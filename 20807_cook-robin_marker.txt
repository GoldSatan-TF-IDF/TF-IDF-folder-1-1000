robin cook marker a book in the jack stapleton laurie montgomery series for jean and cameron and all they mean to me i would like to acknowledge my medical school the college of physicians and surgeons at columbia university in new york it was an honor and a privilege to have attended both my professional life and writing career have depended heavily on the foundation of knowledge and experience i learned and enjoyed at that fine institution r c prologue in the wee hours of february a cold steady drizzle drenched the concrete spires of new york city shrouding them in a dense swirl of purplishpink fog save for a few muted sirens the city that never sleeps was at a relative standstill yet at exactly threeseventeen am two nearly simultaneous unrelated but basically similar microcosmic events occurred on opposite sides of central park that would prove to be fatefully connected one was on a cellular level the other on a molecular level although the biological consequences of these two events were opposite the events themselves were destined to cause the perpetratorsall strangersto violently collide in less than two months the cellular event occurred in a moment of intense bliss and involved the forcible injection of slightly more than two hundred and fifty million sperm into a vaginal vault like a group of anxious marathoners the sperm mobilized quickly tapped into their selfcontained energy stores and began a truly herculean race against death a remarkably arduous and perilous race that only one could win relegating the others to short and frustratingly futile lives the first task was to penetrate the mucous plug obstructing the collapsed uterine cavity despite this formidable barrier the sperm rapidly triumphed as a group although it was a pyrrhic victory tens of millions of the initial wave of gametes were lost in a form of selfsacrifice required to release their contained enzymes to make the passage possible for others the next ordeal for this horde of minute living entities was to traverse the relatively enormous uterine expanse almost equivalent in distance and danger to a small fish swimming the length of the great barrier reef but even this seemingly insurmountable impediment was overcome as a few thousand lucky and robust individual sperm made it to the openings of the two oviducts leaving behind hundreds of millions of unlucky casualties still the travail was not over once within the undulating folds of the oviducts the fortunate ones whod entered the correct tube were now spurred on by the chemotaxis of the descending fluid from a burst ovarian follicle somewhere ahead beyond a tortuous and treacherous twelve centimeters lay the sperms holy grail a recently released ovum crowned with a cloud of supporting cumulous cells progressively goaded by the irresistible chemical attraction a contingent of the male gametes accomplished the ostensibly impossible and closed in on their target nearly exhausted from the long swim and from avoiding predatory macrophages whod engulfed many of their brethren the number was now less than one hundred and falling rapidly neck and neck the survivors bore down on the hapless haploid egg in a race to the wire after an astonishingly short one hour and twentyfive minutes the winning sperm gave a final desperate beat of his flagellum and collided headon with the eggs surrounding cumulous cells frantically he burrowed between the cells to bring his caplike acrosome into direct contact with the eggs heavy protein coat to form a bond at that instant the race was over as his last mortal act the winning sperm then injected his contained nuclear material into the egg to form the male pronucleus the other sixteen sperm that had managed to reach the egg seconds behind the winner found themselves unable to adhere to the eggs altered protein coat with their energy stores exhausted their flagella soon fell silent there was no second place and all the losers were soon swept up engulfed and carried off by the deadly maternal macrophages inside the nowfertilized ovum the female pronucleus and the male pronucleus migrated toward each other after the dissolution of their envelopes their nuclear material fused to form the required fortysix chromosomes of a human somatic cell the ovum had metamorphosed into a zygote within twentyfour hours it divided in a process called cleavage the first step in a programmed sequence of events that would in twenty days begin to form an embryo a life had begun the nearly simultaneous molecular event also involved a forcible injection on this occasion a bolus of more than a trillion molecules of a simple salt called potassium chloride dissolved in a shotglass volume of sterile water was injected into a peripheral arm vein the effect was almost instantaneous cells lining the vein experienced a rapid passive diffusion of the potassium ions into their interiors upsetting their electrostatic charge necessary for life and function delicate nerve endings among the cells quickly sent urgent messages of pain to the brain as a warning of imminent catastrophe within seconds the rest of the potassium ions were streaming through the great veins and into the heart where they were propelled with each beat out into the vast arterial tree although progressive dilution occurred within the plasma the concentration was still incompatible with cellular function of particular concern were the specialized cells of the heart responsible for initiating the heartbeat those of the brainstem responsible for the urge to breathe and the nerves and muscle spindles that carried the messages all were quickly adversely affected the heart rate rapidly slowed and the heartbeats grew weaker breathing became shallow and oxygenation inadequate moments later the heart stopped altogether initiating progressive bodywide cellular death as well as clinical death a life had been lost as a final blow the dying cells leaked their store of potassium into the stagnant circulatory system effectively masking the original lethal bolus one the sound of the dripping was metronomic somewhere out on the fire escape drops of water fueled by the incessant rain splattered against a metallic surface to laurie montgomery the noise seemed almost as loud as a kettledrum in jack stapletons otherwise silent apartment making her wince as she anticipated each splat the only competition over the long hours had been the refrigerators compressor cycling on and off the hiss and thump of the radiator as heat rose and an occasional distant siren or horn sounds so typical in new york that peoples minds instinctively ignored them but laurie was not so lucky after tossing and turning for three hours shed become hypersensitive to every sound around her laurie rolled over again and opened her eyes anemic fingers of light reached around the window shades edges allowing her a better view of jacks barren and otherwise drab apartment the reason she and jack were there instead of at her apartment was the size of her bedroom it was so small that the largest bed it could accommodate was a twin which made communal sleeping problematic and then there was also jacks desire to be near to his beloved neighborhood basketball court laurie glanced over to the radio alarm clock as its digital readout relentlessly advanced laurie became progressively angry without much sleep she knew from sore experience shed be a basket case at the medical examiners office that day she wondered how in gods name she had made it through medical school and her residency where sleep deprivation had been the name of the game yet laurie sensed that her current inability to fall asleep wasnt the only thing making her angry in fact her anger was probably why she couldnt sleep in the first place it had been the middle of the night when jack had inadvertently reminded her of her upcoming birthday asking her if she wanted to do something special to celebrate laurie knew it had been an innocent question coming as it did in the afterglow of lovemaking but it had shattered her elaborate defense of taking each day at a time to avoid thinking about the future it seemed impossible but she was soon to be fortythree years old somewhere around age thirtyfive the clich√© about the ticking reproductive clock had become true for herand now hers was sending out the alarm laurie let out an involuntary sigh in her loneliness as the hours had slid by shed fretted over the social quagmire in which she found herself ensnared when it came to her personal life things hadnt gone right since middle school jack was content with the status quo as evidenced by his relaxed silhouette and the sounds of his blissful sleep which only made things worse for laurie she wanted a family shed always assumed shed have one even during her comparatively wild twenties and early thirties yet here she was almost fortythree living in a crummy apartment in a fringe new york neighborhood sleeping with a man who couldnt make up his mind about marriage or children she sighed again earlier shed consciously tried to avoid disturbing jack but now she didnt care she had decided she was going to try to talk with him again even though she knew that the issue was something he studiously preferred to ignore but this time she was going to demand some change after all why should she settle for a miserable life in an apartment more suited to a couple of penurious graduate students than boardcertified forensic pathologists as she and jack were in a relationship where discussions of marriage and children were unilaterally verboten yet things werent all bad on the career side it couldnt be better she loved her job as a medical examiner at the office of the chief medical examiner of new york where shed been working for thirteen years and she felt lucky she had a coworker like jack with whom she could share the experience both of them were awed by the intellectual stimulation that forensic pathology offered each day they learned something new and they saw eye to eye on a lot of issues both had little tolerance for mediocrity and both were turned off by the political necessities of being part of a bureaucracy yet as compatible as they were workwise it did not make up for her burgeoning desire to have a family jack suddenly stirred and rolled over onto his back his fingers intertwined and hands clasped on his chest laurie looked at his sleeping profile in her eyes he was a handsome man with closely cropped graystreaked light brown hair bushy eyebrows and strong sharp features usually sporting a wry smile even in repose she found him aggressive yet friendly bold yet modest challenging yet generous and most often playful and fun with his quick wit life was never dull especially with his adolescent penchant for risktaking on the negative side he could be aggravatingly stubborn especially about marriage and children laurie leaned toward jack and looked more closely he was definitely smiling which aggravated her irritation it didnt seem fair that he was satisfied with the status quo although she was reasonably sure she loved him and believed he loved her his inability to make a commitment was literally driving her to distraction he said it wasnt a fear of marriage or parenthood per se but rather the vulnerability that such commitment created at first laurie had been understanding jack had suffered the tragedy of losing his first wife and two young daughters in a commuter plane crash she knew that he carried both the grief and the responsibility since the accident had occurred after a family visit while he was retraining in pathology in another city she also knew that after the accident he had struggled with severe reactive depression but now the tragedy was almost thirteen years in the past laurie felt that shed been sensitive to his needs and had been patient when they finally did start dating seriously but now almost four years later laurie felt that shed reached her limit after all she had needs too the buzz of jacks alarm shattered the silence jacks arm shot out and swatted the snooze button then retracted back into the warmth of the covers for five minutes peacefulness returned to the room and jacks breathing regained its slow deep sleeping rhythm this was part of the morning routine that laurie never saw because jack invariably was up before she was laurie was a night person who loved to read before turning out the light often staying up longer than she should almost from day one of their cohabitation laurie had learned to sleep through the alarm knowing jack would get it when the alarm went off the second time jack turned it off threw back the covers sat up and put his feet on the floor facing away from laurie she watched him stretch and could hear him yawn as he rubbed his eyes he stood up and padded into the bathroom heedless of his nakedness laurie put her hands behind her head and watched him and despite her aggravation it was a pleasant sight she could hear him use the toilet and then flush when he reappeared he was again rubbing his eyes as he came around to lauries side of the bed to wake her jack reached out to give lauries shoulder a shake as per usual and then gave a start when he saw her eyes open trained on him her mouth set in an expression of irritated determination youre awake jack said his eyebrows arching questioningly he knew instantly that something was amiss i havent been back to sleep since our middleofthenight tryst it was that good huh jack said in hopes that humor could defuse her apparent pique jack we have to talk laurie said flatly sitting up and clutching the blanket to her chest defiantly she locked eyes with him isnt that what were already doing jack questioned he immediately guessed where laurie was coming from and he couldnt keep sarcasm out of his voice although he knew his tone was counterproductive he couldnt help himself sarcasm was a protective mannerism hed developed over the last decade laurie started to respond but jack held up his hand im sorry i dont mean to sound insensitive but i have a sneaking suspicion where this conversation is headed and its not the time im sorry laurie but we have to be at the morgue in an hour and neither of us has showered dressed or eaten jack its never the time well then lets put it this way this might be the worst possible time for some kind of serious emotional discussion its sixthirty on a monday morning after a great weekend and we have to get to work if it had been on your mind thered have been a dozen other times during the last couple of days when you could have brought it up and i would have been happy to discuss it oh bull lets face it you never want to talk about it jack im going to be fortythree on thursday fortythree i dont have the luxury of being patient i cant wait for you to decide what you want to do ill be postmenopausal for several beats jack stared into lauries bluegreen eyes it was clear that she wasnt going to be placated easily all right he said exhaling noisily as if he was conceding he averted his gaze down to his bare feet well talk about it tonight over dinner i need to talk about it now laurie said emphatically she reached out and lifted jacks chin to lock eyes again ive been agonizing over our situation while youve been sleeping putting it off is not an option laurie im going to go in and take a shower im telling you theres no time for this at the moment i love you jack laurie said after grabbing his arm to restrain him but i need more i want to be married and have a family i want to live someplace better than this she let go of jacks arm and swept her hand around the room to point out the peeling paint the bare lightbulb the bed with no headboard the two night tables that were empty wooden wine cases set on end and the single bureau it doesnt have to be the taj mahal but this is ridiculous all this time i thought four stars was adequate for you save the sarcasm laurie snapped a little luxury wouldnt hurt for as hard as we work but thats not the issue its the relationship which seems fine for you but isnt enough for me thats the bottom line im taking a shower jack said laurie gave him a crooked halfsmile fine you take a shower jack nodded and started to say something then changed his mind he turned and disappeared into the bathroom leaving the door ajar a moment later laurie heard the shower start and the sound of the shower curtain rings scraping across the shower rod laurie exhaled she was trembling from a combination of fatigue and emotional stress but she was proud of herself for not shedding any tears she hated when she cried in emotional situations how she had avoided it at the moment she had no idea but she was pleased tears never helped and frequently put her at a disadvantage after slipping on her robe laurie went into the closet for her suitcase the confrontation with jack actually made her feel relieved by responding just as shed anticipated jack justified what she had decided to do even before he had awakened opening up her allotted bureau drawers she took out her things and began packing with the task almost complete she heard the shower stop and a minute later jack appeared in the doorway briskly toweling off his head when he caught sight of laurie and the suitcase he stopped abruptly what the hell are you doing i think its perfectly clear what im doing laurie answered for a minute jack didnt say anything merely watching as laurie continued her packing youre carrying this too far he said finally you dont have to leave i think i do laurie responded without looking up fine jack said after a beat an edge to his voice he ducked back through the door to finish toweling off when jack came out of the bathroom laurie went in carrying the days outfit she made a point of closing the door although on normal mornings it remained open by the time laurie emerged fully dressed jack was in the kitchen laurie joined him for a breakfast of cold cereal and fruit neither took the time to sit at the tiny vinyl dinette set both were polite and the only conversation was excuse me or sorry as they danced around each other to get in and out of the refrigerator thanks to the narrowness of the room it was impossible to move without touching by seven they were ready to leave laurie squeezed her cosmetics into her suitcase and closed the lid when she rolled it out into the living room she saw jack lifting his mountain bike from its wall rack youre not riding that thing to work are you laurie asked prior to their living together jack had used the bike to commute as well as to run errands around the city it had always terrified laurie who constantly worried that he was going to arrive one day at the morgue feet first when they had begun to commute together jack had given up riding the bike since there was no way laurie would consent to doing the same well it looks like ill be on my own coming back to my palace its raining for gods sake rain makes it more interesting you know jack since im being honest this morning i think i should tell you that i find this kind of juvenile risktaking of yours is not only inappropriate but also selfish like youre thumbing your nose at my feelings thats interesting jack said with a smirk well let me tell you something riding my bike has nothing to do with your feelings and to be honest with you your feeling that it does seems pretty selfish to me outside on th street laurie walked west to columbus avenue to catch a cab jack pedaled east toward central park neither turned to wave at the other two jack had forgotten the exhilaration of riding his dark purple cannondale mountain bike but it came back to him in a rush as he coasted down one of the hills after entering central park near th street since the park was nearly deserted save for the rare jogger jack had let himself go and both the city and his suppressed anxieties miraculously disappeared in the misty citybound forest with the wind whistling in his ears he could remember as if it were yesterday sailing down dead mans hill in south bend indiana on his beloved redandgold widetired schwinn hed gotten the bike on his tenth birthday after having seen it advertised on the back of a comic book mythologized as a symbol of his happy and carefree childhood hed convinced his mother to save it and it continued to gather dust back in the garage of his familys home rain was still falling but not hard enough to dampen jacks experience despite his hearing droplets splattering against the brow of his bicycle helmet his biggest problem was trying to see through the moisturestreaked lenses of his aerodynamic bicycling sunglasses to keep the rest of himself reasonably dry he wore his waterproof bicycle poncho which featured ingenious little hooks for his thumbs when he learned forward with his hands grasping the handlebars the poncho created a tentlike covering for the most part he avoided puddles and when he couldnt he lifted his feet off the pedals to coast until he reached drier pavement at the southeast corner of central park jack entered the midtown city streets already clogged with morning rushhour traffic there had been a time when he loved to challenge the traffic but that was when he was in his words a bit crazier it was also when he was in significantly better shape since he hadnt been riding much over the last few years he didnt have nearly the same stamina anymore his frequent basketball playing helped but basketball didnt involve quite the same sustained aerobics that bicycling demanded yet he didnt slow down and by the time he coasted down the ramp into the th street receiving dock at the medical examiners office his quadriceps were complaining after dismounting he stood for a moment leaning onto his handlebars to let his circulation catch up with the oxygen demand in his leg muscles when the hypoxic aching of his thighs had been mollified jack hefted his bike on his shoulder and started up the steps to the receiving dock his legs were still rubbery but he was eager to find out what was going on at the morgue when hed passed the front of the building hed seen a number of tv satellite trucks parked at the curb with their generators cranking and their antennae extended he also had caught sight of a press of people within the reception area just beyond the front doors something was brewing jack waved a greeting to robert harper through the window of the security office the uniformed officer popped out of his chair and stuck his head around the jamb of the open door back to your old tricks dr stapleton robert called out i havent seen that bike of yours for years jack waved over his shoulder as he carried his bike into the depths of the morgues basement he passed the small autopsy room used for examining decomposing corpses and turned left just before the central mass of drawershaped refrigerated compartments where bodies were stored prior to being autopsied he had to clear a space for his bike in the area reserved for the potters field pine coffins used for the unidentified and unwanted dead after stowing his coat and bicycle paraphernalia in his locker in the changing room jack headed for the stairs he passed mike passano the graveyardshift mortuary tech who was busy finishing up his paperwork in the mortuary office jack waved but mike was too engrossed to notice him as jack emerged into the central corridor on the first floor he caught another glimpse of the crowded front reception area even from the back of the building he could hear the murmur of excited conversation something was up and his curiosity was piqued one of the most exciting aspects of being a medical examiner was that he never knew from one day to the next what was in store coming to work was stimulating even exciting which was a far cry from how jack had felt in his former life as an ophthalmologist when each day had been comfortable but utterly predictable jacks ophthalmology career had ended abruptly in when his practice had been gobbled up by the aggressively expanding managedcare giant americare americares offer to hire jack as an employee was another slap in the face the experience forced jack to recognize that oldschool feeforservice medicine based on close doctorpatient relationships where decisions were based solely on patients needs was rapidly disappearing that epiphany led to his decision to retrain as a forensic pathologist hopefully freeing himself from managed care which he felt was more of a euphemism for denial of care the final irony was that americare had resurfaced to haunt jack despite his efforts to distance himself thanks to a low bid for its premiums americare had recently won a competitive contract for city employees jack and his colleagues now had to look to americare for their own healthcare needs wishing to avoid the throng of media jack set off on the back route to the id office where the morgues workday began on a rotating basis one of the more senior medical examiners arrived early to review the cases that had come in during the night decide which ones needed to be autopsied and make the assignments it was jacks habit to get to work early as well even if it wasnt his turn to be the scheduler so he could snoop through the cases and get the most challenging ones assigned to him jack had always wondered why other docs didnt do the same thing until he realized that the majority of the others were more interested in avoidance jacks curiosity invariably caused him to end up with the largest caseload but he didnt mind work was jacks opiate for taming his demons while he and laurie had been practically living together hed gotten her to come in early with him which had been no mean feat considering how hard it was for her to get up in the morning the thought made jack smile it also made him wonder if she had already arrived jack suddenly stopped in his tracks until now he had deliberately kept the mornings confrontation from his mind thoughts of his relationship with laurie as well as memories of horrific events of his own past flooded into his consciousness irritably he wondered why she had felt compelled to end a beautiful weekend on such a downer note especially since things had been going so well between them in general he almost felt content a remarkable state of mind considering he didnt feel he deserved to be alive much less happy a wave of anger spread through him the last thing he needed was to be reminded of his smoldering grief and guilt about his late wife and daughters which happened with any talk of marriage or children the idea of commitment and the vulnerability it entailed especially starting another family was terrifying get a grip jack murmured to himself under his breath he closed his eyes and roughly massaged his face with both hands behind his irritation and frustration with laurie he felt the stirrings of melancholy an unwelcome reminder of his past struggles with depression the problem was he truly cared for her things were great except for the gnawing issue of children dr stapleton are you all right a womans voice asked jack peeked out through his fingers janice jaeger the petite nightshift forensic investigator was staring up at him while pulling on her coat on her way home and apparently exhausted her legendary dark circles made jack wonder if she ever slept im fine jack said he took his hands away from his face and shrugged selfconsciously why do you ask i dont think ive ever seen you standing still especially in the middle of the corridor jack tried to think of a witty retort but nothing came to mind instead he changed the subject by lamely asking if she had had an interesting night it was wild around here janice said more so for the tour doctor and even dr fontworth than me dr bingham and dr washington are already here doing a post with fontworth assisting no kidding jack said what kind of case harold bingham was the chief and calvin washington was the deputy chief generally neither appeared until well after eight in the morning and it was rare for them to do an autopsy before the normal day began there had to be political ramifications which explained the media presence fontworth was one of jacks colleagues and had been on call for the weekend medical examiners didnt come in at night unless there was a problem pathology residents were hired as tour doctors to cover routine calls requiring a physician its a gunshot wound but its a police case which is why fontworth had to take it as i understand it the police had surrounded a suspect in his girlfriends care when they tried to arrest him a barrage of shots was fired theres the question of unreasonable force you might find it interesting jack inwardly winced gsw cases could be tricky with multiple shots although dr george fontworth was jacks senior by eight years at the office of the chief medical examiner or ocme he was in jacks opinion perfunctory i think ill stay clear with the chief involved jack said whatd you handle anything of note the usual but there was one at the manhattan general that stood out a young man whod just been operated on yesterday morning for a compound fracture after a fall while inline skating on saturday in central park jack winced anew with his sensitivities aroused thanks to laurie he had a negative response at the mere mention of the manhattan general hospital once an acclaimed academic center it was now an americare flagship hospital after having been targeted and taken over by the cashrich managedcare giant although he knew that the overall level of medicine practiced at the institution was good such that if he took a bad flop on his bike and ended up in their trauma unit which is where they would probably take him with the new city contract hed be well taken care of at the same time it was still a managedcare establishment run by americare and he had a visceral hatred for the company what made the case stand out jack asked trying to conceal the emotion he felt reverting to sarcasm he added was it a diagnostic conundrum or was there some sort of scurrilous hankypanky involved neither janice sighed it was just the way the case struck me it was just rather sad sad jack questioned he was taken aback janice had been working as a forensic investigator for more than twenty years and had seen death in all its inglorious permutations for you to say its sad its got to be really sad whats the scoop in a nutshell he was only in his late twenties and had no medical history specifically no heart trouble the narrative i got was that hed rung his call button but by the time the nurses got around to him five to ten minutes laterthats according to the nurseshe was dead so it must have been cardiac there was no resuscitation attempt oh they definitely tried to resuscitate him but with no success whatsoever they never even got a blip on the ekg what made it so sad the mans age the age was one factor but it wasnt the whole story actually i dont know why it bothered me so much maybe it has something to do with the nurses not responding quickly enough and my thinking the poor guy knew he was in trouble but couldnt get help we can all relate to that kind of a hospital nightmare or maybe it has something to do with the patients parents who are very sympathetic they came in from westchester to go to the hospital then came over here to stay near the body theyre really broken up i get the impression their son was their whole life i think theyre still here where i hope theyre not stuck out there in that mob of reporters last thing i knew they were in the id room insisting on another id even though it had already been established to be considerate the tour doctor told mike to go ahead and do another set of polaroids but that was when i was called back to the general for another case when i got back here mike happened to mention the couple was still spaced out in the id room sort of emotionally adrift while clutching the polaroids and as if still hoping the whole affair was a mistake they insisted on viewing the body itself jack felt his pulse quicken he knew all too well the emotional devastation of losing a child that case cant be what has the media people all stirred up heavens no the kind of case im talking about never reaches the public thats part of the reason its so sad a life wasted is it the police case thats brought in the media its what brought them originally bingham announced he would make a statement after the autopsy the tour doctor told me the spanish harlem community is up in arms about the incident apparently there were something like fifty shots fired by the police echoes of the diallo case in the south bronx some years back but to tell you the truth i think what the media is now mostly interested in is the sara cromwell case which came in after they were already here sara cromwell the syndicated psychologist in the daily news yeah the advice diva capable of telling anyone and everyone how to get his or her life back on track she was also a tv personality you know she hit most of the talk shows including oprah she was pretty darn famous was it an accident why the fuss no accident she was apparently brutally murdered in her park avenue apartment i dont know the details but it was on the gory side according to dr fontworth who had to handle that case as well i tell you he and the tour doctor were out all night after cromwell there was a double suicide in a mansion on eightyfourth street then a nightclub homicide after that the tour doctor had to go out for a hitandrun on park avenue and two overdoses what about the double suicide old or young middleaged carbon monoxide they had their escalade running with the garage door closed and a couple of vacuum hoses from the exhausts into the cab hmmm jack murmured any suicide notes hey no fair janice complained youre grilling me about cases i didnt handle but as far as i know there was only one note from the woman interesting jack commented well i better get down to the id room sounds like its going to be a busy day and you better get home to get some sleep jack was pleased the anticipation of an interesting day swept away some of the irritation that had resurfaced about the morning if laurie wanted to go back to her own apartment for a few days it was fine with him hed just bide his time because he wasnt going to be emotionally extorted jack sped by the forensic investigators office cut through the clerical room with its banks of file cabinets and entered the communications room just beyond he smiled at the dayshift telephone operators but got no response they were preoccupied with getting themselves organized he waved to sergeant murphy when he passed the nypd detective room but murphy was on the phone and didnt respond either some welcome jack mused entering the id office jack got the same treatment there were three people in the room and all three ignored him two were hidden behind their morning papers while dr riva mehta lauries office mate was busy going over the sizable stack of potential cases to make up the autopsy schedule jack got a cup of coffee from the communal pot then bent down the edge of vinnie amendolas paper vinnie was one of the mortuary techs and jacks frequent partner in the autopsy room vinnies regular and early presence meant jack could start in the autopsy room well before anyone else how come youre not down in the pit with bingham and washington jack asked beats me vinnie said pulling his paper free apparently they called sal they were already going at it when i got here jack how ya doin a third person emerged from behind his paper but the accent gave him away it was detective lieutenant lou soldano from homicide jack had met him years ago when he had first joined the office of the chief medical examiner convinced of the enormous contributions of forensic pathology to his line of work lou was a frequent visitor to the ocme he was also a friend with a bit of effort the stocky detective heaved himself out of the vinyl club chair clutching his paper in his beefy hand with his aged trench coat his tie loosened and the top button of his shirt open he appeared like a rumpled character out of an old film noir his broad face sported what could have been a twoday growth of beard although from experience jack knew it was only one they greeted each other with a slapping modified highfive which jack had learned out on the neighborhood basketball court and had jokingly taught lou it made both of them feel more hip whats got you up this early jack asked up i havent been to bed yet lou scoffed its been that kind of night my captain is worried sick about this supposed police brutality case since the department is going to feel real heat if the involved officers story doesnt hold up im hoping to get an early scoop but thats not looking good with bingham doing the case hell probably be in there screwing around for most of the day what about sara cromwells case are you interested in that too yeah of course as if i had any choice did you see all the media out in reception they would have been hard to miss jack responded unfortunately they were already here on the police shooting guaranteed theres going to be a lot of newspaper and tv hype for that skinny psychologist probably more than she would have gotten had they not been hanging around and whenever a murder gets a high profile in the media i know ill be getting lots of pressure from above to come up with a suspect so with that said do me a favor and do the case are you serious of course im serious youre fast and youre thorough both of which fulfill my needs also youre okay with me watching which i cant say about everybody around here but if youre not interested maybe i can get laurie to do it although knowing her gsw bent shell probably want to get involved in the police case shes also interested in one of the manhattan general cases riva said in silky britishaccented voice which was in sharp contrast to lous new york twang shes already taken the folder and said she wants to do that one first did you see laurie this morning jack asked lou he and lou shared an appreciation of laurie montgomery jack knew that lou had even once briefly dated laurie but it hadnt worked out from lous own admission the problem had been lous lack of social confidence graciously lou had become a strong advocate for jack and laurie as a couple yeah about fifteen or twenty minutes ago did you talk to her of course what kind of a question is that did she seem normal what did she say hey why the third degree i dont remember what she said it was something like hi lou wassup or something to that effect and as far as her mental state was concerned she was normal even bubbly lou glanced over at riva was that your take dr mehta riva nodded id say she was fine maybe a little excited about all the fuss around here shed apparently had a conversation with janice about the manhattan general case thats why she wanted it did she say anything about me jack asked lou leaning forward and lowering his voice whats with you today lou asked is everything copacetic with you guys oh theres always a few bumps in the road jack said vaguely laurie being bubbly added insult to injury under the circumstance how about assigning me the cromwell case jack called over to riva be my guest riva said calvin left a note saying he wanted it done asap she took the folder from the to be autopsied pile and put it on the corner of the desk jack grabbed it and opened it revealing a case worksheet a partially filledout death certificate an inventory of medicallegal case records two sheets for autopsy notes a telephone notice of death as received by communications a completed identification sheet an investigators report dictated by fontworth a sheet for the autopsy report a lab slip for hiv analysis and an indication that the body had been xrayed and photographed when it had arrived at the ocme jack pulled out fontworths report and read it lou did the same over jacks shoulder were you at the scene jack asked lou no i was still up in harlem when this was called in the precinct boys handled it initially but when they recognized the victim they called in my colleague detective lieutenant harvey lawson ive since talked with all of them everyone said it was a mess blood all over the kitchen what was their take considering she was seminude with the apparent murder weapon sticking out of her thigh just below her private parts they thought it was a fatal sexual assault private parts so restrained thats not quite how they described it to me im translating thank you for being so considerate did they mention the blood on the front of the refrigerator they said there was blood all over did they mention blood being inside the refrigerator particularly on the wedge of cheese as described here in fontworths report jack poked the paper with his index finger jack was impressed despite his previous experience with fontworths desultory work the report was thorough like i said they reported blood was all over the place but inside the refrigerator with the door closed thats a bit odd maybe the door was open when she was attacked so then she carefully put the cheese away thats more than odd in the middle of a homicide tell me this did they mention footprints in the blood besides those of the victim no they didnt fontworths report specifically says there were none but quite a few of the victims thats odder still lou spread his hands and shrugged his shoulders so whats your take my take is that in this case the autopsy is going to be significant so lets get the ball rolling jack walked over to vinnie and slapped the back of his paper making the tech jump lets go vinnie old boy jack said happily weve got work to do vinnie grumbled under his breath but stood up and stretched at the door into the communications room jack hesitated looked back at riva and called out if you dont mind id like to do that double suicide as well ill put your name on them riva promised three how about this laurie suggested ill call you just as soon as i finish and let you know what i found i know it wont bring your son back but perhaps knowing what happened will be some comfort especially if were able to learn from this tragedy to keep it from happening to someone else if by some slim chance we still dont have any answers after the autopsy ill call you after ive had a chance to look at the microscopic and give you the definitive answers laurie knew what she was suggesting was out of the ordinary and that skirting mrs donnatello in the public relations office and giving out preliminary information would annoy bingham and calvin both of whom were sticklers for rules if they got wind but laurie felt the mcgillin case warranted this change of protocol after talking with them for only a short time shed learned that sean mcgillin sr was a retired physician whod had a large internalmedicine practice in westchester county he and his wife judith whod been his office nurse were not only fellow medical professionals but also extremely simpatico the mcgillins projected a saltoftheearth honesty and graciousness that made laurie like them instantly it also made it impossible for her not to feel their pain i promise to keep you in the loop laurie continued hoping her reassurances would allow the mcgillins to go home theyd been at the mes office for hours and it was obvious that they were both exhausted ill personally watch over your son laurie had to glance away after her last comment knowing it was deliberately misleading she again caught sight of the crush of reporters in the reception area even though she was trying to ignore them and heard muffled cheering as coffee and donuts arrived laurie winced it was unfortunate that as the mcgillins were suffering their private grief a media circus was going on in the next room it had to make it harder for the mcgillins hearing banter and laughter it just isnt fair that it isnt me who is lying downstairs in that refrigerated compartment dr mcgillin said with a sad shake of his head ive had a good run at life im nearly seventy ive had two bypass procedures and my cholesterols too high why am i still here and sean jr is down there it doesnt make sense hes always been a healthy active boy and hes not even thirty was your sons ldh high as well laurie asked janice hadnt included anything about that in her forensic investigators report not in the slightest dr mcgillin said in the past i made sure he had it checked once a year and now that his law firm contracted with americare which requires yearly physicals i know hed continue to be checked after a quick glance at her watch laurie made direct eye contact with the mcgillins looking from one to the other they were sitting bolt upright on the brown vinyl couch their hands folded in their laps clutching the identification polaroids of their dead son rain spattered intermittently against the glass the couple reminded her of the man and woman in the painting american gothic they radiated the same resoluteness and moral virtue along with a hint of puritanical narrowness the problem for laurie was that she was organizationally shielded from the emotional side of death and consequently had limited experience with it dealing with the grieving families as well as helping them through the identification process was done by others she was also sheltered by a kind of academic distance as a forensic pathologist she saw death as a puzzle to be solved to help the living there was also the acclimatization factor although death was a rare event for the general public she saw it every day our son was to be married in the spring mrs mcgillin said suddenly she hadnt spoken since laurie had introduced herself forty minutes earlier we were hoping for grandchildren laurie nodded the reference to children touched a tender chord in her own psyche she tried to think of something to say but was saved when dr mcgillin suddenly stood up he took his wifes hand and pulled her to her feet im sure dr montgomery has to get to work dr mcgillin said he nodded as if agreeing with himself while collecting all the polaroids and pocketing them its best if we go home well leave sean in her care he then took out a small pad of paper and a pen from his inside jacket pocket after writing on it he tore off the top sheet and extended it to laurie this is my personal phone line ill be awaiting your call i will look forward to it sometime before noon surprised and relieved at this sudden change of events laurie stood up she took the paper and glanced at the number to be sure it was legible it was a i area code ill call as soon as i can dr mcgillin helped his wife with her coat before putting on his own he extended his hand toward laurie she shook it and noticed that it was cold take good care of our boy dr mcgillin said hes our only child with that he turned opened the door to the reception area and urged his wife forward into the press of reporters desperate for news the reporters instantly fell into an expectant silence the moment the mcgillins appeared anticipating a news conference all eyes followed their progress the couple had advanced halfway across the reception area on their way to the main door when someone broke the silence by yelling out are you part of the cromwell family dr mcgillin merely shook his head without slowing his progress are you related to the police custody case someone else demanded dr mcgillin shook his head again with that the reporters switched their attention to laurie apparently recognizing her as one of the medical examiners a number even spilled into the id room an avalanche of questions followed initially ignoring the reporters laurie went up on her tiptoes to see the mcgillins exit the ocme only then did she look at the people pressed around her sorry she said pushing microphones away i know nothing of those cases youll have to wait for the chief luckily one of the ocme security personnel had materialized from within the reception area and he managed to herd the reporters back to where theyd come from relative silence returned to the id room once the connecting door had been closed for a moment laurie stood with her arms hanging limply at her sides she had sean mcgillin jrs folder in one hand and his fathers scribbled phone number in other dealing with the grieving couple had been trying especially since she was feeling psychologically fragile herself but there was a positive side knowing herself as well as she did she knew it was helpful to be involved in an emotionally wrenching situation because it put her own problems in perspective keeping her mind occupied was a good hedge against backsliding into what shed come to recognize as an unacceptable status quo fortified to a degree laurie headed into the id office while pocketing dr mcgillins phone number wheres everybody she asked riva who was still busy with the scheduling process you and jack are the only ones here so far besides bingham washington and fontworth what i meant was where are detective soldano and vinnie jack came in and took them both down to the pit the detective asked jack to do the cromwell case thats curious laurie remarked jack usually shied away from cases that attracted a lot of media attention and the cromwell case certainly fell into that category he seemed genuinely interested in it riva said as if reading lauries mind he also asked for the double suicide which i didnt expect i had a feeling he had an ulterior motive but i have no idea what it could have been do you happen to know if any of the other techs are here yet id like to get started myself with mcgillin i saw marvin a few minutes ago he got coffee and went downstairs perfect laurie said she enjoyed working with marvin hed been on evenings but had recently been switched to days ill be in the pit if you need me im going to have to assign you at least one more case its an overdose im sorry i know you said you had a bad night but weve got a full schedule today thats fine laurie assured her she walked over to get the overdose folder works a good way to keep my mind off my problems problems what kind of problems dont ask laurie said with a dismissive wave its the same old same old with jack but this morning i laid it on the line i know i sound like a broken record but this time i mean it im moving back to my own apartment hes going to have to make a decision one way or the other good for you riva responded maybe it will give me strength along with sharing office space laurie and riva had become good friends rivas boyfriend was as resistant to commitment as jack but for different reasons so she and laurie had a lot to talk about after momentarily debating whether or not to have coffee and deciding not to for fear that it would give her a tremor laurie started off to find marvin although she was going only one floor down she headed toward the elevator she was exhausted from lack of sleep just as she knew she would be when she had been unable to fall back asleep that morning but instead of feeling irritated with herself she was content she certainly wasnt happy because of her feelings for jack and she knew she was going to be lonely yet she felt shed done what she had to do and in that way she was satisfied when laurie passed the forensic investigators office she leaned in and asked if janice had left bart arnold the chief investigator told her she had but asked if he could help laurie said shed talk to her some other time and continued on her way she had only wanted to fill janice in about the conversation shed had with the mcgillins she thought janice would be interested the fact that the case had penetrated janices usually thick emotional skin was what had intrigued laurie in the first place marvin was in the mortuary office attending to his portion of the neverending paperwork that engulfed the ocme he had already changed into green scrubs in anticipation of getting down to work in the pit the term everyone fondly used in referring to the main autopsy room he glanced up when laurie appeared in the doorway he was an athleticlooking africanamerican with the most flawless skin laurie had ever seen laurie had been instantly jealous the first time she met marvin laurie was sensitive about her complexion along with her blond coloring she had a spattering of freckles over the bridge of her nose as well as a scattering of other imperfections that only she could see although laurie had gotten brown hair with auburn highlights from her father her almost transparent skin and bluegreen eyes came from her mother are you ready to rock and roll laurie asked playfully she knew from experience that shed feel better if she didnt act tired youre on sister marvin responded laurie handed over the folders i want to do mcgillin first no problem marvin said consulting the ledger for the location of the body laurie first went into the locker room to change into scrubs then went over to the storage room to don a moon suit moon suit was the term used by the staff to describe the protective gear required while doing autopsies they were fashioned of completely impervious material with attached hoods and fullface masks air was brought into the suit through a hepa filter by a selfcontained fan powered by a battery that had to be charged each night the suits were not popular since they made working more difficult but everyone accepted the handicap for peace of mind except jack she knew that when jack was on call on weekends he frequently dispensed with the moon suit on certain cases where he felt the risk of an infectious agent was low in those circumstances he reverted back to the traditional goggles and surgical facemask the techs seemed content to keep his secret if calvin found out there would be hell to pay after climbing into her gear laurie retraced her steps to the central corridor then walked down to the door of the anteroom where she washed and gloved thus prepared she pushed into the autopsy room even after working at the ocme for thirteen years laurie still savored the tingle of excitement she felt as she entered what she considered to be the center of action it certainly wasnt the visual experience for in that regard the tiled windowless room with its bluewhite fluorescent lighting was cheerless the eight stainlesssteel tables were dented and stained from countless postmortems over each hung an antiquated springloaded scale along the walls were exposed piping dated xray view boxes oldfashioned glassfronted cabinets containing an array of grisly instruments and chipped soapstone sinks more than a half century ago it had been a stateoftheart facility and the pride of the ocme but now it suffered from lack of funds for both modernization and appropriate upkeep yet the physical plant didnt faze laurie the setting didnt even register in her mind her response was based on knowing that she would see or learn something new every time she entered the room of the eight tables three were occupied one supported the corpse of sean mcgillin or so laurie surmised since marvin was scurrying around it in his final preparations the other two closest to where laurie was standing contained bodies in the middle of their procedures directly in front of her lay a large darkskinned man four people attired in moon suits identical to lauries were working over him although reflections off the curved plastic fullface masks made identification difficult laurie recognized calvin washington his sixfoot seveninch twohundredfiftypound frame was hard to conceal the other one she thought was harold bingham because of his contrasting short stocky stature the last two had to be george fontworth and the mortuary tech sal dambrosio but because they were about the same size she couldnt tell them apart laurie stepped over to the foot of the table just in front of her was a drain emitting a rude sucking sound water continuously ran down the surface of the table beneath the corpse to carry away body fluids fontworth where the hell did you learn to use a scalpel bingham growled it was now obvious which one of the suited figures was george he was on the patients right with his hands somewhere down in the deceaseds retroperitoneal space apparently trying to trace the track of a bullet laurie couldnt help but feel a stab of sympathy for george whenever bingham came into the autopsy room he liked to assume the professor role but he invariably became impatient and annoyed even though laurie knew she could always learn from him she disliked the aggravation of working with him it was too stressful sensing that the atmosphere around table one was too charged to ask any questions laurie moved down toward table two there she had no trouble recognizing jack lou and vinnie immediately she sensed the atmosphere was the opposite with some semisuppressed laughter dying away as she arrived laurie was not surprised jack was famous for his black humor the corpse was that of a thin almost emaciated middleaged female with brittle bleachblond hair laurie assumed it was sara cromwell of particular note was the handle of a kitchen knife protruding at an acute cephalad angle from the upper outer anterior surface of her right thigh laurie wasnt surprised to see the utensil still in place in such cases medical examiners preferred that such objects be left in situ i hope you are showing reasonable respect for the dead laurie gibed never a dull moment lou responded and i dont know why i keep laughing at the same jokes vinnie complained tell me doctor montgomery jack said in an exaggerated professorial tone in your professional opinion would you guess this penetrating entry into the thigh was a mortal wound bending over slightly so she could better access the point of entry laurie looked more closely at the knife it appeared to be a small kitchen paring knife which she guessed had a blade about four inches long which had penetrated to the haft lateral to the femur more important the entrance was inferior to the anterior iliac spine but in line with it id have to say it was not fatal laurie responded its location suggests the femoral vessels surely would have been spared so bleeding would have been minimal and dr montgomery what does the angle of entry of the weapon suggest id have to say its a rather unorthodox way for someone to stab their victim there you go gentlemen jack commented smugly we have confirmation of my assessment by the eminent dr montgomery but there was blood all over the place lou whined where the hell did it come from there are no other wounds ahha jack said switching to an exaggerated french accent finger raised in the air i believe we shall see in a few moments monsieur amendola le couteau sil vous pla√Æt despite the glare of the overhead fluorescent lights off vinnies face mask laurie caught him rolling his eyes as he passed a scalpel into jacks waiting hand he and jack had a curious relationship although it was based on mutual respect they pretended it was the opposite leaving the three to their own devices laurie moved on she felt a mild disappointment that jack could be so offhand and flippant she couldnt help but think it wasnt a particularly good sign as if he didnt care laurie made an effort to put the problems with jack out of her mind as she approached the next table stretched out on its slightly angled surface was the body of a wellmuscled male in his midtwenties his head propped up on a wooden block by reflex she immediately began the external exam the individual appeared healthy his visible skin although marblewhite in death was lesionfree his hair was thick and dark and his eyes were closed as if in repose the only visible anomalies were a sutured incision with a retained drain on his lower right leg the cappedoff end of an intravenous line running into his left arm and an endotracheal tube protruding from his mouth left over from the resuscitation attempt with marvin still busy putting labels on specimen jars laurie checked the bodys accession number and name confident that she was dealing with sean mcgillin she continued the external exam inspecting the iv site carefully it looked entirely normal with no swelling or other evidence of extravasation of blood or iv fluid she looked more closely at the sutured wound on the leg the site of the operation on the fractured tibia and fibula there was no swelling or discoloration there either suggesting that there was no infection the drain was sutured in place with a single loose loop of black silk and there was evidence of a minimal discharge of serous fluid the leg itself looked like the other leg without any outward signs of venous thrombosis or clotting i didnt see anything of note externally marvin said when he returned with a handful of sterile syringes and specimen jars some containing preservatives and some without he placed them all on the edge of the table to have them immediately available so far id have to agree laurie responded there was a lot of giveandtake between the techs and the doctors although it varied depending on the personalities laurie always encouraged comments and suggestions especially from marvin as far as she was concerned the techs were a rich source of experience marvin went over to the glassfronted cabinets to get the required instruments despite the hum of her ventilation fan laurie could hear whistling he was always cheerful which was another thing she liked about him after checking for signs of intravenous drug use and not finding any laurie used a nasal speculum to look inside seans nose there was no suggestion of cocaine use with a mysterious death drugs had to be considered despite what his parents had said to the contrary next she opened the eyelids to examine the eyes they appeared normal with no hemorrhages on the sclera opening the mouth she made sure the endotracheal tube was in the trachea and not the esophagus laurie had seen that on a few occasions with the predictable disastrous results with all his preparations complete marvin came back to the side of the table opposite laurie and stood expectantly waiting for the internal part of the autopsy to begin all right lets do it laurie said reaching out with her hand as marvin handed her a scalpel although laurie had done thousands of postmortems each time she started another it gave her a tingle of excitement starting the actual autopsy was akin to opening a sacred book the mysteries of which she was about to discover with her index finger pressing down on the top of the scalpel laurie expertly made the usual yshaped incision starting from the points of the shoulders meeting midsternum and then continuing down to the pubis with marvins help she quickly reflected skin and muscle before removing the breastbone with bone cutters looks like a broken rib marvin commented pointing to a defect on the right side of the chest no hemorrhage so it was postmortem probably from the resuscitation attempt some people go overboard with the chest compressions ouch marvin said sympathetically expecting blood clots or other emboli laurie was eager to examine the great veins leading to the heart the heart itself and the pulmonary arteries where fatal clots would usually be found but she resisted the temptation she knew that it was best to follow a normal protocol lest something be forgotten carefully she examined all the internal organs in situ then used the syringes marvin had laid out to take fluid samples for toxicological testing a fatal reaction to a drug toxin or even an anesthetic agent had to be considered less than twentyfour hours had elapsed since the deceased had undergone anesthesia laurie and marvin worked together in silence making certain that each sample was put into the correctly labeled specimen container once the fluid samples had been obtained she began to remove the internal organs diligently she maintained the normal sequence and it wasnt until a bit later that she finally turned her attention to the heart here comes the money marvin quipped laurie smiled the heart was indeed where she expected to find the pathology with a few deft strokes the heart came out she peered into the cut end of the vena cava but there was no clot she was disappointed since she had already noted that the pulmonary arteries had been clear when shed removed the lungs laurie weighed the heart then with a long bladed knife began an internal examination to her chagrin there was nothing amiss there was no clot and even the coronary arteries appeared entirely normal laurie and marvins eyes met across the opened corpse damn marvin exhaled im surprised laurie said she took a deep breath well you see to the gut and ill take my micro samples then well check the brain you got it marvin said he took the stomach and the intestines over to the sink to wash them out laurie took multiple tissue samples for microscopic study particularly from the heart and the lungs marvin returned the cleaned gut to laurie who went through it carefully taking samples as she proceeded meanwhile marvin started on the head by reflecting the scalp by the time laurie was finished with the stomach and intestines marvin was ready for her to inspect the skull she gave him a thumbsup when she was through and he hefted the powervibrating saw to cut through the bone just above the ears while marvin was busy with the skull laurie took a scissors and opened the sutured wound on the lower leg all looked fine within the surgical site she then opened the long veins of the legs tracing them from the ankles all the way up into the abdomen there were no clots the brain looks normal to me marvin commented laurie nodded there was no swelling and no hemorrhage and the color was normal she felt it with her practiced finger it felt normal as well a few minutes later laurie had the brain out and she dropped it into a pan that marvin held she checked the cut ends of the carotid arteries like everything else they were normal she weighed the brain its weight was within the normal limits were not finding anything she said im sorry marvin said laurie smiled on top of his other good qualities he was empathetic you dont need to apologize its not your fault it would have been nice to find something what are you thinking now it doesnt look like he should have died i havent the slightest idea ill hope the microscopic can shed some light but im not optimistic everything looks and feels so normal why dont you start winding things up while i section the brain i cant think of anything else to do you got it marvin said cheerfully as laurie anticipated the interior of the brain looked like its exterior she took the appropriate samples then joined marvin to suture up the body with both of them working it took only a few minutes id like to get my next case up as soon as possible laurie said i hope you dont mind she was afraid that once she sat down her fatigue would return with a vengeance at the moment she was feeling better than expected not at all marvin said he was already straightening up laurie looked around the pit shed been so engrossed that she hadnt seen all the activity at that point all eight tables were in use with at least two and sometimes more people clustered about each she glanced toward jacks table he was bent over the head of another womans body apparently hed finished with sara cromwell and lou had left beyond jacks table calvin was still at work with fontworth on the same body they were working on before bingham had apparently left to give his news conference how long will the turnaround take laurie asked marvin as he carried the specimen bottles away not long at all laurie wandered toward jack with mixed feelings she was not prepared for more of his levity but after the earlier tease about cromwell she was curious about what hed discovered laurie stopped at the foot of the table jack was concentrating intently on making a mold of a lesion on the womans forehead just within the hairline laurie stood for a moment waiting for him to acknowledge her presence vinnie had looked up immediately and had at least given a restrained wave what did you find on your first case laurie asked finally it seemed unlikely that he hadnt seen her but it had to have been the case she didnt want to think otherwise another few minutes went by without jack responding she glanced back at vinnie who spread his hands out palms up and shrugged his shoulders as if to indicate that there was no accounting for jacks behavior laurie stood for another beat uncertain of what to do before moving on although she was aware that jack could become so engrossed as to be oblivious of his surroundings it was demeaning for her to stand there things were not much better at fontworths table even though bingham had left calvin was riding poor fontworth with equivalent venom as the case dragged on interminably after a quick glance at the other five tables laurie gave up on socializing and returned to lend marvin a hand i can get one of the other techs to help marvin said hed brought in a gurney and positioned it next to the table i dont mind laurie said there had been a time not too long ago that between cases the examiners would go upstairs either to the id room or the lunchroom for a quick coffee and impromptu discussions but with the more elaborate protection apparatus they were required to wear it was too much effort once sean mcgillins remains had been placed in the walkin cooler marvin led laurie to the appropriate compartment for the next case a man named david ellroy the moment marvin pulled out the drawer to reveal the body of thin undernourished middleaged africanamerican laurie remembered that it was a presumed overdose her trained eye immediately took in the scars and tracks on the mans arms and legs from his intravenous habit although laurie was accustomed to overdose cases they still had the power to evoke an emotional reaction with less than the usual control over her thoughts her mind yanked her back to a crisp clear flagsnapping october day in i when shed rushed home from her high school the langley school for girls she lived with her parents in a large prewar flat on park avenue it was the friday before the long columbus day weekend and she was excited because her brother shelly her only sibling had come home the night before from yale where he was a freshman as laurie had gotten off the elevator in their private lobby she sensed a disturbing stillness none of the usual sounds issued forth from the laundry room door vent entering the apartment proper she called shellys name while she stashed her books on the console table in the foyer before cutting through the kitchen when she didnt see holly she was momentarily relieved remembering it was their maids day off yelling out shellys name again she glanced in the den beyond the family room the tv was on without sound which heightened her uneasiness for a moment she watched the antics of a midday game show wondering why the tv would be on without sound resuming her tour of the apartment she called out shellys name yet again convinced that someone had to be home as she passed the formal living room she began to move faster sensing a secret urgency shellys door was closed she knocked but there was no answer she knocked again before trying the door it was unlocked she pushed it open only to see her beloved brother stretched out on the carpet clad in only his briefs to her horror bloody froth oozed from his mouth and his overall color was as pale as the bone china in the diningroom breakfront a tourniquet was loosely looped about his upper arm near his halfopen hand was a syringe on the desk was a glassine envelope which laurie guessed contained the speedball a mixture of heroin and cocaine hed bragged about the night before laurie had taken it all in instantly before dropping to her knees to try to help with some difficulty laurie pulled herself back to the present she didnt want to think about her vain attempt to resuscitate her brother she didnt want to remember how cold and lifeless his lips felt when she touched them with her own can you help move him over onto the gurney marvin asked hes not very heavy certainly laurie said glad to be of use she put down davids folder and lent a hand a few minutes later they were on their way back to the autopsy room inside when marvin maneuvered the gurney next to the table one of the other techs helped marvin get the body onto the table laurie could see the dried remains of a bloody froth that had issued from davids mouth and the image drew her back into her disturbing reverie it wasnt her failed attempt to resuscitate her brother that occupied her thoughts but rather the confrontation she had to endure with her parents a number of hours later did you know your brother was using drugs her father had demanded his face was purple with rage and was mere inches away from lauries face his thumbs dug into her skin where he held her upper arms answer me yes laurie blurted through tears yes yes are you using drugs too no how did you know he was by accident i found a syringe hed gotten from your office in his shaving bag there was a momentary silence as her fathers eyes narrowed and his lips stretched out in a thin cruel line why didnt you tell us he growled if you told us hed be alive i couldnt laurie sobbed why he shouted tell me why because laurie cried she paused then added because he told me not to he made me promise he said hed never talk to me again if i did well that promise killed him her father hissed it killed him just as much as the damn drug a hand gripped lauries arm and she jumped she turned to look at marvin anything special you want for this case marvin asked motioning toward davids corpse it looks pretty straightforward to me just the usual laurie said as marvin went to get the necessary supplies laurie took a deep breath to get herself under control intuitively she knew she had to keep her mind busy to keep it from dredging up other bad memories opening the folder she had in her hand she searched through the papers to find janices forensic investigator report and began reading the body had been found along with drug paraphernalia in a dumpster suggesting that david had died at a crack house and had been thrown out with the rest of the trash laurie sighed dealing with such a case was the negative side of her job an hour later and back in her street clothes laurie stepped into the back elevator the overdose case had been routine there had been no surprises david ellroy had shown the usual signs of asphyxial death with a frothy pulmonary edema the only mildly interesting finds were multiple tiny discrete lesions in various organs suggesting that he had suffered numerous episodes of infection from his habit as the antiquated elevator clunked upward toward the fifth floor laurie thought about jack when shed finished with david ellroy he had already started his third case between his second and third hed gone out of the room pushing the gurney with vinnie steering even from where she was standing laurie could hear the usual banter five minutes later theyd both reappeared bringing in the new case while carrying on with the same wisecracking behavior they then proceeded to transfer the body to the table and go through the setup before starting the post at no time through any of this did jack make an attempt to come over to lauries table engage her in conversation in any way or even look in her direction laurie shrugged whether she wanted to admit it or not it was becoming obvious that he was actively ignoring her such behavior was uncharacteristic for the nine years shed known him hed never been passiveaggressive before laurie went to her office she stopped in the histology lab in addition to the case folders she was carrying a brown paper bag containing the tissue and toxicology samples from mcgillin it didnt take her long to locate the supervisor maureen oconner the fullbodied busty redhead was sitting at a microscope checking a tray of slides she looked up as laurie approached a knowing smile spread across her heavily freckled face now what have we here maureen questioned with her heavy brogue she looked from laurie to the bag laurie was carrying let me guess tissue samples whose slides you desperately need yesterday laurie smiled guiltily am i really that predictable with you and dr stapleton its always the same story whenever you two come in here youve got to have the slides immediately but let me remind you of something sister your patients are already dead maureen laughed heartily and a few of the other histology techs whod overheard joined in laurie found herself chuckling as well maureens ebullience was infectious and it never varied despite the lab being chronically understaffed due to ocme budgetary restraints laurie opened the bag took out the tissue samples and lined them up on the counter next to maureens microscope maybe if i told you why id like these sooner rather than later it might help as busy as we are around here a few extra hands would be more helpful than talk but fire away laurie pulled out all the stops knowing there was no professional reason for what she was asking she started by describing how sympathetic dr and mrs mcgillin were and how their deceased son seemed to have been their whole life she even mentioned the sons imminent marriage and the parents hope for grandchildren she then admitted that she had promised to provide the couple the cause of their sons death that morning to help their grieving the problem was that the autopsy had failed to confirm her clinical impression thus she needed the slides in hopes the answers would be forthcoming what she didnt explain were her personal reasons for taking on this minicrusade well thats quite a touching story maureen said softly she took a deep breath and then gathered up the samples well see what we can do i promise you well give it a go laurie thanked her and hurried out of histology she glanced at her watch it was already after eleven and she wanted to call dr mcgillin before noon taking the stairs she descended a floor and walked into the toxicology lab here the atmosphere was different than in the histology lab instead of a babble of voices there was the continual hum of the sophisticated and mostly automated equipment it took laurie a few moments to locate anyone to her relief she saw peter letterman the assistant director if it had been the lab director john devries laurie would have walked out she and john had gotten off on the wrong foot back when laurie desperately needed quicker results on a series of cocaine overdose cases and had badgered the man that was thirteen years earlier when laurie had first started at the ocme and john had held on to his animosity like a dog with a bone laurie had long ago given up trying to make amends my favorite me peter said happily catching sight of laurie he was a thin blond man with androgynous features and almost no beard he wore his long hair in a ponytail and although he was pushing forty he could still pass as a teenager in contrast to john he and laurie got along famously you have something for me indeed i do laurie said she handed over the bag while warily looking around for john the f√ºhrer is down in the general lab so you can relax its my lucky day laurie commented peter glanced in at the sample bottles whats the scoop what am i looking for and why laurie told a shorter version of the same story shed related to maureen at the end she added i dont really expect you to find anything but ive got to be complete especially if the microscopic doesnt show anything ill see what i can do peter said i appreciate it laurie responded after climbing back up the single flight of stairs laurie walked down the corridor toward her office she passed jacks office with its door ajar but neither jack nor his officemate chet mcgovern were inside laurie assumed that they were both still down in the pit coming into her own office she immediately caught sight of her suitcase that shed brought from jacks although she hadnt forgotten the mornings confrontation seeing the suitcase brought it back with unpleasant clarity it also didnt help that she felt let down by not finding a smoking gun during sean mcgillins autopsy the more she thought about it the more surprising it was how could an ostensibly healthy twentyeightyearold man die and the cause not be apparent from a combination of a detailed history and the autopsy in some respects the case was mildly shaking her belief in forensic pathology that microscopic better come through laurie voiced out loud as she sat down at her desk she was emphatic but didnt quite know how she would act on the threat if the microscopic failed to live up to her expectations leaning over she added the folders from the mornings cases to her sizable unfinished pile it was lauries job on each case to collate all the material from the autopsy from the forensic investigators from the laboratories and from any other source she needed to come up with a cause and manner of death the meaning of cause was obvious whereas manner referred to whether the death was natural accidental suicidal or homicidal each with specific legal ramifications sometimes it took weeks for all the material to be available when it was laurie had to make her decision about the cause and manner on a preponderance of evidence meaning she had to be at least fiftyone percent certain of course in the vast majority of cases she was close to or at one hundred percent certain laurie took the sheet of paper containing dr mcgillins phone number from her pocket and smoothed it out on the blotter in front of her although she was reluctant to call him she knew she had to make good on her promise the problem was laurie was not good at any type of confrontation it was a given that he was going to be even more let down as there was as of yet no ostensible cause for his sons untimely death with her elbows on her desk she leaned forward to massage her forehead while staring at the westchester number she tried to think of what to say in hopes of mitigating the impact for a fleeting moment she considered handing the situation over to the public relations department as she was supposed to do but she quickly ruled that out since she had specifically offered to make the call herself while her mind was struggling over her prospective wording she found herself thinking about the victims first name sean since it was the name of a college boyfriend sean mackenzie had been a colorful fellow wesleyan university student whod appealed to lauries rebellious side although he wasnt exactly a hoodlum hed been a bit over the edge with his motorcycle artistic craziness and outlaw behavior including mild drug use at the time the whole package had excited laurie and driven her parents to distraction which was part of the attraction but the onagain offagain relationship had been unhealthily mercurial from the start and laurie had finally put an end to it just before joining the ocme now with her relationship with jack in question she vaguely thought about calling sean since she knew he was living in the city and had become a rather successful artist but she quickly nixed the idea there was no way she wanted to reopen that pandoras box a penny for your thoughts a voice asked lauries head popped up filling her doorway was jacks athletic sixfoot frame he was the picture of relaxed informality in his livedin chambray shirt knitted tie and faded jeans lets up that to a quarter he added theres been significant inflation since i learned that phrase and i know how valuable your thoughts are an impish smirk dimpled his cheeks his lips were pressed together into a thin line laurie regarded her friend of at least a decade and lover of nearly four years his irreverent gaiety and sarcasm could at times be wearing and this was one of them so youre deigning to speak with me now she questioned with an equally affected tone jacks smile faltered of course im going to talk with you what kind of question is that except for that brief professorial game when i first came into the autopsy room youve been ignoring me all morning ignoring you jack questioned with knitted brows i think i should remind you we came to work separately which was more your decision than mine arrived at different times and since then weve been working on our own cases we work most days and most days we communicate almost continuously particularly when we are in the same room i even went over to your table during your second case and asked you a direct question i didnt see or hear you scouts honor jack held up his index and middle finger in the form of a v his smile returned laurie arched her eyebrows and shrugged she was being provocative by suggesting that she didnt believe him but she didnt care fine and dandy and now i have more work to do she turned her attention back to the sheet with the westchester phone number no doubt jack said refusing to rise to the bait or be dismissed how were your cases this morning laurie looked up but not at jack one was routine and rather uninteresting the other was disappointing in what regard id promised a couple whose son died at the manhattan general to find out what killed him and let them know immediately but the autopsy was clean there was no gross pathology whatsoever now ive got to call and say we have to wait for the microscopic to be available i know they are going to be disappointed and i am too janice briefed me on that case jack said you didnt find any emboli nothing and the heart laurie looked back at jack the heart the lungs and the great vessels were all completely normal ill wager you find something with the hearts conduction system or maybe micro emboli in the brainstem you took adequate samples for toxicology that would be my second thought i did laurie said id also kept in mind hed had anesthesia less than twentyfour hours ago well sorry your cases were a letdown mine were the opposite in fact id have to say they were fun fun truly both turned out to be the absolute opposite of what everybody thought how so the first case was this wellknown psychologist sara cromwell supposedly it was a brutal murder during a sexual assault i saw the knife remember that was what threw everybody for a loop you see there was no other wound and she hadnt been raped how could all the blood that was described come from that single nonfatal stab wound it didnt jack stared at laurie with a slight smile of anticipation laurie stared back she was in no mood to play games so where did it come from any ideas why dont you just tell me i think youd be able to guess if you thought about it for a minute i mean you did look at how gaunt she was didnt you jack if you want to tell me tell me otherwise i have to make my call the blood was from her stomach it turns out there was a fatal engorgement of food causing a rupture of her stomach and the lower part of her esophagus obviously the woman had bulimia and pushed herself over the edge can you believe it everybody was convinced it was homicide and it turns out to be accidental what about the knife sticking out of her thigh that was the real teaser it was selfinflicted but not on purpose in her final moments while she was puking blood and putting away the cheese she slipped on her own blood and fell on the knife she was holding isnt it too much i tell you this is going to be a good case to present at our thursday conference for a moment laurie stared at jacks satisfied face the story had touched a chord in her inner life there had been a time when shed had selfesteem problems after her brothers death causing her to have a brush with anorexia and bulimia it was a secret she hadnt shared with anyone and my next two cases were equally intriguing it was a double suicide did you hear about it vaguely laurie responded she was still thinking about bulimia i tell you i have to give old fontworth credit jack said id always considered him less than meticulous but last night he seemed to have done a bangup job with the double suicide he found a heavy maglite flashlight on the front seat of the suv along with the victims and was smart enough to bring it with the bodies he also noted the driversside door was ajar what was important about the flashlight laurie asked plenty jack replied first of all let me say i was a bit suspicious when there was only one suicide note in double suicides its usual to have two notes or one that is written by both parties i mean it makes sense since they are doing it together anyway that put up a red flag since the note was presumably from the woman i elected to autopsy her first what i expected to find after the fact was something toxicological like a knockout drug or the like i didnt expect to find anything on gross but i did she had a literal indentation on her forehead just above the hairline that was curiously curved jack paused his smile returned dont tell me the flashlight and the indentation matched you got it a perfect match it seems that the whole affair was an elaborate setup by the husband who had prepared the scene and probably even wrote the note after he knocked out his wife got her into the passenger seat of the suv and started the engine he probably went back in the house to wait when he thought enough time had passed he returned to check that his wife was dead but didnt realize how quickly one can succumb to carbon monoxide if the level is high enough climbing behind the wheel he rapidly fell unconscious and ended up joining his wife what a story laurie commented isnt it ironic i mean it was supposed to be a double suicide and instead the manner of death turns out to be homicidal for the wife and accidental for the husband forensic pathology certainly can surprise laurie nodded she distinctly remembered having the same thought before she started her overdose case even the police case is turning out to be opposite of what was expected how so laurie asked everybody has been assuming it was a case of justifiable homicide by the police since the police acknowledged shooting him a number of times but calvin just told me that as near as they can determine it was suicide theyve been able to ascertain that the victim shot himself through the heart before he was hit by any of the police rounds that should help quiet the neighborhood we should hope jack said anyway it was an interesting morning to say the least and i just thought youd like to hear that weve had a rash of cases this morning where the manner of death was the opposite of what was expected with that said are you going to pop down for some lunch soon i dont know im not terribly hungry and ive got a lot to do well maybe ill catch you down there if not ill see you later laurie waved at jack as he disappeared down the hall she turned her attention back to sean mcgillin srs phone number she thought about what jack had said about forensic surprises and considered what that could mean for sean mcgillin jr shed expected his manner of death to be natural a fatal clot or fat emboli or even a congenital anomaly since shed not found anything of the kind at least so far she was now entertaining the idea that the cause of death couldve been accidental such as an unexpected late complication with anesthesia but if the cause of death were to be truly opposite like the cases jack had just described it would have to have been homicidal laurie mulled the idea it seemed farfetched but then she thought about sara cromwell and how only minutes earlier she would have thought it totally farfetched that her manner of death was accidental sean jrs autopsy had already surprised her with its lack of findings could the case surprise her once more she doubted it but then again she couldnt rule it out completely four despite lauries concerns to the contrary the phone conversation with dr mcgillin turned out be surprisingly civil he had accepted that the autopsy had failed to show any pathology with unexpected equanimity it was as if he had taken the information as a compliment about his adored son corroborating the idea that the boy was indeed perfect inside and out having expected to be angrily chastised for not delivering on her promise or at the very least anticipating having to weather passiveaggressive disappointment laurie felt even more beholden to the man when he maintained his composure he had even gone to the extent of thanking her for her efforts on his sons behalf and for spending time with them in their hour of need if she had been willing before to bend the rules by providing the man with the cause of his sons demise shed now become determined to get him that information after hanging up the phone with sean sr laurie spent some time pondering the case while staring blankly ahead at her corkboard with its various notes reminders and business cards she tried to think of a way to speed up the process but her hands were tied she had to wait for maureen and peter and hope that they would respond to her appeal time melted away effortlessly riva came in and said hello as she dumped folders on her desk and took her seat laurie returned the greeting by reflex without turning around her mind by then had switched to jack and his irritatingly insouciant joviality and what that meant about their relationship although she hated to admit it it was becoming progressively apparent that he was happy shed decided to leave in a circular fashion thoughts of jack brought her back to sean jrs case as she recalled jacks comments about forensics occasionally revealing that the causation and manner of death were the opposite of what was assumed laurie again considered the possibility that seans death could have been a homicide she couldnt help but remember several infamous episodes of serial homicides that had occurred in healthcare institutions particularly one rather recently that had continued undetected for an unconscionably long time such a scenario had to be considered although she recognized that all the involved patients in those series were aged chronically ill individuals and that there was an inkling of an imaginable albeit sick motive not one of the victims had been a vigorous healthy twentyeightyearold whose whole life was still ahead of him laurie was certain that homicide was extremely implausible and she wasnt going to worry about it especially since peters toxicology screen would pick up an overdose of insulin or digoxin or another potentially lethal drug akin to those implicated in the previous institutional murders after all that was what the toxicology screen was all about in her mind sean jrs death had to be either natural which was most probable or accidental yet what was she going to do if the microscopic and the toxicological turned out to be negative such a concern seemed reasonable considering the autopsy itself had been so surprisingly clean from her experience it was rare not to find some pathology even in a twentyeightyearold and even if the abnormalities were not associated with the demise to prepare for such an eventuality laurie needed as much information as possible although the usual course of action in such a case would be to wait for the microscopic and the toxicological to come back she decided to be proactive to save time impulsively she snatched the receiver and called down to the forensic investigators office bart arnold picked up on the second ring i posted a sean mcgillin this morning laurie said he was an inpatient over at the manhattan general id like to get a copy of his hospital chart im aware of the case did we not get what you need the forensic investigators report is fine to be honest im on a fishing expedition the post was negative and im a little desperate theres kind of a time constraint ill put the request in immediately laurie replaced the receiver while racking her brain in hopes of coming up with something else that would be useful if everything turned out to be negative whats wrong riva asked she had swung around in her desk chair after overhearing lauries conversation with bart knowing how tired you are i thought id given you straightforward cases im sorry laurie assured her officemate that she neednt apologize laurie admitted that she was creating a problem when there really wasnt one probably to keep from obsessing about her social life do you want to talk about it you mean my social life i mean jack and what you did this morning not particularly laurie responded she waved a hand as if swatting a nonexistent fly theres not much to say that you and i havent hashed over before ad nauseam the reality is that i dont want to be stuck in a neverneverland relationship which is what ive been settling for over the last couple of years i want a family its that simple i guess whats really irking me is that jack is being such an ass by acting so blasted cheerful ive noticed riva agreed i think it is an act whos to know laurie responded she laughed at herself im pathetic anyway let me tell you about the mcgillin case quickly laurie related the whole story including the details of the conversations shed had with the parents and then subsequently with jack its not going to be a homicide riva said emphatically i know laurie agreed whats bothering me at this point is not being able to live up to the promise i made to the parents i was so sure id be able to tell them today what killed their boy and now i have to sit on my hands and wait for maureen and peter my compulsiveness is driving me batty if its any consolation my opinion is that jack was right about the microscopic being the key i think youll find the pathology in the heart especially with a strong family history of elevated ldh and heart disease laurie started to concur but her phone rang twisting around she answered it expecting some quick tidbit of information on one of her cases which is what the vast majority of her calls were about instead her eyebrows arched in surprise covering the mouthpiece she looked back at riva and whispered youre not going to believe it its my father rivas face reflected equal disbelief she hastily motioned for laurie to find out the occasion for the call phone contact was restricted to lauries mother and that was rarely at work im sorry to disturb you dr sheldon montgomery said he spoke in a resonant voice with a hint of an english accent despite his never having lived in great britain youre not disturbing me laurie answered im sitting here at my desk she was intensely curious why her father was calling but resisted the temptation to ask directly fearful such a question would sound too unfriendly their relationship had never been anything special as a selfabsorbed workaholic cardiac surgeon whod demanded perfection from everyone including himself hed been emotionally distant and generally unavailable laurie had tried vainly to break through to him constantly pushing herself to excel at school and in other activities which is what she thought he wanted unfortunately it never worked then came her brothers untimely death which sheldon blamed on her what little relationship theyd had deteriorated even further im at the hospital he said his tone was matteroffact as if he was telling her the weather im here with your mother what is mother doing at the hospital laurie asked for sheldon to be at the hospital was not out of the ordinary although he was retired from private practice now that he was in his early eighties he still frequently went to the hospital laurie had no idea what he did her mother dorothy never went to the hospital despite being active in various hospital fundraising activities the last time laurie remembered her mother being in the hospital was for her second facelift fifteen years earlier and even then laurie had learned of the admission after the fact she had surgery this morning sheldon said she is doing fine in fact she is rather chipper laurie sat up a bit straighter surgery what happened was it an emergency no it was a scheduled procedure unfortunately your mother had a mastectomy for breast cancer my word laurie managed i had no idea i just spoke with her on saturday she didnt mention anything about surgery or cancer you know your mother and how she likes to ignore unpleasant issues she was particularly insistent on shielding you from unnecessary concern until this was behind her laurie looked at riva with disbelief as close as their desks were in the small office riva could hear both sides riva rolled her dark eyes and shook her head what stage was the cancer laurie asked solicitously a very early stage with no apparent nodal involvement sheldon said things are going to be fine the prognosis is excellent although shell have to undergo further treatment and you say she is doing well very well indeed shes already taken some nourishment orally and shes back to her old self by being genuinely demanding can i speak with her unfortunately that would be rather difficult you see im not in the room at the moment im at the nurses station i was hoping youd be able to come over here to see her this afternoon there is an associated aspect to all this that i would like to discuss with you i will be right over laurie said she hung up the phone before turning back to riva is it true you had no idea about any of this riva asked not a clue there wasnt even the slightest hint i dont know whether to be angry hurt or sad actually its pathetic what a dysfunctional family i cant believe it im almost fortythree and a doctor and my mother still treats me like a child about illness can you imagine she wanted to shield me from unnecessary concern our family is just the opposite everybody knows everything about everybody its the opposite extreme but i dont advocate it either i think the best is somewhere in between laurie got up and stretched she waited for a moment of dizziness to pass her fatigue had come back with a vengeance after sitting at her desk she then got her coat from behind the door when she considered the differences between her family and rivas she thought she would pick rivas although she certainly wouldnt choose to live at home like riva did she and riva were the same age want me to answer your phone riva asked if you wont mind especially if its either maureen or peter leave any messages on my corkboard laurie got out a package of postits and plopped them on her blotter ive got to come back here im not going to take my suitcase with me laurie stepped into the hall and briefly considered going down to jacks office to tell him about her mother then decided to skip it even though she was certain hed ultimately be sympathetic she had had quite enough of his levity and didnt want to risk having to deal with anymore on the first floor laurie took a quick detour into the administration office calvins door was ajar unchallenged by the two busy secretaries laurie glanced in to see the deputy chief hunched over his desk a standardsized pen looked like a miniature in his huge hand she knocked on the open door and calvin raised his intimidating face and drilled laurie with his coalblack eyes there had been times when laurie had clashed with the deputy chief since he was both a stickler for rules and a politically savvy individual willing to bend those rules on occasion from lauries perspective it was an untenable combination the occasional political demands of being a medical examiner were the only part of the job laurie didnt like laurie mentioned that she was leaving early to visit her mom in the hospital calvin waved her away without a question laurie didnt have to clear such a thing with him but she had been trying of late to be a little more politically sensitive herself at least on a personal level outside the rain had finally stopped making it easier to hail a taxi the ride uptown went quickly and in less than a half hour she was deposited at the front steps of the university hospital during the drive she had tried to imagine what her father had meant by an associated aspect of her mothers illness that he wished to discuss she truly had no idea it was such an oblique statement but she assumed he meant some limitations of her mothers activity the hospitals lobby was in its usual afternoon uproar with visiting hours in full swing laurie had to wait in line at the information booth to find out her mothers room number castigating herself for failing to get it earlier armed with the information she took the proper elevators up to the proper floor and walked past the nurses station where a number of people were busy at work no one looked up at her it was the vip wing which meant the corridor was carpeted and the walls were hung with original donated oil paintings laurie found herself glancing into the rooms as she passed like a voyeur reminding her of her first year of clinical residency her mothers door was ajar like most of the others and laurie walked right in her mother was in a typical hospital bed with the guardrails up an intravenous running slowly into her left arm instead of the usual hospital garb she was wearing a pink silk robe she was sitting up with a number of pillows behind her her mediumlength silvergray hair which normally billowed on top of her head was pressed down like an oldfashioned bathing cap her color was gray without her makeup and her skin seemed to be pulled tighter than usual over her facial bones and her eyes had retracted as if she was slightly dehydrated she appeared fragile and vulnerable and although laurie knew she was petite she looked particularly tiny in the large bed she also looked older than she did less than a week before when laurie had seen her for lunch there had been no conversation about cancer or imminent hospitalization come in my dear dorothy said waving with her free hand pull a chair over sheldon told me he had called you i wasnt going to bother you until i was home this is all very silly its just not worth getting all upset over laurie glanced over at her father who was reading the wall street journal in a club chair by the window he glanced up gave a little wave and a wan smile and then went back to his paper advancing to the side of the bed laurie took her mothers free hand and gave it a squeeze the bones felt delicate and the skin cool how are you mother im just fine give me a kiss and then sit down laurie touched her cheek to her mothers then she pulled a chair over to the side of the bed with the hospital bed raised she had to look up at her mother im so sorry this has happened to you its nothing the doctor has already been in and he said things are just fine which is more than i can say about your hair laurie had to suppress a smile her mothers ploy was transparent whenever she didnt want to talk about herself she went on the offensive laurie used both hands to sweep her highlighted auburn hair back away from her face it was shoulderlength and although she usually wore it up with a clip or a comb shed taken it down to brush it out after her mornings stint in the moon suit and hadnt put it back up unfortunately her hair had been a frequent target for her mother ever since lauries teenage years after the conversation about her hair and a short pause in which laurie tried to ask a question about her mothers surgery dorothy switched to another convenient target by saying that lauries outfit was much too feminine for working in a morgue with some difficulty laurie restrained herself in response to this new criticism she made it a point to wear such clothing it was part of her identity and she saw no conflict with her place of employment laurie also knew that part of her mothers response was derived from her distaste for lauries career choice although both her parents had mellowed to a degree and had even grudgingly come to recognize the merits of forensics subsequent to lauries work they had been disappointed from the moment she had announced her decision to become a medical examiner at one point dorothy had actually told laurie that she had no idea what to say when her friends asked what kind of a doctor laurie was and how is jack dorothy inquired hes just fine laurie said not wishing to open that can of worms dorothy then went on to describe some upcoming social events that she hoped laurie and jack would attend laurie listened with half an ear while glancing over at her father whod finished with the wall street journal he had a large stack of newspapers and magazines he stood up and stretched although he was in his eighties he was still a commanding figure well over six feet tall with an acquired aristocratic air his silver hair knew its place as usual he had on a carefully pressed conservatively cut glen plaid suit with matching tie and pocket square he walked over to the opposite side of the bed from laurie and waited for dorothy to pause laurie would you mind if we stepped out in the hall for a moment not at all laurie said she stood and gave her mothers hand a squeeze through the beds guardrail ill be right back now dont you go worrying her about me dorothy scolded her husband sheldon didnt respond but rather pointed with an open palm toward the door outside in the hall laurie had to step out of the way of a passing gurney carrying a postoperative patient back to her room her father came up behind her since he was almost a foot taller she had to look up into his face his skin was tan from a january trip to the caribbean and surprisingly devoid of wrinkles considering his age laurie didnt harbor any ill feelings toward the man since she had long ago overcome her anger and frustration about his emotional distance her eventual maturation had made her realize that it was his problem not hers at the same time there was no sense of love it was as if he were someone elses father thank you for coming over so quickly sheldon said theres no need to thank me theres no question id come over immediately i was afraid you might be more upset with the news coming out of the blue i want to assure you that it was your mothers insistence that you not be informed of her condition i gathered that from what you said on the phone laurie said she was tempted to say how ridiculous it was to keep such information from her but she didnt there wasnt any point her mother and father were not going to change she didnt even want me to call you this afternoon wishing to wait until she got home either tomorrow or the next day but i had to insist i had respected her wishes up until today but i didnt feel comfortable putting it off any longer putting off what what are you talking about laurie couldnt help but notice her father looking up and down the hall as if concerned that they might be overheard im sorry to have to tell you this but your mother has a marker for a specific mutation of the brca gene laurie felt her face flush with heat although she knew people were supposed to blanch with disturbing news she always did the opposite as a physician laurie was aware of the brca gene which in its mutated form was associated with breast cancer more disturbing she knew that such mutations were inherited in a dominant fashion with high penetrance meaning there was probably a fifty percent chance that she carried the same genotype it is important for you to have this information for obvious reasons sheldon continued if i had thought the threeweek delay would have had any significance for you i would have told you immediately now that you know i must say that my professional opinion is that you should be tested the presence of such a mutation raises the probability of developing breast cancer sometime prior to your eightieth year sheldon paused and again glanced up and down the corridor he seemed to be genuinely uncomfortable about revealing a family secret in public laurie touched her cheek with the back of her hand as she feared her skin was hot to the touch with her father showing no emotion as usual she was embarrassed that she was being so demonstrative of course it is up to you sheldon recommenced but i should remind you that if you are found to be positive there are things you can do to lower probabilities of developing a tumor as much as ninety percent such as prophylactic bilateral mastectomies thankfully the implications of a brca mutation are not the same as with huntingtons chorea gene or some other untreatable illness despite her obvious embarrassment laurie stared back into the dark eyes of her father she even found herself imperceptively shaking her head even if their relationship was strained particularly after her brothers death even if he didnt act like her father she couldnt believe he could be saying what he was saying without more human warmth in the past shed attributed his general detachment to a need for a defense mechanism against the stress of literally holding his patients beating hearts and hence their lives in his hands on a daily basis having assisted at surgery as a firstyear resident she knew something of what such stress was like she also was aware that his patients had ostensibly appreciated his detachment seemingly interpreting it as supreme confidence rather than a narcissistic personality flaw but laurie hated it thank you for this most helpful sidewalk consult laurie managed unable to keep the sarcasm from her voice she forced herself to smile before breaking off from her father and returning back to claim her seat at her mothers bedside has he upset you dear dorothy questioned after taking one look at laurie your face is as red as a beet laurie didnt answer for a moment she had her mouth clamped shut to stop her lower jaw from quivering her emotions were threatening to surface a weakness she had always despised especially in the presence of her emotionless father sheldon dorothy called out as he reclaimed his chair by the window what did you say to laurie i told you not to upset her about me i wasnt talking to her about you sheldon said as he picked up the new york times i was talking about her jack put down his pen and turned to look at chet mcgoverns back hunched over his desk chet was a medical examiner colleague and jacks officemate although he was five years jacks junior they had started at the ocme at almost the same time and got along famously although jack appreciated sharing space with chet for the companionship he still thought it was ridiculous that the city didnt provide them with private offices the problem was a continuous budgetary constraint that precluded updating the facility the ocme was an easy target for politicians in a city strapped for funds the building had been adequate when it had opened almost a half a century ago but was now something of a dinosaur with space at a premium since jack was aware that dinosaurs had lived on earth for some hundred and sixty million years he hoped the building in its present configuration wasnt expected to last quite that long i cant believe it jack called out im finished ive never been finished chet swung around he had a boyish face capped by a shock of blond hair that was considerably longer than jacks but worn in a similar unkempt style like jack he also gave the impression of being athletic but it was from almost daily visits to the gym not from street basketball he was in his midforties but looked considerably younger what do you mean youre finished finished what with his hands clasped into fists jack stretched his arms over his head all my cases im completely caught up then what are all those folders doing in your inbox chet used his index finger to point at the sizable stack threatening to spill out those are just the cases waiting for material to come back from the lab big deal chet scoffed with a dismissive laugh before returning to his work hey its big for me jack said he stood up and touched his palms to the floor and held them there for a beat after the unaccustomed bike ride to work that morning his hamstrings felt tight after straightening back up he glanced at his watch good grief its only threethirty will wonders never cease i might make it for the first run on the court if its dry chet said without looking up why dont you come over to sports club la the court will be dry there if you were smart youd tag along with me to bodysculpting class i tried it last friday and im telling you the chicks are incredible there was this one that was something else she had on a fullbody black skintight bodysuit that left nothing to the imagination ogling chicks jack mocked one of these days youll wake up and be able to look back on these difficult years of puberty and laugh at yourself the day i stop checking out the women will be when im ready for one of those pine boxes downstairs ive never been much for spectator sports jack quipped ill leave that up to you wimps jack took his jacket from the back of the chair and headed out of the office whistling as he went it had been an interesting and stimulating day when he reached lauries office he poked his head in wondering if she was inclined to change her mind about not coming back to his place that evening the office was empty though he noticed an open folder on lauries desk jack sauntered in and checked the name as hed guessed it was sean mcgillin he was curious why laurie and janice seemed so engrossed in what sounded to him like a routine case generally he wasnt one to stereotype women but he thought it odd that they had both displayed what he thought was rather unprofessional emotion he flipped open the folder and shuffled through it until he found janices report he read it quickly nothing jumped out other than the victim being only twentyeight the circumstances werent particularly noteworthy it might have been sad and a tragedy for the victims family and friends but it wasnt sad for mankind or the city or even the borough for that matter there were a lot of individual tragedies in a metropolis the size of new york jack quickly closed the folder and beat it out of the office as if hed been engaged in something surreptitious and was fearful about being caught all at once he was less inclined to see if laurie wanted to reconsider her decision to move back to her own apartment for fear of having to deal with too much emotion thinking about family tragedies was not a pastime he wanted to indulge in hed had too much personal experience down on the first level jack retrieved his biking paraphernalia as well as the bike itself he waved to the evening security man mike laster as he carried his bicycle out onto the receiving dock and then down onto the pavement the rain had stopped and it was significantly colder than it had been when hed arrived that morning he was thankful for his gloves as he climbed on the bike and pedaled across th street to first avenue in contrast to his morning ride jack enjoyed the afternoon slalom among the cars taxicabs and buses as he streaked northward racing the traffic in daredevil fashion eventually he cut over to madison avenue using the brief crosstown traverse as a time to allow his circulation to relieve his aching quadriceps heading north again he regained his speed at the rare times he had to stop for traffic lights he briefly questioned between breaths why he was enjoying challenging the traffic when he hadnt that morning sensing it had something to do with things he didnt want to think about he gave up trying to understand and just savored the experience at the grand army plaza with the plaza hotel on one side and the sherrynetherland hotel on the other jack entered central park this was always his favorite part of his commute with the temperature continuing to plummet it was now cold enough for his breath to form a cloud of vapor with each exhale overhead the sky had darkened into a deep purple except to his left in the direction of the setting sun there it was still a rich but rapidly fading scarlet that formed a striking bloodred backdrop for the sawtoothed spires of the buildings lining central park west the street lamps had come on in the park and jack rode between spheres of light and their intersecting penumbras there were more joggers than there had been in the morning and jack kept his speed down above th street the number of joggers began to fall precipitously by then night had taken full command of the sky to make things worse it seemed to jack that the distance between the street lamps had grown as dark as it was he occasionally had to slow down to walking speed between illuminated areas since he could not see the ground and had to proceed on faith that there were no obstacles in his path when he passed th street it got even darker particularly in the hilly section where he had felt such exhilaration that morning in contrast now he felt the stirrings of foreboding the leafless trees crowded the pathway he could no longer see the buildings along central park west and except for an occasional distant beep of a taxi horn he could have been biking out in some vast isolated forest when he did approach a street lamp it made the intervening leafless branches appear like giant spider webs exiting the park at th street jack felt relief as he hit the button for the traffic light he had to laugh at his imagination and wonder what had stimulated it although he had not been riding in the park at night for months hed done it a considerable number of times over the years he could not remember it having affected him in such a fashion even he recognized the absurdity of his having had no fear earlier in traffic where it was truly dangerous while getting the heebiejeebies riding through the deserted park he felt like an impressionable tenyearold walking through a cemetery on halloween once the light had changed jack crossed central park west and rode along th street as he came abreast of the neighborhood playground he stopped without taking his toes from his toe clips he grasped the high chainlink fence and looked out onto the basketball court it was illuminated by a series of mercury vapor lamps that he had paid for in fact jack had paid to have the entire playground rehabbed originally jack had only offered to redo the basketball court thinking the neighborhood would be overjoyed to his surprise he was forced by an ad hoc neighborhood committee into considering doing the whole park including toddler area if he was to be granted the privilege of upgrading the basketball section it took jack just overnight to decide to do the whole schmear after all what else was he going to do with his cash that had been six years ago and jack had more than gotten his moneys worth you coming out and run doc one of the players called out there were only five men all africanamerican casually warming up at the distant basket in deference to the cold they were all dressed in multiple layers of trendy hiphop gear one of them had stopped when hed caught sight of jack from his voice jack knew it was warren a man with whom jack had become close over the years warren was a powerfully built gifted athlete as well as the de facto leader of the local gang he and jack had come to share a great mutual respect in fact jack even gave warren credit for having saved his life thats my intention jack yelled back anybody else coming out or is it going to be threeonthree we got rained out last night so the whole gangs going to show up so get your kicks and get that white ass of yours out here on the double otherwise youll be standing around holding your dick catch my drift jack flashed back a thumbsup hed caught the drift all right there would be a lot more than ten guys meaning the first ten would get to play while the others would be forced to jockey to get into subsequent games it was a complicated system that had taken jack a couple of years to comprehend by most peoples standards it wasnt democratic or fair winners was taken by the eleventh guy to show up who then chose the other four he wanted on his team at that point the order people arrived didnt matter in fact sometimes one of the members of the losing team would get selected because he was a particularly good player back when jack had just moved to the neighborhood it had taken him months to get into his first game and that was because he finally realized he had to get out there early motivated by not wanting to stand around on the sidelines in the cold jack quickly pedaled across the street snatched up his bike on his shoulder and ran up the steps leading to his buildings front door skirting some large green trash bags jack pushed open the inner door just inside were two derelicts sharing a bottle of cheap wine they got out of the way as jack charged up the stairs he was careful because of the debris that sprinkled the steps jack lived in the rear unit on the fourth floor he had to put his bike down while he struggled with his keys without even bothering to close his apartment door jack stashed his bike against the wall in the living room then kicked off his shoes and stripped off his jacket tie and shirt and tossed them over the back of his sofa clad only in his boxer shorts he ducked into the bathroom to get his basketball gear which normally hung over the shower curtain jack stopped in his tracks instead of his shorts and sweatpants he was looking at a pair of lauries pantyhose he had forgotten that he had not played the previous night and laurie had folded his gear and put it in the closet jack snatched the pantyhose off the curtain rod and held them in his hand slowly his eyes rose to look at himself in the mirror he was alone and his slack face reflected the reality hed been actively avoiding all day laurie wouldnt be there when hed finished his basketball game there wouldnt be the usual intelligent banter there wouldnt be the inevitable laughter they wouldnt be heading down columbus avenue for a bite to eat at one of the many upper west side restaurants instead he would be coming back to an empty apartment just like he had for all those years after hed first arrived in the city it was depressing then and it was depressing now you basket case he voiced with derision he looked back down at the pantyhose feeling a mixture of emotion that included anger at himself and at laurie at times life seemed too complicated with unnecessary care he folded the pantyhose and carried them into the bedroom he opened one of the nowempty drawers that laurie had been using and carefully put the lingerie inside he closed the drawer and felt a modicum of relief with the painful reminder out of sight he then ran to the closet to get his athletic gear to jacks relief he got back out onto the court before ten people had arrived and warren selected him to be on his team jack warmed up by shooting a series of perimeter jump shots he felt ready when the game began a few minutes later but unfortunately he wasnt he played poorly and he was a significant factor in the loss with another team ready to run warren and jack and the rest of warren s team were relegated to standing on the sideline shivering in the cold none of them were happy man you were shit warren said to jack you were killing us wassup jack shook his head im distracted i guess laurie wants to get married and have a kid warren knew laurie over the previous several years he and his girlfriend natalie doubledated with jack and laurie almost once a week they had even gone on a wild trip to africa together seven years ago so your shortie wants to get hitched and have a kid warren said derisively hey man what else is new i got the same problem but you didnt see me throwing the damn ball away or letting a perfectly good pass bounce off my forehead you got to pull yourself together otherwise youre not going to be running with me i mean theres a question of getting your priorities straight you know what im saying jack nodded warren was right but not quite the way he was implying the trouble was jack didnt know if he was capable of getting his priorities straight since he wasnt quite sure what they were with her ankle holding the insistent elevator door open laurie managed to get her suitcase onto the fifthfloor landing it was a bit of an effort since the floor level was a few inches higher than the elevators cab she then stepped out herself and let the door close she could hear the whine of the elevator machinery on the roof as the cab immediately descended someone had obviously been pressing the call button taking advantage of the suitcases wheels she got it over to her door without having to lift it again the more she had struggled with it the heavier it seemed to have become she knew the culprit was the stash of cosmetics shampoo conditioner and detergent shed had to bring over to jacks none of it was travelsize of course the iron didnt help either she went back to get the bag of groceries as she fumbled to extract her keys from her shoulder bag she heard the door to the front apartment open as its securing chain reached its limit with a definite clank laurie lived in a building on th street that had two apartments per floor while she occupied the rear apartment that looked out onto a warren of postagestampsized backyards a recluse by the name of debra engler resided in the front her habit was to open her door a crack and peer out every time laurie was in the hall most of the time her nosiness had irritated laurie as an intrusion on her privacy but at the moment she didnt mind it was a reassuring familiarity welcoming her home once inside laurie activated every one of the locks bolts and chains that the previous tenant had installed then she looked around she hadnt been there for over a month and couldnt remember the last time shed slept there the entire apartment needed a good cleaning and the air smelled slightly stale it was smaller than jacks but a quantum leap more cozy and comfortable with real furniture including a tv the colors of the fabrics and paint were warm and inviting a group of framed gustav klimt prints from the met hung on the walls the only thing missing was her cat tom whom she had boarded a year ago with a friend who lived out on shelter island she wondered if shed have the nerve to ask for her pet back after such a long time laurie dragged her suitcase into her tiny bedroom and spent a half hour organizing things after a quick shower she donned her robe before making herself a simple salad although she hadnt had any lunch she still wasnt particularly hungry she brought the salad and a glass of wine out to her desk in the living room and turned on her laptop while she waited for it to boot up she finally allowed herself to think about what she had learned from her father it had taken effort to avoid thinking about the issue but she had wanted to be by herself and have access to the internet as well as be more in control of her emotions she knew she didnt know enough to be able to think clearly the problem was that medical science was racing ahead at breakneck speed laurie had been to medical school in the mideighties and had learned a significant amount about genetics since that was the time of the heady breakthroughs in recombinant dna but since then the field had mushroomed geometrically climaxing in the sequencing of the billion base pairs of the human genome as announced with great fanfare in laurie had made it a point to stay reasonably current with her genetic knowledge particularly as related to her specialty of forensics but forensics was only interested in dna as a method of identification it had been discovered that certain noncoding areas or areas not containing genes showed dramatic individual specificity such that even close relatives had differing sequences tests taking advantage of the specificity are called dna fingerprinting laurie was well aware of this and appreciated it as a powerful forensic tool but the structure and function of genes were other issues entirely an area where laurie felt unprepared two new sciences had been born medical genomics which dealt with the enormously complex flow of information within a cell and bioinformatics which was an application of computers to such information laurie took a sip of her wine it was a daunting process to try to make sense of what she learned from her father namely that her mother carried the marker for the brca gene and that laurie had a fifty percent chance of having the same marker she shuddered there was something unsettlingly perverse about knowing that she might have something potentially lethal hiding out in the core of her body throughout her life shed always felt that information was good in and of itself now she wasnt so sure maybe there were some things that were better not to know as soon as laurie was connected to the internet she googled brcal gene and got five hundred and twelve sites she took a bite of her salad clicked on the first site and started reading five whoa chet mcgovern murmured in appreciative homage to the female form he was watching out of the corner of his eye it was the woman hed mentioned to jack that afternoon and she was dressed in the black bodysuit hed described he guessed she was in her late twenties but he couldnt be sure what he was sure about was that she had one of the best figures hed ever seen at the moment she was lying prone on a bench using a machine to work her hamstrings and buttocks the accentuated curve of the small of her back and the rhythmical rippling of her butt as she did her repetitions gave chet a shiver of delight chet was about twenty feet away craftily using free weights in front of a mirrored wall so that he could get close without arousing suspicions hed seen her in bodysculpting class as he had on friday but this time spurred on after having mentioned her to jack hed followed her into the weight room where there was still a handful of people even though it was after nine pm it was chets intention to connect with her and ask her to have a drink in the hope that he could get her phone number most of chets dates were women hed met at one of the multiple health clubs he frequented for him ogling women was not just a spectator sport the woman finished with the machine shed been using wasting no time she got up glanced up at the wall clock and then hustled down to the next machine to work the pectorals seemingly in a hurry she started right in chet had watched her in the mirror and in the background he caught sight of one of the clubs employees entering the room chet knew him reasonably well from pickup basketball and sensed that he was a savvy dude especially since he had some kind of supervisory role his name was chuck horner stepping up to the freeweight rack chet deposited the weights he had been using and walked over to the employee hey chuck chet said sotto voce do you know that chick using the pectoral machine chuck craned his neck to see around chet the looker the one with the pixie face and a body to beat the band thats the one yeah i know her i mean i know her name since she comes in here all the time and i happened to sign her up for membership whats her name jasmine rakoczi but she goes by jazz quite a body wouldnt you say one of the best chet admitted what kind of name is rakoczi its funny you should ask because i asked the same thing when she joined she said it was hungarian is she tight with anybody that you know ive no idea but i can tell you shes a pistol she drives around in a black hummer i should warn you she doesnt do much socializing at least not around here are you thinking of trying to make a move im thinking about it chet offered casually he turned around to look at jazz working her pectorals she wasnt fooling around perspiration glistened like little diamonds on her tanned forehead five bucks says you cant get to first base chet turned around to look back at chuck a wry smile appeared on chets face getting paid for what he wanted to do was a good incentive to overcome his hesitation youre on back at the freeweight rack chet lifted off several more weights he was now committed to approach jazz but it wasnt without a certain amount of anxiety especially with the daunting tidbits hed learned from chuck in truth chet was not quite as bold as he liked to portray himself while standing in front of the mirror doing curls with the free weights chet tried to think of some way to approach the woman that would leave him an out if he needed it unfortunately he couldnt think of anything clever and fearing she might suddenly finish and disappear into the womens locker room he made his move in reality it wasnt much of a move at all he merely walked over when he thought she was almost done with her current machine by now his mouth was dry and his heart was thumping in his chest encouragingly he managed to time his approach just about right as he stepped in front of her she stopped her repetitions and took her arms off the machines grips taking the towel from around her neck she wiped off her forehead using both hands covering her face and breathing deeply from exertion hi jazz chet said cheerfully trusting shed be instantly curious how he knew her name jazz didnt respond except to slowly lower the towel to progressively reveal her features she skewered chet with her burnt umber deeply set eyes up close she wasnt pixielike beneath a helmet of dark hair that was damp from her workout her features had a hint of the exotic what chet had thought was tan was naturally dark skin that made her teeth appear particularly white her eyes were slightly almondshaped and her nose had an almost imperceptible aquiline bend all this would have been acceptable to chet except for the mildly hollow cheeks and her expression those cheeks made her look mean while her expression was intimidatingly brazen like those hed seen in photographic portraits of marine recruits chet wasnt encouraged especially when jazz didnt respond i thought maybe id introduce myself chet said trying to maintain nonchalance which was difficult considering her stare the free weights were also bothering him dragging down his shoulders chet had taken some heavy ones in the hope of impressing this wellmuscled woman besides her nipples he could even see her welldefined abs beneath her spandex jazz still did not respond she didnt even blink im dr chet mcgovern chet added he used his doctor status as a trump card in his approach to meeting women although he never mentioned what kind of doctor unless pressed in his dating experience the medicalexaminer role didnt have the same cachet as that of a clinical physician the situation was quickly becoming critical not only hadnt jazz said anything about his being a doctor but also her expression had morphed from brazen to contemptuous chet tried to shrug but found it difficult with the free weights in his hands feeling desperate he said i was hoping maybe if youre not too busy we could have a drink or something at the bar when youre finished with your workout unfortunately the pitch of his voice came out higher than even he expected do me a favor dickhead jazz said venomously buzz off what an ass jazz thought as she watched chets face fall after she cut him off at the knees with her acerbic remark he then slunk away like a dog with his tail between his legs shed seen him in the bodysculpting class on friday and again today on both occasions he had acted as if he thought he was being slick with his furtive glances in her direction as if that wasnt bad enough today hed followed her into the weight room pestering her to death by watching her either in the mirror or out of the corner of his eye as she went through her routine all the time pretending he was using the free weights so he could stay in relative proximity he was such a pervert and a dork to boot she couldnt believe anyone in his right mind would prostitute himself by wearing trendy workout clothes with designers names emblazoned across them polo good grief in her mind it was so tacky that it was gross jazz stood up and headed for the inclined plane to do her situps she didnt know where chet had gone and was glad to be away from his lecherous gaze she hated ivy league types and chet had certainly been one of those she could recognize them a mile away they strutted around with their fancy degrees and didnt know crap the fact that chet entertained even for a minute the idea that shed want to have a drink with him was a slap in the face after another quick glance at the clock to be sure she had enough time jazz did her hundred situps making sure her breathing was in sync the only problem with the healthclub sceneor so she had convinced herself without explaining why she liked to wear her suggestive outfitwas that she had to put up with men like chet on a daily basis most of them said they wanted to buy her a drink but she knew that wasnt what they wanted they wanted sex like all men back when she was in high school and even middle school she probably would have been willing to give chet a run for his money by slipping him some ecstasy and then taking advantage of him but that was back when she considered sex a sport when it gave her a sense of power and when it drove her parents crazy now she didnt need it anymore in fact it was a big pain in the ass with all the nonsense that had to go along with it it was a waste of time especially since it was far easier and quicker to take care of herself when she was in the mood finishing her situps jazz got to her feet and looked at herself in the mirror she straightened to the full extent of her lean muscled fivefootten stature she liked what she saw particularly the definition of her arms and legs she was in better shape than she was after naval boot camp when the idea of exercise had first been introduced to her with her towel in one hand she stooped down to pick up her water bottle there was only a little left and she polished it off then she started for the locker room as she walked she could see most of the mens eyes slyly following her she was careful to avoid any eye contact and kept an expression of disdain on her face which was easy considering that was how she felt she also caught a glimpse of mr ivy league talking to the birdbrain whod processed her paperwork when she joined the club a month earlier blond mr polo now had his hands on his hips and a sad hangdog expression on his face jazz had to suppress a smile when she thought about him bragging to her that he was a doctor as if it was going to impress her jazz knew too many doctors and they were all jerks she tossed the empty water bottle in the container by the door before heading out of the weight room when she passed the main reception desk she saw that it was almost nineforty meaning shed better fire her afterburners and get a move on since she liked to have the option of getting to work early if she lucked out and got another assignment there had been a bit of a lull before the previous nights mission which she was hoping would be the start of a whole new series but she couldnt complain about the lull because overall she was lucky indeed sometimes she wondered how they had found her but she didnt dwell on it it was about time that things were starting to work out considering all her effort especially her socalled formal schooling after she got out of the military having to go to that community college with all those retards in order to go from corpsman to rn had been the biggest trial of her life just inside the lockerroom door was a table with a large tub of iced soft drinks jazz helped herself to a coke popped the tab and took a satisfying swig next to the tub was a clipboard with a little sign requesting that she write her name and indicate what shed taken so that her account could be charged as she took another pull from the can and headed off to the vip section where she had her own assigned locker she wondered what kind of fool would actually write their name down but then again she knew that a fool was born every minute a shower was a quick affair for jazz after lathering up including a shampoo she liked to stand for a few minutes with her eyes closed and allow the water to drum on her head and run down the crevices of her welltuned body closing her eyes had the added benefit of shielding her from having to look at the other women some of whom had butts the size of small countries with skin that resembled the surface of the moon jazz couldnt believe they had such little selfrespect to allow themselves to get to such a pathetic state after the shower her cropped coif needed only a short stint with the hairdryer when shed been young shed agonized over her hair but being in the military had cured her it had also cured her of a longstanding hangup about cosmetics now all she used was a little lipstick and that was more to keep her lips from drying out than anything else next came the green scrubs over which she pulled on a mediumlength white coat with a stethoscope crammed in the side pocket the breast pocket boasted a collection of pens pencils and other nursing paraphernalia are you an er nurse a voice asked jazz looked around one of the largeass women was sitting on the bench in front of her locker swaddled in her towel like a sausage jazz debated whether or not to ignore her generally jazz stayed above the usual lockerroom drivel preferring to be expeditious about showering yet the stereotyping which the comment implied begged for a retort no im a neurosurgeon jazz said she took her oversized olivedrab military coat from her locker and pulled it on it had pockets as deep as gold mines the contents of the pockets bumped up against her thighs particularly on the right a neurosurgeon the woman marveled with a look of disbelief no kidding no kidding jazz echoed with a tone that did not invite any more conversation she stuck her sweaty bodysuit in her gym bag then closed and locked her locker although she did not look at the woman whod spoken to her she sensed that the woman was watching her jazz didnt care if the woman believed her or not it didnt matter without the exchange of another word jazz struck off through the locker room and out into the main corridor after she pushed the down button of the elevator she stuck her hand into the overcoats right pocket and fondled her favorite possession a subcompact ninemillimeter glock its molded composite handgrip gave her a reassuring feeling of power while awakening recurrent fantasies of being accosted by lowlifes like mr ivy league in the parking garage it would all happen so fast that the guys head would spin one minute hed be making some inane comment the next hed be looking down the barrel of the guns suppressor jazz had made the effort to outfit the gun with a silencer because another ongoing fantasy was to take out one of her nursing supervisors jazz sighed for her whole life shed been saddled with the albatross of incompetent authority personnel it had started in high school she could remember as if it were yesterday the time shed been called into the guidance counselors office the dork had said he was mystified because shed tested off the charts for intelligence but was doing so poorly what was the cause duhhh jazz voiced out loud as she recalled the incident the guy was so slow mentally that he couldnt comprehend that ninetenths of all the teachers were from the same shallow end of the gene pool that he was from it was a waste of time going to high school hed warned her that she wouldnt get to go to college if she kept doing what she was doing well she didnt care she knew that the only real way out of the cesspool of her life was the military the trouble was that the military wasnt a whole lot better it was okay at first because she had a lot of ground to make up getting into shape and all aptitude tests had supposedly pointed her in the direction of becoming a hospital corpsman which was a joke since she always lied on those stupid tests but she played along becoming a corpsman sounded fine especially the idea of being on her own eventually she opted for being an independent duty corpsman with the marines but when she eventually got assigned things started to go downhill some of the officers she had to deal with were halfwits especially over in kuwait when her squadron infiltrated the kuwait salient in february she had gotten a kick out of shooting iraqis until her commanding officer took her rifle away as if she was not supposed to have any fun he told her to restrict her activities to the health needs of the real men it had been embarrassing things came to a head in san diego almost a year later the same cretin of an officer came into a bar where she and some of the regular grunts were tossing back a few beers he got sloshed and grabbed a feel when jazz wasnt looking as if that wasnt bad enough he called her a freaking dyke when she spurned an offer to drive out to the tip of point loma with him to get laid that had been the last straw and jazz had shot him in the leg with her sidearm she hadnt been aiming for the leg but he still got the appropriate message of course that had been the end of her military career but by then she didnt care shed had enough going from the military into the community college turned out to be like going from the frying pan into the fire but jazz had persevered shed thought that getting her rn would be her ticket because nurses were so much in demand and she could call the shots unfortunately the eventual reality was no different from her experience in the military when it came to supervisors forcing her to move from job to job with the vain hope that things would be better at different institutions but they never were now it didnt matter when the elevator stopped on the upper parking level jazz got off pushed out of the glassed elevator lobby and walked over to her secondfavorite possession a brandspankingnew shiny blackasonyx h hummer she ran her fingers appreciatively along the vehicles side catching a view of her reflection in the windows except for the windshield all the glass was tinted to the extent that it appeared to be black mirrors before she opened the door she stepped back and took in the vehicles boxy outline and its squat threatening stance both of which made it look like a weapon system ready to do battle on the streets of new york city jazz climbed in tossed her gymbag onto the passenger seat and took her blackberry out of her coat but left it in her lap she started the engine the low growl issuing from the tailpipes added to the cars allure she couldnt help but smile getting into the car gave her a thrill like a line of coke only better it also reminded her how rewarding the day had been when mr bob had approached her she still didnt know his full name which was stupid hed told her it was a matter of security which she questioned at the time but now she felt it didnt matter at that first meeting shed seen him come at her out of the corner of her eye and thought it was just going to be another typical male comeon but it wasnt he got her attention immediately by calling her doc jr which was the nickname the jarheads in her first marine squadron had given her shed not heard the name for several years so she was surprised and guessed that mr bob had been a marine himself he had been waiting for her to come out of the hospital in new jersey where she was working on the evening threetoeleven shift he said he had a business proposition for her and asked if she was interested in earning extra moneya lot of extra money sensing that her ship had finally come in jazz accepted his invitation to join him in his h hummer which was a spitting image of her own before she got in the vehicle she made sure that there wasnt anybody else inside she also made sure that she had her hand around the glock nestled in her pocket back then the pistol didnt have the silencer so it was easy to draw if mr bob did any thing untoward she would have shot him where shed meant to shoot the marine officer she didnt believe in threatening if the gun came out it would be used but she hadnt needed to be worried mr bob was all business they ended up at a small smoky bar in downtown newark where mr bob commiserated with her about her experience in the military and even apologized about her treatment and unwarranted discharge he said that it was precisely because of her exemplary service that she was being recruited for an important mission for which she would be compensated accordingly mr bob went on to say that theyjazz had yet to know who they wererecognized her unique qualifications to provide the service they required he then had asked if she was interested jazz laughed as she put her hummer in reverse and backed out of the parking slot when she thought back it was crazy for him to be asking if she was interested before she knew exactly what she would be doing and she told him so at the time from then on he stopped beating around the bush he told her they needed people like jazz to help eliminate doctor incompetence which he said was rampant although hard to ferret out because of a conspiracy of silence on the part of the medical profession that was when jazz was convinced that she was well suited to help she was an expert on recognizing incompetence since there had been a wellspring of it in every institution shed been associated with mr bob said that her job would be to communicate to him by email all episodes of adverse outcomes particularly related to anesthesia obstetrics and neurosurgery but he emphasized that they werent choosy they wanted everything she found for her efforts she would be paid two hundred dollars per case with an added bonus of a thousand dollars for each that resulted in a malpractice suit and an extra five hundred if the judgment was for the plaintiff so that had been the beginning following mr bobs recommendation she switched from evenings to nights which was easy because the graveyard shift was the least popular the benefit was that during the wee hours of the morning there was less oversight which made roaming the floors checking the charts and generally catching the gossip much easier than during the day or even during the evening mr bob had had other helpful recommendations as well which he explained came from the fund of experience theyd had over several decades he said that jazz was joining an extensive elite underground jazz had flourished from the start the clandestine nature of the operation was an added benefit it even made going to work fun the money was wired into an offshore account that had been set up for her by whoever they were it grew rapidly and it grew taxfree the only problem was that in order to use the money she had to go down to the caribbean a necessity that she found was hardly an imposition but then after four years and several moves to different hospitals the last being to st francis in queens things got even better mr bob reappeared to say that as a consequence of her outstanding work shed been commissioned along with a very select group to be raised in rank within the underground task force she was now going to participate in an even more important mission for which her compensation would be greatly increased at the same time so would the level of secrecy it was a highly classified operation codenamed operation winnow jazz remembered that he laughed after telling her the name he said he had nothing to do with its selection since it reminded him of minnow but his laughter quickly died off and he again emphasized the secrecy he said there are to be no ripples on the surface he had asked if jazz understood of course she understood mr bob had gone on to explain that the circumstance would be the opposite of the setup with the adverse outcomes which she was to continue as well with operation winnow she would receive a patients name by email then following a carefully devised protocol which she had to follow to the letter she would sanction the patient there had been a pause at that point at first jazz didnt get his drift she was confused by the word sanction until it finally dawned on her when it did it gave her a shiver of anticipation this protocol has been masterminded by professionals and it is completely foolproof mr bob had said there is no way it can be discovered but you must follow it exactly as specified do you read me of course i read you jazz had replied what did he think she was stupid are you interested in becoming part of the team thats affirmative jazz had said but you havent told me the compensation five thousand a case jazz could remember the smile that had appeared on her face to think she would be paid five thousand dollars to do something challenging and fun was almost too good to be true and it turned out to be better than she imagined after the first five missions which went off without a hitch thanks to the protocol provided mr bob had appeared along with the hummer its a token of our appreciation he had explained while handing jazz the keys and the papers think of it as the antithesis of the pink cadillac given out by that cosmetic company enjoy it in good health jazz exited the health clubs parking garage onto columbus avenue stopping at the first red light she activated her blackberry from experience she knew that reception was marginal inside the garage she was rewarded with a message from mr bob with mounting excitement she opened it it was another name yes jazz shouted with a grimace of determination like an athlete who had just executed a perfect move simultaneously she punched the air with a fist but then she quickly reigned in her response her military training immediately kicked in to bring her back to a proactive calmness getting another name after having gotten one the evening before suggested that she was about to begin another series although the names came in random intervals they tended to be grouped together she had no idea why reaching over jazz put the blackberry in the traylike indentation on the dash over the glove compartment the motion caused her to hesitate when the light turned green the taxicab to jazzs right lurched forward with the intention of cutting into jazzs lane to avoid a stopped taxi in his own lane jazz stomped on her accelerator to unleash the full power of the hummers v the suv shot forward and gobbled up the lead of the taxi in short order forcing the driver to slam on his brakes jazz flipped him the finger as she shot by after several other close calls with taxis along central park south jazz worked her way over to the east side and then north on madison to the manhattan general hospital it was tenfifteen when she pulled into the complexs mammoth garage one of the other benefits of working the graveyard shift was a plethora of parking spaces right near the garages entrance into the hospital on the second floor collecting her blackberry and slipping it into her left coat pocket jazz crossed the pedestrian bridge and went into the hospital as she had planned she was a little early she went directly to floor six where she was assigned it was a general surgical floor and always busy after safely stashing her coat she sat down at one of the computer terminals and casually typed in darlene morgan the evening ward secretary ignored her busy wrapping things up so she could leave jazz was pleased to learn that darlene morgan was in room on jazzs floor which made the mission that much easier she could always go to other floors on her breaks and lunch hour which she had done on previous missions but there was always the mild concern about arousing attention leaving floor six she took the elevator down to the first floor there she walked into the emergency room as usual it was pure pandemonium evening was its busiest time and the waiting area was jammed with people and crying babies in all manner of illness and injury it was the kind of chaos jazz counted on no one questioned when she walked into the storeroom where the parenteral or intravenous fluids were kept although she didnt expect any interference even if she was seen she still looked around to make sure she wasnt being observed it was a reflex when it was clear no one was watching her she reached into the cardboard box containing the concentrated potassium chloride ampoules took one out and slipped it into her jacket pocket as mr bob had said in the busy er it would never be missed with the first part of her mission accomplished jazz returned upstairs to wait for the nursing report and for her evening shift to begin more out of curiosity than anything else she pulled darlene morgans chart to see if there was anything interesting or for that matter any explanation of course she didnt care whether there was or wasnt mommy i want you to come home tonight stephen whined darlene morgan patted the top of her eightyearolds head and exchanged a worried glance with her husband paul stephen was big for his age and at times could act reasonably mature although that wasnt the case at present he was genuinely nervous about his mother being in the hospital and wouldnt let go of her hand darlene had been surprised when paul had showed up with the little guy in tow since hospital rules dictated that visitors had to be twelve or older and stephen might have been big but he didnt look twelve but paul had explained that stephen pleaded to come to the point that paul was willing to gamble that enforcement of the twelveandover rule would be minimal and that the floor nurses would turn a blind eye at first darlene had been glad to see stephen but now she was worried that there might be a tantrum if paul inappropriately handled the departure issue paul had been trying to leave for half an hour and was understandably frustrated with some difficulty darlene got her hand free and reached an arm around her sons waist and pulled him over against the side of the bed stephen she said softly you remember what we discussed yesterday mom had to have an operation why darlene looked up at paul who rolled his eyes both knew that stephen found the situation threatening and he wasnt going to make it easy darlene had explained everything to him over the weekend but he obviously hadnt comprehended i had to have my knee fixed darlene said why you remember last summer when i hurt myself playing tennis well i broke something in my knee called a ligament the doctor had to make me a new one now i have to stay here overnight tomorrow night ill be home okay stephen twirled the edge of the bedsheet in his fingers avoiding his mothers eyes stephen its way past your bedtime you go home with dad and then when you wake up it will be the day i come home i want you home tonight i know you do darlene said she leaned over and gave her son a hug then she winced and let out a little groan from having moved her operated leg more than she had planned the leg was partially immobilized in a motorized apparatus that slowly but continuously flexed the joint paul stepped forward put his hands on his sons shoulders and urged him to step away stephen allowed himself to be backed up hed heard his mothers moan are you all right paul asked his wife yeah darlene managed she readjusted herself in the bed i just have to leave my leg still she closed her eyes and breathed deeply and the pain lessened this is quite a setup paul said nodding toward the apparatus we should thank our lucky stars we got into americare this fall otherwise all this would have broken the bank youre not suggesting i shouldnt have had the surgery are you not in the slightest im just thinking our old insurance wouldnt have covered everything remember all those complicated deductibles and all that nonsense every time we tried to put in a claim hey im just pleased everything is covered the little episode with the pain seemed to have a big effect on stephen it scared him enough to convince him that his mother needed to be in the hospital just a few minutes later when paul repeated that they had to go he went without complaint all of a sudden darlene found herself alone during the afternoon there had been constant activity in the hallway but now stillness reigned no one passed her open door what she didnt know was that all the nurses and aides from the evening shift as well as those from the night shift were having their report the only sound was the distant barely audible beep coming from a cardiac monitor someplace down the corridor darlenes eyes roamed around her room taking in the simple hospital furniture the cut flowers from paul on the bureau the celerygreen paint and the framed monet print she shuddered to think of the lifeanddeath struggles the walls had witnessed over the years but then quickly tried to erase the thought from her mind it wasnt easy she didnt like hospitals and except for childbirth had never been in one as a patient childbirth had been different there was sense of happiness and anticipation that permeated the ward here it was different and far more intimidating turning her head and looking up she watched the drops fall soundlessly from the iv bottle into an expanded portion of the iv line watching it was hypnotizing and after a few minutes it took a bit of effort to pull her eyes away the reassuring part was that piggybacked to the iv line was a small pump containing morphine which meant that to a controlled degree she could medicate herself so far she had done it only twice a tv was suspended above the foot of her bed and she turned it on more for company than anything else the local evening news was in progress she turned down the sound preferring only to watch her mind addled from a combination of the mornings anesthesia and the narcotic pain medication the machine continued flexing her leg but she was strangely detached from it as if it were someone elses leg an hour passed effortlessly in a state midway between sleep and full consciousness it was more like sleep when she remembered to lie still and more like wakefulness if she happened to move her leg she was vaguely aware that the local news had given way to the letterman show the next thing she knew she was being shaken awake by a nurses aide darlene gritted her teeth because shed inadvertently contracted her thigh muscle upon being disturbed have you passed urine since your operation the aide asked she was an overweight woman with stringy red hair darlene tried to think in truth she couldnt remember and said so i think you would have remembered if you had so youve got to go now ill get the bedpan the aide disappeared into the bathroom and returned with the stainlesssteel container she placed it on the edge of the bed against darlenes hip i dont have to go darlene said the last thing she wanted to do was move herself onto the bedpan even the thought made her wince the surgeon had told her she might have some discomfort after the operation what an understatement you have to the aide stated she checked her watch as if there was no time for discussion a combination of the aides attitude and darlenes drugged state made darlenes dander rise leave the bedpan ill do it later honey youre doing it now i got orders from above well you tell whoever is above that im doing it later im getting the nurse and let me tell you she doesnt brook contrariness the aide disappeared again darlene shook her head contrariness was a word she associated with preschoolers she moved the icecold bedpan away from her thigh five minutes later the nurse burst into the room with the aide in tow causing darlene to start in contrast to the aide the nurse was tall and lean with exotic eyes with her hands on her hips she leaned over darlene the aide tells me you refuse to urinate i didnt refuse i said i would do it later youre doing it now or well cath you i trust you know what that means darlene had an idea and it wasnt appealing in the slightest the aide went around to the other side of the bed darlene felt surrounded its your call sister the nurse added when darlene didnt respond my advice to you is to get that butt of yours in the air you could be a little more empathetic darlene suggested as she prepared to raise her backside by putting her two palms against the bed i got too many sick patients to be empathetic about passing a little urine the nurse said she checked the iv line while the aide got the bedpan into place darlene breathed a sigh of relief getting on the bedpan hadnt been as bad as she had imagined although the cold metal was shocking urinating was another matter it took her a few minutes of concentration before she could start meanwhile the nurse and the aide had left she passed more urine than she thought she could which made her recognize that the ordeal was necessary at the same time it made her remember why she didnt like hospitals once she was finished she had to wait she could move her pelvis up and down without discomfort but to get the bedpan out from under her shed have to lift one of her hands off the bed that meant tensing muscles that hurt her knee so she was stuck after five minutes her back started to complain so she gritted her teeth and managed to move the bedpan to the side almost on cue both the nurse and the aide reappeared while the aide dealt with the bedpan the nurse offered darlene a sleeping pill and a small paper cup of water i dont think i need it darlene said with all the drugs shed had during the day she felt like she was floating take it the nurse enjoined its been ordered by your doctor darlene looked up into the nurses face she couldnt tell if her expression was brazen or bored or disdainful whatever it was it seemed inappropriate it made darlene wonder why the woman had gone into nursing darlene took the pill swallowed it and chased it with the water she gave the cup back to the nurse you could be a little more personable she suggested people get what they deserve the nurse said taking the cup and crushing it in her hand ill be back to see you later dont bother darlene thought but didnt say instead she merely nodded as the nurse and the aide left recognizing her neediness and vulnerability she didnt want to cut off her nose to spite her face with her leg bound up in the flexing machine and with as much pain as she got when she moved her knee she was totally dependent on the nursing staff darlene gave herself a dose of her pain medication to dull her toothachelike discomfort after the bedpan ordeal she soon felt calm and detached the emotions evoked by the runin with the nurse and the aide faded into insignificance the important thing was that the surgery was over the anxiety shed felt the night before was a thing of the past she was now on the road to recovery and according to the doctor she could look forward to playing tennis in six months or so without being aware of the transition darlene fell into a deep dreamless drugged slumber she was unaware of the passage of time until she was rudely yanked back to consciousness by a searing pain racing up her left arm a moan escaped from her lips as her eyes shot open the tv was off and the room was dim with only a single lowwattage nightlight down near the floor for an instant darlene was disoriented but she quickly recovered with the pain now spreading into her shoulder she lunged for the call button but she didnt get to it instead she felt a hand grab her wrist raising her eyes she saw a white figure standing at the bedside the face lost in shadow darlene opened her mouth to talk but the words caught in her throat the room dimmed and began to spin before darlene felt herself falling from the light into darkness six shelly watch out laurie yelled stop to her utter horror her brother was running full tilt toward a stagnant lake the shore of which was ringed with deadly mud capable of swallowing an elephant she couldnt believe it shed warned him of the danger but he wouldnt listen shelly stop she repeated as loud as she could filled with the agonizing frustration of powerlessness in the face of imminent disaster laurie began running although she knew she would be helpless when shelly blundered into the mud she couldnt stand there and let the tragedy unfold without trying to do something as she ran she frantically looked for a long stick or a log that she could extend to her brother once he was caught in the muck but the surrounding landscape was barren with nothing but bare rock then suddenly shelly stopped about ten feet from the quicksandlike muddy border of the lake he turned and faced laurie he was smiling in the same taunting fashion as he had when they were children relieved laurie came to a halt panting she didnt know if she should be thankful or angry then before she could say anything shelly turned around again and recommenced his mad dash toward calamity no laurie shouted but this time shelly reached the lake and ran out as far as he could go before his legs became hopelessly mired again he looked back only now his smile was gone in its place was a look of terror he reached toward laurie whod run to the very edge of the dry land again she looked for something to use to reach out to him but there was nothing rapidly and relentlessly her brother sank into the muck with his pleading eyes riveted to lauries until they disappeared into the filth all that was left was a hand vainly grasping at the air but it too soon disappeared from view swallowed by the enveloping mud no no no laurie shouted but her voice was drowned out by a jarring jangle that pulled her from the depths of sleep quickly she stretched out and quieted her ancient windup alarm clock she flopped back onto the bed and stared up at the ceiling she was perspiring and breathing heavily it was an old nightmare that mercifully shed not had for several years laurie sat up and put her feet over the side of her bed she felt terrible the night before shed stayed up too late compulsively cleaning her dirty apartment despite her exhaustion she knew it had been a stupid thing to do but it had been symbolically therapeutic the literal and figurative cobwebs had to be cleaned she couldnt believe how much her life had changed in fortyeight hours although she was confident that her friendship with jack would remain strong her intimate relationship with him was probably over she had to be realistic about her needs and his reality on top of that were the concerns about her mother as well as the worry about her own health getting to her feet laurie went into her tiny bathroom and started her morning routine of showering washing and drying her hair and putting on the small amount of makeup shed become accustomed to using it was restricted to a touch of coral blush a bit of eyeliner and a naturalcolor lipstick when she was finished she looked at herself in the mirror she wasnt pleased she appeared tired and stressed despite her attempts to hide it and even with additional blush and a few dabs of concealer she didnt look any better laurie had always been a healthy person and had taken health for granted except during a brush with bulimia in high school suddenly the threat of carrying the marker for a brcal mutation changed that dramatically it was a scary disturbing idea that a genetic conspiracy might be covertly residing inside every one of her trillion cells although she had hoped the previous evenings research would have been reassuring it hadnt been she now knew a lot more about the brcal problem from an academic point of view namely that the normal gene functioned as a tumorsuppressor gene but that in its mutated form it acted the opposite unfortunately bookish information was not a lot of help when she thought about the issue personally particularly when she coupled what she had learned with her desire to have children prophylactically losing her breasts was bad enough but losing her ovaries was much worse it was castration to her horror shed learned that if she had the marker for brcal she not only had an increased chance of developing breast cancer before age eighty but also an increased chance of ovarian cancer in other words her biological clock was ticking even louder and faster than she had thought it was all very depressing especially combined with her exhaustion from lack of sleep the question was should she be tested for the brca marker she didnt know she certainly would not consent to having her ovaries removed at least not until she had had a child and her breasts she didnt think shed consent to that either so what would be the rationale for having the test in her mind such a quandary was the current problem with modern genetic testing either there was no cure for the illness in question or the cure was too horrific after a quick breakfast of fruit and cereal she got out of her apartment only fifteen minutes later than she would have liked mrs engler didnt disappoint her she cracked open her door on cue and looked out at laurie with her bloodshot eyes as laurie repeatedly hit the elevator button in the hope of speeding it up laurie smiled and waved at the woman but got no response other than mrs engler clicking the door shut the walk up first avenue was uneventful it had turned colder than it had been the previous few days but laurie didnt try to hail a cab with her down coat zipped up to her neck she was warm enough she also enjoyed the distraction that the pulsating city provided for her new york had a dynamism like no other place on the planet and her problems mercifully retreated into the recesses of her mind in their place surfaced thoughts about the mcgillan case and the hope that she would get slides from maureen and a report from peter she also found herself wondering what kind of cases shed get that day she hoped they would be as absorbing and distracting as mcgillans laurie entered the ocme through the front door in contrast with the previous morning the reception area was empty the administration area to the left was also empty she waved to marlene wilson the receptionist who was enjoying the solitude and leafing through the morning paper she waved back with one hand while buzzing laurie into the id room with the other laurie slipped out of her coat as she walked into the office two of the more senior medical examiners kevin southgate and arnold besserman were sitting in the two brown vinyl club chairs deep in conversation both waved to laurie without interrupting their dialogue laurie waved back she noticed that vinnie amendola was not in his usual spot hiding behind his newspaper she approached the desk where riva was busy reviewing the cases that had come in overnight riva looked up peering at laurie over the tops of her glasses riva smiled did you get more sleep last night she asked not a lot more laurie confessed i was apartment cleaning until almost two ive been there riva said with an understanding chuckle what happened at the hospital laurie told her about the visit and that her mother was doing fine she talked briefly about her father but didnt mention the brca problem jack is already down in the pit riva said i guessed as much when i noticed vinnie wasnt here reading the sports page riva shook her head jack was already in here rooting around in the cases when i arrived before sixthirty thats too early for him to be in here its pathetic i told him to get a life laurie laughed that must have gone over well i also told him about your mom i hope that was okay he had asked where you had gone yesterday afternoon apparently hed come by our office just after youd left for the hospital and i had gone down to talk with calvin thats fine laurie said now that ive been told its no secret i hear you riva said i cant understand why your mother wouldnt want to confide in you anyway jack was taken aback i could tell did he say anything in particular not about your mom he was quiet for a few minutes which is not like jack what kind of case is he doing laurie asked an ugly one riva said he is amazing i have to give him credit the more difficult the case whether emotionally or technically the better he likes it this one was particularly troubling from an emotional point of view it was a fourmonthold infant that had been abraded all over its little body then brought into the er dead the er personnel were in an uproar of indignation since the parents tried to say they had no idea what had happened the police were called and now the parents are in jail oh god laurie voiced with a shudder despite thirteen years as a medical examiner she still had trouble doing children especially infants and abuse cases i was in a muddle when i read the investigative report riva admitted there was no question the child had to be posted but there wasnt anyone i disliked enough to assign it to laurie tried to laugh because she knew riva was joking but she only managed a smile riva liked everyone and vice versa laurie also knew that riva would have taken the case herself had jack not volunteered before jack went downstairs he mentioned another case riva said as she searched through the files before holding one up he said hed had his usual informal teteatete with janice on his way in and that she had told him thered been a case of another young adult at the manhattan general strikingly similar to mcgillans he said that you would probably want it and that i should assign it to you are you interested absolutely laurie said her brows knitted as she took the folder she opened it and rifled through the pages to find the investigative report the patients name was darlene morgan age thirtysix she was the mother of an eightyearold riva said what a tragedy for the child my word laurie voiced as she skimmed the report it does sound similarstrikingly similar she looked up do you know if janice is still here i havent the faintest idea she was when i passed the pas office but that was before sixthirty i think ill check laurie said thanks for the case my pleasure riva said but she was talking to lauries back because laurie was already on her way laurie moved quickly technically janice was off at seven but she frequently stayed later she was compulsive about her reports and often could be there as late as eight it was sevenforty as laurie passed through the clerical room a minute later she leaned into the investigators doorway bart arnold looked up from his desk he was on the phone is janice still here laurie asked bart hooked his thumb over his shoulder to point into the depths of the room janices head popped out from around a monitor she was sitting at the desk in the far corner laurie walked in and grabbed a chair she pulled it over to janices desk and sat down she waited until janice finished a strenuous yawn sorry janice said when she had recovered she used a knuckle to wipe under her eyes they were watering youre entitled laurie said was it a busy night volumewise it was the usual nothing like the night before although there were a couple of heartbreakers i dont know whats getting into me i didnt used to be so sensitive i hope its not affecting my objectivity i heard about the infant can you imagine how can people be like that its beyond me maybe im getting too soft for this job its when you stop being affected by such cases that you have to worry i suppose janice with an exhausted sigh she straightened herself up in her chair as if pulling herself together anyway what can i do for you ive just scanned your report on darlene morgan the case strikes me as being disturbingly similar to that of sean mcgillan thats exactly what i told dr stapleton when i ran into him this morning is there anything you can tell me thats not in here laurie said waving the report in the air like any impressions you might have gotten while talking to the people involved like the nurses or the doctors or even the family members you know a step beyond the facts something that you sensed intuitively janice kept her brown eyes glued to lauries while she thought after a minute she shook her head slightly not really i know what you mean kind of a subliminal impression but nothing came to mind it was just another hospital tragedy an apparently healthy youngtomiddleaged woman whose time was up janice shrugged when someone like that suddenly dies it certainly makes you realize we are all living on the edge laurie bit her lip while she struggled to think of what else she should ask you didnt talk to the surgeon did you no i didnt was it the same surgeon who operated on mcgillan no there were two different orthopedic guys involved and my impression from the resident was that both are held in high regard it seems that both patients died at about the same time in the morning did that seem strange to you not really in my experience that twotofouram time frame is quite popular for deaths to occur its my busiest time during my shift a doctor one time suggested to me it had something to do with circadian hormone levels laurie nodded what janice was saying was probably true dr stapleton told me that you did the post on sean mcgillan is the reason you are asking these questions because you didnt find much pathology i found none laurie admitted what about anesthesia any similarities there like the same personnel or same agents i have to confess i didnt look into that should i have laurie shrugged both were about eighteen hours postsurgery so they would still have remnants of the anesthesia on board i think were going to have to look into everything including all the medication they got and in what order and dosage i asked bart to get the mcgillan chart im going to need the morgan chart also i can put in the request before i go janice said laurie stood up i appreciate it i hope you dont think my coming in here is a negative reflection on your investigative report because it is quite the contrary your reports are always firstrate janice flushed well thank you i try i know how important it can be to have all the information especially in mysterious cases like these four four laurie questioned with surprise what do you mean four as i recall the week before last there were two others both from the manhattan general that were similar from my end how similar were they patients who were in their first day postoperative like mcgillan and morgan thats my recollection what i do remember for certain is that they were young and generally in good health so that it was a bigtime unpleasant surprise to everyone that they had cardiac arrests i also remember both were found by the nurses aide while doing routine postoperative temperatures and heart rates which is how darlene morgan was found suggesting they had to have suffered some kind of major medical catastrophe i mean there was no warning at least with sean mcgillan hed had a chance to ring his call button also just like with mcgillan and morgan the resuscitation team had zero luck i mean they got nothing but a flat line this could be very important laurie said pleased that she had come to seek out janice anyway janice said i was planning on pulling copies of the investigative reports but i havent had time yet were they orthopedic cases i dont remember exactly what kind of surgery they had but it will be easy to find out if i had to guess id say they were both general surgery cases not orthopedic would you like me to pull the investigative reports dont bother im certainly going to want to have the whole folders do you remember which doctor posted them i dont think i ever knew i dont have much contact with the doctors besides you and dr stapleton do you remember what was the final official cause of death laurie asked sorry janice admitted i dont even know if they have been signed out yet sometimes i follow up on cases that interest me but not on the two were talking about i have to admit that at the time they seemed like a couple of pretty routine unexpected major cardiac problems i guess saying something is routine and unexpected is an oxymoron so maybe routine is not the right word i mean people die in the hospital as tragic as that may be and a lot of times its not from the problem that brought them into the hospital in the first place it wasnt until this morning when i was writing up the morgan case and thinking about the nurses aide angle that i even remembered them what were the names laurie asked she felt a shiver of excitement this curious unexpected yet potentially important snippet of information was exactly the reason she had wanted to talk with janice it made her feel more strongly that her medicalexaminer colleagues who ignored the experience and expertise of the forensic investigators and the mortuary techs did so at their professional peril solomon moskowitz and antonio nogueira i wrote them down with their accession numbers janice handed the paper to laurie laurie took the paper and looked at the names whether she was actively seeking a major diversion from her own personal problems she didnt know what she did know was that she had found one thanks janice laurie said sincerely ive got to hand it to you associating these cases might be important one of the problems of there being eight medical examiners at the ocme is that such associations could slip through the cracks there was a thursdayafternoon conference where cases were vetted in an open forum but it usually involved only the more academically interesting or even macabre ones dont mention it janice said it makes me feel good when i think im really part of the team and contributing you most certainly are laurie responded oh and by the way when you put in the request for morgans chart will you also ask for moskowitzs and nogueiras as well ill be happy to janice said she made a notation on a postit and put the reminder on the side of her monitor with her brain in a twitter laurie hustled out of the forensic investigators office and took the elevator up to the fifth floor concerns about brca and even jack were pushed to the back of her mind she couldnt take her eyes off the two names on the paper that janice had given her going from one curious case to four was a huge leap the question was simply whether these four cases were indeed related for her this was what being a medical examiner was all about if the cases were related by a common drug or procedure and if she could figure it out then she would have the rewarding opportunity to prevent more deaths of course such information would also tell her if the deaths were accidental or homicidal and that thought gave laurie a shiver entering her office laurie quickly hung up her coat behind the door then sat down at the computer she typed in the accession numbers of the two cases learning that neither had been signed out as of yet mildly disappointed she did get the names of the two doctors who had done the autopsies george fontworth had posted antonio nogueira and kevin southgate had posted solomon moskowitz having seen southgate down in the id office earlier she picked up her phone and dialed his extension she let it ring five times before hanging up returning to the elevator laurie descended to the first floor and wended her way back to the id room shed hoped kevin would still be there talking with arnold and she wasnt disappointed she waited patiently for a break in their animated conversation the two incessantly argued about politics kevin the inveterate liberal democrat and arnold the equivalent conservative republican both had been at the ocme for almost twenty years and had come to resemble each other both were overweight with ashen complexions and were haphazard about their hygiene and dress in lauries mind they were the stereotypical coroners in old hollywood movies do you remember posting a solomon moskowitz about two weeks ago laurie asked kevin after apologizing for interrupting as usual he and arnold seemed to be just shy of exchanging blows they frustrated each other since neither had a snowballs chance in hell of changing the others entrenched opinions after joking that he couldnt remember the cases he did yesterday kevins doughy face screwed up in thought you know i think i remember a moskowitz he said do you happen to know if it was a manhattan general case thats what i was told then i remember it the patient had an apparent cardiac arrest if its the one im thinking about there wasnt much on the post i dont believe ive signed it out yet i imagine im waiting for the microscopic to come back yeah sure laurie thought to herself even in the busiest of times it didnt take two weeks to get slides but she wasnt surprised kevin and arnold were notorious for failing to get their cases out on a timely basis do you remember if the patient had had recent surgery now youre pushing your luck i tell you what why dont you stop up to my office and ill let you go over the folder sounds like a good idea laurie responded she was momentarily distracted by seeing george come in through the door to the id room removing his coat allowing kevin and arnold to get back to their bickering laurie joined george at the coffee machine george had been at the ocme for almost as long as kevin and arnold but he hadnt picked up any of their personal habits he appeared significantly more stylish with pressed pants a clean shirt and a colorful tie all of which were reasonably contemporary which was how he liked to present himself he also looked dramatically younger by avoiding the common middleage weight gain although laurie knew jack did not hold george in high esteem professionally she had always found him easy to work with i heard your gunshot case yesterday had a surprising denouement laurie said what an ordeal george complained if bingham ever offers to do another case with me remind me to graciously refuse laurie laughed and chatted about the case for a few minutes before switching to her real interest as shed spoken with kevin concerning moskowitz she asked if george remembered doing antonio nogueira some two weeks earlier give me a hint george responded im guessing at the details since i dont know them for certain laurie said but i believe he would have been relatively young he would have been within twentyfour hours of having surgery at the manhattan general and he would have been suspected of having suffered some sort of cardiac catastrophe okay i remember the case a real teaser i found zilch on the post and nothing to hang my hat on with the microscopic the folder is up on my desk waiting for toxicology possibly to come up with something otherwise im going to be forced to sign it out as a spontaneous ventricular fibrillation or a massive heart attack that was so sudden and so global that there wasnt any time for pathology to develop of course that means whatever caused it had to magically disappear one way or the other the heart stopped i mean it couldnt have been that his breathing stopped because there was no cyanosis he shrugged and gestured helplessly with his hands so the microscopic didnt show much in the coronary vessels minimal and the heart muscle itself looked normal i mean like something capable of causing a sudden lethal arrhythmia was there any sign of inflammation nope it was completely normal do you mind if i look at the folder later this afternoon laurie asked be my guest why the interest how did you hear about it i heard about it from janice laurie said im interested because i had a case surprisingly similar yesterday laurie felt mildly guilty about not mentioning the two other cases but not guilty enough to bring them up for one thing her suspicion that they were connected in any way was purely speculative and second at this early stage she couldnt help but feel proprietary about what she was beginning to think might be some kind of series leaving the id office laurie descended a floor and sought out marvin she found him in the mortuary office as she had hoped he was already in his scrubs are you ready to rock and roll laurie asked she was eager to start youre on sister marvin said as if it today was a rerun of the previous day laurie gave him darlene morgans accession number before going into the locker room to change into scrubs she was excited it was the first time in her career as a medical examiner that she hoped to find nothing on the autopsy meaning morgan would be like mcgillan nogueira and moskowitz the longer the series idea played out the better the diversion it would be and the less apt shed be to agonize over personal unpleasantries leaving the locker room she crossed over to the storage room and rescued her battery pack from the charger fifteen minutes later she was in the moon suit and pushing into the pit from the anteroom where shed gloved there was only one case under way she had no trouble distinguishing between jack and vinnie since vinnie was shorter and considerably slighter jack was peering through the viewfinder of a camera set on a tripod laurie tried not to look at the tiny naked infant splayed out on the table laurie blinked by reflex when the cameras flash went off is that you laurie jack called out he had straightened up and turned in her direction in response to the sound of the door closing it is laurie said not finding marvin in the autopsy room she twisted around to look through the wireembedded glass in the door leading out to the corridor marvin was approaching with a gurney in tow at the back pushing was another mortuary tech miguel sanchez laurie guessed there had been a problem marvin was customarily superefficient and invariably waiting for her come on over here jack said with some excitement i have something to show you this case is a corker im sure it is laurie said but i think ill let you tell me about it after the fact you know that autopsies on children are not my cup of tea im pretty certain this case is another one like those yesterday jack said im more than ninety percent sure the cause and manner of death are going to surprise everyone im telling you its textbook despite her distaste for dealing with kids in the autopsy room her professional curiosity urged her over to jacks side with some difficulty she made herself look down at the hapless child just as riva had described the poor little girl appeared bruised abraded and burned over much of her tiny body including her face the awfulness of the image made laurie sway slightly as if dizzy she spread her feet to stabilize herself behind her she heard the door open followed by the squeak of the wheels of an old gurney as it was pushed in what if i told you the whole body xray of this infant was completely negative for fractures old or new would that influence your thinking about this case not particularly laurie said she tried to look in at jacks face but it was difficult with the overhead lights reflecting off his plastic face mask they hadnt seen each other or talked for almost twentyfour hours and when they first met that morning she had hoped for something other than a repeat of his playful professorial role what if i told you that in addition to the xray being normal the frenulum is intact it certainly wouldnt negate what im looking at laurie responded despite her repugnance laurie bent over and looked closely at the skin lesions particularly where jack had made a small incision through one of the abrasions there had been no blood or edema all at once she knew now what jack was implying when pointing out signs that suggested abuse was not at issue vermin she said suddenly she straightened up give this lady a prize jack said like a carnival barker as expected dr montgomery has expertly corroborated my impression of course vinnie isnt convinced so we have a fivedollar bet riding on finding nonspecific evidence of an asphyxial death when we do the internal part of the autopsy and everybody knows what that would imply laurie nodded the chances were good that the child in front of her had died of sudden infant death syndrome or sids which shows signs of asphyxial death on autopsy although on first glance she had thought all the skin lesions had been inflicted prior to death she now guessed they were most likely postmortem damage caused by a variety of vermin such as ants cockroaches and possibly mice or rats if this indeed proved to be the case then the manner of death was not homicidal but accidental of course that didnt lessen the tragedy of the young life lost but it surely had very different implications well i better get cracking here jack said as he detached the camera from the tripod this child was maimed by the circumstances of poverty not abuse ive got to get her parents out of jail keeping them there is like adding insult to injury laurie made her way over to where marvin was aligning the gurney next to one of the autopsy tables trying not to dwell on her disappointment about jacks blithe repartee and apparent mindset she also couldnt help but wonder if jacks case was another preternatural hint to remind her that things were not always quite what they seemed at first glance did you have some trouble laurie asked marvin as the two techs moved the body onto the autopsy table marvin positioned the head on a wooden block a slight hitch marvin admitted mike passano must have written down the wrong compartment number but with miguels help we found the body in short order any special requests for this case it should be straightforward laurie said as she checked the accession number and name in fact i hope it turns out to be a mirror image to the first case we did yesterday marvin shot her a perplexed glance as she started the external exam lauries trained eye began recording her observations the body was that of a caucasian woman in her midthirties with brunette hair in a normal distribution who appeared to have been in good health although slightly overweight with extra adipose tissue across her abdomen and on the lateral aspect of her thighs her skin had the usual pallor of death and was lesionfree save for a few innocuous nevi there was no cyanosis there was no evidence of recreational drug use there were two freshly sutured incisions on the lateral surfaces of her left knee and no signs of inflammation or infection a cappedoff intravenous line ran into her left arm with no extravasations of blood or fluid at the site an endotracheal tube that was correctly positioned in her trachea protruded from her mouth so far so good laurie said to herself meaning the external exam was comparable with sean mcgillan jrs she took the scalpel offered by marvin and began the internal portion she worked quickly and intently the activity in the rest of the room receded from her consciousness fortyfive minutes later laurie straightened up after tracing the veins in the legs up into the abdominal cavity she had found no clots other than several insignificant uterine fibroids and a polyp in the large intestine she had found no significant pathology and certainly nothing that would have explained the womans demise exactly like mcgillan she would have to wait for the microscopic and the toxicological if she was going to find a cause of death a clean case marvin commented just like you wanted very curious laurie said she felt vindicated she looked around the room which had practically filled during her intense concentration the only table that wasnt in use was immediately adjacent to where jack had been working apparently hed finished and left without so much as a word laurie wasnt surprised it seemed consistent with his recent behavior at the table on the other side of hers laurie thought she recognized rivas diminutive frame when marvin went out into the hall to get a gurney laurie stepped over to check it was riva interesting case laurie asked riva looked up not particularly from a professional point of view its just a hitandrun on park avenue she was a tourist from the midwest and she was holding on to her husbands hand when she was struck he was only a step ahead of her it always amazes me pedestrians arent more careful in this city considering how fast the traffic moves how about your case extremely interesting laurie said almost no pathology whatsoever riva looked at her officemate askance interesting and no pathology that doesnt sound like you ill explain later meanwhile do i have another case not today riva said i thought you could use a little down time hey im okay really i dont want any special treatment dont worry its a relatively light day youve got a lot on your plate laurie nodded thanks riva she said although she would have preferred to keep busy ill see you upstairs laurie returned to her table and when marvin came back with the gurney she thanked him for his help and said that she was finished for the day ten minutes later after the usual cleaning process she hung up her moon suit and attached her battery to the charger planning on heading to histology and toxicology she was surprised to see jack blocking her exit from the storeroom can i buy you a cup of coffee he asked laurie glanced up into his maplesyrupcolored eyes and tried to gauge his mood shed had quite enough of his lightheartedness considering the circumstances it was ultimately humiliating yet there was no impish smirk like hed worn the previous afternoon when hed appeared in her office doorway his expression was serious almost solemn which she appreciated since it was more apropos to what was going on between them id like to talk jack added id love a cup of coffee laurie responded with some difficulty she tried to reign in her expectations about what jack had in mind this seemed to be almost tooappropriate behavior for him we could head up to the id office or the lunchroom jack said its your call the lunchroom was on the second floor it was a loud room with an oldfashioned linoleum floor bare concrete walls and a bank of vending machines at that time in the morning it would be reasonably crowded with secretarial and custodial personnel on break lets try the id office laurie suggested we should have the place to ourselves i missed you last night jack said as they waited for the back elevator my word laurie thought despite her concerns her hopes of having a significant conversation rose it was not customary for jack to admit to his feelings quite so directly she looked up at his face to make sure he wasnt being sarcastic but she couldnt tell for certain since his face was averted he was absorbed in watching the floor indicator above the elevator door the numbers were decreasing with their typical agonizing slowness the back elevator was used for freight and moved at a glacial pace the door opened and they boarded the cab i missed you too laurie admitted concerned that she was allowing herself to be set up for a fall she felt embarrassingly selfconscious and now avoided eye contact from her perspective they were both acting like a couple of preteens i was a hopeless case on the basketball court jack said i couldnt do anything right im sorry laurie said but then immediately wanted to take it back it sounded as though she was apologizing when she was merely sympathizing as i expected the internal on my case was consistent with sids jack said to change the subject it was obvious that he was equally uncomfortable really laurie said how was yours jack asked as the elevator began its ascent when i bumped into janice she mentioned it seemed similar to your mcgillan case so i told riva that youd probably want it i appreciate it laurie said i did want it and you were right it was exactly like mcgillan to an uncomfortable degree what do you mean uncomfortable jack asked im beginning to think that your suggestion yesterday about forensics establishing a manner of death opposite to what was expected could be applicable im thinking i might be dealing with homicide sort of the cromwell case in reverse in other words i might have stumbled onto the work of a serial killer i cant help but think about some of those infamous healthinstitution serial murders particularly the recent one over in new jersey and pennsylvania laurie did not have the same reservations about mentioning her suspicions to jack as she had had with fontworth whoa jack said when i was talking about forensics providing some surprises i was talking in general i wasnt suggesting anything about your case i thought you were laurie said jack shook his head as the elevator door opened on the first floor not at all and i have to say that i think youre taking a quantum leap going from natural to homicide with the case you described to me why on earth did it even occur to you he gestured for laurie to exit ahead of him because ive now autopsied in successive days two relatively young healthy people who have died suddenly yet have no associated pathology none your case today didnt have any emboli or obvious cardiac abnormalities absolutely none it was clean well there were a few uterine fibroids but that was it like mcgillan she was within twentyfour hours postsurgery with general anesthesia like mcgillan she had been completely stable without complications and then bingo she arrests and is totally unable to be resuscitated laurie snapped her fingers for emphasis they passed through the communications room the secretaries were bunched together and chatting for the moment the phone lines were quiet after the mayhem of the morning commute death generally took a breather in the city two cases dont make a series jack asserted he was dumbfounded by lauries suggestion of a serial killer i think it is four cases not two laurie said thats too many to be a coincidence while they helped themselves to the communal coffee laurie described her conversations with kevin and george as she spoke she and jack sat down in the two brown vinyl club chairs that kevin and arnold had been in earlier what about toxicology jack questioned if there turns out to be no pathology on gross or histologically then the answer is going to come from toxicology whether there was hankypanky going on or even if there wasnt george said hes still waiting on toxicology for his case obviously for mine ive got a wait be that as it may were dealing with a curious set of circumstances here jack and laurie sipped from their respective cups eyeing each other over the brims both were aware of the others current mindset in regard to lauries serialkiller theory lauries expression was challenging while jacks reflected his feeling that she was out in left field if you want my opinion jack said finally i think youre letting your imagination run wild maybe youre upset because of our problems and youre looking for a diversion laurie felt a wave of irritation spread through her it came from a combination of jacks being patronizing on the one hand and his being correct on the other she averted her gaze and took a breath what is it you wanted to talk about im sure it wasnt our respective cases riva told me about your mother yesterday jack said i was tempted to call last night to ask you about her and extend my sympathies but under the circumstances i thought it better to talk in person thank you for your concern shes doing fine im glad jack said is it appropriate if i send some flowers thats completely up to you then i will jack said he paused fidgeted and then said hesitantly i dont know if i should bring this up about your mother then dont laurie said to herself she was disappointed she had allowed herself to be set up after all she didnt want to talk about her mother but im sure you are aware there is a hereditary aspect to breast cancer i am laurie said she looked at jack with exasperation wondering where he was going with this conversation i dont know if your mother has been tested for the markers indicating brca gene mutations but the results would have significance concerning treatment more important for you it would have significance concerning prevention one way or the other i think you should definitely be tested i mean i dont want to alarm you but it would be prudent my mother is positive for a brca mutation laurie admitted some of her anger although not her disappointment abated when she realized that jack was being solicitous about her health and not just her mothers thats an even greater reason for you to be tested jack said have you thought about it ive thought about it laurie admitted but im not convinced it would have much significance and may just add to my anxiety im not about to have my breasts and ovaries removed mastectomy and oophorectomy are not the only preventive measures available jack said last night i went on the internet and read up on all this laurie found herself almost smiling she wondered if she and jack had visited the same websites more frequent mammograms is another option jack added eventually you might even consider tamoxifen treatment but thats down the road anyway the bottom line is that it just makes sense i mean if this predictive information is available you should do it in fact i would like to ask you to do it no i take that back i would like to plead with you to do it for me to lauries surprise jack leaned forward and gripped her forearm with unexpected strength to emphasize his commitment to the cause youre really convinced laurie questioned marveling at the for me part absolutely no question jack responded even if the only effect is to make you more prone to have regular checkups that would be an enormously positive effect laurie please is it a blood test i dont even know yes its a simple blood test do you have a primarycare physician over at the manhattan general where we are now obligated to go not yet laurie admitted but i can call my old college chum sue passero shes on staff in internal medicine im sure she could set me up perfect jack said he rubbed his hands together should i call to make sure you do it laurie laughed ill do it today all right for goodness sakes ill do it today thank you jack said he released lauries arm that hed been firmly clutching now that weve got that settled i want to ask about whether we can compromise about your moving out of my apartment for a moment laurie was nonplussed just when she thought jack wasnt going to bring up their relationship he did as i said he continued i missed you last night worst of all my basketball game was a disaster the defenses i had carefully erected against your absence had been undermined by a pregame runin with a pair of your pantyhose what pantyhose laurie asked raising her guard again she purposefully didnt laugh at jacks reversion to witty sarcasm for her there was nothing funny about suggesting that jacks prowess on the basketball court was a determining factor in her moving back to his apartment a pair you left in the bathroom but dont worry theyre safely ensconced in the bureau what do you mean by compromise laurie asked dubiously jack fidgeted in his chair it was apparent that he was uncomfortable with the question laurie let him take all the time he wanted finally he made a gesture of confusion by hunching his shoulders and extending his free hand palm up well agree to make sure we discuss the issues on a regular basis lauries heart sank thats no compromise she said with a voice that reflected her discouragement jack we both know what the issues are at this point more talk is not going to solve anything i know that sounds contrary to what ive usually said about the importance of communication the fact of the matter is that ive been compromising from the beginning and particularly over the last year i think i understand where you are coming from and im sympathetic which is what has kept me in a circumstance that has not been satisfying my needs its really as simple as that i believe we love each other but were at a crossroads im not twentyfive anymore i need a family i need commitment to use one of your expressions the ball is in your court its your decision talk is superfluous at this point im not going to try to convince you which at this stage talk would begin to sound like and one final point i didnt leave in a moment of pique its been a long time coming for a few minutes they merely stared at each other without moving finally laurie was the one who moved she leaned forward and gave jacks thigh a squeeze just above the knee this doesnt mean i dont want to talk in general she said it doesnt mean were not friends it just means that unless we can truly compromise ill be better off staying at my apartment and meanwhile ill get back to my diversion laurie stood up smiled down at jack without rancor and then walked back through the communications room en route to the elevator seven with a mighty yawn that brought tears to her eyes laurie put down her pencil stretched and then viewed her handiwork she had created a matrix on a piece of graph paper that had the names of the four patients of her supposed series on the lefthand side of the page running along the top of the page and creating columns were all parameters of the cases that she thought might be important including the age of the patient the sex of the patient the type of surgery involved the name of the surgeon the anesthesiologist and anesthetic agent used the sedative and pain medication employed where in the hospital the patient was boarded how the patient was discovered and by whom the time the patient was discovered who did the autopsy any potentially relevant pathology and the toxicology results currently laurie had preliminary entries in all the boxes of her matrix except for the names of the surgeons and anesthesiologists the type of anesthetic and drugs used the toxicology results on the two cases she had posted and any possible relevant pathology on darlene morgan to fill in the empty boxes she needed the hospital charts and the continued cooperation of peter and maureen in the toxicology boxes of the two cases posted by kevin and george laurie had written negative screen further testing pending one piece of information that the matrix had already brought to her attention which she thought important and mildly damning for her theory of a serial killer was that the cases were not on the same ward two of the patients had been on the general surgical floor while the other two had been on the orthopedic and neurosurgical floor since none of the patients had had neurosurgery and since one of the orthopedic cases had been on general surgery laurie had already called the manhattan general admitting office for an explanation the explanation turned out to be simple because the hospital operated at near capacity beds frequently had to be allocated irrespective of the type of surgery from the moment laurie had left jack in the id room she had been a human dynamo in regard to investigating the four patients her motivation was twofold there was the continued need for a diversion to keep from obsessing about her own problems as jack had surmised that hadnt changed what had changed was a strong desire to vindicate her intuitive belief that these cases did not represent a coincidence jacks blithe dismissal of the idea had been both belittling and galling first she had gone up to histology to see maureen whod been happy to present her with a tray of mcgillans hestained microscopic sections in less than twentyfour hours with the burden of processing eight thousand autopsies a year overnight histologyslide service was unheardof laurie had thanked her profusely for her efforts and had immediately taken the slides back to her office to study them painstakingly as she had suspected she found no pathology in general and specifically she found the heart entirely normal there were no signs of active or healed inflammation of the cardiac muscle or the coronary vessels and she saw no abnormalities of the valves or conduction system next she had gone down to the fourthfloor toxicology lab where shed run into a minor setback by bumping into john devries thanks to the bad blood between them and johns territoriality hed demanded to know what she was doing wandering around in his laboratory not wishing to get peter in trouble with his boss laurie had to be creative she happened to have been standing next to the mass spectrometer so she said she had never completely understood mass spectrometry and was hoping to learn something about it mollified to a degree john had provided her with some printed literature before excusing himself to go down to the serology lab laurie had found peter in his windowless lilliputian office and his eyes lit up when he saw her although laurie didnt remember peter from their life prior to the ocme peter remembered her when they both had attended wesleyan university in the early eighties he had been two years behind her i ran a toxicology screen on mcgillan peter had said i didnt find anything but i have to warn you that sometimes compounds can hide out in the peaks and valleys on the readout particularly when the concentration is very low it would be a big help if you gave me more of a hint of what you are looking for fair enough laurie had said since the autopsies on these patients suggested they suffered a very rapid demise their hearts had to suddenly stop pumping blood i mean one minute everything was fine and the next minute there was no circulation that means we have to eliminate cardiac toxins like cocaine and digitalis and any other drugs that can cause changes in the heart rate either by affecting the center that initiates the beat or the conduction system that spreads the impulse around the heart on top of that we even have to rule out all the drugs that are used to treat abnormal cardiac rhythms wow thats a rather big list peter had commented the cocaine and the digitalis i would have seen because i know where to look on the readout and theyd have to be big doses to do what you are talking about the others i dont know but ill look into it at that point laurie had asked about solomon moskowitz and antonio nogueira whose autopsies had been done several weeks earlier she told peter that the cases mirrored mcgillans using his keypad in front of his monitor and his password peter accessed the laboratory database both toxicology screens had been normal but he offered to run them again now that he had a ballpark idea of what she was looking for one other thing laurie had said when she was about to leave i did another case this morning whose samples should be on the way up again it was strikingly similar to the others which tells me theres something weird going on over at the manhattan general since i cant find any pathology im afraid the major burden is going to be on your shoulders to find out what it is peter had said hed do his best after her visit to toxicology laurie had gone up to georges office to get a look at antonio nogueiras folder george had surprised her by having copies of the salient portions waiting for her kevin had not been so accommodating but he didnt mind if laurie made copies taking the material back to her office laurie had gone over it in detail filling in her matrix as she went along taking the sheet containing the matrix and twisting around in her chair laurie waited for riva to hang up on a call she was on with a local doctor about her hitandrun case that morning check this out laurie said extending the graph paper to her officemate as she hung up the receiver riva took the sheet and studied it then looked over at laurie youre being very industrious this is a great way to organize this information im fascinated by this puzzle laurie admitted im also intent on figuring it out i suppose this is why you were pleased when you found no pathology on morgan meaning you had yet another case precisely so what is your thinking at this point riva asked with all this effort you must have a better idea i think i do its become pretty clear to me that the mechanism of death was ventricular fibrillation for all four the cause is another matter as is the manner im listening are you sure you want to hear i mentioned my ideas to jack and he was irritatingly dismissive try me all right in a nutshell since ive decided that the mechanism of death was ventricular fibrillation or cardiac standstill and since the hearts have been structurally normal the cause of death has to be some arrhythmiaproducing drug that seems pretty reasonable riva said now what about the manner of death this is the most interesting part laurie said she leaned forward and lowered her voice as if she were afraid someone might hear im thinking the manner of death is homicide in other words i think i have stumbled onto the handiwork of a clever serial killer in the manhattan general riva started to say something but laurie held up her hand and moderated her voice as soon as i get the hospital charts ill be able to fill in the rest of my matrix that will include the preop drugs the anesthetic agent as well as the postoperative medication well talk again and see what your response is personally i dont think the extra information is going to make any difference the occurrence of four cases of fatal ventricular fibrillation unresponsive to resuscitation in young healthy people undergoing elective surgery in the same hospital using customary protocols within a couple of weeks is too much of a coincidence it is a very busy hospital laurie riva said simply not wanting to argue laurie breathed out forcibly in her sensitized state she interpreted rivas tone as condescending and not all that different from jacks laurie reached out and snatched her matrix from rivas hand its just my opinion riva said sensing lauries reaction youre entitled to your opinion laurie said swinging back around to face her desk i dont mean to irritate you riva said to lauries back its not your problem laurie said without looking back im a bit thinskinned these days she turned around again and faced riva but let me tell you this what made those previous incidences involving serial killers in healthcare facilities go on for so long was a low index of suspicion i think you are right riva said she smiled but laurie did not return the peace gesture instead she spun back around and picked up the phone she might have found it aggravating to share her ideas with jack and riva but the process of vocalizing them had put everything more in focus and had served to make her even more confident that she was correct her friends objections had done nothing to shake her beliefs she was now even more committed to her serialkiller scenario as such she realized that even if it were premature in the sense of having no definitive proof it was incumbent on her to see that someone over at the manhattan general was informed unfortunately from bitter experience she knew that such a decision was not hers to make it had to come from administration and go through public relations consequently she dialed calvins extension and asked connie egan calvins secretary for a moment of calvins time the deputy chief is due to leave for an advisory board luncheon in a few minutes connie said if you want to try to catch him id advise you to come down immediately otherwise youll be looking at sometime after four and even that is dependent on his getting back here and theres no guarantee of that ill be right down laurie said she hung up and got to her feet good luck riva said overhearing the conversation thanks laurie responded without a lot of sincerity she picked up her matrix dont be disappointed if calvin is even more dubious than i riva called after her and he might bite your head off with such a suggestion of criminality remember he has a soft spot for the manhattan general since he trained over there as a medical student and resident in its former life as a major universityaffiliated teaching hospital ill keep that in mind laurie yelled back she felt a little guilty about her behavior toward riva being in such a bad mood was out of character for laurie but she couldnt help herself for fear of missing calvin she wasted no time she took the front elevators and in less than five minutes she was walking into the administration area a number of people were seated on a long couch waiting to see the chief whose office door was closed and guarded by his secretary gloria sanford laurie could remember a few times sitting there herself waiting to be bawled out for doing something she was now avoiding by going to see calvin laurie had been a good deal more headstrong as well as apolitical when she had first started at the ocme you can go right in connie said as laurie approached her desk calvins door was ajar he was on the phone with his legs perched on the corner of his desk as laurie came in he motioned with his free hand for her to take one of the two chairs facing him lauries eyes glanced around the familiar room it was less than half the size of binghams and didnt connect with the conference room still it was mammoth when compared to the space laurie had to share with riva the walls were covered with the usual array of diplomas and awards and pictures with major city politicians calvin concluded his conversation which laurie could tell dealt with the agenda of the upandcoming advisory board luncheon the advisory board had been set up by the mayor almost twenty years ago to make the ocme less beholden to both the executive branch and law enforcement calvin let his heavy legs plop down on the floor he peered at laurie through his newly acquired rimless progressive lenses laurie felt herself tense thanks to a lingering mild problem with male authority figures from an early age calvin had always intimidated laurie even more than the chief it was a combination of his imposing physical presence his unwavering cold black eyes his legendary stormy temperament and his occasional chauvinism at the same time she knew him to be capable of warmth and gentlemanly behavior what worried her at any given encounter was which side would be dominant what can i do for you calvin began unfortunately we have to make this short it wont take but a moment laurie assured him she handed over the matrix she had prepared then she quickly summarized the history of the four cases as they had unfolded followed by her ideas concerning the possible mechanism cause and manner of death it took only a few minutes and when she was done she fell silent calvin was still studying the matrix finally he looked up his eyebrows were arched settling back into his seat which complained with a squeak he arched his index fingers with his elbows on the desk and shook his head slowly his expression was of confusion i guess my first question has to be why you are telling all this to me at this early stage none of these cases has been signed out yet purely because i thought you might want to warn someone over at the manhattan general what our thinking was to raise the index of suspicion correction calvin boomed he took a fleeting glance at his watch which wasnt lost on laurie i would be warning them what your thinking was not mine laurie im surprised at you youre using grossly inadequate data here to make a premature and ridiculous leap he slapped the matrix with the back of his free hand youre suggesting that i communicate pure speculation which could be extraordinarily detrimental to the manhattan general hospital if it got out into the wrong hands something that happens all too frequently it could even cause a panic we deal in facts here at the ocme not fanciful supposition hell we could lose all credibility i have a strong intuition about this laurie countered calvin slammed his sizable palm down onto the surface of his desk a few papers went wafting off i have zero patience with female intuition if thats what this is boiling down to what do you think this is a sewing club were a scientific organization we deal in facts not hunches and guesswork but were talking about four essentially unexplained cases within a twoweek period laurie said while inwardly groaning it seemed that she had awakened calvins dormant chauvinism yeah but they do thousands of cases over at the manhattan general thousands i happen to know they have a low death rate well below the bellwether three percent how do i know i serve on the board come back with some facts from toxicology or infallible evidence of lowvoltage electrocution and ill listen to you not some cockamamie story of serial killer on the loose with no facts to back it up they were not electrocuted laurie said at one point she had briefly considered the idea since standard voltage was capable of causing ventricular fibrillation but shed dismissed the idea because patients werent routinely subjected to power sources maybe one could have been exposed to an aberrant piece of equipment but surely not four particularly since none had been monitored im just trying to make a point calvin yelled he stood up abruptly causing his desk chair to roll back on its casters and strike the wall he handed laurie her paper go back and get some facts if you are so motivated i dont have time for this foolery ive got to go to a meeting where we deal with real problems embarrassed at being chastised like a schoolgirl laurie fled the administration area calvins office door had been open during the exchange and the people waiting to see bingham watched her departure with expressionless faces she couldnt imagine what they thought about what they had heard she was relieved to catch an empty elevator to pull herself together as she had said to riva she knew she was thinskinned at the moment and under normal circumstances she probably could have brushed off calvins crusty response to her concerns yet combining calvins reaction with jack and rivas she felt like a modernday cassandra she couldnt believe that people whom she respected could not see what was so clear to her back in her office she threw herself into her chair and for a moment buried her head in her hands she was stymied she needed further information but was paralyzed by having to wait for the charts to come over from the manhattan general through the usual channels there was no way she could speed up the system other than that she had to wait for peter to work his magic with the gas chromatography and mass spectrograph short of getting yet another similar case the following day which she was not wishing for there was nothing to be done i have to assume your meeting with calvin was not as auspicious as you hoped riva said laurie didnt respond she was feeling even more temperamental than earlier from when she was a little girl shed always sought approval from authority figures and when she didnt get it she felt terrible calvins reaction was a case in point making her feel that all the disparate segments of her life were unraveling first was the situation with jack next her mother and the brcal problem and now it seemed that even her job was in disarray on top of it all she felt physically exhausted from insufficient sleep two nights in a row laurie sighed she had to pull herself together thinking about the brcal problem reminded her that she had agreed with jack to have herself tested for the marker by calling her old college roommate sue passero at the time laurie had not been completely forthright since she actually hadnt entirely decided to do it so her acquiescence was more to assuage his unexpected insistence than a real decision yet suddenly she saw the idea in a new light since getting away from the ocme even for just a couple of hours sounded like a good idea the thought also occurred to her that she could kill two birds with one stone knowing sue as well as she did laurie was confident that while getting tested she could pass along her concerns about the possibility of a serial killer that would give the hospital a reason to be vigilant without the need to cite herself or the ocme as the source laurie got out her address book for sues office number and made the call they had been close in college and in medical school and having ended up practicing in the same city they got together every month or so for a dinner they always vowed to see each other more often but somehow it never happened laurie got one of the clinic secretaries where sue worked and asked for sue lauries intention was just to leave a message for sue to call back at a convenient time but when the secretary asked who was calling and laurie said dr montgomery the secretary went off the line before laurie could explain the next thing she knew she was talking with her friend this is a nice surprise sue said cheerfully whats up do you have a minute to talk a minute whats on your mind laurie said she needed to be tested for brca for reasons that she would explain later she also mentioned that she had been switched to americare but had not yet made arrangements for a primarycare doctor no problem come over anytime i can set you up with a script and send you down to the lab how about today today is fine come on over have you had lunch i havent laurie smiled it was going to be three birds with one stone well get your rear end over here girl the cafeteria food is not something to write home about but the company will be good laurie hung up and got her coat from behind the door i think you are doing the right thing about being tested riva said thank you laurie responded she looked at her desk to be sure she wasnt forgetting something i hope youre not cross with me riva said of course not laurie responded she gave rivas shoulder a reassuring squeeze as i said earlier i know im oversensitive these days and everything is bothering me more than it should be that as it may and i know youre not my secretary but id appreciate it if you would once again take messages especially from maureen or peter ill make it up to you dont be silly ill be happy to answer your phone are you going to be back this afternoon absolutely its going to be a quick lunch and a simple blood test although i might stop and say hello to my mother as well anyway ill have my cell if you need to call riva waved and went back to her work laurie walked out the ocme entrance on first avenue there was a bite to the air the temperature had dropped as the day progressed so it was colder than when shed walked to work that morning as she descended the front steps toward the curb she got her zipper started and pulled it up to her chin standing on the curb she was shivering slightly as she raised her hand to hail a cab the ride to manhattan general was a little longer than the ride shed taken the previous day to university hospital both institutions were on the upper east side and approximately equal distance to the north from ocme but the general was farther west sprawled along central park it took up more than an entire city block with several pedestrian walkways spanning the surrounding streets to connect with outlying buildings the complex had been constructed of gray stone in fits and starts during the course of almost a century so the various wings were of slightly different architectural design the newest wing with the most modern silhouette and named for the benefactor samuel b goldblatt stuck off the back of the main structure at right angles it was the vip wing the equivalent of where lauries mother had been roomed over at the university hospital having been to the manhattan general on a number of occasions including visiting sue laurie knew where she was going which was helpful since the hospital was always mobbed she headed directly to the kaufman outpatient building once inside she walked down to the internal medicine section and inquired after her friend at the main checkin desk when laurie mentioned her own name the secretary handed her an envelope inside was a completed script for a screen for the brca marker as well as a note from sue the note told her where the genetics lab was located in the central building on the second floor there were also instructions for laurie to go first to admitting as a new americare subscriber she had to get a hospital card the final line in the note said that laurie should go directly to the cafeteria when she was finished and that sue would meet her there obtaining the hospital card took more time than the blood test she had to wait in line to see one of the customerservice representatives still it took only fifteen minutes and she was soon on her way up to the laboratory on the second floor sues directions were clear and laurie found the genetics diagnostics lab without difficulty inside it was surprisingly serene in comparison to the rest of the hospital canned classical music issued from wall speakers framed prints of monets water lilies from the museum of modern art lined the walls no patients were in the waiting room when laurie handed over sues script to the receptionist it was apparent that walkin genetic testing was in its infancy but laurie knew it would soon be changing and with it medicine in general sitting in the waiting area laurie was again forced to confront the reality of what might be lurking deep within the core of her being it was a disturbing revelation to think she was possibly carrying an instrument of her own death in the form of a mutated gene it was a kind of unconscious suicide or builtin selfdestructive device which was certainly the reason shed been actively avoiding thinking about it would she be positive or negative she didnt know and being in the hospital made her feel like a gambler something she was never comfortable with had jack not insisted she most likely would have put off doing the test indefinitely but now that she was there she would have the blood drawn and then she would forget about it a trait laurie shared with her mother after the blood was drawn a deceptively simple procedure laurie returned to the first floor and waited in line at the main information desk she had no idea where the cafeteria was located in the extensive complex when it was her turn the pinksmocked volunteer asked laurie if she wanted the main cafeteria or the staff cafeteria momentarily indecisive laurie said the staff cafeteria and was given directions the directions were complicated but made easier by the volunteers last suggestionnamely to follow a purple line on the floor after a fiveminute walk laurie found herself in the staff cafeteria since it was quarter past twelve the place was bustling laurie had no idea the staff of the manhattan general was as large as it was especially considering that the crowd represented only a portion of one shift out of three laurie looked around at the teeming faces both sitting at tables and waiting in the steamtable line the babble of reverberating conversation reminded her of the noise of a wetland sanctuary on a late summer night with such a crowd laurie couldnt help but be immediately pessimistic about hooking up with sue the plan smacked of trying to meet a friend in times square on new years eve just when laurie was about to head over to the cashiers to ask for a house phone to page her friend a hand tapped her on the shoulder to lauries delight it was sue who enveloped her in a big hug sue was a bigboned athletic woman of color who had excelled at college soccer and softball laurie felt tiny in her embrace as usual sue looked fetching in contrast to most of her colleagues she was dressed in a stylish and flattering silk dress overlaid with a highly starched white coat similar to laurie she liked to indulge her feminine side with her attire i hope you didnt bring your appetite sue teased while gesturing toward the steamtable line but joking aside the foods not that bad as they descended the steamtable line and chose their food they maintained a superficial banter about their respective professional roles while waiting in the cashiers line laurie asked about sues two children sue had gotten married just after medical school and had a boy fifteen and a girl twelve laurie couldnt help but be jealous except for the agony of adolescence everything is hunkydory sue said what about you and jack any light at the end of the tunnel seems to me youve got to get a move on girl i happen to know you are sneaking up to the big fortythree in a few days since im close behind laurie felt her face flush along with a twinge of irritation that she was incapable of hiding anything she could tell that sue had caught the reaction and since she and sue had been friends for al most twentysix years she had confided in her about her desire for children and the situation with jack particularly over the last two years laurie was not going to be able to get away with platitudes jack and i are history laurie said deciding to be more forthright than she actually felt at least intimacywise oh no whats wrong with that boy laurie wrinkled her forehead and shrugged to say she had no idea she didnt want to get into a long drawnout emotional conversation in her current state well you know something good riddance youve been more than patient with that indecisive nincompoop you should get a medal because he aint going to change laurie nodded and had to restrain herself from defending jack even though what sue was saying was true sue wouldnt let laurie pay for her lunch and insisted on putting the charges on her house account with their trays in hand they managed to get a table for two by the window the view was of an inner courtyard with an empty fountain in the summer it was lush with flowers water gushing from the fountains multiple tiers they talked casually for a few more minutes about the situation with jack with sue doing most of the talking she then insisted that she would find someone more suitable for laurie and laurie teased her by daring her to try the conversation then switched to why laurie had to have the brca screen laurie told the story about her mother and the fact that as usual her mother had hidden the information from her sues only comment was that she would arrange an appointment for laurie with a topnotch oncologist if the test came back positive what about a primarycare physician sue asked after a short pause now that you are officially a subscriber youre going to need one how about you laurie suggested are you taking new patients id be honored sue replied but are you sure you would be comfortable with me as your doc absolutely laurie said ill also have to switch my gyno i can help you with that as well sue said weve got some terrific people on staff including the woman i use my myself shes quick gentle and knows her stuff sounds like a good recommendation but theres no rush im not due for a yearly checkup for another six months that might be true but i think we should get it in the works the woman im thinking of is awfully popular for all i know she has a sixmonth wait for a first appointment shes that good then by all means laurie said for a few minutes they both concentrated on eating it was laurie who broke the silence theres something else important that i wanted to talk to you about oh sue commented she put down her teacup fire away i wanted to talk to you about sads sues face screwed up into an expression of complete confusion what the hell is sads laurie laughed i just made it up this second youve heard of sids sudden infant death syndrome of course who hasnt well ive coined sads for sudden adult death syndrome which is a good name for a problem thats been occurring over here at the manhattan general oh sue questioned i think youd better explain laurie leaned forward before i do i have to say that it has to be in strictest confidence that the information im about to tell you came from me i had suggested to our deputy chief that some one over here at the manhattan general should be warned but he blew his top contending that it was all mere speculation with no proof and as such might hurt the hospitals reputation yet i feel like the researcher caught in the bind of conducting a doubleblind study on a lifesaving procedure which has quickly suggested its worth even though id be destroying the integrity of the study which might keep the fda from approving the treatment ive got to leak the results so the people getting the placebo can be saved laurie leaned back and laughed at herself wow am i getting melodramatic or what but it is true that i have no specific proof concerning what im about to tell you mainly because i havent finished investigating the cases i dont even have copies of their hospital charts yet i just feel it strongly and someone has to know sooner rather than later anyway this kind of medical politics drives me up the wall its the one bad thing about my job now youve got my curiosity up way up come on spill the beans leaning forward again and lowering her voice laurie proceeded to tell the story in the chronology it had unfolded by starting with mcgillan then adding the two cases posted by kevin and george and ending with her case that morning she talked about the ventricular fibrillation and the fact that the autopsies had been completely clean she then told sue that she felt that with no pathology on gross or microscopically the chances of four cases happening by chance was about the same as the sun not coming up the following morning what exactly are you saying sue questioned dubiously well laurie said with hesitation knowing sue as well as she did she was aware that what she was about to say was the figurative equivalent of slapping her friend in the face although i suppose there is still a minuscule chance the cause of these deaths was accidental in the form of a late anesthetic complication or maybe an unexpected side effect of a drug i sincerely doubt it and when i say minuscule i mean infinitesimally small because our toxicology screens have so far been negative anyway the bottom line is this im concerned about the possibility that these deaths are homicides for a few minutes neither laurie nor sue said a word laurie was content to let the information sink into sues brain she knew sue was enormously quickwitted and patriotic about the manhattan general shed done all her residency training within its walls sue eventually cleared her throat it was obvious that what laurie had said had troubled her greatly let me get this straight you think we have some kind of a grim reaper wandering around our wards at night in a way yes at least thats my worry before you dismiss the idea out of hand just call to mind those cases in the news over the last couple of years where deranged healthcare workers were dispatching patients under their care you remember them dont you of course i remember them sue said seemingly taking offense at the comparison she sat up straighter in her chair but were not out in the boonies here or operating a flybynight nursing home this is a major medical center with layers of oversight and these patients youve been describing werent bedridden or at deaths door laurie shrugged its hard to argue with the facts that we have namely no explanation for four deaths and as i remember it at least some of the institutions involved in those serialmurder cases were highly regarded the double tragedy is that they went on for so long sue took a deep breath and let her eyes wander around the room blankly sue im not expecting you to do anything about this personally laurie said nor should you feel defensive about the manhattan general i know it is a fine institution and im certainly not trying to sully its reputation what i was hoping is that you would know whom you or i should inform to try to keep it from happening in the future seriously ill be happy to tell this individual exactly what i told you provided my identity can stay out of the picture at least until the ocme officially gets involved sue visibly relaxed she gave a quick mirthless laugh sorry i guess i take any criticism of the place to heart silly me do you know someone like i described someone on a clinical administrative level or what about the head of anesthesia maybe i should talk to him no no no sue repeated for emphasis ronald havermeyer has an ego as big as a tectonic plate with the usual associated volcanic eruptions he should have been a surgeon dont talk to him hed definitely take it personally and want to take revenge on the messenger i know because ive sat with him on several hospital committees what about the hospital president whats his name again charles kelly but hed be as bad as havermeyer and maybe worse hes not even a doctor and he clearly thinks of this whole operation as a business theres no way in hell hed be sensitive to your situation and hed be looking for a scapegoat immediately no it has to be someone with a bit of finesse maybe a member of the mortalitymorbidity committee why do you say that simply because dealing with something like this is their mandate and they meet once a week to keep tabs on what is going on who serves on it i served on it for six months someone from the clinical side serves on a rotating basis the permanent members are the risk management officer the qualitycontrol chief the chief counsel for the hospital the president of the hospital the nursing supervisor and the chief of the medical staff wait a second sue lunged across the table and grasped lauries forearm so quickly that laurie jumped lauries eyes darted around the room as if she expected an imminent physical threat the chief of the medical staff sue repeated with enthusiasm she let go of lauries arm and gestured widely with her hands why didnt i think of him before oh my gosh hes perfect how so laurie questioned having recovered from her momentary fright it was now sues turn to lean forward and lower her voice in a conspiratorial tone hes in his late forties single and hes a doll hes only been here for three or four months all the single nurses are gaga over him and if i werent happily and irrevocably married i would be too hes tall and lean and has this smile that melts ice he does have a rather big snout but you dont even notice it best of all hes got an iq in the stratosphere and a personality to go with it laurie couldnt help but wryly smile he sounds charming but thats not what im looking for i need someone in a position of power who can be discreet its that simple i told you hes the chief of the medical staff what more power can you ask for and as far as being discreet is concerned hes the definition of the word i tell you you have to pry personal information out of him with a crowbar it took me a quarter of an hour at the christmas party just to find out that before coming here hed been with m√©decins sans fronti√®res which took him all over the world i had to bite my tongue when gloria perkins the head nurse in the or butted in and asked him to dance sue i think you are telling me more than you need to i dont need to know the guys history all i want to know is if youre reasonably confident hell listen to what i have to say act on it and leave my name out of it until theres official word from the ocme is that your take i told you hes the picture of discretion and personally i think you two will hit it off famously and all i ask in return is that you name your firstborn after me im joking of course now lets see if hes here sue pushed back her chair stood up and started scanning the crowd aghast at suddenly comprehending sues romantic intentions laurie reached out and tugged insistently on her white coat hold on this is not the time or place to try to fix me up hush girl sue said batting lauries hand away while continuing to search the room you dared me to find somebody suitable and this dude fills the bill now where in tarnation is he hes always here with women around him like hes dressed in flypaper ah there he is and no wonder i couldnt see him hes holding court at the far table without a seconds hesitation and oblivious to lauries appeals to the contrary sue strode off laurie watched her wend her way among the crowded tables almost fifty feet away she tapped a mediumbrownhaired man on the shoulder he stood up and being a head taller than sue laurie guessed he was close to jacks height for a moment sue talked with him utilizing lavish hand gestures capped off with her finger pointing in lauries direction laurie felt herself blush and she looked down at her tray the last time she had experienced this kind of social humiliation was in middle school and although that episode turned out reasonably well she didnt feel confident now the next few minutes crawled by laurie redirected her eyes out the window at the empty fountain wondering if she should flee the next thing she knew sue was tapping her shoulder and calling her name with a sense of resignation laurie turned and found herself looking up into the rugged smiling face of an attractive and vigorousappearing man standing next to her friend he could have been a sailor or someone who had spent a good deal of time in the sun he was carefully groomed dressed in a dark blue suit with a white shirt and colorful tie over his clothes he had on a clean highly starched white coat similar to sues all in all he exuded an urbane refined even elegant aura that stood out markedly from the other mostly frumpy doctors as far as the nose was considered laurie felt it fit in just fine i want you to meet dr roger rousseau sue said her hand gripped his shoulder laurie scrambled to her feet and shook the hand that was extended toward her it was warm and forceful looking into his eyes she was surprised to find them a pale blue after stumbling over saying she was glad to meet him laurie winced internally she felt like she was acting as she had back in middle school during that previous awkward introduction please call me roger the man said warmly and me laurie laurie added regaining her composure she noticed the mans smile that sue had described and found it appealing sue mentioned that you had some confidential information that you were willing to share with me i do laurie said simply i assume she also mentioned it has to stay anonymous a leak could put my job in jeopardy unfortunately ive had some bad experiences in the past i have no problem with your need for secrecy i give you my word he glanced around the busy cafeteria this isnt the best place for a confidential conversation may i invite you up to my modest but at least private office we wont have to shout and we surely wont be overheard that would be fine laurie said she glanced at sue who winked smirked and waved goodbye all at the same time when laurie started to pick up her tray sue motioned for her to leave it saying shed take care of it laurie followed roger as he threaded his way out through the cafeteria entrance which was now even more crowded than when laurie first arrived just beyond the throng roger stopped and waited for laurie to catch up its only one flight up i usually take the stairs do you mind heavens no laurie said she was surprised hed even thought to ask sue told me you were part of the m√©decins sans fronti√®res laurie said as they climbed i was indeed roger said for about twenty years im impressed laurie said knowing something of the good works carried out by the organization for which it had received a nobel prize out of the corner of her eye she noticed that roger was taking the stairs by twos how did you happen to join that organization when i finished my residency in infectious diseases in the mideighties i was looking for some adventure i was also an idealistic farleft liberal who wanted to change the world it seemed like a good fit did you find adventure most assuredly as well as training in hospital administration but i found some disillusionment as well the need for even the most basic medical care in so much of the world is staggering but dont get me started where were you located the south pacific first then asia and finally africa i made sure i made the rounds laurie remembered her trip to west africa with jack and tried to imagine what it would be like to work there before she could mention her experience roger sprinted ahead and opened the door at the top of the stairs what made you leave the organization laurie asked as they descended the busy main corridor en route to the administration area as roger was a relatively new employee she was impressed by how many people greeted him by name as they passed partly the disillusionment of not being able to change the world and partly because i felt the need to come home and settle down and have a family id always seen myself as a family man but it wasnt going to happen in chad or outer mongolia thats romantic laurie said so love brought you back from the wilds of africa not quite roger said as he held open the door that lead into the carpeted peaceful realm of the administrative offices there was no one here waiting for me im like a migratory bird instinctively flying back to the nesting site where i began as a chick hoping to find a mate he laughed as he waved to the secretaries who were not at lunch so youre from new york laurie commented queens to be exact where did you go to medical school columbia college of physicians and surgeons roger said really what a coincidence so did i what year did you graduate nineteen eightyone i was eightysix did you happen to know a jack stapleton in your class i did he was one of the best basketball players in bard hall do you know him i do laurie said without elaborating she felt strangely uncomfortable like she was cheating on her relationship with jack just by bringing up his name hes a colleague of mine over at the ocme she added lamely they entered rogers office which was as he had said modest it was situated on the inside area of the administration wing and accordingly had no windows instead the walls were covered with framed photos of numerous places around the world where he had worked there was a number of himself with either local dignitaries or patients laurie couldnt help but notice that in all of them roger was smiling as if each photo had recorded a celebratory event it was particularly noticeable since the other people were expressionless or actually frowning please sit down roger suggested he angled a small straightback chair toward the desk after closing the door to the hall roger sat at the desk leaned back and folded his arms now then tell me whats on your mind laurie again emphasized the need to keep her name out of the situation and roger assured her that she had nothing to fear reasonably confident laurie told the story as she had told it to sue this time she used the term serial killer when she was finished she reached over and put a threebyfive index card with the four names directly in front of him roger had been silent throughout lauries monologue staring at her with increasing intensity i cant believe you are telling me this he said finally and i am enormously appreciative of your making this effort my conscience dictated that someone should know laurie explained perhaps after i get copies of the charts or if toxicology comes up with something surprising ill have to eat my words that would be fine and no one would be happier than i but until then im worried something weird is going on the reason im so surprised and appreciative is because i have been the scorned gadfly here like you have been over at the ocme and for the same reasons ive brought up each of these cases at the morbiditymortality meeting in fact the last time was this morning with darlene morgan and every time ive been met with denial even anger particularly from the president himself of course i havent had the added benefit of the autopsy results since we havent gotten them yet none of the cases have been signed out laurie explained whatever roger said these cases had me worried right from the first one mr moskowitz but the president has put a gag order on our even discussing them lest something leak out to the media and put the efficacy of our cpr program in question the oncall docs were unable to get even a rudimentary heartbeat going on any of these cases has there been any investigation of any sort nothing which flies in the face of my strenuous recommendations i mean ive personally looked into it to a degree but my hands are tied the problem is our mortality is very low below twopointtwo percent the president said wed do something when it gets to three percent the usual level of concern the rest of the committee agrees particularly the qualitycontrol person the riskmanagement person and the damn lawyer they are all convinced beyond a shadow of doubt these episodes are merely unfortunate and unavoidable complications in the inherently risky environment of a tertiarycare center in other words they are within statistical predictions but i dont buy it for me theyre sticking their heads in the sand when you looked into it did you find anything at all i didnt the patients have been on different floors with different staff and different doctors but i havent given up good laurie said im glad you are on top of it and im glad to have had a chance to satisfy my conscience she stood up but the second she did she wished she hadnt yet she couldnt sit back down for fear of embarrassing herself the problem was jack in fact lately it seemed that the problem was always jack she had enjoyed talking with this man and the feeling made her uncomfortable well thanks for listening to me she added extending her hand toward roger in an attempt to regain a modicum of control it has been nice meeting you as i mentioned ill be getting copies of the charts and i have our best toxicologist working on it ill let you know if anything comes up id appreciate it roger said shaking her hand but then holding on to it now may i ask a few questions of course laurie said would you mind sitting back down roger asked he let go of lauries hand and gestured toward the chair laurie had just vacated i prefer you sitting so i dont have to worry youll flee out the door somewhat confused by rogers last comment and why he might believe shed want to flee laurie sat back down i have to confess that i have an ulterior motive in being uncharacteristically glib about answering personal questions if you would indulge me id like to ask you a few personal questions since sue made it a point to tell me that you were single and unattached is any or all of that correct laurie immediately felt dampness in the palms of her hands was she unattached being put on the spot by an attractive interesting man who was expecting an answer made her pulse race she didnt know what to say roger leaned forward and dipped his head to try to look laurie in the eyes her eyes had lowered in response to her emotional confusion i apologize if i am upsetting you roger said laurie straightened up took a deep breath and smiled wanly youre not upsetting me she lied i just didnt expect to be asked that kind of question especially on this potentially kamikaze careerwise mission of mine over here to the manhattan general then an answer would be nice roger persisted laurie smiled again mostly at herself she was again acting like a teenager i am single and mostly unattached mostly is an interesting choice for an adverb but ill accept it on face value since we all live in a social web of sorts do you live in the city an embarrassing snapshot of her tiny apartment with its seedy entrance flashed through lauries mind yes i have a flat downtown then to make it sound better than it was she added not too far from gramercy park sounds good how about yourself ive only been back for a little over three months so i wasnt sure where the best place was to live currently in the city i took a years lease on an apartment on the upper west side seventieth street to be exact i like it its close to that new sports la club the museum and lincoln center plus i have the park at my fingertips sounds good laurie said she and jack had frequented restaurants in that area over the last several years my next question is whether youd care to have dinner with me tonight laurie smiled inwardly as the aphorism be careful what you wish for since it may come true occurred to her over the last number of years with jack shed progressively come to realize how much she appreciated decisiveness in her significant other something jack lacked in his personal life roger on the other hand seemed to be the opposite even during this brief encounter she sensed his personality embodied the term it doesnt have to be a late night roger added when laurie hesitated it can be a restaurant of your choosing right around where you live how about on the weekend laurie suggested i happen to be free that could be held out as a bonus if you enjoy yourself tonight roger said zealously taking lauries suggestion as an auspicious response im afraid i must insist on tonight provided of course you are free that gives you an easy out since you can always say you are busy but i hope you dont i have to admit right up front i have not been bowled over by interesting accomplished women in this town and i have had my antennae fully extended laurie was flattered with rogers insistence especially compared to jacks indecisiveness and having been introduced to him by sue laurie felt there was no reason why she shouldnt accept she had been looking for a diversion and this was the healthiest okay she said we have a date great where or would you prefer i pick how about a restaurant in soho called fiamma laurie suggested she wanted to steer clear of any of the places she and jack had frequented even if there was a low probability of running into him ill call and make a reservation at seven sounds good should i pick you up at your apartment lets meet at the restaurant laurie said as a sudden brief image of mrs englers bloodshot eye peering out from behind her door popped into her head she did not want to subject roger to that not at this stage fifteen minutes later laurie walked out of the manhattan general hospital with a definite spring to her step she was both surprised and thrilled at what felt like an adolescent infatuation it was a type of excitement shed not experienced since being in the ninth grade at the langley school for girls she knew from experience that the feelings were premature and that they probably wouldnt stand the test of time but she didnt care she was going to enjoy the euphoria while it lasted she deserved it standing at the curb she looked at her watch with time to spare and with the university hospital in proximity she decided to head over and pay a quick visit to her mother before returning to the ocme eight weeks later jasmine rakoczi was reasonably certain that there were at least two snipers positioned on the rooftop of the gutted building to her right directly ahead was an open space of no more than fifteen feet leading into a building taller than the snipers position her plan was simple dash across the divide dive into the building and then head for the roof at that point she could dispatch the snipers and then move deeper into the ravaged city to accomplish her mission rubbing her hands together in anticipation of her bolt across the open space she made herself as ready as possible her heart was racing and her breathing was rapid and shallow calling on her military basic training she calmed herself took a deep breath and then made the move unfortunately things didnt go as she had planned halfway across the open space and just when she was fully exposed she hesitated as something caught her attention out of the corner of her eye the result was predictable she was shot and having been shot she certainly was not going to be promoted voicing a few choice swear words she had learned in the marines jazz sat back took her hands from the keyboard and vigorously rubbed her face as a standin for a russian conscript in the battle of stalingrad she had been concentrating intently for several hours while playing the computer game call of duty shed been doing fantastic until this current debacle which meant shed have to start over the goal was to complete progressively more difficult missions and be promoted up through the ranks to reach the level of tank commander now it wasnt going to happen at least not tonight letting her hands drop down into her lap she looked over to the side of her computer screen to see what had messed her up it was a small blinking popup window shed set to appear when she got an email imagining that she was going to be even angrier when she found some stupid porn solicitation or a viagra advertisement jazz clicked on it to her delight it was a message from mr bob a shiver of excitement coursed down jazzs spine like a bolt of electricity shed not heard from mr bob for over a month and was beginning to think operation winnow had been terminated over the last week shed become depressed enough to be tempted to use the emergency number mr bob had given her even though he had made it crystal clear that the number was only for emergencies from her end as that was not technically the case shed resisted but as the days had worn on and her discouragement mounted shed begun to warm to the idea after all she was getting to the point where she might have to move on from the manhattan general hospital which was the hospital where mr bob had specifically asked her to become employed the reason jazz was thinking of moving was because her relationship with the nightshift charge nurse susan chapman had deteriorated to the point of ridiculousness as did her relationship with the rest of the shifts nurses for that matter jazz had come to believe the night shift was the place where nursing incompetents hid from the world she had no idea how susan had ever gotten to be in charge of anything much less the surgical floor at the general not only was susan a fat blob but she knew crap and was always bossing jazz around to do this or do that and finding fault with everything jazz did which was easy since the other nurses kept ragging on her about everything especially when shed duck into the back room to put her feet up for a few minutes and read a magazine worst of all susan always assigned the worst cases to jazz as though she was thumbing her nose at her every night letting the other nurses have the easy ones susan even had the nerve to complain to jazz about jazz nosing around in the charts of the cases not assigned to her and to question why jazz frequently went to the obstetrics floor when she was supposed to be at lunch susan said the obstetrics charge nurse had called to complain jazz had bit her tongue at the time and resisted the temptation to ream susan out the way she deserved or better yet to follow her home and use the glock to get rid of her once and for all instead jazz dreamed up an explanation involving her need for continuing education blah blah blah it was all bull but it seemed to work at least temporarily the problem was that jazz needed to go to obstetrics and neurosurgery most every night since it was the only way she could keep up with what was happening in those specialties even though jazz had not had any patients to sanction she had kept up with reporting adverse outcomes which were mostly in obstetrics involving druggies giving birth to screwedup babies un fortunately such reporting was not that challenging or fun and the money was piddling compared to the pay for sanctioning patients holding her breath jazz opened mr bobs email yes she shouted while she punched the air over her head with both hands like a professional cyclist winning a leg on a grand tour event the email was simply the name stephen lewis meaning jazz had another mission suddenly going to work was not going to be the grim experience it had become putting up with susan chapman and the rest of the schmucks wasnt going to be any easier but at least there was a reason beside herself with excitement jazz quickly accessed her offshore bank account for a pleasurable moment she just stared at the balance it was thirtyeight thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour dollars and some odd cents the best part was that by tomorrow it would be five thousand higher for jazz the idea of having money in the bank meant power even if she didnt do anything particular with it she knew she could money gave her options she had never had money in the bank any money that came into her hands went right out for whatever she wanted at the moment in a vain attempt to obscure the reality of her life in middle school and high school that meant drugs as a child jazz had grown up in nearpoverty conditions in a tiny onebedroom apartment in the bronx her father geza rakoczi the only son of a hungarian freedom fighter whod immigrated to the usa in had sired her at age fifteen her mother mariana was the same age and from a large puerto rican family for religious reasons the youths were forced by their respective families to drop out of school and marry jasmine was born in life for jasmine was a struggle from the very beginning both parents shunned the church which they blamed for their plight both became alcoholics as well as drug abusers and fought almost continually when they were sober enough her father worked intermittently at various manual occupations disappeared on occasion for weeks at a time and spent time in jail for various felonies and misdemeanors including domestic violence her mother worked at a series of odd jobs but was constantly fired for absenteeism or poor performance secondary to drunkenness ultimately she became remarkably obese which limited what she could do jasmines life outside the home was no better than within the neighborhood and the schools were caught in a web of gangrelated violence and drugs that reached down into the grammar school even kindergarten teachers spent more time dealing with behavior problems than teaching forced into a precarious and dangerous world where the only consistency was constant change jasmine learned to cope by trial and error every time she came home from school she had no idea what to expect a sibling boy born when she was eight and whom she thought would be her soul mate died of sids at age four months it was the last time she cried as jazz gazed at her nearly fortythousanddollar offshore account balance she remembered the only other time she had thought she had a lot of money it was the year after baby janos died and it had snowed enough to actually accumulate with an old coal shovel jazz had found in the basement of their tenement shed walked around the neighborhood and shoveled walks by five oclock she had amassed a fortune thirteen dollars feeling proud shed returned home with the roll of singles clutched in her hand in retrospect she should have known better but at the time she couldnt help but flaunt her newly acquired wealth as evidence of her worth the result was predictable as jazz now knew geza had snatched the money away saying it was about time she contributed to the family larder actually he used the money to buy cigarettes a slight smile played across jazzs face as she remembered her revenge the only thing her father loved at the time was a yappy mutt the size of a rat with long hair which someone had given him where he was temporarily employed at the time while geza was drinking beer and watching the fights on tv shed taken the dog into the bathroom where the window was always open to help with the smell from the broken toilet she could remember as if it were yesterday the expression on the dogs face as she held it out the window by the scruff of its neck while it tried furiously to regain the sill when she let go it let out a little yelp before plunging four stories down to the concrete below later geza had rudely awakened her to demand if she knew anything about the dogs demise jazz had denied it vehemently but she still got knocked around as did mariana who more truthfully denied knowing how the dog fell from the bathroom window but jazz had felt the beating was worth it even though at the time she was terrified of course she was always terrified when her father hit her which was entirely too often until jazz got big enough to hit back jazz closed her offshore account window and checked the time it was too early to go to work but there was not enough time to go to the gym as far as starting another session with call of duty she was too antsy to sit still instead she decided to head down to the local korean twentyfourhour sundry store to get a few basics she was out of milk and she knew shed want some the following morning when she got back from the hospital pulling on her coat her hand instinctively went into her right pocket to fondle the glock she pulled it out with ease despite its lengthy suppressor and aimed at herself in the small mirror she had on the wall next to the door the hole in the end of the barrel looked like a pupil of a oneeyed maniac jazz chuckled as she lowered the gun and compulsively checked the clip it was full as it always was she rammed it home with a reassuring click then she got her canvas bag that she used for shopping and slung it over her shoulder outside it was fairly mild march was like that in new york one day it could feel like spring but the next could be like the depths of winter jazz walked with her hands thrust into her pockets clutching the glock on one side and her blackberry on the other holding on to her possessions gave her a sense of comfort since it was just after eightthirty in the evening there was a fair number of pedestrians on the sidewalk as well as vehicular traffic on the side street as jazz headed down toward columbus avenue passing her beloved hummer she stopped for a moment to admire its shimmering surface shed used the balmy weather that afternoon as an excuse to wash it continuing on she marveled as she often did how lucky she had been to run into mr bob columbus avenue was even busier with tons of people and lots of buses taxis and cars vying for space the sounds of the diesel engines the beeping horns and the screeching tires could have been overwhelming if jazz had stopped to listen but she was accustomed to the general din the canopy of sky seen between the buildings was a dull gray from the reflected city lights only a few of the brightest stars were visible the store was open to the street with shelving filled with fruits vegetables cut flowers and a wide assortment of other products like the avenue itself the interior was crowded with a line of customers waiting at the only cash register jazz walked around and made her selections which included bread eggs a few powerbars and bottled water in addition to the milk once she had what she wanted and with a touch of exhilarating tenseness she wandered out onto the sidewalk and pretended to examine the fruit when she thought it was the most opportune time with the owner engrossed at the register and his wife in the back getting something jazz merely turned and started for home when she was far enough away to know that she wasnt going to be accosted and forced to come up with some lame excuse for walking away she laughed to herself what fools the proprietors were with multiple entrances into the store it was so easy to leave without paying she wondered why anyone bothered as for herself she couldnt remember the last time she had back in her apartment jazz put away her groceries in the refrigerator and checked the time it was still too early to go to work it was at that moment that she caught sight of her computer screen there against her screens wallpaper was that same pesky blinking window announcing that she had email fearing that the stephen lewiss mission may have been canceled even though such a situation had never happened in the past jazz quickly sat down and clicked on the window her concern ratcheted up a notch when she saw that it was a second message from mr bob with some trepidation she opened the email to her astonishment and delight it was a second name rowena sobczyk yes jazz blurted while shutting her eyes tightly grimacing and balling her hands into tight fists with excitement after getting no names for more than a month receiving two in the same night was unbelievable it had never happened before she was almost faint from holding her breath when she reopened her eyes and looked again at the screen she wanted to make sure she wasnt fantasizing and she wasnt the name was still there boldly standing out against the white background vaguely she wondered what kind of name sobczyk was since the juxtaposition of consonants vaguely reminded her of her own jazz stood up and began peeling off her street clothes as she headed over to her closet it was still too early to go to the hospital but she didnt care she was going anyway she was too keyed up to sit around and do nothing she thought she could at least reconnoiter at the hospital and come up with a general plan of attack she got out her scrubs and pulled them on next came the white coat while she dressed she thought about her offshore account by that time the following evening the balance would be close to fifty thousand dollars once in the hummer jazz actively calmed herself it had been okay to celebrate for a time but now it was time to get serious she understood that dispatching two patients would be more than twice as difficult as dispatching one she briefly thought that perhaps she should do them on successive nights but abandoned the idea if that was the way mr bob wanted it he would have emailed on successive days it was obvious to jazz that she was supposed to sanction them together en route to the hospital jazz didnt even challenge the taxicabs she was intent on keeping herself composed and focused she parked the hummer in its usual location on the second floor and walked into the hospital after stashing her coat in its customary place she descended to the first floor and sauntered into the emergency room she was glad to see that the usual chaos reigned as had been the case on all her previous missions she obtained the two potassium chloride ampoules with no problem whatsoever with one in each side of her white coat she went back to the elevators and rode up to the sixth floor in comparison to the er the surgical floor seemed peaceful but jazz could tell it was busy a glance at the chart rack let her know that every room on the floor was occupied and a glance in the empty utility room meant that all the nurses and nurses aides were out in patients rooms on quiet nights by that time the eveningshift nurses were already gathered in the back room kibitzing and getting ready for report to pass the baton into the hands of the night people the only person in sight was the ward clerk jane attridge who was busy getting a stack of laboratory reports into the right charts jazz looked into the drug room to make sure susan chapman wasnt around yet she always came in early jazz sat down at a monitor and typed in stephen lewis she was pleased to learn that his room was in the goldblatt wing although shed never been there she felt it was auspicious being the fancy vip part of the hospital she knew that there would be less nursing activity than on regular floors which undoubtedly would make things easier for her the only thing she had to check was whether the guy had a privateduty nurse which she doubted because the patient was only thirtythree and all he was in for was a rotator cuff repair with stephen taken care of jazz typed in rowena sobczyks name as soon as she did so a smile spread across her face rowena was right there in room just down the corridor she thought it would be ironic if she were assigned the case which was a distinct possibility and if she were it would make the sanction that much easier one way or the other she felt confident that doing both people was going to be like a turkey shoot youre in awfully early a voice quipped jazzs eyes popped up and a shot of adrenalin coursed through her veins she found herself looking into susan chapmans chubby face with its rounded features demarcated by a slight seborrheic rash in the creases susans expression was more challenging than friendly as she looked over jazzs shoulder at the monitor screen jazz hated the way she wore her hair pulled back in an oldfashioned tight bun jazz couldnt help but think she looked like some kind of nursing anachronism especially with her oldfashioned laceup leathersoled shoes with inchthick heels what may i ask are you doing susan demanded just trying to familiarize myself with our cases jazz managed swallowing her anger at this woman she forced herself to smile it seems like we have a full house susan stared at jazz for what seemed like minutes before speaking we almost always have a full house whats with this rowena sobczyk do you know her never saw her in my life jazz responded her smile lingered but now looked more real since she had recovered from her initial alarm at being discovered accessing rowenas record i was trying to take a peek at all the new patients to get a jump on the night i think looking at the new patients is my job susan said fine and dandy jazz said she blanked out the screen and stood up weve been over this before susan snapped we have a rule in this hospital that protects patient confidentiality im going to have to report you if i find you doing this in the future do i make myself clear looking at records is on a needtoknow basis im going to need to know if im assigned susan breathed out audibly as if exasperated she stared at jazz with her hands on her hips like an irate grammarschool teacher its funny jazz said breaking the silence i would have thought you and the rest of the brass would encourage individual initiative but seeing that you dont ill just take myself down to the coffee shop instead she arched her eyebrows questioningly and waited for a beat for susan to respond when she didnt jazz flashed one more fake smile and headed down toward the elevators as she walked she could feel susans eyes boring into her back she shook her head imperceptively she was learning to detest the woman descending to the first floor in case susan was watching the floor indicator jazz followed the twisting corridors past the closed day clinics and walked into the goldblatt lobby she could have gotten off on the fourth or pediatric floor and headed into the goldblatt wing from there but she was worried that susan was getting too suspicious about her meanderings even on the first floor the goldblatt wing was different in all regards from the rest of the hospital the walls were paneled in mahogany and the corridors were carpeted oil paintings hung beneath their picture lamps the visitors who were disembarking from the elevators and leaving were dressed nattily and the women sparkled with diamonds outside were limousines and valet attendants despite an elaborate security setup at the front entrance no one questioned jazzs arrival from the hospital proper she stood at the elevators waiting for a car with a few other nurses coming on duty she noticed they were dressed like susan chapman in oldfashioned nurses outfits several even wore hats jazz was the only person to get off on the fourth floor like the lobby downstairs it was carpeted and paneled and decorated with fine art a number of departing visitors waited for a down elevator several smiled at jazz and she smiled back it hardly seemed like a hospital her crosstrainers hardly made a sound on the carpet glancing into the patient rooms she could see that they were decorated in an equally refined manner with upholstered furniture and draperies visiting hours were ending and people were saying their goodbyes as she came abreast of room she slowed about fifty feet ahead was the central nurses station a beacon of bright light compared to the subdued illumination of the hall the door to room was ajar jazz glanced up and down the corridor to make sure she went unnoticed stepping into the rooms doorway she had a full view of the interior as she expected there was no privateduty nurse there were also no visitors the patient was a muscular africanamerican man stripped to the waist a large bandage swathed his right shoulder and an iv ran into his left arm he was sitting in the hospital bed with the back cranked up watching a tv suspended from the ceiling over the beds foot jazz could not see the screen but from the sound she could tell it was a sporting event stephens eyes pulled away from the tv and looked over at jazz can i help you he called just checking to make sure everything is okay jazz said which was true she was pleased it was going to be a walk in the park things would be better if the knicks would get their game together stephen said jazz nodded waved to the patient then retreated back to the elevator with her reconnoitering accomplished jazz returned to the first floor and went into the coffee shop she was pleased the first half of the night shift went as expected jazz had been assigned as nurse manager for eleven patients which was one more than the other nurses but she didnt complain she was teamed up with the best nurses aide so things evened out unfortunately she had not been assigned to rowena sobczyk and as busy as jazz was there was no chance to do anything for mr bob until her lunch break which had just started jazz descended in the elevator with the two other nurses and two nurses aides who were sharing the lunch slot but she made sure she lost all of them in the cafeteria she didnt want to get caught up with their chitchat and have trouble getting away instead she wolfed down a sandwich and polished off a pint of skim milk without sitting down she had only thirty minutes and she had a lot to do during the course of the shift jazz had added a couple of syringes to the potassium ampoules in her jacket pockets leaving the cafeteria she ducked into the ladies room a quick check beneath the stalls convinced her that she was alone for added privacy she went into one of the stalls and closed the door taking out the ampoules one at a time she snapped off their tops and carefully filled both syringes with their needle caps back on the syringes were returned to the depths of her jacket pockets back out in the main part of the lavatory jazz quickly rolled the empty ampoules up in a number of paper towels still no one had come in placing the roll on the tile floor she crushed it with the heel of her shoe the glass made a faint popping sound she then tossed the flattened wad of paper and glass into the waste container jazz looked at herself in the mirror she ran her fingers through her fringed hair straightened her jacket and adjusted the stethoscope that was draped around her neck satisfied she started for the door now armed and ready for action it had been as simple as that she was beginning to appreciate the efficiency of doing two cases in the same night it was like an assembly line she took the main elevators up to the fourth floor avoiding the goldblatt lobby lest she arouse the curiosity of the security people the fourth floor was all pediatrics and as she descended the long hallway en route to the goldblatt wing the thought of sick infants in the various rooms brought back an unpleasant memory of little janos jazz had been the one whod found him that fateful morning the poor kid was as stiff as a board and slightly blue lying facedown in his rumpled blanket being a child herself jazz had panicked and desperate for help shed dashed in to where her parents were sleeping to try to wake them but no matter what she did she couldnt raise them from their drunken slumber jazz ended up calling herself and later letting the emts in through the front door a heavy fire door separated the goldblatt wing from the hospital proper it was as if it was rarely opened and after an unsuccessful tug jazz had to put one foot up against the jamb and use her leg muscles to get it to budge stepping over the threshold she was again reminded of how different the goldblatt decor was what particularly caught jazzs attention was the lighting instead of the usual institutional fluorescents there were incandescent sconces and picture lights which had been dimmed since jazzs earlier visit she put her shoulder against the fire door just to be a hundred percent sure it would reopen for her retreat it moved with significantly less effort than it had the first time jazz set off down the corridor at a deliberate pace shed learned from experience not to be hesitant since such behavior invited attention she knew where she was going and she acted like it despite a long vista down the hallway she saw no one not even at the distant nurses station as she passed patient rooms she heard the occasional beep of a monitor and even caught a glimpse of a nurse bending over a patient as jazz neared her objective she began to feel the same excitement shed experienced in combat in kuwait in it was a sensation that only soldiers whod been in war could understand sometimes there was a flicker of it when she was playing call of duty but not with the intensity of the real thing for her it was a little like speed but better and without the hangover jazz smiled inwardly getting paid for what she was doing made it even more of a pleasure she came to room and didnt hesitate she walked right in stephen was still propped up in bed but fast asleep the tv was off the room was relatively dark with the only illumination coming from a combination of a dim nightlight and a vanity light in the bathroom the bathroom door was open just a crack causing a stripe of light to fall across the foot of the bed and along the floor like a narrow line of fluorescent paint the iv was still in place jazz checked her watch it was threefourteen quickly but silently she moved over to the bedside and opened up the iv within the millipore chamber the drops became a steady stream she bent over and looked at the iv site where the needle went into stephens arm there was no swelling the iv was running just fine back at the door to the hall jazz leaned out and looked up and down the corridor for one last check still no one was in sight all was calm returning to the bedside she pushed the sleeves of her jacket up above her elbows to get them out of the way she then pulled out one of her full syringes and took the needle cap off with her teeth while holding the iv port in her left hand despite her excitement she steadied herself before inserting the needle straightening up she listened she heard nothing with a strong steady push jazz emptied the syringe into the iv port as she did so she saw the level of fluid in the millipore chamber rise which she expected the potassium chloride solution was backing up the iv fluid what she didnt expect was a rather loud groan from stephen followed by his eyes popping open to their fullest extent even more unexpected was stephens right hand lunging across his chest and grabbing jazzs forearm with shocking strength a muffled cry of pain escaped from jazzs mouth as sharp nails dug into her skin dropping the syringe onto the side of the bed jazz desperately tried to break the hold stephen had on her arm but she couldnt at the same time stephens groan melded into a shriek abandoning her attempt to release his grip on her arm jazz slapped her free hand over stephens mouth and leaned her torso into him in a desperate attempt to quiet him it worked although he bucked to try to worm himself free there was a continued brief struggle but stephens strength quickly ebbed as his grip on jazzs arm weakened his fingernails were drawn down her forearm scratching her and causing her to cry out again as quickly as the scuffle started it ended stephens eyes rolled up inside his head and his body went limp his head flopping onto his chest jazz detached herself she was furious you bastard she murmured through clenched teeth she checked her arm several of the scratches were bleeding she felt like punching the guy but she held herself in check since she knew the guy was already dead she snatched up the syringe and then got down on her hands and knees to find the damn needle cap that shed been holding in her teeth and had dropped when shed cried out she quickly gave up instead she merely bent the needle around before putting the empty syringe back in her jacket pocket she couldnt believe what had happened since she had started dispatching patients this was the first one to pull off such a stunt after slowing the iv back to where it was when shed first come in and replacing her stethoscope around her neck jazz quickly went to the door she glanced up and down the corridor thankfully apparently no one had heard stephens cry since the corridor remained as quiet as a morgue she gingerly straightened the sleeve of her jacket over the scratches on her forearm glanced back once more at stephen to make sure she wasnt forgetting anything then stepped out into the hallway wasting no time she retraced her steps back to the fire door once on the other side she leaned her back up against the door she was a bit unnerved by the unexpected complication but she quickly collected herself she reasoned that she had to expect problems once in a while despite her planning she then examined her forearm in the better light she had three gouges on the volar surface of her forearm from stephens nails with trailing linear scratches about three inches long extending down toward her wrist two of them were oozing blood she shook her head thinking that stephen certainly had it coming to him jazz warily replaced her sleeve and checked her watch it was threetwenty and she had one more sanction to accomplish she knew it was an opportune time because the nurse assigned to rowena was on break with her and wouldnt be back for another ten minutes but she couldnt dillydally walking rapidly jazz returned to the main elevators and went back up to her floor there was only one person at the nurses station it was charlotte baker a pixieish nurses aide she was busy writing nurses notes jazz glanced in the utility room and the drug room the dutch door of which was open on the top both were empty wheres our fearless leader jazz questioned she looked down the corridor in both directions she didnt see anyone i believe ms chapman is down in room helping with a catheterization charlotte said without looking up but im not entirely sure ive been holding down the fort here for fifteen minutes or so jazz nodded and looked down toward that room was situated in the opposite direction from rowenas room sensing that the time would not get any better she pushed away from the counter that overlooked the nurses station made sure charlotte was not paying her any attention and headed toward once again her pulse quickened as she anticipated action only this time the thrill was tinged with anxiety after her experience with stephen lewis a mild ache from the scratches on her forearm was a reminder that she couldnt control all the variables a patient caught a glimpse of jazz as she hurried past his door and he called out to her but she ignored it checking her watch she figured she had six minutes before anyone was scheduled to return from their lunch break including the nurse assigned to rowena but since no one was ever early she had a bit of a buffer six minutes was plenty of time the stage was similar to what shed found in stephens room but without the carpet fancy drapes upholstered furniture and fine art and the only light was a nightlight the bathroom door was ajar but the lights were off rowena sobczyk was asleep in the bed with both feet bandaged from a bilateral hallux valgus repair she was on her back and snoring slightly jazz looked down at the woman although she was twentysix she appeared much younger with tiny features and a mop of dark unruly hair splayed out against the white pillow jazz opened the iv to run freely then bent over to check for any swelling there was none so all was set she pulled out the full syringe and holding it in her right hand lifted the iv port with her left just as shed done in stephens room she used her teeth to remove the needle cap immediately she inserted the needle into the port and then repositioned her hand with her thumb over the syringes plunger after taking a breath and holding it she smoothly depressed the plunger rowena stirred writhing her upper body jazz removed the syringe and as she did so she heard footsteps out in the hall on the composite flooring her intuition immediately flashed a warning as the sound of the footfalls made her think of susans clodhopper nursing shoes she glanced briefly at the halfopen door to the hall then back at rowena who was now clutching at her arm with the iv and making gurgling noises in a panic jazz dropped both the syringe and the needle cap into her pocket and backed up from the patient for a second she thought about hiding in the bathroom in case susan heard the noises but then discarded the idea as it might make a bad situation worse instead she started for the door thinking the best defense was offense confirming her worst fears jazz literally ran into susan coming into the room just after susan had stepped over the threshold susan took a step back acting indignant and looking up at jazz with the same challenging expression she had had earlier charlotte said youd come down here what the hell are you doing this is junes patient i was passing in the hall and she called out susan bent around jazz who was trying to fill the doorway and squinted into the halflight of the room what was the matter i guess she was dreaming she looks like she is moving around and the iv is running full tilt really jazz questioned susan pushed by forcing jazz to step aside susan slowed down the iv as she bent over rowena my god she said then turning to jazz she shouted hit the lights weve got a code here jazz did as she was told while susan sounded the alarm susan then directed jazz to help get the oppositeside bed rails down seconds later the code was announced over the hospital pa system shes got a thready pulse or she did susan barked she had her fingers pressed into rowenas neck to feel her carotid artery she let go and climbed up to kneel on the bed weve got to start cpr you breathe and ill do the compressions with great reluctance jazz pinched rowenas nostrils shut and placed her mouth over rowenas she blew in and inflated the lungs there was little resistance suggesting to her that the patient was essentially flaccid she was the only one who knew that at this stage trying to resuscitate rowena was a joke charlotte and another nurse named harriet arrived and managed to get an ekg hooked up and going susan was continuing the compressions and jazz for appearances sake continued with the breathing we have some electrical activity harriet said but it looks like strange complexes to me at that point the resident cardiopulmonary resuscitation team arrived and quickly took over jazz was pushed to the side as rowena was expertly intubated and started on pure oxygen drug orders were barked out and the drugs were given arterial blood was drawn and sent off to the lab for a stat report on blood gases the strange complexes as noted by harriet at the outset had quickly disappeared the ekg traced a straight line and the residents began to lose their enthusiasm rowena wasnt responding to anything while the resuscitation was still technically going on jazz walked out of the room she went back to the nurses station and stepped into the utility room she sat down and cradled her head in her hands she needed a few minutes to pull herself together she had been unnerved by what happened with stephen lewis and then having something untoward happen with rowena seemed like too much jazz couldnt believe it shed never had any problem whatsoever on all her previous cases she couldnt help but wonder if she would be spooked on her next mission out of the corner of her eye she saw susan appear out at the nurses station jazz couldnt hear but assumed susan had asked the aide manning the desk where jazz was because the aide was soon pointing in jazzs direction when susan started toward the utility room jazz knew that she was about to weather another confrontation susan came in and closed the door she didnt talk even after she sat down she just stared at jazz are they still trying to resuscitate the patient jazz asked discomforted by the silence jazz wanted to get it over with if they were going to have an argument yes susan said simply before another pause jazz felt it was like some kind of weird staring contest so she decided to wait it out finally susan said i want to ask you again why you were in sobczyks room you say the patient called out what exactly did the patient say i dont remember if it was any words i just heard her okay so i went in to check did you talk with her no she was asleep so i just turned around and came out so you didnt see that the iv was wide open thats correct i didnt look at the iv did she seem all right to you of course thats why i was coming out when we bumped into each other what are those scratches on your arm the way jazz was sitting with her elbows on the builtin desk her sleeve had fallen just enough to reveal the three scratches and a bit of dried blood oh these jazz questioned she took her arms off the desk and shook her sleeve back down to cover the wounds it happened in my car its nothing theyve been bleeding maybe a little but its no problem really jazz again found herself having the same weird staring contest as if they were in the third grade for almost a minute susan didnt say anything and hardly blinked jazz had had enough she pushed back and stood up well time to get to work she skirted susan and opened the door it strikes me as a strange coincidence you being in that room susan said as she swung around and faced jazz obviously when the patient called out it was the beginning of whatever caused her code it just wasnt apparent when i went in there maybe i should have checked her better than i did but tell me are you trying to make me feel worse than i already do or what no not really susan admitted she looked away well youre doing a pretty good job whether youre trying or not jazz said before walking out to find the nurses aide shed been assigned to work with that night at first jazz felt like she had talked herself out of a potentially problematic situation with susan but as the rest of the shift wore on she got progressively paranoid it seemed like every time she turned around susan was staring at her by the time report rolled around and the morningshift nurses were hearing about the evening including the code on rowena sobczyk the problem had advanced to a point of ridiculousness with susans behavior there was no question in jazzs mind that she was suspicious all jazz could think about was mr bob telling her that there could be no ripples as far as jazz was concerned this situation with susan wasnt threatening ripplesit was portending a tidal wave jazzs biggest fear was that susan would take off after report and go directly to blab her suspicions to the nursing supervisor clarice hamilton an enormous africanamerican woman who jazz thought was as big a dud as susan if that happened all hell would probably break loose and jazz would surely have to use the emergency number to call mr bob yet what mr bob could do at that point was fairly limited the moment report was over jazz remained where she was and pretended to be doing a bit more chart work susan spent another five minutes debriefing the day charge nurse about specific problems as close as jazz was she could hear most of the conversation luckily susan didnt say anything about jazz when that was over susan got her coat and laughing and carrying on with june she went down to the elevators that was when jazz got her own coat she also grabbed a pair of latex gloves from a box on the utilityroom desk next to the door at that time in the morning with the shift changing the elevator area was crowded jazz made sure she stayed in the periphery as far from susan and june as possible when the car came she wormed her way to the very back she could tell where susan was by her ridiculous bun when the elevator stopped on the second floor jazz pushed her way to the front and disembarked along with a half dozen other people including susan jazz knew that susan like herself drove to work like a clutch of cackling hens the group walked down to the door that opened onto the connecting bridge that crossed over to the parking garage jazz hung back to bring up the rear as she walked she pulled on the latex gloves once in the garage the group splintered off to their respective vehicles at that point jazz upped her pace she had her hands in her pockets with her right hand gripping the glock she closed the distance between herself and susan so that when susan slipped in along the drivers side of her ford explorer jazz was doing the same on the passenger side the second jazz heard the unlocking mechanism activate she opened the passengerside door and slipped into the front seat jazz had timed it perfectly it was almost as if shed been sitting there when susan climbed in under different circumstances susans shocked expression would have been hilarious the trouble was jazz wasnt finding any of this funny what the hell susan questioned i thought maybe we could talk in private and mend fences jazz said she had both hands in her pockets with her shoulders scrunched up and her arms straight i dont have anything to talk to you about susan snapped she put her key in the ignition and started the engine now get out of my car im going home i think we have plenty to talk about youve been giving me the evil eye all night i want to know why well you are an odd duck jazz laughed with derision thats funny coming from you thats the kind of comment that underlines my impressions susan spat to be honest ive never felt confident in you i dont know why you are a nurse you dont get along with anyone you have no compassion every night i have to give you the easiest cases oh bull jazz sputtered you give me all the junk cases for a second susan stared at jazz just the way she had been doing all evening im not going to argue with you in fact if you dont get out of my car im going to go get security and let them deal with you you still havent told me why you have been gawking at me i want to know if it has anything to do with rowena sobczyk of course it has something to do with rowena sobczyk its too much of a coincidence with you coming out of her room when she wasnt your patient and i happen to remember you were seen coming out of sean mcgillins room and he wasnt your patient either but talking to you about all this is not my job its the nursing supervisors job so youll be talking with her im sure oh yeah jazz sneered i dont think you should be so sure you freaking loser with a little effort jazz got the glock out of her pocket susan saw the gun coming and was only able to raise her right hand when jazz shot her twice in the side of the chest susan slumped laterally against the door with her cheek pressed up against the glass despite the suppressor the noise within the car was more than jazz expected so was the smell of the cordite with her free hand she fanned the fumes twisting around she looked out the back of the suv multiple cars were coming into the garage but all were going by and up the ramp since all the secondtier slots were taken a few cars were going out with all the noise and commotion jazz was confident that no one would have heard the double thump of the glock jazz worked the gun back into her pocket reaching over she grabbed susan by her bun and righted her letting her head fall against her chest but keeping her upright what a loser she thought as she positioned the womans lifeless arms to rest on the steering wheel and losers deserve to lose she switched off the cars ignition next jazz opened susans purse and rifled through it to find her wallet opening the wallet she took out the cash and the credit cards then she tossed the wallet and the cards on the floor hoping for the appearance of a fatal mugging twisting around again jazz looked through the back window at the door to the connecting bridge as she did so a group of nurses emerged and waved to each other as they split up to go to their respective vehicles jazz hunkered down until they were out of sight sitting back up she eyed her hummer it was only two cars away after a quick check to make sure the coast was clear jazz got out of susans vehicle and away from it by going around the front of the immediately adjacent car inside her own suv she stripped off the latex gloves and pocketed them she started the engine backed out and headed for the exit as she passed behind susans car she glanced inside it looked as though susan was taking a catnap after a hard night it was perfect out in the morning traffic jazz allowed herself to take a deep breath she hadnt realized how tense shed been it had been a hard night but she was confident shed handled it well she was ten thousand dollars richer and shed managed to eliminate a potential problem operation winnow was alive and kicking life was good nine lauries ancient windup alarm jangled in the mornings halflight and she reached out to turn it off without even opening her eyes as she settled back into the warmth of her bed she shivered not from cold but from nausea her eyes blinked open shed experienced a touch of nausea the previous morning as well but she had ascribed it to the scallops shed had the night before with roger she loved scallops but there had been a few times in the past when they had made her feel queasy the following day luckily yesterdays nausea had not lasted by the time she had walked around a bit it had all but disappeared laurie sat up she shivered again after taking a sip of the water she had at her bedside she felt a bit better the problem was that this time she hadnt had scallops for dinner in fact shed had some reasonably bland chicken the memory of the nausea in the back of her mind as she clutched her sheets around her she noticed a new symptom along with the nausea mild right lower quadrant discomfort it wasnt strong enough to call pain using her fingers she gingerly pushed in her abdomen in the general area over the crest of her hip she couldnt tell if it made the discomfort any worse since pushing in her stomach mostly reminded her of her full bladder throwing back the bedcovers she pulled on her robe and slipped her toes into her slippers as she walked into the bathroom she could feel the discomfort more distinctly now it was more like pain but still quite mild as a doctor considering these two symptoms lauries first concern was early appendicitis she knew there were a lot of things that could go wrong in the right lower quadrant and that the diagnosis could be challenging at times but she knew she was jumping the gun it was the kind of hypochondriasis she had indulged when she was a medical student she smiled as she remembered a simple headache in her first year that made her worry that she was coming down with malignant hypertension simply because shed studied the syndrome the night before of course she didnt have malignant hypertension and in a similar fashion her discomfort and nausea were almost completely gone when she got out of the shower laurie wasnt hungry but she forced herself to eat a piece of toast when that went down okay she had some fruit she was convinced that having something in her stomach would help and it did by the time she was ready to leave for the ocme she felt pretty much like her old self she waved to mrs engler when the womans door cracked open this time the blearyeyed harpy actually spoke advising laurie to get her umbrella since it was supposed to rain it was a mild morning and although overcast it wasnt yet raining laurie walked north along first avenue oblivious to the crush of traffic wondering if her nausea could be psychosomatic due to stress what else is new she thought dejectedly since shed never seemed to be able to get her social life to run as smoothly as her professional life lauries whirlwind fiveweek relationship with roger had recently hit an unexpected bump they had been seeing each other two or three times a week as well as every weekend laurie didnt consider the current bump an insurmountable obstacle but it had been jarring to a degree and made her remember that back in the beginning of their acquaintance shed warned herself that adolescent infatuations often did not withstand the test of time the case in point was laurie learning only two nights earlier that roger was married there had been plenty of opportunities for him to have told her this important fact but he had chosen not to for reasons laurie couldnt fathom it was only after laurie had forced herself to ask him directly that hed owned up to the truth he had married a thai woman some ten years ago when he was stationed in thailand and had never gotten a divorce although he was supposedly now seeking one even more upsetting for laurie was that hed had several children the story became somewhat less damning as it unfolded the woman was from a wealthy privileged family to which she had selfishly returned according to roger essentially abducting the children when roger was transferred to africa yet his withholding such information set a bad precedent and made laurie wonder if roger was not quite the person she had envisioned it also underscored a growing uneasiness that laurie felt about the speed of the relationship coupled with rogers pressure for physical intimacy on top of everything were her unresolved feelings for jack the night before as she sat in her apartment feeling sorry for herself about the previous nights revelations she had had a miniepiphany for the first time she had acknowledged to herself that she actively and deliberately suppressed issues she didnt want to talk about or even think about shed recognized this trait in her parents particularly her mother from as far back as laurie could remember and her mothers way of dealing with her recent bout with breast cancer was a case in point laurie had always despised the trait yet she had never looked at herself in the mirror as her parents child what made her come to the realization was that rogers marital status hadnt been the surprise she liked to pretend there had been hints but laurie had assiduously kept herself from acknowledging any of them she simply did not want to believe that he was married at the corner of th street laurie waited for the light to cross first avenue as she did so she thought about how her newly acknowledged personality trait applied to her ailing relationship with jack with sudden clairvoyance it seemed rather clear she had wanted to put all the blame on him for being noncommittal about their future and for not bringing up the issue of marriage and children now she realized she had to share some of the blame as she had failed to bring it up herself she also realized that his offer to broach the subject on a regular basis had actually been a concession on his part maybe not a monumental one but a concession nonetheless how she was going to communicate all this to jack she had no idea the last time they had spoken on any kind of personal level had been five weeks earlier as the light changed and she hurried across first avenue and up the front steps of the ocme she thought that having met roger complicated things rather than having problems with one man she now had problems with two although she cared for both of them she knew she loved jack and she found herself longing for his un compromising candor part of the reason shed gone out with roger in the first place was to make jack jealous an adolescent machination worsened by two complications first she hadnt expected to be as attracted to roger as she had become and second she hadnt expected the jealousy ploy to work so well although laurie felt that jack loved her his enduring reluctance to make any commitment convinced her his love was not the same as hers specifically he had never made her feel that he valued their relationship as much as she did she was convinced that he wasnt going to change and that he was incapable of jealousy but now thanks to his current behavior she felt differently the tone of their interactions and conversations had deteriorated over time when she had first moved back to her apartment thered been flippant sarcasm after she started seeing roger it had become nastier and it made laurie feel terrible a month ago when jack had asked her to have dinner with him and she told him she had plans to go to the symphony with roger on the evening in question jack had responded by telling her to have a good life he didnt suggest an alternative date the implication was that he didnt even want to remain her friend waving to marlene the receptionist as she buzzed her into the id room laurie had to smile the whole situation smacked of a soap opera and she told herself to put thoughts of the two men out of her mind clearly changing her behavior or anyone elses was not going to be the easiest thing in the world laurie draped her coat over one of the club chairs in the id room placed her umbrella on top and went directly to the coffee machine it was chets turn to decide which cases needed to be posted and he was hard at work bent over a stack of folders laurie stirred her coffee and checked the time it was still before eight but certainly not as early as she used to get in with jack she noticed that vinnie wasnt there reading his newspaper suggesting that he was already down with jack doing an autopsy the only sounds laurie could hear were the chatter of the operators in the communications room preparing for the day laurie enjoyed the relative solitude knowing that in an hour the place would be humming with activity is jack already downstairs laurie asked taking a sip of her coffee yup chet said without lifting his head then suddenly he looked up when he recognized the voice laurie great i was supposed to give you a message if you came in before eight janice is very eager to talk with you shes been in here twice was it about a recent postoperative patient from the general laurie questioned her eyes lighting up she had asked janice to be sure to let her know if another such case surfaced if it had it would mean that not thinking about the two men in her life would be considerably easier as her four suspicious homicide cases would grow by a hefty twentyfive percent the two cases she had posted mcgillin and morgan she had yet to sign out the other two had been signed out by kevin and george citing the manner of death as natural a conclusion that laurie had opposed no it wasnt a patient from the general chet said with a teasing smile that laurie failed to detect lauries shoulders slumped in disappointment it wasnt one but rather two he reached out and tapped the top of two folders hed put aside he then gave them a gentle push in lauries direction and both obviously need to be posted laurie snatched them up and looked at their names rowena sobczyk and stephen lewis she quickly checked their ages twentysix and thirtytwo respectively are they both from the manhattan general she asked she wanted to be sure chet nodded for laurie it seemed almost too good to be true from the standpoint of a diversion her series would grow to six cases not five that was a fifty percent increase id like to do these two cases she said hastily you got them chet responded without another word laurie grabbed her coat and umbrella with the folders under her arms and balancing her coffee as best she could she quickly headed through communications and the clerical room on her way to the forensic investigators office she was beside herself with curiosity shed had to eat a bit of crow over the course of the previous five weeks as her supposed serialkiller scenario had failed to materialize as a viable possibility and had been dismissed by everyone except roger jack had used the issue to tease her rather sarcastically on several occasions even sue passero had been dismissive after making what she described as multiple discreet inquiries around the hospital luckily calvin had not brought up the issue at all nor had riva the hospital charts on the original four cases had eventually arrived in lauries office and she had completely filled in her matrix but found no smoking gun in fact there was no way the cases were related there were different surgeons mostly different anesthetists a variety of anesthetic agents a significant variation of preoperative and postoperative drugs and differing locations in the hospital worst of all the toxicology results were completely negative despite peter pulling every trick that he could think of with the gas chromatograph and the mass spectroscopy for lauries benefit he had truly gone out of his way to find even the most minute traces of an offending agent and with no agent no one was willing to give the serialkiller idea any credence especially since there had been no more cases after darlene morgan everyone relegated the four cases to the wastebasket of statistical oddities occurring in the inherently dangerous environment of the hospital as laurie popped into the forensic investigators office bart looked up from his desk youre just in time he said and pointed to the rear of the room to make his point janice was in the process of pulling on her coat dr montgomery she said i was afraid i was going to miss you ive run out of steam and my bed is calling she peeled off her coat and after draping it over her desk chair sat down heavily sorry to hold you up laurie said no problem janice said gamely this wont take but a minute are those the lewis and sobczyk folders youve got they are laurie said pulling up a chair janice took the folders opened them and took out her reports handing them back to laurie both these general cases remind me of the other four you were interested in janice said as laurie scanned the writeups janice cupped her tired face in her hands and leaned her elbows on the desk she took a deep breath before continuing in short both were young and healthy both seemed to die of an unexpected cardiac problem both had had minor surgery less than twentyfour hours earlier and both obviously could not be resuscitated they sound remarkably similar laurie agreed she looked up thanks for giving me a headsup was there something in particular you wanted to tell me thats not in your summaries its all there janice said but there is something i want to emphasize although most parameters with the sobczyk woman are the same there is one thing that is different when she was found by the nurses she was in extremis but still alive unfortunately that quickly changed despite strenuous intervention lewis on the other hand had no cardiac or respiratory activity when he was found by nurses aides why do you think thats important just because its different janice said with a shrug i dont know but last time you spoke with me you asked me if i had sensed something intuitively about the darlene morgan case i hadnt but with sobczyk the fact that she was still alive jumped out then im glad you told me laurie said anything else thats it the rest is in the reports needless to say ill like copies of the hospital charts they have already been requested great laurie said im glad you told me this if you think of anything else you know where to find me laurie gathered up her belongings and went out to the back elevator eager to get to work she couldnt remember being this excited in weeks as the elevator rose she thought about what janice had told her she wondered if it would be important dashing into her office laurie hung up her coat and put her umbrella on top of the file cabinet sitting at her desk she opened both folders and again took out janices reports after rereading them more carefully she leaned over opened one of her desk drawers then took out the matrix she had drawn from the original four cases it was attached with a rubber band to the morgan and mcgillin folders along with copies of the pertinent portions of the other two cases undoing the parcel she held the mcgillin folder for a second she hadnt been able to give the definitive word to dr mcgillin about his sons death as she had so confidently promised and it made her feel guilty she hadnt even spoken with the man in weeks even though shed promised to get back to him as she put the folder down with the other she made a mental note to call him she wondered what the man would say if she told him she was entertaining the idea of a serial killer feeling confident in janices assessment laurie went ahead and added lewis and sobczyk to the matrix even though she had yet to do the posts since janice anticipated lauries interest she had done a very complete job on both cases even without the hospital charts laurie could fill in the boxes for the patients ages the times they had been pronounced dead their mds the surgical procedures theyd undergone and where in the hospital theyd had their rooms while laurie was busy doing this riva arrived adding to that matrix of yours riva questioned glancing over lauries shoulder there are two more presumed cases thats going to make six obviously i havent done the posts yet but they sound exactly the same want to change your idea about the manner of death i mean this is going to be a fifty percent increase riva laughed i dont think so especially since the toxicology has been negative and i for one happen to know how hard peter has tried by the way hows your mother i keep forgetting to ask shes doing surprisingly well laurie said of course i dont hear much since shes acting like the whole thing never happened im glad shes doing well riva said give her my best hey how is that new beau of yours youve been uncharacteristically silent about him its going well laurie said vaguely riva was right laurie had not shared much about roger picking up her phone before riva could ask any more questions she called down to the mortuary office she was pleased when marvin answered she told the tech about the two cases and said she wanted to do sobczyk first with his usual alacrity he told laurie hed be waiting for her see you in the pit laurie said to riva as she scooped up sobczyk and lewiss folders as she descended in the elevator she prepared herself mentally for the cases which was easy since she half assumed and half hoped she wasnt going to find much by the time she had changed into scrubs donned her moon suit and pushed into the autopsy room marvin was almost ready on the way to her table she had to pass jacks recognizing laurie jack glanced at the wall clock before straightening up from the opened body of a sizable elderly lady a portion of her gray stringy hair had been shaved to reveal a punchedout depressed fracture of the skull on the top of her head dr montgomery it appears as if you are adopting bankers hours these days let me guess i bet the explanation is that you were out painting the town red with your french boyfriend very funny laurie said she fought against her irritation and the urge to walk on actually you are wrong on both counts i was home last night and roger is as american as you or i thats strange jack said rousseau sounds so french to me wouldnt you agree vinnie yeah but my names italian and it doesnt mean im not american my gosh youre right jack said with false contrition i guess im jumping to conclusions here sorry laurie was embarrassed at jacks behavior and the jealous anger he was doing a bad job of repressing but under the circumstance of being in the autopsy room with vinnie she chose to change the subject she pointed to the elderly womans depressed skull fracture i see you have a rather obvious cause of death here the cause maybe but not the manner jack said such cases are becoming my specialty would you care to explain laurie questioned are you really interested i wouldnt be asking if i werent well the victim was hastily offloaded from a cruise ship in the middle of the night the cruise company claimed an inebriated elderly lady had a fatal fall in the bathroom of her stateroom they reported there was no suspicious behavior and no violence involved but i dont buy it although she might have been drunk tell me why you dont buy it first the punchedout depressed fracture is on the top of the head jack said warming to the conversation thats hard to do if youre falling in a bathroom unless youre a contortionist second of all look at these patterns of bruises on the inside of her upper arms jack pointed to linear groupings of petechiae which laurie could see when she looked closer next notice the tan lines on her wrist and ring finger shed spent some serious time in the sun on the cruise with what looks like quite a rock on her finger and a wristwatch and guess what no ring and no watch in the stateroom i have to hand it to the tour doctor despite the hour he was thinking in high gear they had cleaned up the stateroom and the bathroom but he still asked the right questions so you think it was homicide no question despite the cruise companys comments to the contrary of course ill just be reporting the findings but if anybody asked my opinion id tell them that this woman was viciously knocked on the head with some kind of hammer rudely dragged by her arms into her stateroom while still alive robbed and left to die sounds like a good case to emphasize that deaths among the elderly are in some respects similar to deaths involving child abuse thats exactly right jack said since the elderly are expected to die there is less suspicion of foul play than with a younger person its a good teaching case laurie said trying to put on a good face before moving on to her table although she was leaving the exchange on a reasonable note its overall character was more evidence of how difficult it was going to be to have any kind of serious discussion with jack about their relationship even if he was so inclined but she put the thought out of her mind as she looked down on the body of rowena sobczyk do you suspect anything out of the ordinary on this case marvin asked nope i believe it is going to be straightforward laurie said as her trained eye began the external exam her first impression was that the woman looked considerably younger than the reputed twentysix years she was tiny with delicate almost preadolescent features as well as thick youthfulappearing curly black hair her skin was almost blemishfree and ivorywhite except for areas of dependent lividity both feet were bandaged consistent with her surgery the bandages were clean and dry like with mcgillin and morgan the remnants of the resuscitation attempt were still in place including the endotracheal tube and the iv line laurie checked them carefully before removing them she looked for signs of drug abuse and found none she took off the bandages the surgical incisions showed no signs of inflammation and only minimal drainage the internal portion of the autopsy was the same as the external negative for any obvious pathology in particular the heart and the lungs were entirely normal the only finding was several cracked ribs from the resuscitation attempt as with the other cases laurie made certain that she got more than adequate samples from all the usual places for toxicology screening she was not about to give up hope that peter would succeed with his magic on one of the cases do you want to do the second case right away marvin asked when they had finished sewing the body back together absolutely laurie said to expedite the transition laurie helped as they passed jacks table on the way out and again on the way in laurie made sure she didnt hesitate she didnt want to be embarrassed again by any of his comments if he saw her he did not let on by that time the room was in full operation with lots of people coming and going and in their moon suits everyone looked rather similar thanks to the glare of the overhead lights it was difficult to see through the plastic face masks as soon as they moved stephen lewis onto the table and into position laurie began her external exam meanwhile marvin went to get the specimen bottles and other materials for the case laurie forced herself to follow her usual protocol to avoid missing anything although her expectations were high that stephen lewis would be like the others in the sense of having no significant pathology she wanted to be thorough and her methodical approach paid off almost immediately barely discernable but definitely present was a small amount of crusted blood under the nails of his right index and ring finger if she hadnt specifically looked she would have missed it it was something shed not seen with sobczyk morgan or mcgillin and george and kevin had not described it in the autopsy notes on the other two cases putting lewiss hand back down on the table laurie began a careful search for any scratches on the mans body that might account for the dried blood there were none nor was there any bleeding at the iv site next she removed the bandages covering the right shoulder the surgical incision was closed and showed no signs of inflammation although there was some evidence of postoperative bleeding with a bit of crusted blood along the suture line laurie thought there was a chance this blood could have been the source of the blood under the nails although it seemed strange since it was his right hand when marvin came back laurie asked for a sterile swab and two specimen containers she wanted to do a dna fingerprint on both samples just to make sure they matched the victim when she took the samples she sensed that there was a small amount of tissue as well in the back of her mind was the titillating thought that if her serialkiller idea had any merit and if lewis had had a hint of the killers intentions and if he could have gotten hold of him maybe he could have scratched him that was a lot of ifs but laurie prided herself on being meticulous the rest of the case went quickly laurie and marvin had become accustomed to each other such that they functioned as a wellorchestrated team that required minimum conversation each anticipated the others motions like tango dancers once again there was almost no pathology the only findings were minimal atheroma formation in the abdominal aorta and a benignappearing polyp in the large intestine there was no explanation for the mans sudden death is this your last case marvin asked after taking the needle holder from laurie when she had finished sewing up the body it seems that way laurie said she looked around the room to see if she could make out chet but she couldnt i guess were done someone would have said something to me by now both these cases this morning remind me of those two we did a month or so ago marvin said as he began cleaning up the instruments and collecting the specimen bottles remember those two when we found nothing significant i cant remember their names mcgillin and morgan laurie said certainly i remember and im impressed you do as well considering the number of cases youre involved with i remembered them because of how much they bugged you not finding anything hey do you want to take these specimen samples with you or do you want them to go up with all the rest ill take the toxicology and dna samples laurie said the microscopic can go with the others and thanks for reminding me i must say im appreciating you more and more thats cool marvin responded likewise from my end i wish all the docs were like you now that would be boring laurie said with a laugh as she gathered up the samples she walked past jacks table once again without stopping she could hear him and vinnie laughing over what had probably been some black humor laurie disinfected herself and the sample bottles before emerging into the hallway not wasting any time she got out of her protective gear and plugged her battery into the charger without even changing out of her scrubs she headed for the back elevator she carried the clutch of sample bottles against her chest to keep from dropping them the two folders were under her arm as she rode up to the fourth floor she could feel her pulse in her temples she was excited the posts had confirmed janices assessment laurie was now confident that her series now stood at six getting off on the fourth floor laurie cautiously peered into the toxicology lab in her attempt to avoid the temperamental lab director laurie was reduced to sneaking around luckily he stayed mostly in the general lab on the floor below feeling like a cat with its ears down laurie scurried diagonally across the lab and into peters tiny office she was glad when she didnt hear someone call out her name she was even more glad that peter was at his desk meaning she didnt have to seek him out oh no peter moaned teasingly when he looked up from his work and spotted the samples in lauries arms i know youre not happy to see me laurie said but you are the man i need you more than ever ive just posted two more patients that are the mirror image of the others there are now six i dont know how you can say im the man because so far ive come up with a big blank i havent given up hope so you cant either laurie dumped the samples onto peters desk some of them threatened to roll off peter grabbed several and righted them now that there are six cases the idea of skulduggery goes up peter youve got to find something it has to be there laurie i did everything i could think of with the other four cases i looked for every known agent that affects cardiac rhythm there has to be something you havent thought of laurie insisted well there are a couple of other things okay like what peter made a face and scratched his head i mean this is way out in left field thats okay we need some creativity here what are you thinking about in the back of my mind i remember reading something when i was in graduate school about a poison frog from colombia called phyllobates terribilis laurie rolled her eyes ill say youre getting a bit far afield but its okay what about these frogs well they contain a toxin thats one of the most toxic substances known to man if i remember correctly its capable of causing cardiac arrest sounds interesting have you tested for it not really i mean so little of the toxin is needed like millionths of a gram i dont know whether it would show up with the sensitivity of our machine ill have to find out where to look thats the spirit im sure you are going to find something especially with these two additional cases ill go online and see what i can learn i appreciate it laurie said and keep me posted she picked up the dna samples and started to leave but then she stopped oh by the way there was something slightly different with one of these cases let me check which one it was she opened sobczyks folder and checked the accession number against the sample bottles finding the correct one she held it up then put it directly in front of peter its this one this was the only patient out of the six who apparently had some cardiac and respiratory activity when she was found i dont quite know what to make of that but i thought you should know if it were an unstable toxin maybe it would have the highest concentration of all the cases peter shrugged ill keep it in mind laurie looked out into the lab proper seeing that the coast was clear she waved to peter and quickly dashed out into the hallway she used the stairs on her way up to the sixth floor halfway up she stopped all of a sudden the right lower quadrant abdominal discomfort shed had that morning reappeared once again she used her fingers to press over the area at first it made the discomfort worse reaching the threshold of what she would call pain but then as quickly as it had appeared it vanished laurie felt her forehead to make sure she didnt have a fever convinced she didnt she shrugged and continued on her way the sixth floor housed the dna laboratory in contrast to the rest of the building the dna lab was stateoftheart it was less than a half dozen years old and sparkled with white tiled walls white cabinetry white composite flooring and the newest instrumentation its director ted lynch was a former ivy league football jock he wasnt in calvins league in terms of size but not far behind though he had a personality the opposite of calvins ted was an eventempered friendly individual laurie found him hovering over his beloved sequencer machine laurie gave ted a bit of background on the case and then asked him if hed do a rush screen along with the samples from under lewiss nails she gave him a sample of lewiss tissue yeah yeah yeah ted voiced with a laugh you and jack are quite a pair every time you bring me something its got to be stat like the sky is going to fall if you dont get it why cant you two be more like the rest of the lazy gang hell they hope they dont hear from me because when they do it creates work for them laurie couldnt help but smile she and jack had created a reputation for themselves laurie told ted just to do the best he could she then descended a floor and walked quickly down toward her office she couldnt wait to get to the phone the person to whom she was most excited about giving the news of the two new members of her series was roger sitting at her desk laurie dialed rogers extension at the manhattan general she drummed her fingers as she waited for the call to go through her heart was beating even faster than it had been earlier she knew roger would want to know about the two new cases if he didnt already unfortunately when the line was picked up it was rogers voicemail laurie silently cursed of late it seemed that all she ever got was peoples voicemail never a real person after listening to rogers outgoing message laurie merely said it was she who was calling and to call her back she couldnt help but feel a twinge of disappointment at not getting hold of him right away as she hung up the phone she left her hand on the receiver as she thought about roger being the only person who seemed to share her concern about the possibility of a grim reaper stalking the halls of the manhattan general which was the derogatory way sue passero had referred to her suspicions yet with her new selfhonesty she wondered how sincere his support really was after the marriage revelation she didnt know how much to trust him as laurie thought back over the last five weeks she had to admit that hed been almost too solicitous at times she hated to be cynical but that was the consequence of his dishonesty laurie jumped as the phone rang under her hand and snatched up the receiver in a minipanic im looking for laurie montgomery a pleasant female voice said speaking laurie responded my name is anne dickson im a social worker here at the general and id like to make an appointment with you an appointment laurie questioned can you tell me what case this is about your case of course anne said confused my case im not sure i understand i work here in the genetics lab and i believe you came in a little more than a month ago for a genetic screen im calling to arrange for you to come back in so we can schedule a meeting a complex array of thoughts flashed through lauries mind the brca test was yet another example of her putting unpleasant things out of her mind shed completely forgotten about having given the blood this woman calling her up out of the blue brought back the whole disturbing issue like an avalanche hello are you still there anne questioned im still here laurie said as she tried to organize her thinking i suppose this means the test was positive it means that id like to see you in person anne said evasively its our normal procedure for all our clients id also like to apologize your folder has been on my desk for a week or so but it mistakenly got put in the wrong basket its my fault entirely so id like to see you sooner rather than later laurie felt a wave of impatient irritation she took a deep breath and reminded herself that the social worker was only trying to do her job still laurie would have preferred just to be told the results than suffer some drawnout protocol ive had a cancellation for one oclock today anne continued i was hoping that might work if its not convenient the next opening is a week from today laurie closed her eyes and took another deep breath she wasnt going to allow herself to be in limbo for a week although she expected that the phone call meant the test was positive she wanted to know for certain she looked at her watch it was eleven fortyfive there was no reason she couldnt run over to the general maybe she could have lunch with roger or sue one is fine she said with resignation wonderful anne said my office is in the same suite where you came for the blood to be drawn laurie hung up the phone with her eyes again closed she bent over her desk and ran her fingers roughly through her hair scratching her scalp all the nasty consequences of the brca gene flooded into her consciousness along with a wave of sadness what particularly bothered her was the acknowledgment of the upcoming need to make what she called an end decision a decision that eliminated options such as having children knock knock a voice called out laurie glanced up to find herself looking at the smiling face of detective lieutenant lou soldano he appeared particularly dapper with a clean pressed shirt and a new tie hey laur he said cheerfully laur was a nickname that lous son joey had given laurie back when laurie and lou had briefly dated at that time joey was five now he was seventeen laurie and lou had not had a falling out but rather a mutual understanding that a romantic relationship wasnt appropriate although they continued to have great respect understanding and admiration for each other the passion part didnt work instead of romance a close friendship developed and blossomed over the years whats the matter lou asked laurie had started to talk but instead of saying anything her eyes filled up with tears shed slapped a hand over her forehead pressing in on her temples with her thumb and index finger lou closed the door he pulled rivas chair over and sat down then put his hand on lauries shoulder hey come on tell me whats going on here laurie took her hand away her eyes were still brimming but no tears had spilled out she puffed up her cheeks then smiled weakly sorry she managed sorry what are you talking about theres nothing to be sorry for come on tell me whats cookin but wait i think i know you do laurie questioned she opened one of her desk drawers and took out a tissue to blot her eyes once she had the watery eyes under control she looked back at lou what makes you think you know whats bothering me ive gotten to know you over the years both you and jack i also know you and him are on the outs i mean its not like its a secret laurie started to protest but lou took his hand off her shoulder and held it up to shush her i know its none of my business but it is my business since im crazy for both you guys i know youve been seeing some other doctor but i think you and jack should patch things up you guys were meant for each other laurie had to smile in spite of herself she gazed at lou with loving eyes the man was a dear back when she and jack started to be romantically involved shed been concerned that hed be jealous since the three had become fast friends instead hed been generously supportive right from the beginning now it was lauries turn to put her hand on lous shoulder i appreciate your thoughts she said sincerely if he wanted to think her little bout of emotionalism was due to her relationship with jack that was fine with her the last thing she wanted to do was get into a discussion of the brca problem with lou i know for a fact that your seeing this other guy is driving jack crazy really laurie said well you know something lou im actually surprised about that i didnt think jack would care one way or the other how could you think that lou questioned with an expression of total disbelief did you forget about the way he acted when you almost got engaged to that arms dealer sutherland jack was a basket case i thought that was because both you guys didnt think paul was the right man which he wasnt i didnt think it was jealousy on jacks part mark my words it was jealousy loud and clear well well see what we can do i would like to talk to jack if hell let me let you lou questioned with equal disbelief hey ill box him around the ears if he doesnt i hardly think that would help laurie said with another smile she blew her nose with the tissue she had in her hand but be that as it may to what do i owe this midmorning visit especially as decked out as you are i know you didnt come here solely as jacks advocate thats for damn sure lou said he straightened up in his seat i got a problem and i need some help im all ears the reason im spiffed up is because i had to head out to jersey with michael orourke my captain unfortunately his wifes sister was murdered this morning here in the city and we went out to tell the husband needless to say im under a ton of pressure to come up with a suspect the bodys already downstairs in the cooler what im hoping is that either you or jack could do the case i need a break and between the two of you you always seem to come up with the unexpected gosh im sorry lou i cant do it now if it can wait until later this afternoon im sure i can help what time i dont know for sure i have an appointment over at the manhattan general really lou commented with a wry smile thats where michaels sisterinlaw got mugged right in the parking garage thats terrible was she on the hospital staff yeah for years she was a head nurse who worked nights she got whacked getting into her car on her way home its a crying shame two young kids too ten and eleven was she robbed or raped or both just robbed or so it seems her credit cards were strewn about the car her husband guesses she had less than fifty bucks and for that she loses her life im sorry not as sorry as im going to be unless i make some headway what about jack he wasnt in his office when i went by hes down in the pit or he was when i left about a half hour ago lou stood up and rolled rivas chair over to her desk wait lou laurie said as long as youre here theres something i want to mention to you oh yeah what laurie briefly told lou about her series of six cases she touched on only the highlights but it was enough for lou to pull rivas chair back so he could sit down again so you really think these cases are homicides lou questioned when laurie fell silent laurie chuckled mostly at herself you know im not sure she admitted but you just said you thought someone was doing this to these patients thats homicide i know laurie said the problem is i dont know how much i believe it myself let me explain starting this morning ive been on a selfhonesty gig thats making me rethink a lot of things ive been stressed emotionally over the last month and a half with jack with my mother and other things and i know ive been looking for a diversion this series of mine certainly falls into that category lou nodded in understanding so you think you might be making a mountain out of a molehill laurie shrugged have you run this serialkiller idea by anybody else here at the ocme just about everybody who will listen including calvin and everybody thinks im jumping to conclusions because toxicology cant find anything remotely suspicious like insulin or digitalis which was used in documented healthcare institution serial murders in the past well its not completely accurate to say that everybody has disagreed the doctor ive been seeing socially whose name by the way is roger and who works at the general has supported me but this morning ive found myself questioning his motives but thats another issue entirely anyway thats the whole story about the serialkiller idea youve run it by jack certainly he thinks im off the wall lou stood back up and returned rivas chair well keep me informed after that cornealcocaine conspiracy you ferreted out ten years ago i probably would give your intuition more credit than you that was twelve years ago laurie said lou laughed that just shows to go you that time flies when youre having fun ten hows that jack asked he backed up a step to survey his handiwork okay i suppose lou answered jack had helped lou into a moon suit and connected his battery pack jack could hear the hum of the ventilation fan pulling air through the hepa filter can you feel the breeze some breeze lou commented derisively i dont understand how you can work in this contraption every day for me once a month is too much its not my idea of a good time jack admitted as he began climbing into his own suit when im on call on weekends i sometimes surreptitiously revert to the old mask and gown but every time calvin finds out i get read the riot act they gloved in the anteroom then pushed into the autopsy room proper five of the eight tables were in operation on the fifth lay the naked remains of susan chapman vinnie was busy arranging the specimen bottles you remember detective soldano dont you vinnie yeah sure welcome again lieutenant thanks vinnie lou said as he stopped some six feet from the table are you okay jack asked lou was a relatively frequent autopsy observer so jack was not worried that hed pass out and fall over backward as some visitors did jack had no idea why hed stopped although he did notice the detectives facemask had fogged suggesting he was overbreathing im okay lou murmured its a little hard seeing someone you know rudely stretched out like this waiting to be gutted like a fish you didnt say you knew her jack responded i suppose im exaggerating i didnt actually know her id met her a few times at captain orourkes house well move on in here youre not going to see anything from left field lou took a couple of tentative steps forward looks like she had a thing for krispy kremes jack said surveying the body what did she weigh out as vinnie old boy a hundred and eightythree jack whistled which sounded muffled behind his plastic mask thats a bit much for what id say is about a fivefootthreeframe fivefour vinnie said he went back to the cabinet for syringes i stand corrected jack said okay lou fill me in you railroaded me in here so fast i havent read the investigators report where was she found she was sitting upright in the drivers seat of her suv like she was taking a nap her head was resting down on her chest that was why she wasnt discovered right away a few people had seen her but thought she was sleeping what else can you tell me not much she was apparently shot in the right chest and your impression was that of a robbery certainly looked like it her cash was gone her wallet and credit cards were thrown on the floor and her clothes were intact where were her arms poked through the steering wheel really thats odd how so sounds to me like she was positioned lou shrugged could be if so what do you read into it its just not common with a gardenvariety mugging jack picked up the womans right hand a section of the thenar eminence below the thumb was gone causing a grooved defect the rest of the ball of the thumb and most of the palm was heavily stippled with tiny penetrations part of the first metacarpal bone was visible in the defect my guess this is a defensive wound lou nodded he was still a full step away from the table jack lifted the right arm away from the body within the armpit were two small dark red circles with some adherent fabric fibers the surface within the circles looked like dried chopped meat with a bit of yellow adipose tissue peeking out vinnie came back with the syringes and after dumping them alongside the corpse pointed to the view box on the wall i forgot to tell you i put up the xrays there are two slugs in the chest to match the two entrance wounds how right you are jack said he stepped over to the view box and peered at the films lou came up behind him and looked over his shoulder the two bullets stood out dramatically as two pure white defects in the mottled varying gray field my guess is that one is in the left lung and the others in the heart that confirms the two ninemillimeter shell casings found in the vehicle lou said lets see what else we can find jack said as he returned to the table and recommenced his external exam he was meticulous literally going from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet in the process he pointed out the fine stippling around the entrance wounds whats that mean lou asked hed finally moved close enough to see since this area was clothed it tells me the muzzle of the gun was close maybe only a foot away but not as close as it was to the hand is that significant you tell me it raises the question whether the attacker was sitting in the car when the gun was fired rather than just reaching in yeah so jack shrugged if the attacker was sitting in the car you may want to question if the victim knew the attacker lou nodded good point for the internal portion of the autopsy jack stood on the victims right with vinnie on the left lou stood at the head and bent over when jack pointed out a particular finding the autopsy was routine except when jack traced the bullets trajectories both had penetrated ribs which jack thought probably accounted for the lack of exit wounds one bullet had gone through the aortic arch to lodge in the left lung the other had passed through the right side of the heart to embed itself in the wall of the left ventricle jack retrieved both slugs handling them with extreme care so as not to alter their external markings he dropped them into evidence pouches with custody tags that vinnie had prepared im afraid this is all im going to be able to give you jack said handing the sealed pouches to lou maybe your ballistics people can help out i hope so lou said we got no prints from the scene even from the passengerside door handle there werent even any latents on the wallet other than the victims so we got zilch from the scene on top of that the nighttime attendants didnt see anybody suspicious coming in or hanging around it sounds like its going to be a tough case you got that right leaving vinnie to clean up jack and lou went into the storeroom to get out of the protective suits from there they walked into the locker room to change from scrubs to street clothes once a doctor always a doctor so i hope you dont mind my saying that it looks like youre getting a paunch there lieutenant lous eyes dropped to take in his expanded girth sad isnt it sad and unhealthy jack said youre not doing yourself any favors with that extra weight especially since you havent stopped smoking what do you mean lou questioned as if offended ive stopped smoking a hundred times why the last time was just two days ago how long did that last till i could bum one off my partner about an hour he laughed i know im pathetic but the reason im carrying around all this extra baggage is that i cant find the time to work out with all the homicides in this fair city he pulled on his shirt and buttoned it over his protruding waist youre going to have to be indicted for your own death if you dont change your ways standing alongside jack in front of the mirror lou slipped the loop of his tie over his head he hadnt untied the knot earlier he cinched it up to his neck thrusting out his chin in the process i had a conversation with laurie before i came down here to find you oh jack questioned he paused tying his knit tie and stared at lou in the mirror she was upset about you guys and got all tearyeyed thats curious considering shes having a mad passionate affair with some creep over at the manhattan general his name is roger whatever actually hes not a creep and thats part of the problem in fact he sounds kind of perfect well you can relax about that i definitely didnt get the impression shes so wild about the guy she even said she wants to talk to you about patching things up hal jack grunted in disbelief he went back to tying his tie knowing that he was putting words into lauries mouth and feeling a little guilty about it lou avoided eye contact with jack while he got his jacket out of the locker and slipped it on he justified his machinations as a friend helping friends he used his fingers to comb back his closely cropped hair jacks eyes followed lou until lou finally looked at him jack then said i find it hard to believe she wants to talk about patching things up when a couple of weeks ago she wouldnt give me the time of day outside of talking about cases here at the morgue i tried to get together with her a number of nights in a row she blew me off each time saying she was busy going to the symphony or to the museum or the ballet or some other disgustingly cultural event i mean she was booked up solid and never suggested an alternate date like lou jack used his fingers to sweep his caesarstyle hair off his forehead with rapid irritated strokes maybe you should try again lou suggested he sensed that he should tread rather softly as i told her you guys are meant for each other ill think about it jack said evasively im not big on selfhumiliation these days she also mentioned her confusion about a series of suspicious deaths over at the manhattan general it almost sounded like she was trying to talk herself into them being homicides she said shed talked to you about it whats your take she said you thought in her words she was off the wall thats a bit strong i just think shes gotten a little ahead of herself with those four cases six she got two more today no kidding thats what she said she also admitted she might be using the serialkiller idea as a diversion she said that specifically i mean she actually used the word diversion scouts honor jack shook his head with surprise id say that was a reasonable assessment considering toxicology has drawn a complete blank id also have to say it was impressively selfaware with the march sun still making its diurnal transit in the southern sky a shaft of midday sunlight that had suddenly knifed through the rapidly moving cloudcover penetrated into the manhattan generals southerly oriented cafeteria window it was like a laser beam and laurie had to lift her hand to shield her eyes from its sudden intensity dr susan passero who was sitting across from her with her back to the window became a featureless silhouette against the glare keeping her hand over her forehead laurie dropped her eyes to her tray in front of her she had hardly touched her food although her selections sounded appetizing when she got them once she sat down she realized she wasnt hungry at all having no appetite was not usual for laurie she attributed it to the stress she felt about her upcoming meeting with the social worker and the inevitable news she was about to get in some ways she felt humiliated about being forced to see a mentalhealth professional when laurie had arrived at the hospital forty minutes earlier shed first gone to rogers office but he still wasnt available one of the secretaries had told her he was closeted with the hospital president laurie had then gone to seek out sue who was graciously willing to join her for lunch on short notice getting a call from one of the genetics lab social workers doesnt necessarily mean your test was positive sue said oh come on laurie complained i just wish the woman would have told me actually by law they are not supposed to tell you over the phone sue said with the new health information privacy act phone reporting is frowned upon laboratory personnel can never be sure exactly with whom they are speaking they could inadvertently give the information to the wrong person which is what the new hipa is supposed to prevent why havent they sent you my results laurie asked youre my official primarycare physician i wasnt technically when the test was ordered but youre right i should have heard at the same time im not surprised the walkin genetics lab is just getting their act together to tell you the truth im surprised they didnt require you to have a session with one of their specially trained social workers before they took your blood that was my understanding of the proactive way they were going to handle things you dont have to be a rocket scientist to know that genetic testing is going to be upsetting no matter the outcome tell me about it laurie thought to herself whats wrong with your food sue asked leaning over to look at it you havent touched a bite do i have to take this personally laurie laughed and gave sue a dismissive wave of her hand laurie confessed to being not hungry with everything going on in her life listen sue said assuming a more serious tone if the brca test turns out to be positive which obviously you expect i want you to come right over to the clinic so i can get you in to see one of our top oncologists do we have a deal we have a deal good meanwhile whats the scoop with laura riley did you get set up with a gyno appointment for your routine check i did im set laurie glanced at her watch oops ive got to get a move on i dont want to be late the social worker might decide im being passiveaggressive the women parted ways in the hall as laurie climbed the stairs up to the second floor the right lower quadrant discomfort came back causing her to hesitate she wondered why stairs tended to aggravate whatever the nuisance was that was bothering her it was like what she used to call a stitch when she ran too much as a child true to form it faded after only a minute making a fist with her right hand she tapped against her back the idea had occurred to her that it might be kidney or ureteral pain but the tapping did not reevoke the discomfort she pushed in on her abdomen but felt nothing abnormal she shrugged and continued on her way the reception room of the genetics diagnostics lab was as serene as it had been on lauries previous visit the same classical music floated out of wall speakers and certainly the same impressionist prints hung from the walls what was different was lauries mindset on the first visit there was more curiosity than trepidation now it was the reverse can i help you a pinksmocked receptionist asked my name is laurie montgomery and i have an appointment with anne dickson at one oclock i will let her know you are here laurie sat down and picked up a magazine flipping through the pages aggressively she looked at her watch it was exactly one she wondered if ms dickson was going to humiliate her further by making her wait time crept forward laurie continued flipping through the magazine without concentration she found herself getting progressively more anxious and more irritated at the same time she closed the magazine and put it back on the table with the others instead of trying to read she sat back and closed her eyes by force of will she calmed herself she thought about lying on a beach in the hot sun if she tried she could almost hear the waves lapping against the shore ms montgomery a voice asked laurie looked up into the smiling face of a woman half her age she was dressed in a simple white sweater with a single strand of pearls around her neck over her sweater was a clean white coat in her left hand was a clipboard tucked against her side she had her right hand extended im anne dickson laurie got to her feet and shook the womans hand she then followed the woman through a side door and down a short hall she was directed into a small windowless room with a couch two club chairs a coffee table and a file cabinet centered on the coffee table was a box of tissues anne motioned for laurie to sit on the sofa she closed the door and then sat down in one of the chairs the box of tissues conveniently between them anne consulted her clipboard for a moment and then looked up from lauries perspective she was a pleasantappearing woman who could have been a mere college student in a workstudy program rather than a person with at least a masters degree and probably extra training in genetics she wore her straight mediumlength brown hair parted in the middle requiring her to frequently sweep it off her face and tuck it behind her ears her lipstick and nail polish were a dusky redbrown color i appreciate you coming in on such short notice anne said her voice was soft with a slight nasal twang and i apologize again for having misplaced your folder laurie smiled but she could feel herself getting progressively impatient i wanted to give you some background concerning what we do here in the genetic diagnostics lab anne continued she crossed her legs and settled the clipboard between them laurie could see a small tattoo of a snake on the inside of her leg just above the ankle i also wanted to explain why you are talking with me rather than with one of our staff doctors its purely a matter of time i have a lot and they have a little what that means is that i can be with you here for as long as you would like and answer all your questions and if i cant answer them i have immediate access to people who surely can laurie didnt comment or change her expression while she silently ordered anne to cut the fluff and just give her the damn results of the test she leaned back abruptly crossed her arms and tried to remind herself that she shouldnt blame the messenger unfortunately anne and the situation was irking her to no end she particularly found the convenient box of tissues patronizing as if anne expected her to break down emotionally even though knowing herself laurie knew it was a possibility now anne said after consulting her clipboard again and making laurie feel as though she was getting a canned presentation it is important for you to know something about the science of genetics and how the field has all changed with the decoding of the human genome meaning the sequence of all threepointtwo billion nucleotide base pairs but first let me say that you can interrupt at any moment if you dont understand something laurie nodded impatiently she couldnt help but wonder how much anne knew about nucleotide base pairs despite how flippantly she mentioned them nucleotide base pairs are the portions of the dna molecule that form the ladder part of the molecule and their linear order is responsible for conveying genetic information anne went on to discuss gregor mendels laws of genetics concerning dominant and recessive traits discovered by the monks work with garden peas in the nineteenth century laurie couldnt believe what she was being subjected to yet she didnt interrupt nor remind anne that she was dealing with a physician who obviously would have come across gregor mendels work in the course of her biological study laurie let the woman drone on about genes and how certain traits could be linked with other traits to form specific haplotypes that were inherited over generations at one point laurie even tuned the social worker out and concentrated on the womans tics which included in addition to the almost constant sweeping of her hair behind her ear a sustained blepharospasm when she was making a point but lauries attention was drawn back to the woman when she started talking about single nucleotide polymorphisms which she quickly began to refer to by using the acronym snp this was an arena of genetics that laurie was not quite as knowledgeable about and had been learning about only recently snps have become extremely important anne said they are specific sites in the human genome where a single nucleotide base pair has changed by mutation or deletion or even more rarely by insertion between any two people there is an average of one snp for every thousand or so nucleotide bases why have they become so important laurie found herself asking because there are now millions of them mapped across the whole human genome they now stand as convenient markers that are linked hereditarily to specific abnormal genes it is much easier to test for the marker than to isolate and sequence the affected gene although we generally do both just to be one hundred percent sure we want to be confident we are giving our patients the correct information right laurie said irritably annes comment about abnormal genes had rudely yanked laurie back to the reality of why she was having this conversation it was not an intellectual exercise seemingly oblivious to lauries mindset and after consulting her clipboard anne continued her monologue in her nasal twang all at once laurie had had enough her patience came to an abrupt end she uncrossed her arms and raised her right hand for anne to stop speaking anne caught the cue stopped in midsentence and looked at laurie questioningly with all due respect laurie said trying to modulate her voice to sound calm there is one significant piece of information which you either dont have or have forgotten i happen to be a physician myself i appreciate this background material but i assume that the real reason i am here is because you have the results of my test i want to know what they are so if you could be so kind i would like you to tell me flustered to a degree anne again consulted her clipboard when she looked up her blepharospasm was significantly more pronounced i didnt know you were a physician i saw the doctor title but i assumed it was some other kind of doctor it wasnt down as an md its quite all right am i positive for the marker for the brca gene but we havent talked about implications i am aware of the implications and any other questions that i might have i will direct to my oncologist i see anne said she looked down at her clipboard as if it might provide some help in what she was obviously finding as an uncomfortable situation i dont mean to sound unappreciative of your efforts laurie added but i need to know of course anne said she straightened up in her chair and looked laurie in the eye there was no blepharospasm you are indeed positive for the marker for brca which has been confirmed by sequencing the gene im sorry laurie looked away with unseeing eyes while she bit her lower lip although she fully expected the news she could feel tears amassing on the emotional horizon she fought against it as a matter of principle she was determined not to use the tissues on the table in front of her okay laurie heard herself say she also heard anne start to speak but laurie did not listen although laurie was generally acutely aware of others feelings under the circumstances she didnt care she knew she was blaming the messenger to some degree laurie stood up gave anne what amounted to a crooked smile and headed for the door with her palms as wet as they were she had no intention of shaking the womans hand she could hear anne following her and calling her name but she didnt even look back she crossed the reception area of the clinic with a determined step and walked out into the hospital corridor on the first floor laurie appreciated being surrounded by the surging crowds coming and going in the busy hospital the anonymity provided an unexpected solace from her mental turmoil there was a bench opposite the information booth and laurie took a moment to sit down she took a deep breath she was calming down what she needed to do was decide what to do next shed promised sue shed come over to the clinic asap to set up an appointment with the oncologist but as laurie sat there she felt the need for a more personal interaction she thought of roger and wondered if hed be available the administrative area was close and as the connecting door closed behind her laurie realized that she now preferred the calmness to the hospital lobbys chaos her shoes didnt make a sound on the carpet trying not to think about the reality of a genetic time bomb ticking away in every one of her cells she walked down to the area of rogers office one of the secretaries recognized her from earlier dr rousseau is in his office now the secretary said looking at laurie from behind her monitor laurie nodded an acknowledgment and walked to rogers doorway his door was ajar he was sitting at his desk going over paperwork laurie knocked on the jamb and roger looked up he was dressed as he usually was at the hospital in a freshly laundered crisp white shirt he had on a golden silk tie the texture and color of which contrasted nicely with his craggy permanently tanned face my word he said catching sight of laurie and leaping to his feet i just left a message on your voicemail two seconds ago what a coincidence he came around from behind his desk and closed his door turning back to her he gave her a quick hug and a kiss on the forehead he didnt notice that her arms stayed limp at her sides im so glad you are here i have so much to talk with you about he turned his two straightbacked chairs around to face each other he motioned for laurie to sit and he did the same you cant believe the morning ive had roger gushed there were two more postoperative deaths last night just like the previous four both of them young and healthy i know laurie said in a subdued voice ive already autopsied both of them it was what i was called you about earlier and what did you find there was nothing no pathology laurie said in the same quiet manner they were like the previous four i knew it i knew it roger said punching the air with a fist he stood up and paced back and forth in his tiny office i called an emergency meeting of the morbiditymortality committee this morning despite our having just met two days ago i presented the two cases as evidence that these past five weeks have been no more than a pause i argued vainly that we have to do something but oh no were not to rock the boat since the media might get wind of it i have half the mind to make an anonymous call to the media so it wouldnt be an issue but of course i wont i even went into the presidents office after the meeting to try to convince him to change his stance but it was like talking to the wall i even managed to get him angry at me by what he called my damned dogged determination laurie watched roger pace but couldnt make eye contact at the moment the series of suspicious deaths at the manhattan general was not what was on her mind but she didnt have the emotional strength to counter rogers current vehemence about them and then to make matters worse roger added we had a homicidal mugging in our parking garage this morning i mean im starting to get a complex about all this none of this happened before i came on board roger finally stopped moving and made eye contact with laurie his expression suggested that he was looking for sympathy but it changed when he noticed hers why the long face he asked he bent over to look more closely then quickly sat down im sorry here ive been ranting and raging and ignoring you and youre upset whats wrong laurie shut her eyes tightly and looked away rogers sudden solicitousness reawakened the emotions shed felt the moment anne dickson had given her the definitive news she felt rogers hand on her shoulder what is it laurie whats wrong at first laurie could only shake her head for fear that talking would release a flood of tears she hated her emotionalism it was such a damn handicap she straightened up and took a deep breath letting it out in a sustained huff im sorry she managed you dont have anything to be sorry about i was the one carrying on like a selfish insensitive brute whats happened laurie cleared her throat and began her brca saga and once she started talking she ironically got progressively less emotional as if her professional persona was able to take over she talked about her mother and her recent surgery and the fact that she was also positive for the mutated gene she also mentioned her fathers advice to get the test leaving out jacks role she described how shed come over to the manhattan general and had the blood drawn the day she and roger had met she then explained how she had successfully forgotten all about it until the call she had gotten that morning from anne dickson she concluded by saying that shed just come from an interview where shed been told that she was positive for the brca marker and for the mutated gene itself so there was no chance for laboratory error she admitted shed blamed the messenger despite trying to avoid not doing so and joked that shed denied the poor woman the opportunity to ask her the quintessential therapists question how laurie felt about the news laurie ended by chuckling im amazed you can find humor in this roger said i feel better after talking to you im so sorry about all this roger said with a voice that suggested utter sincerity what are you going to do whats the next step as soon as i leave here im supposed to head over to the clinic to see sue passero shes offered to help arrange an appointment in the near future with an oncologist she gave roger a pat on the thigh and started to stand up hold on roger said reaching out and pressing down on her shoulder to keep her in her seat not so fast since the social worker didnt have a chance let me ask you how you feel i imagine its something like finding out your best friend is your mortal enemy laurie peered into the depths of rogers dark brown eyes she found herself wondering if he was asking the question as a close friend or as a doctor if it was the former was his interest truly sincere he seemed to have a knack for saying the right thing but what was his motivation then she chided herself for questioning but after the marriage and children flap she wasnt sure of anything i guess i havent had time to feel much of anything laurie said after a pause she was tempted to say something about her newly recognized ability to compartmentalize her thoughts to the point of just not thinking about anything she didnt want to but then she decided it was too long a story since she wanted to get over to the kaufman clinic building to see sue in the long run it was the oncologist who was going to be key and the sooner the appointment was scheduled the better she would feel there must be something you can share with me roger persisted he still had his hand resting on her shoulder you cant learn something as disturbing as this without having some specific fears i suppose you are right laurie admitted reluctantly for me some of the suggested prophylactic measures and their side effects are the scariest for instance the idea of electively losing my fertility by having my ovaries removed is laurie stopped in midsentence for her the thought that suddenly raced through her mind like a tornado was the equivalent of being rudely slapped in the face it brought an instantaneous adrenaline rush that caused her pulse to race and the ends of her fingers to tingle for a moment she even felt dizzy such that she had to grasp the edge of her chair to keep from toppling over luckily the dizziness passed as quickly as it had appeared she could tell roger was talking but for the moment she couldnt hear him as the idea that had occurred to her kept reverberating in her mind with an effect akin to claps of thunder the old adage be careful what you wish for because it might come to pass again flashed into her consciousness laurie stood up abruptly effectively pulling roger to his feet as well since he still had his hand on her shoulder all at once she wanted to be by herself laurie roger demanded using his two hands he gave her shoulders a shake whats wrong you didnt finish your sentence im sorry laurie said in a voice that was calmer than she felt she peeled rogers reluctant hands from her shoulders i have to go i cant let you go like this what are you thinking about are you depressed no im not depressed not yet anyway i have to go roger ill call you later laurie turned to leave but roger grabbed her arm i have to be sure you wont hurt yourself in any way catching rogers drift laurie shook her head rest assured im not going to hurt myself i just need to be alone for a while she extracted her arm from rogers grasp youll call me yes ill call you laurie said as she opened the door am i going to see you tonight laurie hesitated in the doorway and then turned around tonights not going to work but ill be in touch laurie left rogers office rounded the nearest secretarys desk and walked deliberately down the hallway resisting the inclination to run she could feel rogers eyes on her back but she didnt turn around passing through the doorway that separated the administrative area from the rest of the hospital she slipped into the crowd once again the anonymity was comforting instead of dashing out of the building which was her initial intention she regained her seat opposite the information booth and spent the next quarter of an hour thinking of the consequences of her disturbing notion eleven the thursdayafternoon conference at the office of the chief medical examiner was a command performance according to the dictates of the chief harold bingham although he frequently did not attend himself citing pressing administrative duties everyone else under his command in the five boroughs of new york had to attend the rule was strictly enforced by the deputy chief calvin washington unless prior dispensation had been granted which required deathbed illness or the equivalent consequently the forensic pathologists from the branch offices in brooklyn queens and staten island all had to make the weekly hajj to mecca for the questionable enlightenment that the conferences offered for those medical examiners assigned to the home office serving manhattan and the bronx the onus was far less of an imposition since all they had to do was take the elevator from the fifth floor down to the first laurie generally found the conferences entertaining to a degree particularly the informal social period prior to the meeting it was during this time that the examiners traded war stories of the weeks more intellectually challenging or plainly bizarre cases laurie rarely contributed to these sidewalk discussions but enjoyed listening unfortunately enjoyment was not the situation on this particular thursday after learning that she was positive for the brca marker and then having the disturbing worry emerge in rogers office she felt shellshocked almost numb and certainly didnt feel social in the slightest coming into the room she didnt join the group around the coffee and donuts but rather had taken a seat near the door to the hall in hopes of possibly slipping away at some convenient and unobtrusive time the conference room was of moderate size and its decor had a particularly tired look that suggested it was much older than its purported fortyfour years to the left where a door communicated directly into binghams office stood a scarred and scratched lectern with its own little picture lamp that no longer worked and a goosenecked microphone that did arrayed in front of the podium were four rows of equally battered seats fixed to the floor and outfitted with hinged writing surfaces the seats gave the room the appearance of a small lecture hall and allowed it to fulfill its major function binghams news conferences in the back of the room stood a library table that presently supported the refreshments and around which were grouped the citys medical examiners everyone except the two higherups and jack a babble of voices interspersed with laughter floated around the room unlike laurie jack did not like anything about the thursday conferences jack had had a runin with one of the medical examiners from the brooklyn office over the sister of one of jacks basketball buddies and refused to even socialize with the man the same feelings were extended to the branch chief when he supported his underling in the dispute even though jack denied that it was deliberate he always arrived late to calvins irritation the door to binghams office opened and calvins massive body appeared he was clutching a folder which he opened on the lectern his dark eyes scanned the room briefly connecting with lauries before moving on he was obviously taking attendance all right calvin bellowed when no one paid him any heed thanks to the microphone his voice reverberated around the room like a kettledrum lets get under way here calvin kept his head bent down while he organized his papers on the lecterns slanted surface the medical examiners quickly broke off from their conversations and filed into the rows of chairs to take their seats calvin began the meeting the way bingham used to back when the chief regularly attended first he launched into a summary of the previous weeks statistics as calvins voice droned on lauries mind wandered although she was usually good at slipping into her professional persona on command and leaving her personal problems for another time she couldnt do it presently her new worry kept popping back unpleasantly into her consciousness such that it even trumped the brca concern the problem was that she had no idea what she would do if her fears were realized the hall door immediately to lauries left opened and jack walked in calvin stopped his presentation glared at jack and said sarcastically im so glad you were able to grace us with your presence dr stapleton i wouldnt miss it for the world jack answered causing laurie to wince with her fear of authority figures she couldnt understand how jack could be so transparently brazen with calvin she thought it was a kind of masochism on jacks part jack looked down at laurie with an exaggerated questioning expression she was sitting in the seat he always preferred and for the same reason laurie had taken it he gave her shoulder a squeeze before taking the aisle seat directly in front of her with jacks head in the line of her vision she found it even harder to concentrate on what calvin was saying it was a visual reminder that one way or the other she was going to have to have a serious conversation with him after giving the statistics calvin launched into his usual discussion of cogent administrative issues that usually involved some decrease in city funding and this weeks conference was no different instead of listening laurie watched jack although he had just sat down his head started the telltale bobbing that suggested that he had already begun falling asleep causing her to worry that calvin was going to notice and fly into a rage when authority figures got angry even if it wasnt directed at her it still made her feel uncomfortable either calvin didnt notice or he just elected to ignore the disrespect because he concluded his remarks without making a scene and introduced the chief of the brooklyn office dr jim bennett each one of the chiefs from the respective borough offices stood up to give their presentations when dick katzenburg from queens got behind the microphone and started speaking laurie had a flashback to her cocaine conspiracy twelve years earlier it was at a thursdayafternoon conference that she had the idea of discussing her overdoses with the group and the ensuing discussion had been helpful thanks to dick she wondered why the idea of doing the same with the manhattan general cases hadnt occurred to her and she thought about bringing it up but then she changed her mind she was too stressedout to deal with the anxiety of talking in front of the group but then she waffled again when she reminded herself that calvin seemed to be in a reasonably tolerant mood at the end of margaret hauptmans presentation of the staten island statistics calvin reclaimed the podium and asked if anyone else wanted the microphone for any other business it was a pro forma offer that was rarely accepted since people were eager to leave after a moment of painful indecision laurie tentatively raised her hand any chance of changing her mind was dashed when calvin quickly but reluctantly recognized her jack twisted around in his seat in front of her and gave her an exasperated questioning expression that implied why are you extending this agony laurie walked unsteadily up to the podium she felt a jolt of adrenaline since speaking in front of groups always intimidated her as she adjusted the microphone she berated herself for getting into such a situation she certainly didnt need any more stress first let me apologize laurie began i hadnt prepared for this but it just occurred to me that i would like to get some general response from everyone about a current series of mine laurie looked down at calvin and could tell that his eyes had narrowed she sensed that he knew what was coming and didnt approve she glanced back at jack and as soon as her eyes connected with his he positioned his fingers like a gun and pretended to shoot himself in the head with such negative vibes laurie felt even more insecure to collect her thoughts she looked down at the lecterns defaced wooden surface with its myriad initials and doodles encased with ballpointpen marks vowing to avoid making eye contact with either calvin or jack she raised her eyes and launched into a short description of her sudden adult death syndrome or sads a term she admitted shed coined when talking with a professional colleague five weeks ago about four totally unexpected hospitalbased cardiac arrests that had resisted resuscitation she said she now had six cases spanning a sixweek period all of which had similar demographics young healthy and within twentyfour hours of elective surgery she went on to say that there was no pathology on gross or microscopic although on the last two cases she had yet to do the microscopic since they had been posted that very morning she concluded by saying that despite toxicology failing to come up with any possible arrhythmic agent she suspected that the manner of death in these cases was not natural or accidental laurie let her voice trail off her mouth was bonedry she would have loved a drink of water but she stayed where she was the implication of her monologue was immediately clear to the group and for a few seconds silence reigned in the conference room then a hand shot up and laurie called on the individual what about electrolytes sodium potassium and particularly calcium the lab reported all electrolytes from all the usual sample sources to be entirely normal laurie responded she then called on another person who raised his hand are the patients related in any way other than all being young healthy and having just had surgery not that is apparent ive made it a point to search for commonalities but i havent found any other than what i have mentioned the cases involve mostly different doctors different procedures different anesthetic agents and for the most part different medications even for postoperative pain where have they occurred all six have been at the same hospital the manhattan general which has an extremely low death rate calvin snapped hed had enough he stood up approached the podium and used his bulk to nudge laurie aside he bent the microphone up and a harsh squeal emanated from the speakers as if in protest calling these disparate cases at this stage a series is misleading and prejudicial because as dr montgomery has admitted they are not related ive told dr montgomery this before and im telling her again im also telling this august assemblage that this is an inhouse discussion that doesnt leave this room ocme is not going to tarnish the reputation of one of the citys premier tertiarycare centers with unsubstantiated innuendo six is rather a lot for a coincidence jack said he had revived when laurie got up to speak although he was not asleep he was slouched back in his seat with his legs draped over the seat in front of him would you kindly show some respect dr stapleton calvin growled jack put his feet down on the floor and sat up four was borderline but six is too many when they are all at the same hospital still im going to vote for accidental something in the hospital is affecting these patients conduction systems dick katzenburg raised his hand calvin motioned with his head for him to speak my colleague at the queens office just reminded me that we saw some similar cases dick said its our recollection that the demographics were quite similar all relatively young and supposedly healthy the last case was at least a few months ago and we havent had one since how many overall laurie asked dick leaned toward bob novak his deputy and listened for a moment then straightened up we think it was also six but it was spread over a period of several months with a number of examiners just when we began to be a bit curious about them they stopped and as a consequence they have sort of dropped off our radar its my recollection that all were eventually signed out as natural even though no significant pathology was found i know for certain that toxicology was negative on all of them because that would have certainly been brought to my attention were they postoperative laurie asked she was taken aback excited and pleased it would be d√©j√† vu if her series were to double from having brought up the issue at a thursday conference and if it did double the profile of these cases would surely be even more of a mental diversion than it had been to date i believe so dick said sorry that i cant be more definitive i understand laurie said where did these deaths occur at saint francis hospital ah the plot thickens jack commented isnt st francis another americare hospital dr stapleton calvin snapped kindly maintain a modicum of decorum allow yourself to be recognized if you wish to contribute to the conversation it is an americare institution dick said turning toward jack and ignoring calvin how soon can i get their names and accession numbers laurie asked ill email them to you as soon as i get back to the queens office dick said or we can just call my secretary i think she could find the list id like them as soon as possible laurie said id like to get their hospital charts and the sooner i get the accession numbers to one of our investigators the better fine by me dick said agreeably any other business calvin asked he scanned the group then concluded the meeting see you all next thursday as most of the medical examiners stood up stretched and recommenced their conversations that the meeting had cut short dick made his way over to laurie he had his cell phone pressed up against his ear and was describing the location of a folder in his desk he motioned for laurie to wait glancing over at jack laurie saw him immediately duck out of the conference room she had hoped to talk with him even if only briefly and thank him for being ultimately supportive during her minipresentation do you have something to write on dick asked laurie produced a pen and the back of an envelope while laurie kept her finger on the envelope to keep it steady on the writing surface of one of the chairs dick wrote down the names and the accession numbers he thanked his secretary and rang off well there you have them he said let me know if i can be of assistance in any other way i have to say it does seem curious i imagine ill be able to access what i need from the data bank but if i cant ill be in touch thanks dick this is the second time you have helped me out do you remember those cocaine cases twelve years ago now that you mention it of course i remember although it seems like it was in a different lifetime at any rate im glad to be of service dr montgomery calvin called can i speak to you for a moment although his comment was presented as a request it was more of a command laurie gave dick a parting wave and then stepped warily over to calvin if these cases of dicks turn out to resemble yours demographically i want you to let me know in the meantime the proscription of talking about your supposed series with anyone outside of the ocme still holds am i clear on that you and i have had disagreements about information leaks to the media in the past and i dont want it to happen again i understand laurie said nervously dont worry i learned my lesson and i certainly would not go to the media at the same time i must admit i have been speaking with the chief of the medical staff over at the manhattan general right from the beginning about the cases he happens to be a friend whats his name dr roger rousseau since hes on the staff i suppose its safe to assume he is aware of the sensitive nature of the issue most definitely i suppose its equally safe to assume hes not apt to go to the media hardly laurie said she was feeling more confident calvin was definitely in a mildmannered mood yet dr rousseau is rightfully concerned and i believe he would want to hear if dicks cases are indeed similar it would give him the opportunity to talk with his counterpart at saint francis and make him feel hes not the only one with such a problem well i dont see any harm in talking with him provided you are clear the ocme officially does not currently agree with your assessment of the manner of death and at the moment will back the queens offices disposition certainly and thank you laurie said it was good to clear the air shed carried a twinge of guilt from having talked to roger about the deaths when shed first met him despite calvins wishes leaving the conference room laurie headed directly to the investigators office she was beginning to calm down from the anxiety of talking in front of the group and from having to confront calvin she felt even better when she found cheryl meyers at her desk since her workday had officially ended an hour earlier in lauries estimation cheryl was the most talented investigator at the ocme and just as hard a worker as janice laurie had cheryl copy the list of names and accession numbers dick had provided and laurie asked her to put in a request for copies of the patients charts from st francis hospital what about the autopsy folders and death certificates cheryl asked as laurie had told dick she said shed first try to see what she could obtain from the computerized database if she needed help for hard copies laurie said shed get back to her clutching her envelope and silently reading the names over and over laurie rode up in the elevator her intuition told her loudly and clearly that the demographics and details of this new list of victims was going to match her own her sads series was now twelve people once on the fifth floor laurie hesitated it took her a moment to build up her confidence she wanted to go down to jacks office and talk to him even if only briefly about her disturbing potential epiphany she had had in rogers office she thought it would assuage her anxieties to share them but she didnt quite know what she wanted to say or even how to begin attempting to steel herself against all the uncertainties she took a fortifying breath and started off the closer she got the slower she walked she hesitated again before stepping into view in the doorway appalled at her indecision she was becoming either a coward or hopelessly wishywashy or a mixture of both laurie looked back longingly over her shoulder at her own door some forty feet away and waffled hearing a desk chair scrape back within the office in front of her and sensing that jack was coming out laurie almost fled in a panic fortunately there wasnt enough time and it wasnt even jack it was chet who literally bumped into her in his haste oh gosh im sorry chet offered as he grabbed laurie by the shoulders to keep from bowling her over as the two stumbled back a step he immediately let go of laurie and bent down to pick up the jacket hed dropped its quite all right laurie said she recovered quickly although her pulse was racing im off to my bodysculpting class chet offered as an explanation obviously im late and if you are looking for jack you missed him he had some important basketball game at his neighborhood court and bolted out of here ten minutes ago oh too bad laurie said she was actually relieved no problem ill catch him in the morning chet waved goodbye and ran down the corridor toward the elevator laurie walked toward her office suddenly she was very tired the day had taken its toll she looked forward to getting back to her apartment and taking a hot bath as laurie suspected her office was empty she sat down at her desk and typed in her password for the next thirty minutes she downloaded the records on the six cases from queens although the forensic investigators reports were not even close in quality to those done by janice there was enough information for laurie to conclude that the cases were indeed similar to hers the deaths were all in the earlymorning hours between two and four the ages ranged from twentysix to fortytwo none of the patients had a history of cardiac problems and all were within twentyfour hours of elective surgery when she was finished laurie reached for her phone and dialed rogers number she had promised to call and this was as good a time as any especially since she had something particular to say besides explaining her behavior in his office as the call went through she found herself hoping on this occasion to get his voicemail to avoid having to resist being drawn into a conversation about things that she didnt want to discuss but unfortunately roger answered on the second ring with his usual cheerful voice when he realized it was laurie he became immediately solicitous are you all right he asked anxiously im holding my own laurie answered she wasnt going to lie im looking forward to getting back to my apartment it hasnt been my idea of a great day in the meantime ive learned something within the hour that i think you will find interesting during our thursdayafternoon interdepartmental conference it was brought to my attention that there had been six deaths at saint francis hospital in queens that so far sound strikingly similar to those at the manhattan general really roger questioned he was both surprised and interested ive downloaded their death certificates and investigative reports and ive ordered copies of their hospital charts getting the charts will take a while but in the interim ill get what i can over to you tomorrow i assume youll want to discuss this with the chief of the medical staff at saint francis most definitely if only to commiserate with him switching gears roger added now lets talk about you i have to say ive been worried sick since you mysteriously stopped in midsentence here in my office and then essentially walked out whats going on in your mind laurie twisted the phone cord in her fingers while she tried to think of something appropriate to say it was not her intent by any stretch of the imagination to cause roger anxiety but there was no way she wanted to discuss what was dominating her thoughts especially when she didnt even know for certain that her worries were justified are you still there roger questioned im still here laurie assured him roger im all right truly and as soon as i feel comfortable talking about what is on my mind i promise i will do so can you accept that for the time being i suppose roger said without enthusiasm is it about your being positive for the brca marker indirectly to some extent but please roger no more questions are you sure you dont want to get together tonight not tonight ill call you in the morning i promise okay ill be waiting to hear from you but if you have a change of heart ill be home all evening laurie hung up the phone leaving her hand resting on the receiver she felt guilty about causing roger distress but she was not about to talk to him about what was on her mind pushing back from the desk and standing up laurie looked down at the stack of new material from the ocme database she thought about taking the papers home with her and adding the names to her matrix but then quickly dismissed the idea she could deal with her burgeoning series the following day with her coat over her arm and her umbrella in one hand laurie turned off the light and locked her office door next stop was the drugstore and after that her apartment as laurie pushed the elevators down button she could almost feel the delicious sensation of slipping into an enveloping hot bath for her a bath was as much a therapeutic experience as it was an opportunity to get clean twelve one hundred ninetynine two hundred jazz counted to herself before stopping her situps she lay back on the inclined plane of the situp apparatus keeping her hands behind her head while she stared up at the ceiling panels of the health clubs weight room she was breathing heavily from pushing herself during her entire workout by doing twice her normal number of repetitions with each exercise and at each weight station such exertion usually had a cathartic effect on her cleansing her mind and today was no different she felt better she closed her eyes and let her body relax despite her head being lower than the rest of her causing her blood to rush to her head the problem had been that jazz hadnt been able to stop fretting about the snafus with lewis and sobczyk to the point that sleep had been difficult prior to those two messy episodes shed done ten missions without a speck of trouble it irritated her that people could be so difficult especially lewis grabbing her arm the way he did sobczyk hadnt been much better the way she gurgled and writhed around at just the wrong time the only good part was that that sorry situation had pushed her over the edge as far as susan chapman was concerned jazz had fantasized about getting rid of her from day one and now it was done jazz slipped her feet from beneath the padded restraints and swung her legs over to the side she stood up and glanced in the mirror at her very red and perspiring face she grabbed her towel and wiped the sweat off her forehead before glancing up at the clock although she had essentially doubled her entire workout routine it had taken her only thirty minutes longer letting her eyes briefly sweep around the room she caught the inevitable furtive looks from the mostly male occupants including blond mr ivy league whom she hadnt seen for a while in the mood she was in she almost wished hed try to talk to her again this time she wouldnt be so nice knowing that she had to get a move on if she was to get to work reasonably early jazz headed for the locker room now that she had her irritation about the lewis and sobczyk episodes under control she was able to think more clearly about them both were hardly her fault rotating her left arm she looked at the stillraw scratch marks she couldnt believe the guy had had the nerve to scratch her like that and she hoped to hell he wasnt hivpositive he certainly deserved what he got in the future jazz reminded herself she should steer clear of the subjects free hand as far as the sobczyk debacle was concerned that was chapmans fault and now that chapman was history there was little to worry about with her towel and her walkman in one hand jazz used the other to push into the womans locker room she tossed the towel into the convenient hamper and with the walkman under her arm she took a coke from the icefilled tub after a glance around to make sure no one was watching she walked on she flipped the tab and took a long satisfying slug ultimately the real threat of the foulups with lewis and sobczyk was the possibility of discovery mr bob had warned about ripples and both episodes had been like tenfoot waves participating in operation winnow had been the best thing that had ever happened to jazz and she shuddered to think of what might have occurred had she not wasted chapman when she did or worse yet what might have happened if chapman had gone directly to the nursing supervisor that morning instead of walking out to her car jazz didnt even like to think about it because everything she had worked for could have gone down the drain back at the beginning of her relationship with mr bob she had decided that she was not going to let anything or anybody stand between her and her newfound success just before she came to the health club shed gone online and checked her account as she had anticipated her balance was now close to fifty thousand dollars just looking at the figures had made her feel like she had died and gone to heaven hey someone taunted i heard you were a nurse not a neurosurgeon jazz stopped and turned to look at the person who had spoken to her she was a fleshy woman trussed up in a towel like a cannoli do i know you you told me you were a neurosurgeon the woman said disdainfully and the trusting person i am i believed you well i know differently now a derisive halflaugh escaped from jazzs mouth vaguely she remembered making such a comment but the fact that this tub of lard remembered it and had the nerve to bring it up was a bad joke why dont you get a life you porker jazz scoffed and then walked on before the woman could respond jazz shook her head and wondered if she should begin checking out another health club at her current one it used to be just the men who irked her but now that the women were starting it might be time to move on jazz didnt take long in the shower nor did she dillydally climbing into her scrubs and white jacket when she pulled on her oversized olivedrab coat she checked her pockets as she always did she fondled the glock and the blackberry while she scanned the locker to make sure shed taken everything she wanted as jazz rode down in the elevator she wondered when shed get her next mission for operation winnow she hoped it would be soon and not just for the money with the problems on the last two cases making the possibility of discovery a realistic concern she worried about being spooked shed learned about dealing with such negative thoughts in the military the idea was to jump right back into the water on the upper garage level she headed over toward her waiting car it gleamed in the garages raw fluorescent light and looked awesome despite the fact that it was no longer virginal on the back left quarter panel was a smudge of yellow paint and a slight dent from a recent runin with a taxicab jazz wasnt happy about the defect in the vehicles otherwise flawless surface but the damage to the taxi and the irritation of the driver compensated for the minor blemish when jazz was about ten feet away she activated the door release and she could hear the mechanical clicks as the doors unlocked coming alongside she glanced at her reflection in the tinted windows and fluffed her fringed hair with her fingers she opened the driversside door tossed her gym bag into the passengerside seat and swung herself up behind the wheel as she stuck the key in the ignition with anticipation of hearing the roar of the v a hand gripped her shoulder jazz almost went through the roof spinning around fast enough to jab herself in the hip with the steering wheel she shot a glance into the backseat in the halflight of the interior made dim by the darkly tinted windows all she could see were the outlines of two men their faces were hidden in shadow while jazz frantically struggled to get her hand into her coat pocket to get the glock one of the men spoke howdy doc jr jesus mr bob jazz blurted she gave up on the glock instead she slapped her hand over her forehead you scared me half to death that wasnt the intention mr bob said unapologetically were just being discreet he was sitting on the passenger side of the back seat leaning slightly forward the other man was sitting back with his arms crossed how the hell did you get in here jazz questioned she squinted to try to get a look at the other guy while rubbing the top of her iliac crest it was throbbing from its painful contact with the steering wheel easy we kept a key when we delivered the vehicle id like you to meet a colleague of mine mr dave i cant see either one of you jazz complained should i turn on the interior light its not necessary and i prefer you dont what are you doing here we came for reassurance reassurance about what for one thing we want to be certain the two patients whose names you got yesterday were sanctioned absolutely i did them both last night jazz felt her pulse quicken nervously she worried that bob had somehow learned about the screwups then theres the little matter of a nurse getting whacked in the manhattan generals parking lot supposedly for a measly fifty bucks what can you tell us about that sorry incident nothing i havent heard a thing when did it happen jazz ran her tongue around the inside of her mouth it had gone bonedry but she purposefully didnt look away or squirm in her seat thanks to her military interrogation training this morning between seven and eight the name was susan chapman did you know her susan chapman of course i knew her she was the incompetent charge nurse on my floor thats what we thought and frankly thats why we are concerned we wanted to be reassured you werent involved considering your reputation doc jr i know that officer bastard in san diego had it coming but you did shoot him even if not lethally are you sure this susan chapman didnt get in your face and push you over the edge something like the marine officer we feel it is kind of a coincidence she got shot considering your history and she being your immediate superior is that what this is about you think i shot susan chapman hey no way i mean susan and i might have had our differences but that was minor stuff like her always giving me the crap patients or giving me lip because i sat down for two seconds theres no way id shoot her come on what do you think i am crazy the point here is that we have to be certain your behavior is beyond reproach i made that very clear when i recruited you into the program remember there cant be any ripples of course all this is predicated on your wanting to remain an active participant in operation winnow absolutely jazz said with conviction youre happy with your compensation and i trust this suv were sitting in has been an enjoyment theres no question im very happy good now do i have your word that if theres a problem in any aspect in relation to your position or your fellow workers or the work that you do for us youll give me a call with the special number i gave you i trust you still have the number i thought that telephone number was just for emergencies id consider what im talking about an emergency i want you to call if you are ever tempted to do anything out of the ordinary particularly anything violent that might stimulate an investigation like im certain this murder of the charge nurse will do remember i told you from the beginning that for us security is of the utmost importance since any breach could put the entire operation in jeopardy im sure you dont want to do that of course not we consider any type of investigation worrisome especially if you are drawn into it i agree then we see eye to eye most definitely mr bob turned to his companion is there anything youd like to say or ask doc jr how many days a week do you come to this sports club mr dave asked he uncrossed his arms and leaned forward slightly jazz shrugged i dont know maybe five or six sometimes even seven why so other than your apartment or the hospital this is the only other place you spend significant amounts of your time i suppose any current boyfriends or close girlfriends not really jazz said although she could not see the mans face from his voice she felt that mr dave was younger than mr bob what the hell are these questions for we always like to know our agents mr bob said and the more facts we have the better we know them seems rather personal to me thats the kind of operation this is mr bob said with a smile his teeth looked particularly white in the dim light do you have any questions for us yeah what are your real names jazz laughed nervously she felt she was at a distinct disadvantage with them knowing about her and she knowing nothing about them sorry thats confidential then i dont have any questions okay mr bob said we have something for you another name i trust that you are working tonight absolutely im on the next four nights so im available whats the name clark mulhausen jazz repeated the name with a new mission she was now fully recovered from the shock of the men surprising her in the hummer and from chapmans murder being mentioned in fact she was now elated she was in her words jumping right back into the water so youll be able to do clark tonight consider it done jazz said with a confident wry smile mr bob opened his door and got out mr dave did the same on his side remember no ripples mr bob reminded her before closing his door no ripples jazz repeated over her shoulder but she wasnt sure the men had heard because both rear doors closed simultaneously as she spoke she watched the two men walk down the row of cars toward an h hummer that was a spitting image of hers jazz hadnt noticed it when shed come into the garage as soon as the men climbed into their vehicle jazz started her engine and backed out of her slot creeps she muttered as she drove toward the ramp leading up to the street although she was excited about getting another name and glad everything was copacetic about operation winnow she was aggravated by the way she was being treated she didnt like being subservient and talked down to which is what the conversation with mr bob and mr dave had been like even the names of the two men were stupid and a slap in the face she also vaguely wondered how much they were being paid for each sanction if she was getting five grand hell she thought she was doing all the work so what do you think david rosenkrantz asked robert hawthorne bob was in the drivers seat slowly drumming his fingers on the steering wheel and staring out the windshield at the bare concrete wall while he mulled over their conversation with jazz he had yet to start the car dave was in the passenger seat eyeing his boss i dont know bob said finally throwing both hands into the air he shook his head and turned to his underling bob was a big athleticappearing man with coarse features that contrasted with his italian suit the natty dress was a relatively new affectation most of his life had been spent in military fatigues roaming the world on special ops as a member of the armys special forces running this operation is a classic catch we spend so much effort finding and cultivating these antisocial fruitcakes who are willing to carry out the missions without compunction but then we have to deal with their craziness this rakoczi is a case in point can you imagine she actually tried to shoot that marine officer in the nuts just because he made a pass at her yet shes effective said dave dave was in his midtwenties almost half bobs age he was of a slighter build but equally athletic hed been recruited by bob in prison where both had done time bob for nearly killing a gay man who had made the mistake of approaching him in a bar and dave for simple grand larceny shes the best we have bob answered thats why im torn theres no pussyfooting around with radoczi we give her a name and bam the persons gone the same night not once has there been any hesitation and excuses like weve had to put up with with all the others but like i implied to her im afraid she might be a loose cannon do you think she was involved with the murder of the nurse to tell you the truth i have no idea although i wouldnt put it past her at the same time i know she wouldnt do it for fifty bucks so maybe it was a mugging i just dont know id hoped that by surprising her wed have a better idea she didnt react much when you first mentioned the nurses name but then she seemed to get a little mad i got the same impression but i dont know how to interpret it like most of our emissaries she has a history of not getting along with her superiors so the news that chapman was dead might have just made her feel good about not having her around anymore bob started the vehicles engine and twisted around to back out of the parking slot i think well just have to hold tight and see what happens bob said once he got the car in the clear he put it in drive and started for the ramp if there are any more coincidental shootings well have to suspect the worst and shell have to go if that happens youll be the man yeah i know dave said thats why i asked her about her habits i guessed as much bob said pulling up to the booth but take what she said with a grain of salt people like rakoczi have as much qualms about lying as they do about polishing their shoes dave nodded but he wasnt concerned rakoczis loner inclinations would make dealing with her a breeze thirteen laurie put the small plastic cap on the device after she thought it was adequately saturated and placed it on the edge of the sink she certainly wasnt going to sit and watch it for the required time instead she climbed into the shower and lathered herself with a body wash and shampooed her hair she then stood under the stream of water for a few minutes allowing it to cascade over her head for laurie a shower wasnt quite the therapeutic experience that a bath was but it was as calming just the same it had been a restless night for laurie with her mind refusing to turn off when she was able to sleep it was in snatches haunted by disturbing dreams including the recurrent nightmare about her brother sinking into the mud when the alarm had sounded there was a certain relief that the long night was finally over she hardly felt rested but was relieved to get out of bed the covers and sheets were in such disarray from her tossing and turning that it appeared as if there had been a wrestling match similar to the previous two mornings when she had initially stood up she had a touch of nausea as she turned off the shower there was still a remnant but assuming the situation would be the same she expected shed feel almost normal after a bit of breakfast laurie stepped out onto the bath mat dried herself off then turned and bent her head back into the shower stall to shake her thick mane of hair like a dog emerging from a dip in a pond she then vigorously handdried her hair and wrapped it up in the towel only then did she hazard a look down at the innocent piece of plastic resting on the edge of the sink laurie caught her breath with slightly trembling fingers she picked up the device as if by holding it closer there might be a different result but there wasnt in the small window in the plastic sheath were two pink lines laurie closed her eyes and held them shut for an extended moment when she reopened them the pink lines were still there she wasnt conjuring them up in her mind having studied the directions on the side of the box laurie knew that the test was positive she was pregnant with trembling knees laurie put down the top of the toilet seat and sat down for a moment she felt completely overwhelmed too many disconcerting things had happened in too short a time it had all started with her semisplit with jack followed quickly by her mothers cancer the situation with the brca mutation and then her whirlwind relationship with roger and now she was being drawn into yet another potential tumult most of her life she had dreamed about what it was going to be like to be pregnant but now that she was she didnt know how to feel it was like her life was spinning out of control laurie put the testing device back on the edge of the sink and looked at the box it had come in which she had placed on top of the hamper once again she was tempted to blame the messenger as if being pregnant was the fault of the pregnancy test laurie could have done it the night before but she read that it was the most reliable and sensitive in the morning so she had waited it was obvious to her that she had been procrastinating and putting off the inevitable when the thought of possibly being pregnant had suddenly occurred to her in rogers office she was almost certain she was after all it would explain the morning nausea which she had been foolishly trying to attribute to scallops laurie shook her head in dismay the fact that being pregnant had come as such a surprise was yet another example of her ability to put things that she didnt want to think about out of her mind she distinctly remembered acknowledging to herself that she had missed a period three weeks before but with everything else going on she had decided not to worry about it and she didnt after all she had missed periods before particularly when under stress and currently there was certainly no dearth of stress in her life lowering her head to look at her abdomen laurie tried to understand that there was the beginning of a child inside of her although she had always considered the idea to be natural now that it was actually happening it seemed so phenomenal as to defy belief she immediately knew when the conception had occurred it had to have been that morning when she and jack had found themselves both strangely wide awake in the middle of the night at first they had been careful not to bother the other but when they had discovered that they were both not sleeping they started talking the talking led to a caress and the caress progressed to an embrace the resulting lovemaking had been natural and initially fulfilling but later when laurie found herself still awake the intensity of the lovemaking had ironically made her realize what she was missing a family with children now the ultimate irony was that the lovemaking had actually created a child shed longed for although without the marriage laurie got to her feet and stood sideways in front of the mirror she tried to see if there was any bulge to her abdomen but then openly laughed at herself she knew that at five weeks an embryo was no bigger than about eight millimeters or a third of an inch hardly enough to cause any visible external changes all at once laurie stopped laughing and stared at herself in the mirror being pregnant under the current circumstances was hardly a laughing matter it was a mistake with serious consequences for her life and for others as well thinking in that vein made her wonder how it had happened she had always been careful to avoid lovemaking when she thought she might be fertile so how did she mess up she thought back to the night they had made love and as soon as she did so she realized what had happened at two oclock in the morning it was technically the next day the previous day had been her tenth day and it probably would have been okay but certainly not the eleventh day oh my word laurie said out loud in a despairing voice as the reality of the situation began to sink in she truly felt overwhelmed and even a little depressed the need to talk with jack had suddenly changed from a desire to a necessity yet at the moment she wondered how she was going to find the emotional strength there were too many problems swirling in her mind not least of which was the knowledge that she was positive for the brca marker how was that going to play into her being pregnant she had no idea but the thought invariably brought up the word abortion despite being a medical doctor laurie had always associated the word more with its political connotations concerning womens rights than with a procedure that she would consider herself suddenly all that changed ive got to get a grip laurie said to her image in the mirror with more determination than she felt she got out her hair dryer and began drying her hair her one refuge was her professional persona despite her problems she had to get to work as shed expected lauries queasiness all but disappeared after shed had some breakfast bran flakes without milk turned out to be the most palatable while she ate the right lower abdominal discomfort shed felt on occasion over the last few days returned with her fingers she pushed in over the area it accentuated the feeling especially when she moved her fingers closer to the midline but it still wasnt anything she would have called pain vaguely she wondered if it was a normal sensation of early pregnancy since she had never been pregnant before she didnt know if implantation caused such a feeling intellectually she knew that the process involved a kind of invasion of the uterine wall so it wasnt out of the realm of possibility there was also the chance the discomfort could be from the right ovary one way or another it wasnt her biggest concern when laurie arrived at the ocme it was only about sevenfifteen but she was still pessimistic about catching jack in the id office lately he seemed to be coming in earlier and earlier her assumption was corroborated when she saw vinnies preferred location vacant and his newspaper open to the sports page abandoned on the desk which undoubtedly meant he was already down helping jack chet was hard at work sitting at the main desk and going through the folders of the bodies that had come in during the night it was to be his last day for the job that week laurie was the medical examiner on call for the upcoming weekend which also meant that the following weeks duty of deciding which cases needed to be posted and distributing them would fall to her is jack already downstairs laurie asked as she took her first sip of coffee believing the caffeine would help check her melancholy mood she hoped her stomach would tolerate the strong brew chets head popped up you know jack when i got here hed already been cherrypicking through all the folders and was eager to get a jump on the day what kind of case is he doing the warmth of the coffee gave her a contradictory shiver its interesting you should ask he took a case just like the two you got yesterday laurie took the cup away from her lips her mouth opened in an expression of surprise you mean a case from the manhattan general yup fairly young guy whod had a routine hernia repair and then promptly checked out for good why did jack take it he knows im interested in those cases he did it as a favor oh come on chet what do you mean as a favor apparently calvin had left word with janice that if another such case came in she was to give him a call obviously she did because he came in just about the same time as jack and checked it out when i arrived he told me specifically he didnt want you doing it in fact he said that you were to have an official paper day today so youre free and clear anyway jack then offered to do the case because he said youd probably want the results sooner rather than later why did calvin say that he didnt want me doing it laurie questioned it seemed like a deliberately low blow since the diversion of her series was the only thing she had going for herself in the face of all her problems he didnt say and you know calvin it wasnt as if he was about to offer he just made it crystal clear you werent to do it he also said that when i saw you i was supposed to tell you he wanted to see you in his office asap so the message has been delivered good luck thats weird did he sound angry no worse than normal chet shrugged im sorry thats all i can tell you laurie nodded as if she understood but she didnt leaving her coat on one of the id offices club chairs she retraced her route back out through the id room and into the main reception area she was nervous with everything else in her life in her words going to hell in a handbasket she wouldnt have been surprised if her career was somehow in jeopardy as well although she had no idea what she could have done to irritate calvin other than perhaps giving her impromptu talk at yesterdays conference but after the fact when shed spoken with him everything seemed to be all right laurie had marlene buzz her directly into the administration area which was tomblike in its stillness none of the secretaries had yet arrived calvin however was in his office scanning documents from his in basket and hastily signing them he continued the last couple even after laurie had announced herself he motioned for her to sit while he gathered up the stack of signed papers and slipped them into his out basket then he sat back and eyed laurie over the top of his rimless glasses with his chin practically on his chest if you dont already know the name of the potential new case is clark mulhausen and i suppose you want to know why i insisted you dont do it that would be nice laurie said she was relieved calvins tone was hardly strident suggesting that he wasnt mad and she wasnt about to be harangued or worse yet put on administrative leave the long and short of it is that you have yet to sign out those original cases in your socalled series from over a month ago at this point you cant be waiting for any other lab work or whatever so youve got to get them done to be honest the chief has been feeling some heat about them from the mayors office for god knows what reason whatever it is he let me know he wants them signed out which means im getting heat maybe it has something to do with insurance and the families who knows one way or the other get them done i gave you a paper day to make sure it happens fair enough i havent signed them out because i cant in good conscience say they were either accidental or natural and i know you dont want me to say they were homicides because that would suggest a serial killer and i dont have any proofat least not yet laurie dont give me a hard time calvin said he leaned forward intimidatingly extending his huge head toward her and impaling her with his dark menacing eyes im trying to be nice about this im also not trying to stop you from looking into the possibility they are causally related but for now youve got to choose between accidental or natural i favor natural like dick katzenburg because theres no more proof they were accidental than homicidal the death certificates can always be amended if and when new information becomes available we cant leave the cases in limbo forever and you cant create a pr firestorm by calling them homicidal or even accidental without some specific justification be reasonable all right ill do it laurie said with a defeated sigh thank you but damn you make it sound like im asking for the moon and while were on the subject what have you found out about the queens cases do they fit the same demographics so far laurie said in a tired voice she slouched forward looking down at the floor with her elbows resting on her knees at least from what i could get out of the investigators reports im waiting on the charts keep me apprised now get up there to that office of yours and sign out those manhattan general cases laurie nodded and got to her feet she gave calvin a crooked smile and turned to leave laurie calvin called after her youre acting browbeaten which is not like you whats up are you all right youve got me worried here it distresses me to see you of all people moping around laurie turned back to face calvin she was taken aback it was not like him to ask personal questions much less suggest concern she hardly expected that from any authority figure especially not the oftencurmudgeonly calvin the surprise caused unwelcome stirrings of emotion within her which immediately threatened to surface since the very last thing she wanted to do was break down in front of her oftenchauvinistic superior she fought the impulse by taking a deep breath and holding it for a minute calvins eyebrows slowly arched and he leaned forward more as if to encourage her to speak i guess ive got a lot on my mind laurie said finally she was afraid to make eye contact do you care to elaborate calvin asked in a voice that was significantly more mellow than usual not at the moment laurie said while flashing calvin the same crooked smile calvin nodded fair enough but remember my door is always open thank you laurie managed before fleeing as she walked down the main firstfloor corridor she felt a mixture of feelings to add to her chaotic thoughts on the one hand she felt lucky to have gotten away without an emotional scene while at the same time she was irritated with herself about yet another episode of her embarrassing demonstrativeness it was ridiculous that she had to fight against shedding a tear because her boss evidenced a bit of solicitude on the other hand she was impressed at having witnessed a side of the deputy chief that she had never seen and after the nervous pessimism that the call to calvins office had evoked she felt relief that she was still employed if shed been put on leave for some real or imagined transgression she wasnt sure she could have handled it with the new concern about being pregnant combined with her other anxieties the diversion that her job provided was needed more than ever sticking her head into the investigators office she asked the chief investigator bart arnold if janice was still around laurie wanted to learn the details of the clark mulhausen case to be certain it was another to be added to her series you missed her by about ten minutes bart said anything i can help you with not really laurie said how about cheryl is she available youre striking out shes already out on a case should i have her call you when she returns you can relay a message laurie said yesterday i asked her to put in a request for hospital charts from saint francis hospital out in queens id like her to amend the request and make it urgent i need them as soon as possible no problem bart said as he made a note on a postit ill put this on cheryls desk consider it done laurie headed back toward the id office to retrieve her coat but she thought of jack down in the pit doing the autopsy on clark mulhausen he would have the folder with janices investigative report which would have all the particulars reversing her course she headed for the back elevator not only could she make sure mulhausen fit the demographics of her series shed have an excuse to talk with jack remembering her waffling the previous afternoon outside of jacks office it would be good to have a professional reason to break the ice with him and give her the opportunity to suggest that they get together away from the ocme for a personal discussion the thought of the kind of conversation she needed to have with him made her tense in his current state of mind she had no idea whether or not hed be receptive either to meet with her or to what she had to tell him lou had suggested he would be but laurie didnt know in days past a gown a hat and a mask were all that was needed to drop into the autopsy room for a visit to check out a finding or have a short conversation times had changed now laurie had to go into the locker room and change into scrubs before heading over to the supply room to get into her full protective gear as if she was doing a case herself calvin had established the new rules and they were supposedly cut in stone ahhh laurie whimpered as she extended her arm while hanging up her blouse in the locker she had gotten a sudden stitch in that same abdominal location that had been intermittently troubling her over the previous few days this time it was definitely a sharp pain that made her wince as well as withdraw her hand gingerly she placed it over the bothersome area thankfully the pain quickly eased and then disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared carefully she pressed in over the area but there was no residual tenderness she extended her arm as she had done when hanging the blouse but still there was no discomfort shaking her head with confusion over whether it had anything to do with being pregnant she thought maybe she should ask sue whether she had experienced anything similar during her two pregnancies with the memory of the pain fading into the background laurie continued changing into scrubs and then headed across the hall to climb into her moon suit a few minutes later she pushed into the autopsy room as the heavy door thumped against the jamb behind her the two people in the room straightened up from bending over the body splayed open in front of them they both looked over at her well glory be jack quipped is this really dr montgomery already in full regalia and it is not even eight oclock to what do we owe this great honor i just want to find out if this case truly fits into my series laurie said as lightly as she could while bracing herself for jacks probable continued sarcasm she advanced to the foot of the table jack was on her left and vinnie on her right please go back to work i dont mean to interrupt i dont want you to think i took this case away from you do you know why im doing it i do chet told me have you seen calvin yet i couldnt read him this morning he was acting weird is everything hunkydory between you two everything is fine i was worried myself when chet told me i was to have an official paper day and that calvin wanted to see me asap it turned out that all he wants is for me to sign out the earlier cases in my series im supposed to say they were natural are you going to do it im thinking theres no way they were natural i dont have a lot of choice laurie admitted he laid it on the line i hate the political pressures of this job of which this situation is becoming a prime example but be that as it may whats your take on mulhausen does this case belong in my series jack looked down into the corpses open thorax hed already removed the lungs and was in the process of opening the great vessels the heart was in full view so far id have to say yes the demographics are the same and i dont see any suggestion of pathology of any note ill know for sure in a half hour or so when i finish with the heart but ill be very surprised if we find anything do you mind if i look at the investigators report in the folder mind why would i mind but i can save you the trouble by giving you the facts the patient was a healthy thirtysixyearold stockbroker whod had an uncomplicated hernia repair yesterday morning and was doing fine fourthirty this morning he was discovered dead in his bed the nurses notes said he was practically room temperature when he was found but they tried to resuscitate him anyway obviously they got nothing so do i think he fits your series i do whats more i think you are genuinely onto something with this series idea obviously i didnt at first but i do now especially now that youve got seven cases laurie tried to see the nuances of jacks expression but she couldnt through his plastic screen still she was encouraged somewhat like calvin he was acting more affable than expected and it made her feel optimistic on a number of fronts what about those cases dick katzenburg mentioned yesterday jack asked have they panned out so far yes at least from the investigators reports im waiting for the hospital charts to be certain it was a good pickup jack said yesterday when you got up to go to the microphone to give your little presentation i was pissed since it meant that the thursdayafternoon torture session was going to be extended but now i have to give you credit if dicks cases do turn out to match yours your series doubles which kind of casts a pall over americare wouldnt you say i dont know what it says about americare laurie said she was surprised at jacks talkativeness even that seemed encouraging well as the saying goes somethings rotten in denmark at thirteen cases its gone way beyond coincidence but its interesting theres no smokinggun commonality which is why i hesitate to support your homicide idea although im warming to it tell me have any of the cases occurred in the intensive care unit or the postanesthesia care unit none of mine i dont know about dicks mine have all been in regular hospital rooms why do you ask was mulhausen in either no he was in a normal room im not sure why im asking maybe because drugs are handled differently in either the icu or the pacu than they are on a regular hospital floor actually im trying to think of some sort of systems error like they are all getting a drug that they are not supposed to get its just something else to consider thanks for the suggestion laurie said without a lot of conviction ill keep it in mind i also think you should continue to press toxicology i still think that ultimately its going to be toxicology that solves this conundrum thats easy to say but i dont know what else i can do peter letterman has really gone out of his way trying to the point of thinking about minutiae yesterday he was talking about checking into some kind of unbelievablely potent toxin from a southamerican frog whoa thats a bit far afield that calls to mind the adage when you hear hoof beats think of horses not zebras something is interrupting these peoples cardiac conduction system i cant help but believe its got to be a gardenvariety arrhythmia drug how they are getting it is another story but that certainly would have shown up in toxicology thats true jack agreed what about a contaminant in their iv fluid have they all had ivs running laurie thought for a minute now that you mention it they have but its not unusual since most people whove had surgery keep an iv for at least twentyfour hours as far as a contaminant in the iv fluid is concerned it passed through my mind but it is extremely unlikely if a contaminant were involved wed have more cases than we have and it certainly wouldnt favor the relatively young and healthy nor just patients having had elective surgery i dont think you should eliminate anything out of hand jack said which reminds me of the question about electrolytes the fellow from staten island asked you yesterday after you made your presentation you told him the levels all tested normal is that true absolutely i made it a point to ask peter to check into that specifically and he reported back that they were all normal well it certainly sounds as if you are covering all the bases jack said ill finish up with mulhausen just to be sure theres no emboli or cardiac pathology he repositioned the scalpel in his hand and bent over the corpse im trying to think of all the possibilities laurie said then after a moments hesitation she added jack could i speak to you for a moment on a personal note oh for christs sake vinnie said suddenly hed been impatiently shifting his weight from one foot to the other during laurie and jacks extended conversation cant we get this freaking autopsy done jack straightened back up and looked at laurie what is it you want to talk about laurie glanced at vinnie she felt awkward in his presence especially considering his impatience jack noticed lauries reaction dont mind vinnie with as much help as he is as an assistant you can just pretend hes not here i do it all the time very funny vinnie responded how come im not laughing actually laurie said i dont want to talk with you now what id like to do is arrange for us to get together there are some important things i need to share with you jack didnt answer right away but rather stared at laurie through the plastic face masks let me guess he said finally youre getting married and you want me to be a bridesmaid vinnie laughed so hard it sounded as if he was choking hey it wasnt that funny jack protested although he was now laughing along with vinnie jack laurie said maintaining a calm voice with some difficulty im trying to be serious i am too jack managed and since you havent denied the nuptials ill consider myself informed but im afraid im going to have to decline the bridesmaid offer was there anything else jack laurie repeated im not getting married i need to talk with you about something that involves you and me okay fine im all ears im not about to talk to you here in the autopsy room jack made a gesture around the room with all its gothic details whats wrong with this i feel quite at home in here jack could you be serious for a moment i said it was important okay fine what other venue do we have at our disposal that would better suit your needs if you give me a half hour or so i could meet you upstairs in the id office and we could chat over a nice cup of vinnies coffee the only problem with that is that the other hoi polloi will just be arriving for their workday perhaps youd prefer we rendezvous in our scenic secondfloor lunchroom and have something delectable out of the vending machines there we could hobnob with the janitorial staff whats your preference laurie eyed jack as best she could through the plastic face shields his reversion to angry sarcasm seriously eroded her earlier optimism about his receptivity but she pressed on what i was hoping is that we could have dinner tonight possibly at elios if we could somehow manage a reservation elios was a restaurant that had played a role in laurie and jacks long relationship for another extended moment jack stared back at laurie although the day before hed not given lous comments about laurie much credence he suddenly wondered if there had been a germ of truth to what hed said at the same time jack reminded himself that he was in no mood for further humiliation whats the matter with romeo is he sick tonight vinnie chuckled again and then tried to suppress it when laurie glared at him i dont know jack continued its kind of short notice considering i was supposed to go bowling tonight with seventeen nuns from out of town vinnie lost control and left the table he wandered over to the sink and busied himself could you please be serious for a moment laurie repeated youre not making this easy im not making it easy jack questioned superciliously thats a switch i tried for months to arrange spending an evening with you but you were always heading off to some major cultural event its only been a month and you asked me twice and both nights i had plans i need to talk with you jack will you see me tonight or not it sounds like you are really motivated about this rendezvous im very motivated laurie agreed okay tonight it is what time is elios all right jack shrugged its fine then ill call to see if i can make a reservation and ill let you know it might have to be on the early side since its friday night okay jack said ill wait to hear from you with a final nod laurie left the table opened the door to the hallway and walked back to the storeroom to get out of her protective suit she was pleased that jack had finally agreed to get together but as calvin had suggested earlier she felt browbeaten about getting jack to commit to their meeting and sensing his anger she was no longer particularly optimistic about how he was going to react to her news after getting into her street clothes and rescuing her coat from the id room laurie took the elevator up to the fourth floor her idea was to pay peter a quick visit to give him a morale boost for his efforts and to make sure he hadnt struck gold with either sobczyk or lewis as preoccupied as she was with personal thoughts she didnt even consider the possibility of having to confront her nemesis the laboratory director john devries unfortunately he was in peters office apparently in the process of dressing down peter he had his hands angrily thrust onto his hips and peter had a sheepish expression on his face laurie had unknowingly run headlong into the fray such timing john exclaimed if it isnt the seductress herself excuse me laurie questioned with such a sexist comment she could feel her own ire rising apparently you have been able to seduce peter into becoming your own laboratory slave john snarled you and i have had this discussion before dr montgomery with the pittance im allocated to run this lab no one gets special service which invariably makes everyone else wait that much longer do i make myself clear or do you want me to write it out for you furthermore you can be sure that dr bingham and dr washington will be notified of this situation meanwhile i want you out of here to emphasize his point john gestured toward the door for a moment laurie looked back and forth between johns gaunt face and peters the last thing she wanted to do was make things any worse for peter so she refrained from telling john what she thought of him instead she turned around and walked out of the lab as laurie climbed the stairs she felt more depressed than she had earlier she hated runins with people particularly people she had to work with they often lead to inappropriate emotional responses like the one shed had earlier with calvin although on this occasion with john anger was ascendant thinking of calvin she vaguely wondered what the fallout would be since john invariably made good on his threats she thought the chances were good that shed hear from the deputy chief and what that would mean she had no idea she truly hoped she hadnt caused any longterm problem for peter since he had to deal with john on a daily basis entering her office laurie closed the door behind her she hung up her coat and noticed rivas hanging on its hook which meant riva was down in either the id office or the autopsy room laurie sat down and thought about the telephone call she had to make shed been dreading it since the pregnancy test had been positive in her mind it was as if the process of making the call would finally and ultimately confirm the reality of her being pregnant she had been trying to deny it to some degree because of how big a mistake it was as much as she wanted to have children this was not the time and she questioned what had gone through her mind to allow her to take the risk even though it was only a few weeks ago she truly couldnt remember reaching for the phone laurie reluctantly placed the call to the manhattan general hospital as the connection went through she looked down at the material from the queens cases which she needed to add to her matrix along with the case jack was currently doing when the operator came on the line laurie asked to be connected with dr laura rileys office as the extension began to ring laurie was thankful that sue happened to fix her up with a gyn doctor who also did ob in the current medical malpractice milieu that certainly was not always the case when dr rileys scheduling secretary answered laurie explained her situation she found herself stumbling over her words when she revealed she was pregnant according to an otc test kit well in that case we certainly cannot wait until september the secretary said brightly dr riley likes to see her obstetrics patients at eight to ten weeks after the last period where are you its been about seven weeks laurie said then we should see you next week or the week after there was a pause laurie realized that her hand holding the phone was trembling how about next friday the secretary said coming back on the line thats a week from today at onethirty that will be fine laurie said thank you for squeezing me in my pleasure now can i have your name im sorry i didnt realize i didnt give it to you im dr laurie montgomery dr montgomery i remember you i spoke with you yesterday laurie winced her secret was now quasipublic even though she had never met the secretary the woman now knew a terribly private intimate detail about her life that laurie had not yet decided how she was going to handle difficult choices would have to be made congratulations the secretary continued hold the line im sure that dr riley would want to say hello without a chance to respond laurie found herself on hold listening to music for a brief moment she thought about hanging up but she decided she couldnt do it to keep her mind in check she looked down at the stack of death certificates and investigative reports from queens anxious for a diversion she picked up the first and began reading the patients name was kristin svensen age twentythree who had been admitted to st francis hospital for a hemorrhoidectomy laurie shook her head at the dimensions of the tragedy it made her problems seem small compared to the death of a healthy young woman in a hospital after having her hemorrhoids removed dr montgomery i just heard the good news congratulations you can call me laurie fair enough and you can call me laura im not sure congratulations are in order to be perfectly frank this is an unexpected and rather an inconvenient surprise for me so im not sure how i feel about it i see said laura reigning in her exuberance then with sensitivity born of experience she added we still have to make sure you and the conceptus are as healthy as possible have there been any problems a bit of morning sickness but its been very transient laurie found herself uncomfortable talking about the pregnancy and wanted to get off the line let us know if it gets any worse there are lots of suggestions for dealing with it in the thousands of pregnancy books available as for books my advice is to stay away from the most conservative ones because theyll drive you crazy thinking you cant do anything like take a hot bath with that said well see you next friday laurie thanked her and hung up the phone it was a relief to get the call behind her picking up the computer printouts of the cases from queens she tapped them against the surface of her desk to align them the motion caused an almost subliminal unpleasant sensation in the same location where shed had the pain while down in the locker room she wondered if she should have at least mentioned the feeling and pain to laura riley she thought she should have but wasnt about to call her back instead shed bring it up during her appointment unless it became frequent or intense enough to warrant a call she also wondered if she should have mentioned about being positive for the brca marker but as with the discomfort she decided it would be perfectly appropriate to discuss it on her first visit with the papers in one hand laurie reached for the phone again but then hesitated with her hand on the receiver she had it in her mind to call roger for several reasons not the least of which was feeling guilty about leaving him in the dark about what must have seemed strange behavior in his office but she didnt know what she was going to say she wasnt yet willing to tell him the whole truth for a number of reasons but she knew she would have to say something ultimately she decided shed use the brca issue as shed already done laurie picked up the phone and dialed rogers direct line what was really motivating her was her desire to take copies of the queens materials over to him so she could talk with him directly about them despite the turmoil in her mind from her personal problems shed come up with an idea about the cases from queens that might possibly solve the mystery of sads fourteen when laurie got over to the manhattan general hospital she was ushered directly into rogers office where he was waiting for her the first thing he did was close the door then he gave her a sustained silent hug laurie hugged him back but not with equivalent ardor on top of the residuals from the marriage flap she knew she wasnt going to be entirely forthright with him about her own situation and it made her feel selfconscious if he noticed her restraint he didnt mention it after the embrace he turned his two straightbacked chairs around to face each other just as he had done the day before he had laurie sit in one and he took the other im glad to see you he said i missed you last night he was leaning forward into her space with his hands clasped and his elbows on his knees laurie was close enough to smell his aftershave lotion his day was just beginning his fresh shirt still had the telltale creases from the laundry box im glad to see you too laurie said she reached out and handed him the investigative reports and the death certificates on the six cases from queens she hadnt had time to make copies but it didnt matter she could just as easily download them again by giving him the material she hoped to deflect the conversation away from her mental state at least for the moment besides she was eager to tell him her idea roger scanned the pages quickly my word they do seem similar to ours even to the extent of occurring at around the same time in the morning thats my take ill know more details when i get the hospital charts but for the sake of the discussion lets assume they are mirror images does that suggest anything to you roger looked down at the papers thought for a moment and then shrugged it means the number of cases has doubled we now have twelve cases not six no we have thirteen including the death last night i assume youve heard about clark mulhausen are you going to be doing the autopsy no jack is doing it laurie said she had told roger a little about jack during their fiveweek courtship including the fact that she and jack had been lovers when laurie had first met roger she had described herself as mostly unattached later when she and roger had gotten to know each other better she had admitted that she had used that particular description of herself because of unresolved issues with jack she had even gone to the extent of confiding that the problem involved jacks reluctance to make a commitment roger had accepted the news with great equanimity which had enhanced lauries estimation of his maturity and selfconfidence and the issue had never resurfaced look at the dates on the queens cases laurie suggested roger again glanced through the papers then looked up they were all in the late fall of last year the last one was in the latter part of november exactly laurie said they were clumped pretty close together at a frequency of slightly more than one a week then they stopped does that suggest anything to you i suppose but it sounds like you have something specific in mind why dont you tell me fair enough but first listen you and i are the only ones who suspect we might be dealing with a serial killer but weve been effectively gagged i cant get the ocme to take a stand on the manner of death and you cant get the hospital authorities even to admit theres a problem what were fighting here is institutional inertia both bureaucracies would rather sweep the issue under the rug until something forces their hand i cant argue with that whats held us so effectively in check from your side is that your hospital has such a good mortality rate that these deaths arent appearing on the radar from my side it is the failure of toxicology they still havent found anything remotely suspicious laurie shook her head and the chances they might in the near future just took a nosedive im afraid our crotchety laboratory director discovered my undercover effort this morning if i know him from now on hell make sure that any further work on our cases will go to the very back of the queue and even when he does get around to them hes surely not going to do anything special so where are you going with all this it means its up to us alone to try to root out this possible serial killer and wed better do something if were going to prevent any more senseless deaths weve known that practically from day one yes but up until now we have tried to work within the constraints of our institutions and our job descriptions i think we have to try something else and it seems to me these cases from queens present an opportunity if these deaths are homicides my guess is that there is one serial killer not two or more i suppose i had assumed as much since saint francis is another americare institution you should have reasonable access to their personnel database youre in the perfect position to get personnel information what we need is a list of people from janitors to anesthesiologists who worked the eleventoseven shift at saint francis in the fall and manhattan general in the winter once we have the list then we could check the people out this is where my idea gets a little fuzzy but if we could come up with a couple of credible suspects then maybe well be able to get the hospital or the ocme to take a stand a slight smile played across rogers craggy face as he nodded an elegant ideal im glad i thought of it he laughed and gave lauries thigh a playful pat you make it sound so simple but thats okay i think i should be able to cajole that kind of information out of someone and wouldnt it be interesting if it really came to something i mean i wonder if there really will be such a list i know another list that exists for sure a list of the professional staff with admitting privileges at both institutions i have direct access to it as chief of the medical staff that might even be a better idea than mine laurie admitted if i were asked who i would consider the most likely suspect in the hospital community id have to say a deranged doctor its passed through my mind that if these deaths are homicides then whoever is responsible must have a significant knowledge of physiology pharmacology and maybe even forensics otherwise wed already know how he or she is pulling it off and we both know which group of doctors is the most knowledgeable in those regards who anesthesiologists laurie nodded it was true that anesthesiologists would be the most skillful at dispatching patients yet despite her comments she had trouble believing as a doctor herself that a doctor could be behind the killings it seemed so contrary to a doctors role but then again it was contrary to the role of all healthcare professionals and of course there was the staggering case in england of a doctor suspected of murdering upwards of two hundred people how about jumping on this idea laurie suggested i know its friday and people are not excited about having a new task plopped in their laps just before the weekend but we have to do something and we have to do it fast and not only because it might prevent more deaths it might be that our supposed serial killer is also smart enough to know that it would be safer for him to move to another hospital after a certain number of episodes the assumption here is that he has moved once after six episodes so theres reason to believe he could move again after seven if he does then our equivalent colleagues at some other hospital maybe even in another city will be starting from square one that was one of the reasons that the other recent infamous healthcare serial killer here in the metropolitan area wasnt caught for so long hey queens might not have been his first hospital youre right laurie said with a shiver i never thought of that ill get right on it roger promised im on call all weekend laurie said which means ill probably be at the ocme so call me there whatever i can do to help id be happy to do i know the whole process will be more difficult than i have suggested well see maybe ill be able to find a computer nerd in personnel who could help us roger aligned the pages laurie had given him now i have something rather interesting to tell you about our cases by chance ive uncovered a curious commonality oh laurie questioned she was fascinated what is it now i dont mean to suggest that this is significant but it holds for all seven cases including mulhausen last night all of them were relatively recent americare subscribers having joined the plan within the year i actually discovered it by accident looking at their subscriber numbers for a moment laurie stared at roger and roger stared back laurie mulled over this new fact and tried to think how it could be connected nothing came to mind although it reminded her of jacks comment the day before during the afternoon conference when he learned st francis another americare institution had seemingly had a similar series of deaths like hers hed said the plot thickens shed not had a chance to ask him what he had meant nor did she follow up this morning when hed said the new cases cast a pall over americare but now that roger had told her this new fact she was even more eager to ask him to explain laurie knew that jack had a visceral hatred for americare which colored his thinking but still he was smart and also intuitive i really dont know if this is significant roger repeated but it is curious then it has to be significant in some form or fashion laurie said but i dont know how these victims have all been young and healthy americare actively recruits such customers its to their detriment to lose them i know it doesnt make sense but i thought i should inform you anyway im glad you did laurie said she stood up well ive got to get back the reason im not doing mulhausens autopsy is that i was supposed to go right up to my office and sign out mcgillin and morgans deaths as being natural this very morning not so fast roger said he caught lauries arm and with a little pressure eased her back down into her seat youre not getting away that easy but first whos forcing you to sign out the cases as natural the deputy chief calvin washington he claims that the chief harold bingham is getting pressure from the mayors office roger shook his head he had a disgusted expression on his face im not surprised considering what the hospital president said to me yesterday he said that i should know for my own good that americare wants this problem to fade into the woodwork thats hardly surprising it would be a pr nightmare but how does it come through the mayors office im new to the organization but ive gotten the sense that americare puts a lot of stock on being politically connected as evidenced by them landing the city contract i dont have to remind you that healthcare is big business and theres always a lot of lobbying going on about a myriad of issues laurie nodded as if she understood but she didnt im going to sign them out as natural deaths but im hoping with your help ill be changing the certificates in the near future enough of this business talk roger said more important how are you ive been really concerned and frankly ive had to hold myself back from calling you every fifteen minutes im sorry ive made you concerned laurie said as her mind frantically searched for a way to placate roger without lying and without telling him the crux of the problem but as i said yesterday im holding my own its just a difficult time for me i understand i tried to imagine how i would feel if i had been told i had a marker for a gene that was associated with developing cancer and then allowed to walk out the door the burgeoning field of medical genetics has to come up with a better way to present this kind of information to patients than they do now along with some reasonable cures as someone whos in the process of going through it id have to agree although the social worker did make an attempt but american medicine has always been like that technology has been the driving force pulling the sociology of patient care behind i wish i knew how to be more supportive for you im afraid at the moment you really cant be im caught up in my own personal odyssey but that doesnt mean im not appreciative of your thoughts and you have been supportive what about tonight can we get together laurie peered into rogers pale eyes it bothered her that she wasnt being forthright but she could not get herself to tell him she was pregnant and was having dinner with jack because she and jack had conceived a child it wasnt that she thought he couldnt handle it because she thought he could it was more because of her sense of privacy and until she told jack she didnt want to share it with anyone even someone she cared for such as roger we could have an early dinner roger urged we dont even have to talk about the brca issue if you dont want to maybe ill already have some personnel data from here or saint francis i mean its possible i could get some even though as you say its friday roger with everything that has happened to me recently i need some space at least for a few days thats the kind of support i need can you try to live with that yes but i dont like it i appreciate your understanding thank you laurie stood up again and roger did the same can i at least call you i suppose but i dont know how much ill want to talk maybe it would be better for me to call you im taking it a day at a time roger nodded and laurie did the same there was a brief awkward moment of silence before roger reached out and gave laurie another hug her response was as restrained as it had been earlier laurie flashed a weak smile and started to leave one other question roger said he stepped between laurie and the door does any part of this difficult time youve described have anything to do with my still being married to be honest i suppose a small amount laurie admitted i certainly regret not telling you and im sorry i know i should have earlier on but at first it seemed presumptuous youd care i mean id gotten to the point i didnt care myself like it was a nonissue then when we got to know each other and id fallen in love and i knew you would care i was embarrassed for not having told you sooner thank you for apologizing and explaining im sure it will help put the issue behind us thats my hope roger said he gave lauries shoulder a tender squeeze then opened his office door well talk laurie nodded for sure she agreed and then walked out roger watched laurie wend her way among the desks and start down the long corridor he watched her until she was out of sight then closed his door as he moved around his desk and sat down her scent wafted in the air like a wraith he was concerned about her and he was worried that hed botched their relationship by not being forthright with her and more damning he hadnt come clean he was still holding back things that she had the right to know if their relationship was to grow and worse yet he wasnt telling her the truth about things that hed already told her contrary to what he had suggested there were unresolved aspects of his relationship with his wife including unrequited love on his part which he had not had the courage to tell laurie even though she had had the courage to tell him something similar regarding her former boyfriend jack rogers biggest secret from everyone including his current employers was that he was a former addict while in thailand he had fallen into the trap of heroin addiction it had started innocently enough as a kind of experiment ostensibly so he could better understand and treat patients with the problem unfortunately he had underestimated the drugs seductiveness and his own weaknesses especially since the heroin was so freely available it was at this time that his wife and children left him for the protection of her powerful family it was also the reason he was transferred to africa and eventually dismissed from the organization and even though he had gone through an extensive program of rehabilitation and had been reasonably drugfree for years the specter of the addiction problem still haunted him every day one problem was that he knew he drank too much he loved wine and was surreptitiously drinking at least a bottle a night which made him worry that he was allowing alcohol to become a substitute for heroin as a physician particularly one whod gone through rehab he knew the risks roger would have agonized longer but luckily he had the series of suspicious deaths to occupy his thoughts although he had been curious about them on his own it was lauries commitment to them that had fanned his interest hed used the series to foster a relationship with her and it had worked superbly as the weeks had gone by hed become enthralled with her and began to think that his idea of coming back to the states to salvage some kind of normal life with a new wife new kids and the proverbial white picket fence were within his grasp then with a slip of the tongue disaster had struck now he needed the series more than ever as a kind of glue to hold things together the sooner he got the employee lists she suggested the better if he was really lucky and came up with something he could call her that evening and take it over to her apartment roger used the intercom on the phone to get in touch with caroline the most efficient secretary he asked her to come into his office next he got out the hospital phone directory and looked up the director of the human resources department his name was bruce martin roger copied down his extension number and while he was doing so caroline appeared and hovered expectantly in the doorway i need some names and phone numbers over at saint francis hospital roger called out his voice reflected his sudden zeal i want to talk to the chief of the medical staff and the director of human resources as soon as possible should i get them on the line caroline asked or do you want to make the call yourself get them on the line roger ordered meanwhile ill have a quick chat with our own mr bruce martin as laurie came through the front door of the ocme office she glanced at her watch she was appalled it was almost noon the taxi ride from the manhattan general hospital had taken an incredible hour and a half she shook her head new york could be like that with all of midtown snarled in traffic like an enormous blood clot the driver had explained that some major dignitary was in town although he didnt know whom unfortunately the visit required certain streets to be closed off for the motorcade as soon as that happened the entire central portion of the city came to a screeching halt marlene buzzed laurie in through the main door such that laurie had to pass the administration area she was afraid to look through open door lest calvin catch sight of her if she had known she was going to be gone for so long she would have filled out the two pesky death certificates before she left luckily the elevator was waiting so laurie didnt have to stand fully exposed in the main hall to anyone coming out of administration as she rode up she wondered if roger would follow up on her suggestion and do the detective work she proposed the more she thought about the idea the more optimistic she became that it would lead to something but even if it didnt it would at least give her the feeling that something was being done about the problem she didnt even want to think about the individual tragedies that the deaths of young healthy people in the prime of their lives were causing for their families and loved ones getting off on the fifth floor laurie walked quickly down to her office the door was ajar riva was there but on the phone laurie hung up her coat and sat down centered on her blotter were a series of postit notes in rivas crisp handwriting three said merely jack came in two said calvin came in followed by several exclamation points the final one said to call cheryl meyers hastily laurie opened the drawer where she kept the material from her potential serialkiller series and pulled out the mcgillin and morgan folders from each she took the partially completed death certificates then reached for a pen the first certificate was mcgillins and she positioned the pen over the place on the form where she had to indicate the manner of death but she hesitated as a mental battle raged between her responsibility of duty as ordered by a superior and her sense of ethics for her it was akin to a soldier being ordered to do something that wasnt right for which he could be held responsible the only saving grace was that in lauries situation it was not an irrevocable act and it could be changed with a sigh she completed both forms at that point riva hung up her phone and spun around where have you been ive tried your cell phone a dozen times i was over at the manhattan general laurie said she opened her bag felt around for her phone took it out and checked the lcd screen well thats the explanation why i didnt get your call i cant seem to remember to turn the blasted thing on im sorry calvins been in here twice i wrote two notes so youd get the message if you came in when i wasnt here to say the least hes not very happy you disappeared i know what its about laurie said as she held up the two death certificates this is what he was looking for so all should be okay i hope so he was fit to be tied i see jack stopped by as well thats the understatement of the year he was here twenty times well thats a bit of an exaggeration but even he got a little sarcastic with his comments toward the end laurie inwardly groaned after the effort shed expended getting jack to agree to have dinner that night she hoped her absence hadnt frustrated him enough that hed call off their date did jack say what he wanted no just that he was looking for you as for the last message from cheryl she said it wasnt important but for you to give her a call laurie got up clutching the two death certificates thanks for being a messenger service i owe you it wasnt a problem riva said but out of curiosity what were you doing over at the manhattan general for so long actually i spent more time in the taxis than i did at the hospital but i went over there because i had an idea that might help with my supposed serialkiller series what is it ill tell you later right now im going to take these death certificates down to calvin in person to smooth the waters what should i say to jack if he happens to come by yet again tell him ill be stopping by his office after i see calvin laurie retraced her steps to the elevator feeling a twinge of guilt about not sharing her most current problem with riva yet short of the ob office she knew she didnt want to tell anyone that she was pregnant until shed told jack of course she knew that if sharing it with jack turned out to be as bad as it could possibly be she might not be sharing it with anyone else as the elevator descended laurie glanced at the nowcompleted death certificates even though they could be changed and in her estimation probably would it still bothered her that shed been forced to compromise her professionalism by filling them out as she had it seemed to her that kowtowing to the needs of bureaucracy was not only ethically repugnant but also a disservice to the memory of the victims once in administration laurie had to sit on the couch to wait calvins door was closed and his secretary connie egan told her the deputy chief was closeted with a police captain laurie wondered if it was michael orourke lous immediate boss who was an inlaw to the manhattan general mugging victim while she waited she thought about what she was going to say to jack if hed been looking for her as hard as riva had suggested it was inevitable hed ask where shed been if he were as jealous as lou suggested it was not going to help if he learned that laurie had gone over to see roger immediately after getting jack to commit to having dinner yet laurie promised herself that she wasnt going to fall into the trap of lying thinking about jack reminded her that shed not made a dinner reservation since it was now afternoon she knew it was an appropriate time she eyed the phone on the side table next to where she was sitting with no one paying her any heed laurie called riva to get the number from her address book on her desk and then put in the call as she expected the restaurant was heavily booked and laurie had to settle for a fivefortyfive reservation calvins door opened and a bulky quintessentially irishappearing police officer in his dress blues emerged he shook hands with calvin nodded to connie and even laurie put on his hat and left as lauries eyes turned back to calvin she found herself transfixed by his stare get in here calvin barked laurie got to her feet and sheepishly passed him to stand inside his office calvin shut his door came over to laurie and snatched the papers from her hands he leaned his backside against his desk while he checked the certificates satisfied he tossed them onto his desk its about time calvin said where the hell have you been i gave you a paper day to do paperwork not to go gallivanting around i made what i thought was going to be a quick visit to the manhattan general hospital unfortunately the traffic didnt cooperate and it turned into a much longer errand than id expected calvin eyed laurie suspiciously and what were you doing over there if i may ask i was talking with the gentleman i mentioned yesterday the chief of the medical staff youre not going to do anything that will turn out to be an embarrassment to the department i trust not that i can imagine i gave him the information about the queens cases its in his hands to do whatever he thinks is appropriate i dont want to hear youre overstepping your bounds like youve done in the past as i said yesterday ive learned my lesson laurie knew she was again being less than forthright i should hope so now get your butt upstairs and sign out the rest of your cases or youll be out pounding the pavement for alternative employment laurie nodded respectfully and left calvins office she was relieved she had expected the worst but the visit turned out to be surprisingly tame she wondered if calvin was mellowing while she was on the first floor laurie poked her head into the forensic investigators office to see if she could save herself a call she found cheryl busy at her desk and asked her what was on her mind i just wanted to let you know that i called saint francis and changed the chart request to urgent shucks when i saw your message i was hoping maybe youd gotten them already cheryl laughed overnight hospitalchart service thatll be the day well be lucky to see them in a couple of weeks even with the urgent classification laurie went back to the front elevator and as she waited she wondered if it would be helpful if roger intervened as far as the charts were concerned in the back of her mind she had the sense that somewhere in the charts from either st francis or the manhattan general there would be some hidden piece of information that would be the keystone of the mystery gaining the fifth floor laurie hesitated for a moment building up her courage she wanted to drop in to jacks office to talk with him but was concerned about what shed be confronting after what riva had said although laurie accepted that the current estrangement with jack was largely her fault due to the affair with roger it didnt make it any easier at the same time she was not about to apologize taking a fortifying breath laurie started down the hall in contrast to the day before she didnt hesitate she let her momentum carry her all the way into the room where she found both jack and chet bent over their respective desks peering into their microscopes although she hadnt been trying shed come in silently such that neither man knew she was there id be willing to bet five bucks im right jack was saying youre on chet responded excuse me laurie called with obvious surprise both mens heads bobbed up and turned to face their visitor forsooth jack exclaimed speak of the devil the ghost of the missing dr montgomery has just materialized in our midst miraculous chet added he drew back pretending to be terrified come on you guys laurie said im in no mood to be made fun of thank god shes real jack said as if relieved he pressed the back of his hand against his forehead in the stereotypical fainting gesture in a similar fashion chet put his hand to his chest as if he were experiencing palpitations come on knock it off laurie said while looking from one to the other it seemed to her that they were carrying the charade a bit too far we thought you were gone for good chet explained with a snicker the rumor was that it had been a sudden dematerialization as the days scheduler i was supposed to know where you were but i had no idea even marlene in reception didnt see you leave marlene had stepped away from her desk when i went out laurie said it was apparent to her that her absence had been the subject of speculation which under the circumstances was not a good sign were all a little curious about where you did go since according to calvin you were supposed to be in your office what is this the spanish inquisition laurie asked hoping a bit of humor would deflect the question she looked directly at jack riva said you stopped by so im returning the favor was there something specific on your mind i was going to give you the final lowdown on mulhausens autopsy jack said but first we are all truly curious about where you so mysteriously went cant you fill us in weve got a lot of money riding on it lauries eyes flicked back and forth between the two men they were watching her expectantly this was the question she feared and she frantically tried to think up an appropriate response without lying nothing came to mind i went over to the manhattan general hospital laurie began but jack cut her off bingo jack said he pointed at chet with his fingers positioned to make his hand appear like a gun you owe me five bucks hotshot chet rolled his eyes in apparent disappointment shifted his weight to get his wallet out of his back pocket and plopped a fivedollar bill in jacks waiting hand jack clutched the money triumphantly and looked back at laurie looks like i get to profit from your assignation after all laurie felt her ire rising but she held it in check she didnt like this public gamesmanship at her expense i went over to the manhattan general because i had an idea that might solve the mystery of my serialkiller series oh sure jack said and just by coincidence you had to share this idea with your current flame i think ill head down and get some coffee chet said hastily getting to his feet you dont have to go on my accord laurie said i think i will just the same chet responded its time for lunch he stepped out of the office and pulled the door shut behind him for a moment laurie and jack eyed each other lets put it this way jack said breaking the silence i find it demeaning that you would spend considerable effort convincing me to have dinner with you and then immediately disappear for four hours to see the man with whom you are currently having an affair i can understand and im sorry it didnt dawn on me that it would affect you like this oh please put yourself in my position well after the fact i must admit i was afraid you would ask where i had gone but jack i went only for the reason i said the queens cases gave me an idea of how i might be able to come up with a list of potential suspects it was not a tryst dont belittle me with that kind of talk jack tossed chets fivedollar bill onto his desk lowered his eyes and rubbed his forehead jack believe me part of the reason i had the idea i did was your comments about the plot thickening and a pall being over americare in fact i wanted to ask you what you meant specifically im not sure i had anything specific in mind jack said without taking his hand from his forehead its just that if your series jumps to thirteen cases at two hospitals both of which are americare institutions it makes you wonder laurie nodded i thought you had something about managed care in mind if these are murders im getting the impression they are not random the demographics are too similar for instance i learned today that all of them at least those at the manhattan general have been relatively recent americare subscribers how that fits into the picture i havent a clue jack took his hand away and looked up at laurie so youre now thinking this might be some kind of conspiracy thing laurie nodded i thought that was what you were implying from your comments not really and from a capitation standpoint it doesnt make sense so it cant have anything to do with managed care per se on the other hand medicine has become big business and americare is one enormous organization that means there are actuarial types and their bosses who are so far removed from patient care that they forget what the product of the company ultimately is they see everything in terms of numbers that may be true laurie said but getting rid of new healthy subscribers is diametrically counterproductive to any actuarial goal it might seem that way to us but my point is that there are people involved at high levels whom we cannot hope to understand some kind of conspiracy still could be involved whose rationale might not be immediately apparent maybe so laurie said vaguely she was disappointed she thought jack might have something specific to offer laurie and jack gazed at each other for a few beats it was jack who broke the silence let me ask you something straightout that i alluded to down in the pit is this dinner date tonight some kind of elaborate setup to tell me youre getting married because if it is im going to go ballistic i just want to warn you about that laurie didnt answer right away because the comment reminded her of how complicated everything in her life had become it was hard for her to keep everything and everybody in perspective this silence is not giving me a good feeling jack warned i am not getting married laurie said with sudden vehemence jabbing her finger at jack i told you that in no uncertain terms down in the autopsy room i told you that i needed to talk to you about something that involves you and me and no one else i dont think you included that no one else part down in the pit well i am now laurie barked all right all right calm down im the one thats supposed to be upset not you youd be upset if you were me now thats a statement i cant interpret without a bit more information but you know laurie i hate to see us going at each other like this were like two blind people flailing away in the dark i couldnt agree more well then why dont you tell me whatever it is you need to tell me and put it behind us i dont want to talk about it here in this setting i want to be away from the ocme it has nothing to do with work and i dont want to be here i made a reservation at elios at fivefortyfive whoa is that going to be dinner or a late lunch very funny laurie said impatiently i warned you it might have to be early its friday night and they are booked i was lucky to get what i did are you going to be there or not ill be there but its going to be a big sacrifice warren is going to be disappointed i wont be showing up on the basketball court for the big fridaynight run well actually thats a lie ive been playing so poorly since you left that he wont have me on his team ive become a relative persona non grata on my own court ill see you at elios laurie said provided you deign to show up she turned and walked out of the office jack leaped from his chair and holding onto the doorjamb he leaned out into the hall laurie was already a good distance down the corridor in the direction of her office there was no hesitancy in her step and she was moving at a good clip hey he called out saying it was a sacrifice meeting you for dinner was supposed to be a joke laurie didnt slow or turn around and soon disappeared from view into her office jack righted himself and regained his desk chair he wondered if he had overdone his sarcasm he shrugged because knowing himself it would have been hard for him not to do otherwise such repartee had become his defense against the uncertainties of life in the current situation he feared he was going to be blindsided by laurie in some form or fashion he had no idea what was on lauries mind yet lous comment that she wanted to patch things up still resonated and gave him a sliver of hope the combination of street basketball and work was usually jacks solace and with basketball not as satisfying as hed explained to laurie work had taken over during the previous five weeks jack had been a virtual workhorse within the time frame of slightly more than a month hed gone from calvins nightmare in respect to getting cases signed out to calvins darling not only was jack doing significantly more cases than anyone else he was getting them out faster jack returned to his microscope and the trays of slides hed just brought down from histology that morning time flew by chet returned and jack insisted that chet take back his fiver with the explanation that the bet hadnt been fair be cause jack had been a hundred percent certain after a time chet had gone out again but jack labored on the progress he made calmed him and gave him a sense of satisfaction but best of all it made it possible not to think about laurie hey come up for air a voice said breaking jacks concentration hed been staring at a strange hepatic parasite hed stumbled onto in the liver of a gunshotwound case he looked up to see lou soldano standing in his doorway ive been watching you for five minutes and you havent moved a damn muscle jack waved the detective into the office with one hand while he turned chets chair around with the other lou sat down heavily and tossed his hat onto chets desk he was wearing his usual sleepdeprived face such that he had wrinkled his forehead to keep his eyes open i just heard the good news lou said i think its great what are you talking about i just stuck my head in lauries office she told me you and she have a date tonight at elios and that she asked you out what did i tell you she wants to get back together did she tell you that specifically no not specifically but come on i mean she asked you out to dinner she said she wanted to tell me something but maybe its something i dont want to hear god what a pessimist you sound as bad as me the woman loves you yeah well its news to me how did she happen to tell you we have a date anyway i asked her i dont hide the fact that i want you two back together and she knows it well see jack said meanwhile whats on your mind the freaking chapman case of course weve been working flat out and have interviewed just about everybody over at the hospital unfortunately nobody saw anybody suspicious not that thats so strange but weve got nothing i was hoping that you might have come up with something i know my captain came over to talk with calvin washington thats weird calvin doesnt know anything about the case and he didnt talk with me lou shrugged i thought maybe you had anyway do you have anything at all i havent gotten the slides back but theyre not going to tell us anything you got the slugs which i think is about all youre going to get from the autopsy what about the positioning of the victim and the fact that whoever shot her was probably sitting in the car are you working on the angle that the victim might have known the perpetrator were working every angle i tell you we are interviewing everybody that had access to that garage the problem is we have no prints except for the shell casings weve got nothing sorry not to have been more help jack said on another subject did laurie say anything about her series of suspicious deaths that i mentioned to you yesterday no she didnt im surprised jack said things are hopping in that regard shes up to seven cases now at the manhattan general including one i posted today plus shes come across six others at a hospital out in queens interesting i think its more than interesting in fact im starting to believe shes was right about this from the start i think she might be on to a serial killer no kidding no kidding so maybe youd better start thinking about getting involved whats the official take are calvin and bingham on board too hardly in fact i found out laurie was pressured to sign out her first cases as natural deaths by calvin who was pressured by bingham who was pressured by somebody over in the mayors office sounds political which means our hands are tied well at least i warned you fifteen jack put some serious muscle into his pedaling and his bike responded he was presently streaking past the united nations building heading north on first avenue although the fivethirty traffic was at its peak jack had no altercations with any of the drivers he had scaled back his aggressiveness to a degree following the recent arrival at the morgue of one of the citys many bicycle messengers that poor fellow had had a dispute with a sanitation truck for which he paid dearly when jack saw him in the morgue his head had the diameter of large beach ball but the thickness of a quarter ahead loomed the massively pillared viaduct of the queensboro bridge jack clicked into a higher gear as the roadway began to drop away in a gradual decline with the help of gravity jack was neck and neck with the traffic and the wind was whistling through his helmet as usual the exhilaration gave him a sense of detachment and for a few minutes all his cares worries and bad memories evaporated in a wash of endorphins earlier that afternoon jack had turned off his microscope light put his desk in order and walked down to lauries office with the idea of discussing with her how they should get to the restaurant but hed found her desk empty just like he had on his many visits that morning on this occasion riva had explained that she had gone back to her apartment to change clothes jack gathered that his expression had been one of surprise because riva had gone on to explain that it was a woman thing although that explanation only confused him more lauries attire had been perfectly appropriate for their early dinner more than anyone else at the ocme laurie always dressed in a smart feminine fashion just beyond the queensboro bridge the traffic snarled with backedup cars vying to get onto the ramp leading to the fdr drive north jack was reduced to slaloming between stopped cars buses and trucks until he was able to worm his way across the gridlocked rd street intersection breaking away from the pack he stood up on his pedals to regain his speed from that point north jack had no trouble at the corner of nd street and second avenue jack went up onto the sidewalk and dismounted he secured his bike and helmet to a no parking sign when he walked into elios he was only three minutes late jack stood by the mahogany bar just inside the door and took in the scene waiters in freshly laundered white aprons scurried about making sure the linentopped tables were in order there were few customers sprinkled around the narrow but deep interior to jacks immediate right was a round table occupied by a loud group several of whom jack vaguely recognized as tv people even though he didnt own a tv at first he didnt see laurie and thought he was the first to arrive the owner an elegantly tall woman approached him when jack said he was there for a reservation under the name of montgomery she took his leather bomber jacket which she immediately handed to an unoccupied waiter and motioned for jack to follow her halfway into the dining room he saw laurie at a table to the right engrossed in conversation with a mustached waiter in front of her was a bottle of sparkling italian water but no wine he knew how much laurie liked wine and in the past if he was ever late for a dinner together she always went ahead and ordered a bottle why she didnt on this occasion he had no idea jack leaned over and gave laurie a fleeting kiss on the cheek before he even thought about whether he should do it or not he then shook hands with the waiter who was a remarkably friendly chap as jack sat down the waiter asked him if he wanted any wine yeah i guess jack said he looked at laurie you go ahead laurie said pointing to her water glass im going to stick with this oh jack questioned he was already slightly off guard at a dinner date where he had no idea what to expect he waffled for a moment then told the waiter to bring him a beer if laurie wasnt going to drink wine he wouldnt either he thought it was a matter of principle even if he had no idea what the principle was im glad you got here safely laurie said i was hoping after that courier case youd rethink the advisability of courting death on a daily basis jack nodded but didnt respond to him laurie looked radiant she was wearing one of his favorite outfits and he wondered if she had chosen it on purpose not only had she changed clothes she had washed her hair at the ocme laurie wore her hair either piled on top of her head or in a french braid but tonight it was down and cascaded over her shoulders to form a soft frame around her face you look great jack said thank you you look good too oh yeah sure jack said with obvious disbelief he looked down at his wrinkled chambray shirt mildly spotted dark blue knitted tie and slightly greasestained jeans next to lauries splendor he felt like the poor relation while the waiter was off getting jacks beer they made small talk about the numerous times they had been at the restaurant laurie mentioned the time she had brought paul sutherland into elios for a surprise meeting with jack and lou when she was thinking of marrying the man well that wasnt my favorite night here jack admitted it wasnt mine either laurie agreed the reason it comes to mind is that just yesterday lou brought it up out of the blue and said that you and he were jealous really well what does lou know i have to tell you just so you know i never thought you were jealous the waiter returned with jacks beer and a basket of bread would you like to hear the specials now or do you want to wait i think well wait for a few minutes laurie responded just give a yell the waiter said agreeably jack and laurie watched him head back into the kitchen im sorry about suggesting this afternoon that having dinner with you was a sacrifice jack said when they looked back at each other i didnt mean to hurt your feelings it was supposed to be funny thank you for your apology under normal circumstances i wouldnt have reacted as i did im afraid im not seeing much humor in things lately well i didnt get a chance to tell you that mulhausen was clean just as you suspected there was no pathology whatsoever on gross and talking about lou you should know that i told him that i was coming around to your serialkiller idea and that his department might want to look into it really and what did he say he wanted to know what the official ocme position was and i told him and he said under the circumstances with neither the ocme or the hospital taking a stand and the mayors office tangentially involved his hands were in a sense tied im going to try to change all that by coming up with a list of suspects actual suspects whoa that would certainly alter the landscape and strange that you should say that i had a new thought along those lines this should be interesting although the deaths in your series seem counterproductive to the actuarial interests of managed care there are a couple of ways they could be related to the managedcare phenomenon im listening managed care has had to be aggressive taking over practices and hospitals in an often hostile way your serial killer could be someone as angry at americare as i am i have to admit id harbored some murderous thoughts after americare gobbled up my practice if it werent for americare id still be a conservative ophthalmologist back in the midwest walking around in a glen plaid suit and struggling to put a couple of girls through college no matter how many times you tell me the story of your former life i find it hard to picture im sure i wouldnt recognize you i wouldnt recognize myself but your point is well taken a physician who has admitting privileges at manhattan general and saint francis hospital is one of the profiles that is being considered whats your other idea managedcare competition its a dogeatdog business world out there in the medical arena as the two local giants in the industry national health and americare have bumped heads in the past with some strikingly underhanded machinations coming to light i know national health has generally conceded new york to americare but they could have had a change of mind causing americare a major pr disaster which your series will be sooner or later would undoubtedly be a boon to national health and as long as im thinking in this vein any individual or group who wanted americare stock to tumble could be involved because once your series hits the media investors are going to turn away in droves good points laurie conceded i really hadnt thought of either one of those ideas thank you dont mention it jack took a long pull on his beer drinking it directly from the bottle laurie sipped her sparkling water the restaurant was awakening from its daytime slumber a few more patrons were seated a bar crowd had materialized raising the noise level with excited chatter and bursts of laughter noticing the break in jack and lauries conversation the waiter came over to ask if theyd like to order appetizers after laurie and jack exchanged glances to see if either objected they both nodded which keyed off an impressive performance on the waiters part he rattled off a long list of appetizer specials explaining each in painstaking detail despite the enticing recital laurie ordered an arugula salad and jack settled on calamari both were from the regular menu after the waiter had gone and left them alone again jack eyed laurie she had her head down while busily repositioning her flatware that was already perfectly well positioned jack sensed that she was tense after several more minutes went by what had started out as a mere pause in the conversation seemed to jack to become an awkward lull he adjusted himself on the hard seat and after a glance around the room to make sure they were being appropriately ignored he broke the silence when would you like to talk about your important whatever that involves you and me and no one else is it an appetizer subject an entree subject or a dessert subject laurie looked up jack tried to read her bluegreen eyes but he couldnt tell if she was angry or anguished his speculation about what she was going to say ran the full gamut from her wanting to patch things up as lou had suggested to telling him she was tying the knot with her frenchsounding boyfriend the fact that she was dragging the mystery out was starting to wear thin if its not too much to ask i would like you to kindly avoid any attempts at sarcastic humor im sure it is obvious im having a hard time with this and you could at least show some respect jack took a deep breath it was a tall order for him to abandon his most potent psychological defense in a situation when he feared he needed it the most ill try he offered but im all over the map trying to figure what this is all about first let me say that i learned yesterday that i have the marker for brca jack stared at his former lover while myriad thoughts reverberated inside his head along with a rush of sympathy and concern was what he considered a less noble sense of relief selfishly he knew he could personally deal with the brca problem a lot better than he could with the idea that she was getting married arent you going to say anything laurie asked after a pause im sorry the news has just caught me unawares im truly sorry to hear that you have the marker on the positive side i still think it is better that you know than if you didnt know at the moment im not convinced i am theres not a shred of doubt in my mind for now it will merely mean youll have to be that much more vigilant perhaps with mammograms or mris on a yearly basis remember that although the marker means you have an increased risk of developing cancer before the age of eighty your mother whose mutation you undoubtedly share didnt develop the problem until she was in her eighties thats true laurie said recognizing that jack had a point her face visibly brightened and my maternal grandmother whod had breast cancer didnt develop it until her eighties either and my aunts who are all in their latter seventies havent gotten itat least not yet well there you go jack said it seems reasonably clear to me that your particular family mutation determines an octogenarian illness maybe laurie said retracting some of her optimism but theres no test for such an assertion and it doesnt take into account the increased risk of ovarian cancer has anyone in your family on either side ever had ovarian cancer not that i know of it seems to me that is all very positive information i suppose laurie said going back to tinkering with her flatware jack took another gulp of his cold beer he felt hot and wondered vaguely if his face reflected it he stuck a finger into his collar and pulled it away from his perspiring neck he was dying to take off his tie but he didnt dare with the chic way laurie was dressed what was bothering him was the way laurie had introduced the brca issue shed said first which made jack worry there was a second at that moment the salad and calamari arrived the waiter served the food and then busily rearranged the table and scooped up the breadcrumbs before disappearing hed not pestered them about their entree order which reminded jack of one of the reasons he liked to eat at elios hed never felt victimized by the inevitable bums rush in an effort to turn the table as he had at so many other in restaurants after taking a few bites of his calamari and another sip of beer jack cleared his throat superstitiously he didnt want to ask the question but the suspense was killing him was there anything else you wanted to tell me tonight or was it just this brca issue laurie put down her fork and locked eyes with jack there is something else i wanted to tell you that i am pregnant jack swallowed tipped his head slightly to the side as if something had just caromed off his scalp and put his beer back on the table he kept his eyes glued on lauries laurie being pregnant was perhaps the last thing he expected to hear and his mind was a jumble of complicated thoughts he cleared his throat again whos the father jack questioned lauries face clouded over like a sudden summer storm and she leaped up so fast that her chair tipped over backward the crash brought general conversation in the restaurant to a sudden standstill she threw her cloth napkin down onto the top of her salad and started for the front of the room jack who had initially recoiled from the unexpected flurry regained his senses enough to reach out and catch laurie by the forearm she tugged back but jack held on tightly and wouldnt let her go she glared down at him with nostrils flared im sorry jack blurted and then hastily added dont run off obviously we need to talk and perhaps that wasnt the most diplomatic first question laurie gave another tug to free her arm but it was with less force than the first please sit down jack said in as calm and reassuring a voice as he could muster as if suddenly becoming aware of her surroundings lauries eyes swept around the room and she saw that the restaurant had been seemingly caught in a freezeframe with all eyes directed at her she looked down at jack nodded and took a step back around the table as if on cue the waiter materialized righted her chair and took away both the napkin and plate of salad laurie sat down and as soon as she did so the conversation in the restaurant recommenced as if nothing had happened new yorkers were accustomed to the unexpected and took it in stride how long have you known jack asked i suspected it yesterday but didnt get confirmation until this morning are you upset about it of course im upset arent you jack nodded and paused for a moment while he thought what are you going to do do you mean whether or not im going to have the baby is that what youre asking with your damn question laurie we are having a discussion you dont have to act angry your first question as you called it struck the wrong chord that was apparent but considering that you have been having what seems from the outside as an intense affair my question isnt so inappropriate it struck me as inordinately insensitive since i have not had sex with roger rousseau how am i supposed to know over the last few weeks ive tried on a number of occasions to call you in the evening one night i continued the effort until rather late which lead me to believe you were not there i have stayed at rogers on a few occasions laurie admitted but there was no sex involved that sounds like a rather suspect distinction but lets move on the waiter reappeared with a fresh napkin and salad for laurie sensitively he quickly withdrew how pregnant are you jack asked six weeks although the ob office would call it seven weeks there is no doubt in my mind that it occurred that last night we spent together its rather ironic wouldnt you say surprising is the adjective that springs mostly to my mind how could this have happened i hope you are not blaming me if you remember the day before you had asked me where i was in my cycle i told you that it was probably safe but that it was close when we made love it was technically the next day and obviously not safe why didnt you put a limit on our lovemaking laurie glared at jack you are starting to anger me again it sounds like blame to me and you know something it was the two of us involved in the decision to make love not just me and we both had the same facts calm down jack said appeasingly im really not placing blame honest im just trying to understand your being pregnant has taken me totally and completely by surprise we had done well to avoid it in the past why did we mess up on this occasion laurie glare softened she took a deep breath and let it out with a whoosh well at this point its probably best to be completely honest that morning when i began to suspect that we might make love i did think that we were taking a chance and i was certain you did too it wasnt a huge chance in my mind considering i thought it was the tenth day but a chance nonetheless with as much as i wanted a family with you for both our sakes i was comfortable with the risk from your point of view i thought that somewhere in the depths of your soul you were of the same mind with the idea that conceiving a child would help push you beyond your past to start a whole new personal life maybe i was projecting too much of my own desires onto you i dont know but that was the long and short of how i felt jack mulled over what laurie had said absently he chewed the inside of his cheek in the process life had thrown him some curveballs and this one seemed right up there with the best of them the shock of being presented with the news that he had possibly fathered another child caught him completely off guard it also terrified him mainly because he feared he would love it too much and it would make him as vulnerable as hed been in the past losing a family had been the biggest trial of his life and he doubted he could survive it again yet on top of these disturbing thoughts was another more positive one if he had learned nothing else in the past miserable six weeks hed at least learned that he loved laurie more than he had admitted how that was going to play out in the current situation he had no idea he had no idea how she felt about her current boyfriend i have trouble with these silences of yours laurie said not only is it not like you but i need feedback anything even if it is bad i need to know how you feel we have some decisions to make or if you dont want to be involved tell me then ill make the decisions myself jack nodded of course i want to be involved but this is a little unfair its difficult for me to have all this dumped in my lap and then be expected to respond in the spur of the moment in fact it seems to me to be unreasonable for you to expect that i would have preferred that you told me the moment when you learned so that we could both have had a chance to think in tandem then at this dinner we could have shared our thoughts you have a point laurie admitted i dont mean to put you on the spot even though i wish you would respond the way i want you to respond and how is that laurie reached across the table and gripped jacks forearm im not going to put words into your mouth other than to hope this event can be positive and draw you out of your grieving role having a child will not demean your late family but go home and think about it im on call this weekend so if im not at home ill be at the ocme ill wait for your call fair enough jack said in a tired voice hey dont get depressed on me laurie chided i wont get depressed but i can tell you one thing im no longer hungry neither am i laurie said lets call it a night were both strung out laurie raised her hand and the waiter came over on the run sixteen roger leaned back and stretched his arms up toward the ceiling they felt cramped after the hours hed spent leaning over the library table in the conference room of the human resources department of st francis hospital stacked around the table in little individual piles were numerous pages of computer printouts plus a recently burned cd sitting across from him was the department head rosalyn leonard she was a seriousappearing tall striking woman with inky black hair and porcelain skin who had initially intimidated roger since she seemed immune to his charm which roger took personally it was inordinately important for him to think of himself as attractive to women he thought were attractive but persistence had paid off and as the hours had passed he had finally prevailed ever so slowly at first she had begun to warm during the last hour he felt she was flirting in return the fact that she was not wearing a wedding band was not lost on roger and as the day melded into evening he had tactfully inquired about her social status when he learned that she was single and currently between relationships he even considered taking the risk of asking her for a dinner date especially if things didnt work out with laurie when roger had come out to queens from manhattan earlier that afternoon it had been a little like going home since the hospital was located in the east side of rego park which was a stones throw away from the section of forest hills where he had grown up although both of his parents had passed away he had several aunts and an uncle who still lived close to his boyhood home as hed peered out of the taxi window while cruising along queens boulevard hed even entertained the idea to pass by the old homestead when he was finished with his errand roger had made significant progress his meeting with bruce martin who headed up the manhattan general hospital s department of human resources had been quite fruitful although not at the outset when roger had initially asked straightout for employee records bruce had told him that there were all sorts of federal rules that restricted access to such information that forced roger to be creative in his request by contending that in his role as the chief of the medical staff he was starting a study about the interaction between the doctors and all the support and custodial staff particularly in regard to new employees and particularly during the night shift when the hospital was on in his words cruise control roger assiduously avoided mentioning even a hint of his true goal by the time roger had left bruces office hed been promised a list of all employees at the manhattan general hospital and a list of new employees since midnovember with a particular emphasis on people who worked the eleventoseven night shift there had been a slight worry in rogers mind when he had proposed such a seemingly arbitrary commencement date for the new employees that bruce would have become suspicious in some form or fashion but bruce had merely written it down without any reaction he promised roger hed have the list before he left work that very afternoon and would have it placed on rogers desk the second thing bruce had done was call rosalyn leonard his counterpart at st francis hospital to tell her that roger would be coming over and to give her an idea of what roger needed at the time roger didnt appreciate how helpful that had been had roger walked in off the street with his requests which was his initial plan he wouldnt have gotten anywhere with rosalyn there was no doubt in rogers mind that she would have been dismissive and unhelpful thanks to bruces call she had already done some of the preliminary work before roger arrived it turned out that getting the kind of lists roger wanted required accessing a number of different sources roger had been surprised that the various departments in americare hospitals more or less functioned as individual fiefdoms within the constraints of their centrally dictated budgets the other thing roger had accomplished before leaving the manhattan general was to get caroline started on amassing the professional staff list with particular interest in those physicians who had admitting privileges for both the manhattan general and st francis roger had taken the time to see if that information was generally available by calling up a few individual doctors records unfortunately it was spotty caroline had promised him she would do what she could as it wasnt specifically coded she had said that she was hopeful since she was personally friendly with one of the computer whizzes employed by the hospital who could often figure out how to do the impossible well there you have it rosalyn said pushing a final thin stack of papers in rogers direction across the library tables varnished surface she patted the top with the palm of her hand heres a complete list of all saint francis employees as of midnovember with a notation of those working the night shift a list of st francis employees who either quit or were terminated between midnovember and midjanuary a list of our fulltime professional staff also as of midnovember and finally a list of our professional staff with admitting privileges is that all you want for your study what about new employees since midnovember no need roger said i think this should do it for what i have in mind he glanced through the pages containing all the hospital employees as of midnovember and shook his head in amazement i had no idea so many people were required to run an american hospital he wanted to divert the conversation away from his putative study as sharp as rosalyn was he guessed shed see through his ruse rather quickly if he was forced to say too much like all americare hospitals were actually on the lower slope of the bell curve rosalyn said as with all managedcare organizations one of the first things americare does when it takes over a hospital is reduce the personnel in most every department i should know since the unenviable task fell to me i was responsible for a sizable number of pink slips that must have been difficult roger offered in an unconsciously preoccupied tone he put the full list aside and glanced at the list of the employees that had left st francis even that was much longer than he had anticipated it also wasnt as detailed as he had hoped particularly in respect to which particular shift individual employees worked whether they were terminated or left on their own accord and where they went im surprised there is as much turnover as this is this representative generally speaking yes but it might be slightly on the high side because the period you are interested in encompasses the holidays if people are thinking of moving to a new job and want to take a little time off in between the holidays are a popular and predictable time and it seems like its mostly nurses unfortunately thats the reality theres a serious nursing shortage which puts them in the drivers seat were constantly recruiting nurses and other hospitals are recruiting ours like a tugofwar were even being reduced to seeking prospective candidates abroad really roger questioned he knew the united states drained doctors from developing countries who came to america presumably to train but then stayed but he wasnt aware that nurses were being recruited as well considering the health needs of the developing world it seemed ethically questionable at best the list doesnt say where the individuals went rosalyn shook her head that information isnt put into the main employee data bank it might be in the individual record if the individual requested a recommendation be sent to another institution or if an inquiry came in from another institution but we have to be very chary with those records as you well know theres always the threat of litigation unless the individual authorizes access roger nodded what if i end up with questions about individual people for my study i mean questions about their records in regard to their general performance while at saint francis like whether they got along with their coworkers or whether there was any disciplinary action taken for any reason that will be difficult rosalyn said nodding as if agreeing with herself is this study of yours an inhouse study or is it something youre thinking of publishing oh its definitely inhouse with limited access except at the highest administrative level its definitely not meant for publication if thats the case i can probably help you but id need to run it by our president and general counsel do you want me to do that monday that would be the first chance id have no not really roger said quickly the last thing he wanted was for the two presidents to have a chat about his socalled study hold off until i see if i need any more personal information on any of these people i probably wont just give me twentyfour hours notice if you do roger nodded and was eager to change the subject he cleared his throat and finally got around to ask the key question on his mind which if any of these employees who left saint francis came to the manhattan general meaning they stayed within the americare family is that information readily available not that im aware of as you know americare operates its hospitals as individual entities the only economies of scale relate to price and origin of basic supplies if a saint francis employee leaves and goes to manhattan general for us its no different than if they went to a nonamericare hospital roger nodded again what he was realizing was that he was facing some serious collating time when he got back to his office the chance that hed have something to take over to lauries apartment that evening as an excuse to get together with her was looking slim he lifted his wrist and glanced at his watch it was a quarter to seven the window behind rosalyn was completely dark night had long since fallen im afraid ive kept you here an unreasonably long time roger said he smiled warmly im very appreciative of your help but im afraid im feeling particularly guilty since it is friday night and im sure i have kept you from something much more entertaining and enjoyable it has been my pleasure to help dr rousseau bruce was very flattering about you when he called i understand you were with m√©decins san fronti√®res im afraid so roger said modestly but please call me roger thank you doctor rosalyn said and then laughed at herself i mean thank you roger theres no reason to thank me it is i who should be thanking you ive read about the work that m√©decins sans fronti√®res does around the globe im very impressed there is a great need in the world for even the most basic healthcare in the trouble spots of the world roger was pleased that the conversation had taken such a personal turn im sure where did you go during your service south pacific the far east and finally africa a mixture of impenetrable jungle and arid desert roger smiled he had this story down pat and just like it had with laurie it usually had an auspicious social outcome it sounds like a movie what made you leave m√©decins sans fronti√®res and what brought you to new york rogers smile broadened he took a deep breath before closing in on the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of his comeon the eventual realization i wasnt going to change the world id tried but it wasnt going to happen then like a migratory bird i felt the instinctive need to come back here to nest and start a family you see i was born in brooklyn and grew up in neighboring forest hills how romantic have you found the lucky lady hardly ive been too busy getting myself situated and adjusted to living in the civilized world well im certain you will not have any trouble rosalyn said as she began amassing the papers from which shed culled the lists shed given to roger i bet you have some fascinating stories to tell about your travels indeed roger responded happily he was relieved he knew hed piqued her interest ill be happy to share a few of the less harrowing if youd allow me to buy you dinner its the least i can do after having kept you here for so long that is of course if you are free would you allow me the honor somewhat flustered rosalyn shrugged i suppose then its a deal roger said he stood up and stretched his legs theres an italian restaurant here in rego park thats been a fixture since the fifties as a hangout for the local mafioso the food was great the last time i was there eons ago and not a bad wine list either are you game to see if it still exists rosalyn shrugged again it sounds intriguing but i cant be out late me neither heck im going back to the office tonight jasmine rakoczi a voice called jazz stopped her repetitions on one of her favorite exercises she was lying prone working her hamstrings and buttocks turning her head to the side she could see that someone was standing next to the machine she was using surprisingly enough the feet and legs were female not male jazz took her earphones out then twisted around to look up into the face of the individual she couldnt see much because the face was backlit from the fluorescent ceiling lights im sorry to bother you said the almost featureless face jazz could not believe someone was harassing her in the middle of her routine and it was more irritation than anything else that got her to extract her legs from the machine and sit up she found herself confronted by one of the women who manned the front desk shed seen her earlier when shed signed in whats the damn problem jazz demanded she wiped her forehead with her towel there are a couple of gentlemen out in the lobby the woman said they said they needed to see you right away but mr horner wouldnt let them come back here a slight but distinctly uncomfortable shiver descended jazzs spine mr bob and mr daves unexpected visit the evening before flashed into her mind something must be up it wasnt like mr bob to approach her in such a public place ill be out jazz said she took a drink from her water bottle as she watched the healthclub employee head out of the weight room jazzs first thought was that her glock was back in the pocket of her coat hanging in the locker if there was going to be trouble she wanted the glock but why would there be trouble mulhausen had gone smoothly without a ripple the only thing that came to her mind was the possibility of something happening in regard to the chapman investigation like everyone else on the eleventoseven shift jazz had been approached by a couple of exhaustedlooking detectives for routine questioning but that had gone down just fine as evidenced by the conversation theyd all had at nursing report the buzz was that it had been a mugging pure and simple hospital security had made a big point of promising theyd be beefing up patrols particularly at the times when shifts changed jazz walked quickly to the door as preoccupied as she was she didnt even notice the men staring at her wasting no time she went back to the locker room and grabbed a coke at the entrance opening her locker she pulled on her coat over her workout clothes thrusting her hand into her right pocket to clutch her glock with one hand in her pocket and the other holding the coke jazz had to use her shoulder to open the door to the lobby beyond the signin desk there was a rather spacious sitting room and beyond that a restaurant and bar there was even a small sportsapparel shop jazz quickly scanned the people sprinkled around the space and not seeing mr bob or mr dave she went over to the signin desk and asked the receptionist for the men who wanted to see her she pointed to two men hidden behind newspapers clearly they were not mr bob and mr dave from the look of their lower halves they could have been homeless bums are you sure they asked for me jazz questioned her next worry was that they were a couple of deepundercover detectives trying to scare up dirt about chapman with a sense of resignation jazz walked over to where the two men were sitting her hand still clutched the glock in her pocket hello jazz called irritably i was told you two were looking for me the men lowered their papers and when they did so jazz could feel her face flush and her pulse pound in her temples it was all she could do to keep from pulling out her gun one of the men was her father geza rakoczi he had a twoday growth of stubble on his face as did his companion jasmine dear how are you gesa questioned jazz could smell the alcohol on his breath from where she was standing behind a shallow coffee table littered with magazines without answering jasmine looked at the other man shed never seen him before this is carlos geza said noticing the direction of jazzs attention jazz looked back at her father shed not seen him for years and had hoped hed drunk himself into the grave how did you find me carlos has a friend whos good with a computer he says you can find anything on the internet so i told him to find you and he did he said you played a lot of online games and used what he called chat rooms i dont know anything about all that malarkey but he sure did find you he even found out you were a member of this club gezas eyes roamed around pretty fancy place im impressed youre doing all right girl what are you doing here jazz demanded well to tell you the truth i need a little money and knowing youre a fancy nurse and all i thought id ask you see your mother died god rest her soul i got to come up with some money or theyll be burying her out on some island in a plain wooden box for a moment all jazz could see in her minds eye was the thirteen dollars shed made shoveling snow remembering what happened to it only deepened her fury as hard as she was holding the glock she was smart enough to take her finger out of the trigger guard get the hell out of here jazz spat she spun on her heels and headed back toward the locker room she could hear geza call out her name and the next thing she knew he had grabbed her shoulder pulling her around jazz yanked her hand out of her pocketluckily without the glock later shed wondered how it had happened since her instinct was to draw the weapon she jabbed her finger into his face dont you ever touch me again she snarled and dont come pestering me you know what im saying if you do ill kill you its that simple jazz turned again and headed for the locker room she could hear geza try to complain saying that he was her father but she didnt stop and he didnt try to follow she returned to her locker spun the combination and put her coat away back in the weight room she decided to start her routine from the top even though when shed been disturbed she was close to finishing jazz had needed the exertion to control her fury and it worked to a large degree by the time she returned to the locker room for her shower she had regained control she could almost see some humor in the pathetic creature that her father had become she wondered when her mother had died jazz was amazed shed lasted this long as obese as she was since she was behind schedule after doubling her workout routine jazz showered and dressed hurriedly emerging from the locker room she looked back into the lobby area where her father had been sitting and was relieved that hed taken the hint and left as she approached her car she couldnt help but remember the previous night and after opening the door the first thing she did was check the backseat she wasnt happy about mr bob and mr dave surprising her the way they did she liked to think of herself as being wary and observant climbing into the hummer and buckling herself in jazz was looking forward to some fun on the way to the hospital dueling with taxicabs was a good way to deal with the remnant of anxiety that her fathers surprise visit had aroused waiting in the short line to get out of the garage she got out her blackberry after three names in the last two nights she wasnt optimistic but she wanted to check just the same at the first red light she logged on for messages to her delight there was one from mr bob hastily she opened it yes she cried out there was another name on her lcd screen it was patricia pruit a smile spread across jazzs face all was well by that time the following night her account balance would be more than sixty thousand dollars when the light changed jazz bolted ahead of the pack of cars and taxis no one seemed to want to challenge her settling back into the seat she thought about how her father had found her she was a little surprised although she spent a lot of time in chat rooms on the internet she thought she had been careful about her identity and whereabouts except for the few times she hooked up she decided shed better be more careful because she liked chat rooms and wasnt about to give up the pleasure it was only online that she found people of like mind to whom she could truly relate respect and even love it was such a far cry from the assholes she had to deal with in real life rogers dinner with rosalyn turned out to be an unqualified success the fact that she had been aloof when they first met was more than adequately made up by her behavior during dinner particularly after shed had a few glasses of wine following the meal roger tried to put her in a taxi to take her home but she insisted that they share one outside her kew gardens apartment she mounted a hardtoresist argument for roger to come in for a nightcap a term roger hadnt heard since college ultimately roger did resist even after a sustained and passionate kiss on the sidewalk roger had kept one hand on the open taxi door despite being severely tempted to take advantage of her hospitality and whatever else her newly expressed physicality implied roger kept reminding himself about the work he planned to do in his office he felt he was on a roll and even if he couldnt have anything that evening to present to laurie the weekend was just beginning after a promise to keep in touch roger climbed back into the cab and waved out the back window rosalyn stood nailed to the spot waving until she disappeared from view roger was pleased the venture to queens had been rewarding not only did he get most of the information he wanted hed met a woman who was a strong candidate for some interesting future encounters by the time he had gotten back to the manhattan general it was nearly eleven oclock the first thing he did was visit the coffee shop and have a cup of real coffee by the time he got up to his office he was wired and he dove into his work with alacrity by two am hed developed quite a bit of data lauries idea coupled with his decisions of how to expand it had proved to be strikingly fertile in fact it appeared to be too fertile when he had started hed wondered if hed come up with any suspects now he had too many roger rocked back in his chair and picked up the first sheet hed printed a list of five doctors with admitting privileges at both manhattan general and st francis and who had actually exercised those privileges at both institutions over the previous four months the original list of the doctors with dual privileges was far too long to be workable that was when he decided to restrict it as chief of the medical staff roger had unfettered access to the credentialing information and records of all physicians associated with the manhattan general three of the five doctors on his list had disciplinary problems two of the doctors were euphemistically called impaired because of addiction problems to which roger could surely relate they were on probation with some minor limitations in respect to their privileges after having gone through drug rehab six months ago the other individual dr pakt tam was involved in multiple malpractice suits that were still pending all of which involved untimely deaths although not the ones in lauries series the hospital had tried to revoke his privileges but he had sued and his privileges were reinstated by court order pending the trial dr tarns case had stimulated roger to look up all the doctors whose privileges had been either eliminated or curtailed over the previous six months with the idea that they could be angry vengeful and deranged or any combination that inquiry had led to eight doctors the problem was that he had no way of knowing if any of them had had an association with st francis quickly he scribbled a note to himself to call and ask rosalyn on monday he attached the note to the page with the eight doctors and put it off to the side the thought about an angry doctor had made roger think about any disgruntled current or former employee of the hospital particularly a nurse or someone else who had direct access to patients if he was going to think about doctors he had to think about everyone else in the hospital as well so hed made a note to talk to bruce to get a list of employees terminated prior to the midnovember cutoff date maybe even going back a year hed taped the note to the edge of his desk lamp so hed be sure to see it at that point he had begun to get discouraged but he had pressed on the next group roger had considered was the anesthesiologists as he had voiced to laurie and for the reasons laurie had concisely specified he felt their expertise made them prime suspects and his intuition had paid off with a couple of interesting possibilities two had immediately jumped out at him both worked the night shift exclusively and presumably by choice one was dr jos√© cabreo who had a history of impairment with oxycontin as well as several malpractice suits the other was dr motilal najah a recent addition to the professional staff from st francis roger had printed out copies of both doctors records and had drawn stars next to their names those papers were directly in front of him just off the central blotter as far as he was concerned they were his chief suspects with najah ahead of cabreo although najahs credentialing record was clean the timing of his transfer was just too perfect the last group roger had looked into was the rest of the hospital employees comparing the list of people leaving st francis after midnovember with the list of new employees at the manhattan general during the same period roger had come up with a group of more than twenty people at first the number shocked him but then when he thought about it it made a certain amount of sense the manhattan general was the flagship of the americare fleet and if there was active recruiting going on as rosalyn suggested it would be natural for most professionals and support personnel to prefer to be at the name institution recognizing his limitations as an amateur sleuth roger had known immediately that twentythree suspects were too many for him to consider to narrow the group he had used lauries suggestion of considering only those people who worked the night shift at st francis and moved to the night shift at manhattan general with such narrow parameters he had no idea if hed get any hits but to his surprise he did he had gotten seven the names were herman epstein from pharmacy david jefferson from security jasmine rakoczi from nursing kathleen chaudhry and joe linton from the laboratory brenda ho from housekeeping and warren williams from maintenance roger picked up the sheet containing these seven names although it was more people than he had expected he thought he could deal with seven as he read over them again he couldnt help but notice how much the surnames reflected the ethnic heterogeneity of american culture he felt he could guess the general ancestral origins of all except rakoczi although if pressed hed say eastern european he looked at the various departments involved and realized that all of them would have access to patients in some form or fashion particularly during the night shift when oversight was at a minimum vaguely he wondered if he should try to talk rosalyn into getting him their st francis records now that he had the beginning of a personal relationship with her perhaps he would be able to get the information without her sending up a red flag but there were no guarantees yet how else was he to proceed putting the paper down next to the list of anesthesiologists roger looked at his watch it was now a quarter after two in the morning he shook his head he couldnt remember the last time he had stayed up so late working he guessed it had been back in his medical residency it was a bit depressing thinking of most of the rest of the city sleeping but at least he wasnt tired the bolus of caffeine hed gotten down in the coffee shop was still coursing around in his bloodstream making him feel antsy he even noticed that hed been unconsciously tapping his right foot he wished it were about ten pm instead of two am because now that he had all these potential suspects he would love to call laurie and maybe even suggest that he pop over to her apartment unfortunately that was out of the question as upset as she was about her brca situation he was surely not going to wake her up thinking about the hour made roger realize that for the first time since hed been employed at manhattan general he was actually in the hospital during the night shift when all the questionable deaths that he and laurie were interested in had occurred with the caffeine on board sleep was out of the question and as long as he was in the sleuthing mood he might as well check out the surgical floor where more than half of the questionable deaths had occurred and while he was at it at least some of his socalled suspects with that idea in mind he picked up the records of the two anesthesiologists and the sheet with the seven individuals whod transferred from the night shift at st francis to the night shift at the general he looked over them again committing the names to memory roger was about to get up when another thought occurred to him given how wired he was he knew hed be up most of the night since hed need some sleep hed likely not be back to the office until late morning with that in mind roger dialed lauries extension at work its me roger he said to lauries voicemail its after two in the morning but your suggestion about saint francis was on target its produced a lot of potential suspects certainly more than i expected so i have to give you credit im looking forward to sharing it all with you and maybe we could get together tomorrow night for dinner at the moment im heading upstairs to do a bit more detective work like check out the surgical floor and meet some of the people on my lists while they are on duty as a teaser let me tell you about one of the nightshift anesthesiologists motilal najah i interviewed him when he applied for a staff position anyway i had forgotten that he had come from saint francis right after the holidays is that a coincidence or what and hes just the tip of the iceberg anyway im going to be here another few hours so i might not be back here in my office until possibly noon or early afternoon ill call you as soon as i get in ciao roger hung up the phone and looked at the list of the seven nonphysicians whod also transferred to the general during the period in question and he wondered if he should have run down the list for laurie more than anything else he wanted to fan her interest as much as possible in the hope that shed accept the idea of getting together he thought about calling again to add to his message but then decided the message hed given was enough of a teaser after donning the long white coat he wore whenever he ventured out into the hospital roger walked the length of the administration area hed been there a few times in the evenings but never after midnight at this hour it was like a mausoleum the main hospital corridor was empty save for a person using a floor polisher in the distance as he rode up in the elevator he was amazed at how wideawake and energized he felt he also recognized a touch of euphoria which unfortunately reminded him of heroin he shook his head he didnt want to fall into that trap for doctors such temptation is harder to fight with drugs so easily available roger got out at the third floor and pushed through a pair of swinging doors into the or complex he found himself in a deserted corridor to his right the sound of a tv issued forth from the arched opening leading into the surgical lounge hoping to run into some of the surgical staff he walked in the room was about thirty feet square with windows that looked out onto the same courtyard as the staff cafeteria did two opposing doors led into the locker rooms the furniture consisted of a couple of gray vinyl couches a smattering of chairs and several dictating desks a central coffee table was littered with newspapers outdated magazines and an open box of pizza a corner tv was tuned to cnn but no one was watching in another corner was a small refrigerator with a communal coffee pot on top ten people were sitting in the room all dressed in the same unisex scrubs some had hats or hoods and some didnt although the or appeared egalitarian roger knew otherwise it was the most hierarchical domain of the hospital most of the people in the room were reading and munching on various snacks while sipping coffee while others chatted roger went over to the coffee machine he debated having more not to keep awake but more as a social ploy as well as an ostensible reason to be there he hadnt recognized anyone in the room believing he was adequately wired he opened the refrigerator and opted for a small orange juice with his drink in hand roger swept his eyes around to look more closely at the various people no one had paid him any heed when hed come in but now a woman made eye contact and smiled roger walked over to her and introduced himself i know you the woman said we met at the christmas party my name is cindy delgada im one of the nurses we dont get admin visitors very often what brings you up here in the middle of the night roger shrugged i was working late and i thought id wander around a bit for some human contact and see the hospital in action a wry smile appeared on cindys face not much excitement with this somnolent group if youre looking for entertainment i suggest the er roger laughed to be polite no cases tonight oh yeah cindy said weve done two theres one going on right now in room six and we have another coming up from the er within the hour do you know dr jos√© cabreo of course cindy said while pointing to a pale heavyset man in a chair by the window dr cabreo is right over there hearing his name jos√© lowered his paper and looked over at roger he had a bushy mustache that hid most of his mouth his eyebrows rose expectantly under the edge of his surgical cap roger felt obligated to walk over he hadnt necessarily planned to talk with the two anesthesiologists directly his informal game plan had been to engage the or staff in casual conversation about the men to see if he could get a feel for their personalities roger wasnt fooling himself he was no psychiatrist and had no delusions that hed be able to recognize a serial killer unless the person outandout told him yet he had a vague idea that he would be able to sense if either man could be a potential suspect hi roger said selfconsciously since he didnt know what to say he berated himself for not anticipating the possibility of such a confrontation what can i do for you jos√© questioned well roger said trying not to sound as confused as he was im chief of the medical staff i know who you are jos√© said his voice had an edge as if he was wary of what roger wanted you do how is that jos√© was one of many on staff hed not met which included just about everybody on the night shift jos√© pointed to rogers nametag oh of course roger responded bouncing the heel of his hand off his forehead i forget its there there was an awkward pause the rest of the room was quiet except for the tv whose volume was turned way down roger had the sense the other people in the room were listening what is it you want jos√© asked i just wanted to make sure that you are content and there are no problems what do you mean problems jos√© demanded i dont like your implication theres no reason to get upset roger said soothingly my intention is merely to be proactive and meet the staff weve not had the pleasure roger stuck out his hand toward jos√© whose face had flushed jos√© eyed rogers hand but made no attempt to shake it nor did he get to his feet slowly his eyes rose and reengaged rogers youve got a lot of nerve coming up here out of the blue and talking to me about problems he said heatedly he poked his finger threateningly toward roger this better not have anything to do with ancient history like dredging up the painkillers i needed for my back or my closed malpractice cases because if it does you and the rest of the administration will be hearing from my lawyer calm down roger urged softly i had absolutely no intention of talking about any such thing he was taken aback at jos√©s belligerence and defensiveness yet he forced himself to remain cool and collected if the man could get this wound up with such little provocation maybe he was a loose cannon capable of the unthinkable to defuse the situation roger quickly added my real goal in stopping by was to ask how things were working out with dr motilal najah youve been here a long time and dr najah is a relative newcomer as the senior man i was interested in your opinion some of the hostility and tenseness drained out of jos√©s face and he motioned for roger to take a seat next to him as soon as roger was seated jos√© leaned forward and lowered his voice why didnt you say that straight off motilal is the one you should be talking with if youre concerned about problems how so roger asked jos√©s eyes now had a conspiratorial glint roger found himself thinking that even if jos√© wasnt a serial killer he might be the last person roger would want giving him anesthesia the man is a loner i mean like were kind of a tight team on the night shift let me tell you he doesnt interact with anyone except in a professional capacity he eats by himself and never comes in here to socialize and when i say never i mean never he seemed personable enough when i interviewed him roger said roger could distinctly remember being impressed by motilals easy candor and gentle manner he seemed friendly enough yet what he was hearing from jos√© suggested that motilal had some antisocial traits and if that was true hed have to be considered a suspect he fooled you then jos√© said he sat back and then gestured around the room ask anybody if you dont believe me rogers eyes scanned the room the people had gone back to their reading or conversation roger looked back at jos√© roger was beginning to feel pessimistic about winnowing down his potential suspect list with what he was hearing about motilal and the way jos√© was acting what about his professional skills roger asked is he a good anesthesiologist i suppose jos√© said but one of the nurse anesthetists would be better at evaluating that since they have to work directly with the lazy bum the problem that i have with him is that he is never here hes always out wandering around the hospital whats he doing when hes wandering around how should i know all i know is i end up doing all the work like ten minutes ago i had to page him to get his ass up here since it was his turn to do a case hell i had already done two tonight where was he when you paged him down on the obgyn floor at least thats what he said when i asked him but he could have been in one of the local bars for all i know so hes doing a case at the moment he better be or our chief ronald havermeyer is going to hear about it im tired of covering for that guy tell me something roger said settling back into his seat have you been aware that in the last couple of months there have been seven unexpected and unexplained deaths of healthy relatively young people in our hospital within twentyfour hours of surgery no jos√© saida bit too quickly in rogers estimation jos√© held his hand out toward roger as if to quiet him a wall speaker had crackled to life code red in a disembodied voice announced code red in jos√© heaved himself to his feet tossing his newspaper aside wouldnt you know it the second i get a chance to sit down theres a cardiac code sorry to break this off so abruptly but when were not on a case were supposed to show up for a code i urge you to talk with motilal if youre trying to head off problems hes your man jos√© rushed from the room with his stethoscope clasped in his hand from out in the hall roger could hear the double doors leading to the elevator lobby bang open and noisily swing shut roger exhaled uneasily and glanced around the room no one had reacted to their strange conversation to the code announcement or jos√©s sudden departure until his eyes reconnected with cindy delgadas she smiled again and made a questioning gesture with her shoulders roger got up and walked back to her dont mind dr cabreo she said with a laugh hes a hopeless pessimist and our resident prophet of doom he seemed a bit defensive ha thats the understatement of the year hes outandout paranoid with a touch of misanthropy but you know something we give him some slack because hes a damn good anesthesiologist and i should know since i work with him almost every night thats reassuring roger said although he was hardly convinced did you happen to hear what he said about dr najah i got the gist is that the general feeling up here in the or i suppose cindy said with a shrug its true dr najah doesnt socialize and hang around with us but no one minds except jos√© i mean this is the graveyard shift after all what does that mean we all have our quirks which is why we work this shift maybe were all a little misanthropic in our own ways i know i like the fact that theres less supervision and a lot less bureaucratic crap why motilal prefers this shift i dont know maybe its as simple as just being shy hes hard to read since hes so quiet but ill tell you hes definitely a good anesthesiologist and dont get me wrong because i said it about jos√© because i dont say that about everybody so you wouldnt say dr najah is antisocial certainly not in the psychiatric sense at least i dont think so but to be honest i really dont know ive probably only spoken ten words to him jos√© complained about him wandering around in the hospital do you have any idea where he goes i believe so i think he visits all the inhouse preops scheduled for morning why i think so is because hes always carrying around the next days surgery schedule roger nodded while silently reaffirming his opinion about his deficiencies as a detective after chatting with jos√© hearing a little about the loner motilal and learning about the night shift in general he wasnt eliminating anyone as a suspect but he pressed on did you hear what jos√© said when i asked him if he was aware of the seven deaths weve seen over the last couple of months yeah i heard cindy said with a derisive chuckle and a dismissive wave of her hand i dont know what was going on in his mind because he knows about them we all know about them particularly the anesthesiologists i mean we havent exactly been dwelling on the issue but its been the topic of conversation on occasion especially as the cases mount why would he tell me he was unaware of them beats me maybe you should ask him when he comes back the anesthesiologists never stay long on codes they just pop in if they happen to be available to intubate the patient or if the patient was already intubated to make sure the patient was intubated properly thanks for chatting with me roger said he then glanced around the room a final time i have to say no one else seems particularly friendly as i said we have our quirks but if you came up here on a regular basis youd find people friendly enough with a final wave and appreciative smile roger walked out to the elevator his finger went toward the call button but stalled in midair his visit to the or hadnt been particularly helpful he had two anesthesiologists who were potential suspects before he arrived and he still had two after he left the choices were simple he could stay on the third floor and visit the pharmacy and try to find out something about herman epstein whod transferred from the night shift at st francis to the night shift at the general he could go down to the second floor and visit the lab to find out what he could about the two lab technicians who were on the same list he could go back down to the first floor and visit security or even to the basement to visit housekeeping and maintenance where there were two more similar transferees yet something told him he wasnt going to learn anything thanks to his total lack of investigative experience his little chat with jos√© had made it clear that he didnt even know what questions to ask short of are you a serial killer whos been knocking off patients during the night shift lauries idea was good in theory but in reality there were just too many potential suspects all the transferees had access to the hospital in general by virtue of their respective job descriptions the thought of directly asking people if they were a serial killer brought a smile to rogers face it wasnt hard to guess what would happen to his reputation and job if he started asking such a question roger sighed and looked at his watch it was now after three am although some of the caffeine euphoria was wearing off the feeling of being wired hadnt there was no way he would fall asleep if he went back to his apartment impulsively roger pressed the up button on the elevator he decided hed pay a visit to the surgical floor whose charge nurse had been mugged and killed and where four of the seven unexpected deaths had taken place he also decided to take a quick tour through the fifth floor which housed orthopedics and neurosurgery where there had been two deaths he reasoned that hed never been in the hospital during the night shift particularly on the patient floors and having a sense of the ambience and locale might be helpful in his thinking although he had assumed as much the atmosphere of the surgical floor was completely different than it was during the day instead of controlled chaos an unexpected and deceptive serenity reigned even the lighting was different dimmed from its daytime starkness as roger walked from the elevator lobby toward the nurses station he saw no one it was as if there had been a fire drill and everybody had run out of the building reaching the nurses station roger looked at the bank of monitors displaying the ekgs and pulses of all the patients with modern wireless technology such telemetry was now easily available on regular hospital floors the problem of course was that no one was there watching it roger looked down the lengthy corridor in both directions the composite floor gleamed in the halflight at that moment roger heard the telltale squeak of a desk chair wondering where the sound had come from he rounded the end of the nurses station and walked over to an open doorway it led into a utility room with a long builtin deskcountertop under and over cabinets and a refrigerator sitting at the desk with her feet propped up and reading a magazine was an arrestingappearing nurse her features reflected a hint of asian exotic which roger had come to appreciate in his years in the far east her eyes were appropriately dark as was her cropped hair beneath her scrubs was the hint of a shapely hard body evening roger said before introducing himself he noticed that the nurse was reading a firearms magazine which seemed mildly inappropriate whats up the nurse inquired without removing her feet from the edge of the countertop roger smiled inwardly he remembered a time in the notsodistant past when nurses were deferential to doctors to the point of acting intimidated even in the united states this one clearly wasnt im just checking to see how things are going roger said i know you tragically lost your charge nurse yesterday morning im sorry not a problem actually she wasnt all that good as a charge nurse really roger questioned it seemed a curiously unsympathetic response such candor with a stranger was hardly the norm whether what she said was true or not he read her nametag jasmine rakoczi he remembered that she was on the transferee list im not pulling your leg she was a weird one and nobody liked her much im sorry to hear that ms rakoczi roger said he leaned back against the countertop and crossed his arms has clarice hamilton assigned a new charge nurse for the shift not yet we got a temp to tide us over but just as another grunt i kind of took charge and assigned the patients somebody had to do it and the others were just sitting around wringing their hands anyway things are going just fine im glad to hear it roger said ms rakoczi id like to ask you a question call me jazz i dont respond to ms rakoczi i assume you have been aware of the four deaths of relatively young ostensibly healthy postop patients that have occurred on this floor over the last six or seven weeks or so with the last one just last night of course it would be hard not to be aware true roger agreed have they bothered you how do you mean roger shrugged the question seemed so selfevident have they disturbed you psychologically no not really this is a big busy hospital people die you cant get attached because if you do youll go crazy and your other patients will suffer you brass sitting in your fancy offices dont remember what its like out here in the trenches you know what im saying i suppose roger said he detected a nottoosubtle change in the nurses demeanor she had started out breezy but now seemed wary and taut almost to the point of anger are you asking me this because they occurred on my floor obviously there have been similar deaths on other floors im aware of that in fact there was one tonight just a half hour ago up on the obgyn floor why dont you go up and hound them a distinctly unpleasant tenseness gripped rogers entire body which he blamed on the caffeine after the euphoria passed he invariably felt as if all his nerves were exposed learning of yet another death right while he was there in the hospital supposedly looking for suspects made him feel uncomfortably complicit as if he should have been able to prevent it were the specifics about the same he asked hoping vainly for a negative reply i suppose jazz responded the word is it was a woman in her thirties in for a hysterectomy seriously why dont you go on up and ask the nurses if it bothered them for a beat roger stared at this exoticlooking nurse whom he had originally thought of being attractive and rather sexy while she brazenly stared back now he thought she was almost eerie reminding him to a degree of his reaction to dr cabreo and to the story about dr najah he couldnt help but remember cindys comment about people working the night shift being quirky though maybe quirky wasnt nearly strong enough maybe neurotic was closer to the mark he couldnt help but wonder if hed find the whole lot of people on his supposed suspect list equally bizarre one way or the other it was becoming clear he would have to work on rosalyn to get the transferees personal records no matter the risk what is this jazz sneered the silent treatment or are we having some kind of juvenile staring contest sorry roger said breaking off eye contact i was just shocked to learn about yet another death its upsetting and alarming im surprised you seem to be able to take it so lightly its called professional distance jazz said those of us who actually treat people have to maintain it she brought her feet down with a thud tossed her magazine to the side and stood up i got patients to see enjoy yourself upstairs on obgyn just a second roger said he grabbed jazzs arm as she tried to brush past him he was surprised at its muscularity i have a few more questions jazz looked down at rogers hand gripping her upper arm there was a tense moment but she controlled herself she raised her eyes to rogers let go of my arm or you will be very sorry you hear what im saying roger let go and recrossed his arms to be completely nonthreatening he didnt want to give this woman any excuse for physical violence of which he intuited she was capable in truth she was scaring him i understand you transferred from saint francis recently would you mind telling me why it was jazzs turn to stare before responding what is this an interrogation as i told you im chief of the medical staff there was a mild complaint about your attitude by one of the doctors and im looking into it frankly this doctor has a history of unfounded complaints but i still am obligated to check into the allegation roger was lying but he felt he had to come up with some explanation for his questioning her on the spur of the moment the nursing staff was not under his jurisdiction whats this freaking doctors name im not at liberty to disclose the individuals identity jazz broke off eye contact with roger her eyes darted around the room roger could see that her nostrils were flared and she was breathing deeply she was no longer wary she was now definitely angry let me explain roger said im inquiring if you left saint francis for a similar reason did you have trouble with any doctor on the saint francis staff we have to ask hell no jazz snapped i might have had a few words with my charge nurse on occasion but never a doctor i mean i could count on one hand the number of times i even saw a doctor over there on the night shift they were all home screwing their wives i see roger said he wasnt about to comment on jazzs last inappropriate point but picked up on the first so you also felt your charge nurse over at saint francis was not as competent as you would have liked a wry smile appeared on jazzs face you guessed it but its not surprising the night shift attracts some weirdoes roger nodded as a result of his first nightshift visit he couldnt have agreed more out of curiosity did you ever think you might share some of the blame if you didnt get along too well with either charge nurse any vestige of a smile disappeared from jazzs face oh yeah its my fault that these two fat ladies were so stupid give me a break so why did you transfer i wanted a change and i wanted to move into the city why do you personally work the night shift because theres a lot less bullshit theres still some i admit that but its a lot less than during the day or even during the evening when i was a corpsman in the military i was assigned to the marines for independent duty i like working on my own the best so you were in the military damn straight i was with the marines during the first gulf war interesting roger said tell me what is the background of the name rakoczi hungarian my grandfather was a freedom fighter one other question if you dont mind roger said trying to be nonchalant did you know that when you were at saint francis there was a series of similar deaths back in november it was the same it would have been hard not to be aware thanks for your time roger said pushing away from the countertop i think i will follow your suggestion and go up to obgyn but i might have a few more questions would you mind if i came back if that were the case suit yourself roger tried to smile reassuringly at jazz before walking out of the utility room and heading toward the bank of elevators as he walked he shook his head imperceptively he couldnt believe it hed talked to two people on his list and heard about a third and he felt he could make a case for any of them possibly being deranged enough to be doing the unconscionable jazz leaned out of the utility room just enough to watch roger head down toward the elevators she couldnt believe it trouble was coming out of the woodwork the sanctioning had been going so well until lewis then all hell had broken loose and just when she had eliminated one potential disaster another one had popped up what a bastard she murmured she knew from the way he dressed and spoke that he was another one of those damn ivy league types when roger reached the elevators and pushed the call button he turned and looked back toward the nurses station jazz pulled her head back she didnt want him to see her staring after him like she was concerned she shook her head then slammed an open palm onto the countertop a few loose papers wafted to the floor what the hell should i do she murmured she shook her head again the thought went through her mind to call mr bob but she quickly dismissed it she had the sense that if she complained about anything she wouldnt get any more names shed be dismissed from operation winnow it was as simple as that jazz shrugged she couldnt think of anything although the worry gnawed at her she didnt know what to do at the same time she knew she had to be careful because this freaking admin type could end up being a whole lot more than a ripple the way he was talking the elevator door slid open and roger stepped out onto the seventh floor to the left beyond double doors was the medical ward and to the right through similar doors was obgyn he pushed into obgyn in contrast to the surgical floor below there were a lot of people in evidence both at the nurses station and in the hallway he even saw an orderly pushing a gurney with a patient shrouded in a sheet toward the patient elevators roger guessed it was the patient hed come up to inquire about advancing to the nurses station roger stood for a moment and just watched he guessed it was the resuscitation team along with some of the floors nurses the resuscitation cart with its defibrillator was parked against the corridor wall the people were talking in small groups most likely debriefing themselves about the failed resuscitation attempt excuse me roger said to a woman directly in front of him she was busy writing in a chart but looked up like jazz downstairs she was dressed in scrubs but unlike jazz she emanated both civility and respect also unlike jazz she was slightly obese with a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose could you tell me who is the charge nurse i am im meryl lanigan what can i do for you roger introduced himself and said that he was inquiring about the recent death the name was patricia pruit meryl said this is the chart would you like to see it i would indeed thank you roger took the chart and rapidly scanned it the demographics were as he had feared patricia pruit was a healthy thirtysevenyearold mother of three the previous morning shed had an uncomplicated hysterectomy for fibroids her postoperative course had been entirely uneventful and she had already been started on clear fluids by mouth then came disaster roger looked back down at meryl she was waiting for the chart which she took back it certainly is a tragedy roger said and so unexpected given her age and past health its heartbreaking meryl agreed she opened the chart to the nurses notes there have been others quite similar on other floors over the last month or so roger said so ive heard luckily this is our first we might take it harder than others since were accustomed to much happier outcomes i have a couple of questions if you dont mind did you happen to see a dr najah on your floor tonight we did just like we usually do how about dr cabreo we saw him as well but only after the code was called how about a nurse named jasmine rakoczi who goes by the name jazz funny you should ask how so we see a little too much of ms rakoczi most every night ive even complained to susan chapman who used to be her charge nurse saying that i didnt want her up here im going to have to go a little higher now that we dont have susan with us any longer what does ms rakoczi do when she comes up here she tries to be friendly with the aides other than that shes always looking in the charts which she has no business doing do you recall specifically that she was up here tonight i remember all right because whenever i see her i challenge her i challenged her tonight just like i always do what did she say she said she was the acting charge nurse downstairs and needed some supplies i cant remember what it was i sent her into our supply room to get whatever she needed but i told her then to please leave i also told her shed have to replace whatever she borrowed which she promised she would and she went into your supply room she did and then what happened i guess she got what she needed and went back downstairs i really dont know because i was off taking care of a problem with one of the patients and then of course we had the code what room was patricia pruit in why do you ask id like to take a look be my guest meryl said while pointing down the appropriate corridor myriad thoughts were swirling around inside rogers head as he walked toward the patients room in his estimation jasmine rakoczi was becoming more and more of an enigma he kept asking himself why she would constantly be coming up a floor to the obgyn section to hobnob with the aides when she seemed so asocial and why would she be going through obgyn charts it didnt make any sense what did make sense was that both she and dr najah had come to obgyn prior to the code of course he wondered how many others on his transfer list had come as well for all he knew it could have been all of them patricias room was a mess the debris from the cardiac resuscitation attempt littered the floor in the frenzy of the event some of the wrappers syringes medication containers and the like had been merely tossed aside the bed had been cranked down flat raised to help with the cpr and the resuscitation board was still in place a few telltale droplets of blood were sprinkled across the wrinkled white sheet unfortunately what roger was looking for was not in evidence the iv pole was in its usual position at the head of the bed but without the bottle or plastic container of fluid that had to have hung there as a consequence of being on the scene roger had gotten the idea of having the iv contents checked since laurie had told him that toxicology had come up short maybe testing the iv fluid would yield something roger turned around and went back to the nursing station he got meryls attention and asked her about the missing bottle meryl shrugged her shoulders i dont have any idea where it is she then turned around and yelled to the medical resident whod been in charge of the resuscitation asking the same question he shook his head indicating that he didnt know either before getting back to his sidewalk miniconference he and the other residents were still loudly debating why they had been unsuccessful i guess it went down with the patient meryl said we always at least leave the ivs in place along with any other tubes this might be a silly question but i havent been on staff that long where exactly did the patient go to the morgue or what we use as the morgue its the old autopsy theater in the basement thanks roger said not at all meryl said roger went back to the elevators he pressed the down button but then eyed the sign for the stairs he suddenly had it in his mind to ask ms rakoczi why she went to the obgyn floor so often and what it was that she needed that night since the elevator was taking its time arriving roger used the stairs as he descended he acknowledged that the caffeine was finally starting to wear off his legs felt heavy he decided that hed have one more chat with ms rakoczi hunt briefly for the iv bottle and then head for home the surgical floor was as quiet as it had been earlier roger surmised that the nurses were all attending to their patients he saw some of them as he passed open doors into the patients rooms rather than bother anyone he thought hed wait at the nurses station for ms rakoczi to return to his surprise he found her where hed found her earlier in the same position reading the same magazine i thought you said you had patients to see roger said he knew he was being abrasively provocative with someone with a volatile temperament but he couldnt help himself this woman was obviously goldbricking i saw them now im manning the nurses station do you have a problem with that luckily for both of us its not my bailiwick roger said but i do have another question for you i followed your suggestion and went upstairs to obgyn and spoke with meryl lanigan she said you were a frequent visitor to her floor in fact she said you were up there earlier id like to know why for my continuing education jazz said obgyn interests me but i didnt get much exposure to it with the marines for obvious reasons so i frequently go up there on my breaks now that ive learned a bit about the field im thinking of putting in for an opening in obgyn so it was for continuing education that took you up there tonight is that so hard to believe instead of going down to the cafeteria on my lunch hour with my half of the surgicalfloor team and talking about drivel i went up to obgyn to learn something i dont know what it is about this place whenever you make an extra effort to improve yourself you get nothing but grief i dont want to add to your burden roger said struggling to keep the sarcasm from his voice but there seems to be a discrepancy ms lanigan told me that when she confronted you earlier you said you wanted to borrow something is that what she said jazz questioned with a scornful laugh well shes right in one sense i did need to borrow some infusion lines thanks to central supply not restocking us but that was an afterthought what i was really doing up there was sucking up information from reading nursing notes she probably doesnt want to admit that because shes probably worried im gunning for her job that wouldnt be my take roger said but what do i know thanks for your time ms rakoczi ill be back in touch if i have any more questions roger walked out of the utility room and rounded the nurses station countertop he was now feeling genuinely fatigued the caffeine had completely worn off a few moments earlier hed entertained the idea after talking again with ms rakoczi of returning to the or to see if he could find dr najah as with rakoczi he wanted to ask him what he had been doing on the obgyn floor but now he had second thoughts he was exhausted it was nearly four oclock in the morning roger resolved that the first thing he would do when he got into his office later that morning was call rosalyn and beg for jasmine rakoczis st francis record he didnt care about the consequences he found himself wondering how much the general nursing shortage had to do with the fact that jasmine rakoczi was employed the overwhelming chances were that she was not a serial killer that would be too easy but the fact that she was employed as a nurse with her attitude was a travesty as far as he was concerned and he intended to do something about it roger pressed the elevators down button and hazarded a glance back toward the surgical nurses station it was only for a split second but he thought he caught a glimpse of jazz eyeing him from around the edge of the door to the utility room roger wasnt so sure and as tired as he suddenly felt it could have been his imagination the woman made him uneasy he hated the thought of being a patient under her care the elevator came and he boarded just before the doors closed he looked back at the utilityroom doorway for the second time he didnt know if it was his eyes or his brain that was tricking him because he thought he saw her again he took the elevator down to the basement level where hed never been in contrast with the rest of the hospital it was completely utilitarian the walls were unadorned stained concrete and myriad exposed pipessome insulated some notran along the ceiling the lighting fixtures were simple porcelain sockets with wire cages just beyond the elevators an old sign composed of peeling paint applied directly onto the concrete wall said autopsy amphitheater accompanied by a large red arrow the route was labyrinthine but by following the red arrows roger eventually arrived at a set of double leather doors with oval windows set at eyelevel height the glass was covered with a greasy film although roger could tell a light was shining in the room beyond he couldnt make out any details he pushed through then propped the door open with an old brass doorstop inside was an oldfashioned semicircular twostory medical amphitheater with rows of tiny seats that rose up on tiers into the shadows roger guessed it had been built a hundred years ago when anatomy and pathology were kingpins in the academic medical curriculum there was a lot of old scraped and pitted dark varnished wood and the lighting came from a single large hooded lamp that hung on a long cord from the ceiling the light was centered on an antiquated metal autopsy table that occupied the center of the pit against the back wall was a glassfronted cabinet with a collection of stainlesssteel autopsy tools roger wondered when theyd last been used outside the medical examiners office few autopsies were now done particularly in managedcare hospitals like the manhattan general standing within the pit along with the autopsy table there were several shrouded hospital gurneys obviously supporting corpses roger started forward not knowing which was patricia pruit as he approached the first body he questioned as hed done in the past why laurie had chosen forensic pathology as her career it seemed so contrary to her vibrant personality with a shrug he grabbed the edge of the sheet and lifted roger grimaced he was looking at the remains of an individual who had been involved in some kind of accident the mans head was horribly distorted and crushed such that one eye was completely exposed roger replaced the sheet his legs felt weak as a medical student hed not liked pathology particularly forensic pathology and this victim reminded him of that fact in an uncomfortably brutal fashion roger took a few breaths before stepping over to the second gurney he reached for the edge of the sheet but his hand didnt make it instead he was propelled forward off his feet having been hit smack in the middle of his back with what felt like a twobyfour he knew he was falling and his arms reflexively flew out to cushion himself but before he hit the tiled floor the board hit him again taking his breath away roger collided with the floor and skidded forward on the glazed tile his head thumped up against the wall that separated the pit from the tiers of seats he tried to move but blackness descended over him like a heavy suffocating blanket seventeen when lauries alarm shattered the silence early saturday morning she felt about the same way she had friday morning once again she hadnt slept well and what sleep she did get was marred by anxious dreams the first thing she did after getting out of bed was repeat the pregnancy test with a new kit as a doctor she was well aware of the necessity to repeat tests to rule out false readings when she returned to check the results she was aware of a definite ambivalence but again it was clearly positive there could be little doubt that she was pregnant adding credence to the test results was the morning nausea which seemed a little worse than it had been the previous days but after eating some dry raisin bran she felt better the accompanying right lower quadrant discomfort was another thing luckily it wasnt anything like shed experienced the prior evening on her way home from her rendezvous with jack then it had been frank pain strong enough to make her writhe it had come on suddenly in the taxicab like severe intestinal cramps for a few seconds she thought shed have to put in a call to laura riley but then as suddenly as it appeared it vanished as intense as it was laurie was convinced it was related to her digestive system its quality was much sharper than a menstrual cramp which made her think it couldnt have anything to do with her being pregnant the only confusion was that in the mornings it appeared along with the nausea suggesting it was related laurie put her empty cereal bowl down on the countertop concerned about the lingering discomfort she gingerly pressed in on her abdomen in the general area of the pain with her index finger trying to determine if there was any pinpoint pain there wasnt and curiously enough the palpation alone seemed to be beneficial when laurie took her hand away the discomfort had vanished suggesting to her once again that the problem was intestinal perhaps gas relieved that the sensation had vanished laurie quickly dressed she was on call for the weekend which meant that of all the medical examiners at the ocme it was her turn to go in and see what kind of cases had arrived during the night she knew that she would probably be doing a few autopsies unless they all could be put off until monday which in her experience had never happened there was a person on second call in case of a flood of urgent cases but in lauries experience that never happened either the weather was typical for new york in marchdrizzling and cold laurie huddled under her umbrella as she trudged north on first avenue she had briefly searched for a taxi but whenever the weather turned sour they were hard to find as she walked laurie thought more about her conversation with jack in hindsight she realized how her emotions had understandably been careening from one extreme to another although she now felt selfconscious about her reaction to jack asking who the father was since it was in the final analysis a reasonable question she gave herself credit in general for having admirably maintained her composure considering the stakes involved it might have been one of the most important conversations in her life all she could do now was pray jack would respond as she hoped given jacks track record she imagined the chances were only about fiftyfifty on the street outside the ocme were several tv media trucks suggesting that something newsworthy had happened overnight and lauries guard went up dealing with the media was not her favorite part of being a medical examiner shed had some unfortunate experiences with journalists in the past to the extent of putting her job in jeopardy for a moment laurie hesitated and debated if she should head around to the th street morgue entrance she glanced back at the tv trucks there were only three and their antennae were not extended suggesting that they were not anticipating breaking news guessing that whatever had drawn them to the ocme was not frontpage news laurie climbed the steps and entered a dozen or so journalists and three cameramen were making themselves at home in the lobby waving a greeting to marlene who came in for a few hours every saturday morning laurie tried to walk across the lobby to be buzzed in almost immediately a journalist who recognized her blocked her way by thrusting a microphone in her face several bright lights switched on bathing the lobby in stark illumination as cameramen hoisted their equipment to their shoulders doctor do you care to comment on the accident the journalist questioned others crowded around extending their own microphones in your opinion was it a double suicide or were the two boys pushed laurie shoved the microphone out of the way i have no idea what you are talking about and any information coming from this office has to be cleared by the chief the deputy chief or the public relations office you people know that laurie pushed her way toward the id room while ignoring a welter of further questions to her relief robert was visible through the central glass pane with his help she got inside and closed the door behind her with the journalists stranded out in the lobby thanks robert laurie said peeling off her coat theyre like a bunch of wolves robert responded whats this is all about laurie asked a couple of thirteenyearold boys were run over by a subway train laurie winced such a scenario was going to be emotionally taxing for her and she was surprised shed not been called during the night luckily the current batch of tour doctors was particularly competent and they had significant experience under their belts to handle all but the most critical cases the tour doctors were mostly senior pathology residents earning a bit of money by moonlighting have the ids been done yup that was all taken care of during the night laurie was glad that was out of the way for her the id process was especially trying with children as it invariably meant dealing with the bereaved parents laurie continued into the id office delighted to see marvins weekend call coincided with hers hed already made the coffee and had laid out the folders of the cases that had come in with one of them in front of him laurie and marvin exchanged greetings as she helped herself to a mug of coffee looks like were going to be busy she said eyeing the folders im afraid so marvin agreed he tapped the folder in front of him with his knuckle we got another of these confusing postoperative cases from the general no kidding theres a note from janice on the front laurie read the note quickly it outlined the details on patricia pruit answering all the usual pertinent questions laurie sucked in a deep breath providing she found no significant cardiac pathology her series was now up to fourteen with eight at the manhattan general alone it couldnt go on lets do pruit first laurie said before the two boys marvin questioned did you see all the newspeople waiting out in the lobby i did and they can wait some more laurie said she wanted to confirm as soon as possible that pruit was part of her series and let roger know something had to be done they couldnt stand on the sidelines any longer okay ill go down and get set up anything else of note most seem routine to me i think youll want to pass on the majority of them my guess is that we are looking at doing four cases but you may have other ideas while marvin went down to the autopsy room laurie went through all the folders as she had anticipated marvin was right theyd do the four cases and call it a day unless anything of note came in while they were working with that decided laurie went up to her office to stash her coat she was glad she had because sitting on her desk was a stack of hospital charts to her amazement the pas had somehow managed the impressive feat of getting lewis and sobczyks charts from the manhattan general and the six charts from st francis all in record time the chart on the top of the pile was rowena sobczyks laurie flipped it open and shuffled through some of the pages glancing at the or notes and the anesthesia record as with mcgillin and morgan there was nothing out of the ordinary she was about to put the chart down when a short strip of abnormal ekg flopped out it was about two feet long having been folded accordionstyle into the chart with just the first six inches glued to the page laurie opened the chart to the location it was a note written by the resident in charge of the resuscitation attempt laurie quickly read it and found it unenlightening she then extended the ekg tracing and studied it the complexes were stretched out suggesting that they represented ineffectual heartbeats if they had been heartbeats at all they could have been merely poorly coordinated cardiac electrical activity that didnt cause any muscular contraction as the sequence continued the complexes became progressively more distorted then rapidly flattened out to a straight line on the border scribbled in pencil was the message short ekg segment from the outset of the resuscitation attempt after which no further electrical activity was obtained shed never had a strong background in reading ekgs and this short segment didnt suggest anything to her yet she couldnt help but think it might be significant since there had been no similar tracings on either mcgillin or morgan whod had no electrical activity on ekg whatsoever and she thought she might show it to someone more knowledgeable than she she marked the spot in the chart with her ruler and even scribbled on a postit note to remind herself to show the tracing to a cardiologist her phone rang and the sound made her jump she eyed it hoping and wondering if it could be jack she put her hand on it and allowed it to ring again feeling the vibration through her skin in a vain attempt to influence the identity of the caller her efforts notwithstanding it was marvin and the message was simple all was ready downstairs in the autopsy room laurie returned sobczyks chart to the top of the pile with the ruler sticking out of the side she was looking forward to going over them later that afternoon particularly those from queens to make sure the cases mirrored those from the general she then looked back at the phone and for a brief moment contemplated calling jack in the process she noticed the small light on the side of the phone indicating she had voicemail confused by who would have left her a voicemail during the night she picked up the receiver again and checked her messages laurie was surprised first by the time of the message and then by the sound of rogers voice she was impressed that he had taken her suggestion so seriously that hed been working nonstop until two oclock in the morning she was even more impressed that he had managed to come up with what he considered a list of suspects including an anesthesiologist by the name of najah whod recently transferred from st francis to the manhattan general as she continued to listen to the message she felt a definite sense of satisfaction and an eagerness to hear the details although when was another matter as she headed back toward the elevators to the basement she wondered if and when jack might call you never knew with jack as laurie had anticipated the post on patricia pruit was strikingly similar to the others in the series with absolutely no pathology to account for her sudden demise true to form the operative site was without any excessive bleeding without signs of infection and there were no clots in the major vessels of the legs abdomen or chest the heart lungs and brain were all entirely normal at the end of the procedure laurie helped marvin move the corpse back onto a gurney which one of the kids do you want to do first marvin asked as he unlocked the gurneys wheels it doesnt matter laurie said she had opened the two folders on a neighboring autopsy table and was searching for the forensic investigators reports then getting a second thoughts she said in fact why not put them both up at the same time fine with me marvin said agreeably he pushed the gurney with pruits corpse out through the main door a few years ago laurie would have taken the folders up to the lunchroom between cases but now that she had on her moon suit it was too much trouble so she read the investigative reports standing up with her ventilation fan as a backdrop she could immediately see why some journalists would be interested the tragic episode had the kind of lurid appeal that the tabloids loved the accident had happened at three oclock in the morning at the th street station the uptown train had thundered in and run over the two kids conflicting stories were the problem the engineer claimed that the kids had waited until the last minute to jump so there was nothing he could do such a scenario suggested a double suicide but the engineer failed a breathalyzer test casting severe doubt on his reliability the other story came from the conductor who claimed he was between car one and car two looking out at the station as the train came in he said he didnt see any kids on the platform and he passed the breathalyzer test the third story was from the agent in the token booth who claimed that a suspicious man had gone through the turnstile right after the kids but disappeared the door to the hall burst open and marvin pushed in another gurney this is not pretty he said i can imagine laurie said she continued reading the investigative reports no suicide notes were found either on the platform or on the victims conversations with both sets of parents did not confirm any episodes of depression in the words of one of the parents the kids were wild and full of the devil but would never kill themselves im going to get the other one marvin called out laurie waved over her shoulder as she continued to read once again she was impressed with janices work how janice could pack as much as she did into a single night laurie had no idea when laurie was finished with her reading she took out the sheets for the autopsy notes from the two folders and turned around to face the first of the two corpses as she did so marvin came back in with the second one good lord laurie murmured as she looked down at the first boys remains teenagers werent as difficult emotionally for laurie as younger children but they were still tough being run over by a train was at the upper end of traumatic experiences the boys arm had been severed at the shoulder and it lay alongside the torso the head and the face had been reduced to a pulp there was no way things could have been cleaned up for the parents benefit laurie began the external examination by detailing the alltoovisual trauma it was obvious that the body had tumbled along beneath the train until it had been brought to a stop theres the second one marvin said as he wheeled the empty gurney over to the side of the room laurie waved over her shoulder without turning around she found something unexpected on the boys penis which made her move down and look at the soles of his feet marvin joined her on the opposite side of the table i noticed that marvin said following lauries line of sight what do you make of it in addition to the abrasions there was a bit of charring where are the shoes laurie asked in a plastic bag in the walkin bring them in laurie said she was preoccupied and immediately stepped over to the second child by the time marvin was back with the clothing from both cases laurie felt she had solved the mystery by the external exam alone marvin brought over the sneakers that the kids had been wearing like the bodies themselves they were a sorry sight laurie picked them up and looked at the soles seems pretty clear to me what happened oh marvin questioned fill me in at that moment the door to the hall banged open surprising both laurie and marvin it was sal dambrosio one of the other mortuary techs he was more animated than his usual indifferent self we got a headless handless male corpse that just arrived along with some cops what should i do did you xray it weigh it and photograph it like youre supposed to do laurie questioned in sharp contrast with marvin who needed little direction sals apathy often grated on lauries nerves there was a protocol to be followed with every body arriving at the ocme all right already sal said sensing lauries impatience i thought with the cops here it might be a different story he ducked back out and the door closed laurie paused for a minute hearing that a headless handless body had arrived created a sense of d√©j√† vu that took her back seven years when a similar corpse had been brought in after floating around in the east river with some effort identification had been made the mans name turned out to have been franconi and mr franconi posthumously had taken her and jack on a wild adventure to equatorial guinea in west africa hey marvin interrupted lauries brief reverie come on you got me curious here whats with these two kids laurie again started to explain but the door to the hall reopened a gowned hooded and masked figure walked in much to laurie and marvins surprise im sorry but no one is allowed in here laurie called out holding up her hand like a traffic cop for a moment she thought the intruder might have been a particularly adventuresome journalist whod somehow managed to infiltrate ocme security its dangerous and full protective gear is mandatory oh come on laur the man said while stopping in his tracks jack told me on the weekends things werent so hardnosed around here and that this is the way he dresses unless its an infectious case lou laurie questioned yeah its me youre not going to make me get into one of those suits are you they drive me crazy if calvin comes in youll be banned for life realistically what are the chances of him coming in nil i suppose well there you go lou said he walked over to laurie and glanced down at the two boys then quickly looked back up at laurie yuck what a sight how you do this for a living it does have its downside laurie agreed what brings you in here so early on a saturday the headless horseman i came in with its caused another stir over at the manhattan general i tell you that place is going to be the bane of me i think youd better fill me in i got called at the crack of dawn this morning seems that the guy who takes care of the bodies over at the general came in to work as usual and then found a body that wasnt supposed to be there lou laughed i mean theres some humor here finding an extra body in a morgue ive heard about bodies being misplaced or missing but finding an extra one is a bit out of the ordinary why were you called why wasnt it just taken care of by the local precinct my captain got word of it subsequent to his sisterinlaws murder over there yesterday morning he practically has an open line to the hospital so he calls me right off the bat and tells me to get my ass over there the problem is that there havent been any breaks in his inlaws case so hes got the thumbscrews to me also there are some similarities this new corpse has what look like two bullet holes just like his sisterinlaw no id nope not a clue and theres no one missing at the hospital like patients or staff and what about the head and the hands gone theyre nowhere to be found so your captain thinks this new corpse relates somehow to his wifes sisters case he didnt say so in so many words but that was obviously what was on his mind it is weird the corpse was as clean as a whistle when the guy found it in the back of their old anatomy cooler no blood no gore no nothing as if the guy just got out of the shower the whole thing is kind of eerie if you ask me and ive seen a lot of weird stuff in my career how were the head and the hands cut off what do you mean was it clean or were they hacked off clean very clean like maybe the way a doctor might do it i suppose i hadnt thought about it like that but yes sounds like an intriguing case will you do it right away the captain said he wants to hear from me asap ill be happy to do the case but not until i finish with these two boys lou glanced around laurie and took another look at the remains whats the story here two kids run over by an a train lou grimaced is this what attracted the media types up in the lobby im afraid so just the idea of being hit by a train is gruesome enough but to make it even more appealing to the tabloids is the question whether its a double suicide or a double homicide yeah marvin said speaking up for the first time i was just about to hear the answer the moment you came in really lou questioned he overcame his hesitancy and stepped nearer these guys look like they went through a meat grinder what was it suicide or homicide neither laurie said it was accidental with obvious surprise both lou and marvin looked up at laurie how can you be so sure lou questioned im confident that when i do the posts ill find evidence the children were dead when the train struck them look at the slight charring on the feet laurie picked up a foot from each child in turn and pointed to the darkened scorched areas what am i looking at lou questioned burns laurie said then she pointed to the childrens penises just like those on the tip of their glandes what the hell are glandes lou asked its plural for glans or head of the penis ouch lou said making a grimace of pain i think these two boys made the fatal mistake of peeing in tandem on the third rail while standing either on the steel edge of the platform or on the rails themselves there was such a good ground the electricity arced up their urine streams and simultaneously electrocuted them my good god lou said straightening up remind me never to do that lou stayed for the posts on the two boys which went quickly as laurie had anticipated there was visible evidence that the massive trauma the boys received occurred after their hearts had ceased to beat while laurie worked she told lou about the first case they had done patricia pruit and that as a consequence her series of mysterious inexplicable unexpected deaths at the manhattan general had risen to eight good grief lou responded jack told me yesterday you had seven and that he was coming around to your idea about a serial killer but that the front office wasnt buying as of yet whats calvins reaction now is the ocme willing to take a public stand calvin doesnt know about the one this morning laurie said i dont know what his reaction will be but im not optimistic im afraid its going to take some momentous event to get him to see the light since no help has come from toxicology when it concerns the manhattan general he has blinders on he still thinks of it as the old venerated academic center where he trained the last thing hed want to do is tarnish its reputation if healthy people keep dying over there its reputation is going to suffer one way or the other but let me know if he comes around to your way of thinking like i told jack with everything else thats happening at the moment my hands are tied at least officially im up to my eyeballs with this chapman case if i dont come up with a suspect i might be out selling pencils actually im working with dr roger rousseau to generate some legitimate suspects and he left me a voice message last night saying hed made some progress i hate to hear you are working with that guy for obvious reasons but if you and he can come up with some names i can do something even if its not official i think we already have one laurie said she finished sewing up the last of the two boys and handed the instruments to marvin lets go ahead and put up the headless john doe before the tourist the tourist was the fourth case they planned on posting he was a college student who had presumably died from acute alcohol toxicity the level in his blood had already been shown to be off the charts hed been found in central park by an earlymorning jogger while marvin went out to get sal to help him with the corpses of the two boys laurie continued to talk to lou about her series she explained her idea about the potential killer apparently moving from st francis to the manhattan general and that roger was going to look into transferees among other people and might even have talked to some of them including the anesthesiologist najah wait a second he held up his hand hold it right there are you telling me this boyfriend of yours is planning on approaching najah and some of these other socalled suspects himself i believe so yes laurie responded she was caught off guard she hadnt expected such a negative reaction from lou this is nuts lou said you know how i feel about amateur detective shenanigans its one thing to come up with some names as part of an armchair game but its something else entirely when it comes to actually approaching anybody why youd have to narrow it down to find out which ones could truly be suspects otherwise its pure conjecture jesus h christ laurie i hate to hear you talking like this lets suppose for a second there really is a serial killer behind your socalled series if there is and if hes not absolutely bonkers then he could be extremely dangerous the slightest provocation could push him over the edge marvin and sal came back into the autopsy room while they moved the teenagers corpses onto the waiting gurneys laurie and lou stood silently they were both selfconscious about lous sudden vehemence when the door closed behind the techs pushing their gurneys lou cleared his throat sorry he said i didnt mean to come on that strong its just that amateur sleuthing scares the bejesus out of me the last thing i want you doing is risking your life like you did playing detective back during that paul cerino cocaine affair dealing with psychopaths is not for novices i think i get your point laurie said on a lighter note lou said eager to change the subject ive been dying to ask about your dinner date with jack last night howd it go are you guys going to bury the hatchet or what laurie didnt answer right away and when she did all she said was that the jury was still out lou was hardly satisfied but his intuition told him to let it go marvin and sal returned with a single gurney marvin pulling sal pushing after marvin placed an xray he had under his arm on a neighboring surface the two techs expertly transferred the headless and handless male corpse i see what you mean laurie said after taking one look at the body it is remarkably clean in sharp contrast to the teenagers mangled bodies there was no blood even at the severed neck and wrists which were cut off so sharply as to look like illustrations in an anatomy book sal took the gurney back out into the hall while marvin put up the xray the two bullets stood out as pure white blotches in the graytoblack field one was a flattened irregular shape and the other normal laurie pointed to the misshapen slug in the middle of the torso my guess is that this one hit the spine she then pointed to the defect in one of the vertebrae id say it ended up in the liver the other one is in the mediastinum in the center of the chest and i wouldnt be surprised if we find it penetrated the aortic arch that was the fatal shot looks like a ninemillimeter lou said well see laurie said she went back to the body to start the external exam while standing on the corpses right with marvin on the opposite side laurie asked the tech to roll the body toward him she wanted to view the entrance wounds as well as photograph them but when marvin did as she asked she caught sight of a small intricate tattoo of an octopus in the small of the corpses back laurie staggered and sucked in a lungful of air she reached out and grasped the tables edge to keep herself erect her eyes were fixated on the tattoo dr montgomery are you okay marvin asked laurie didnt move although she had initially staggered now she seemed frozen laurie whats up lou asked he bent forward to try to see through her plastic face mask laurie shook her head to break her momentary trance she took a step back from the table i need a break she said in a high breathless voice this autopsy is going to have to wait she turned on her heel and headed for the door both marvin and lou looked after her lou called her name but she didnt answer when the doors closed behind her lou looked at marvin whats going on beats me marvin said he eased the corpse back to a supine position he gave a short mirthless laugh this has never happened before maybe shes sick i think id better check lou said and he started for the door expecting laurie to be in the corridor lou was surprised when he didnt see anyone from where he was standing he could see all the way down to the security office there didnt seem to be anyone in there either confused as to what was going on he walked down the length of the bank of small refrigerated compartments where the bodies were stored prior to autopsy when he reached the end where there was a large walkin cooler to his left he was able to see to his right down into the supply room where the moon suits were stored although she was partly out of view he was able to catch a glimpse of laurie climbing out of her gear when he got down there laurie was plugging her battery pack into the charger whats going on lou asked are you okay arent you going to do the case laurie turned and faced her friend her eyes were brimming with tears hey lou said what is with you he pulled off his mask peeled off the gown covering his street clothes and enveloped her in a sustained hug she didnt resist after several minutes lou leaned back to see lauries face still keeping his arms around her she worked her arm up between them and wiped her eyes with her hand then dried it on the front of her scrub shirt are you ready to talk lou asked softly laurie nodded but made no attempt to free herself from lous embrace she took a deep breath started to talk stuttered and then stopped to wipe her eyes again take your time lou urged im afraid i know the identity of the headless body laurie said finally in a halting voice its roger rousseau my friend from the manhattan general good god lou said half in sympathy and half in irritation now you see why i said amateur sleuthing is dangerous i dont need a lecture laurie said she pushed herself out of lous arms im sorry i know you dont but this is a disaster tell me about it laurie challenged this person was someone important in my life and im the one who put him up to what he did oh god what a mess laurie cradled her head in both hands excuse me dr montgomery but thats not what happened you made a suggestion for him to come up with some names unless im off base you didnt put him up to going around talking to people that was his idea at the moment that seems like an academic distinction laurie said while letting her hands fall to her sides are you going to do the case lou asked no im not going to do the case laurie snapped okay okay you dont have to get mad at me im on your side sorry laurie said with a shake of her head robert harper the head of security passed by lauries line of sight down near the walkin cooler after disappearing in the direction of the autopsy room he did a double take and returned to view he quickly approached the media people are getting restless robert reported theyve heard about the headless corpse and now insist on getting details how did they hear about the new arrival laurie demanded robert made a questioning gesture with his hands ive no idea marlene just called me to come up there to calm them down laurie looked at lou lou put up his hands i didnt tell them laurie shook her head dejectedly this is a circus what should i tell them robert asked tell them that im calling the deputy chief i doubt that will satisfy them its going to have to laurie said she pushed between both men and walked out of the storeroom on her way back to the autopsy room robert and lou exchanged a quick glance before robert headed back upstairs lou went after laurie by quickening his step he caught up with her rousseaus got to be posted he said you dont have to tell me what i already know laurie said she pushed open the autopsy door leaned in and told marvin to take a break and that she would be back to him in a little while she then headed for the back elevator lou followed as they rode up in the elevator cab lou looked at laurie who stared back for the moment her shock and sadness had turned to anger maybe this is the wakeup call laurie said maybe now all you naysayers will think a bit more seriously about this series of mine i beg to differ lou corrected rousseaus death does not unequivocally validate that the deaths of the patients in your series are homicides all it does is confirm that we have a killer at the manhattan general who is targeting doctors and nurses maybe this individual is killing patients maybe hes not avoid jumping to conclusions i dont care what you say i think they are related maybe so lou said did rousseau leave any other name besides dr najah no that was the only one but you suspect he had more theres no doubt he had more he said as much do you think he might have written the names down i do he mentioned he had lists well thank the good lord for small favors they arrived at lauries floor lou hurried after laurie who bolted out of the elevator and headed down to her office when laurie sat down at her desk and picked up her phone lou did the same at rivas desk with some hesitation laurie dialed jacks number she prayed hed be in his apartment and not out playing basketball to her relief he picked up on the second ring i hate to bother you laurie began bother its no bother its good to hear from you i know i said id wait for your call but something has come up jack i need you here at the ocme are the cases so uninteresting that you need comic relief jack suggested he started to say more but laurie cut him off please hold the sarcastic humor roger rousseau was brought in this morning as an unidentified homicide victim he was shot last night at the manhattan general hospital ill be right there jack said and hung up after slowly replacing the receiver laurie put her elbows on her desk cradled her head with her hands and rubbed her eyes ever since that fateful night in jacks apartment when she couldnt sleep it was as if her life had spun out of control she seemed to be hurled from one upheaval to another behind her she could hear lou talking with some of his men over at the manhattan general he was telling them to seal dr roger rousseaus office until he got over there and to run a background check on a doctor named najah an involuntary moan escaped lauries lips as she straightened herself up and took her hands away from her face she would need to grieve for roger but it would have to be later she picked up the phone and dialed calvins number after she spoke briefly with his wife calvin came on the line whats up calvin asked in an impatient tone he did not like to be bothered at home without good reason im afraid a number of things first things first but im not sure how to say this im not in the mood for games laurie just tell me what you have to tell me all right im ninetynine percent sure that the chief of the medical staff at the manhattan general the doctor friend with whom i have been confiding about my series is at this moment lying on a table in the autopsy room waiting to be posted hed been shot last night in the hospital and found this morning in the anatomy cooler for a moment calvin didnt say anything laurie might have thought theyd been disconnected if she couldnt hear his breathing why arent you one hundred percent sure calvin finally asked the corpse is headless and handless whoever did this to him didnt want him identified so he was brought in as a john doe thats correct and how did you make the ninetynine percent identification i recognized a rather unique tattoo so i suppose its safe to say this individual was more than a friend he was a friend laurie persisted a good friend okay calvin said willing to change the subject knowing you as i do i assume you take this episode as further support to your serialkiller idea in regard to your series it stands to reason it was just yesterday morning that i told the victim about the queens cases and suggested he look into employees who had transferred from saint francis to the general he left me a voice message during the night saying that hed come up with some potential suspects whom he was going to approach are the police actively involved most definitely detective lou soldano is here right at this moment talking to his people over at the hospital i think it would be inappropriate for you to do the post it never crossed my mind jack is on his way in jacks not on second call i know i thought that not only could he do the autopsy but he could lend me some needed moral support okay thats fine calvin said are you sure you want to stay i could have someone take your place for the weekend i imagine this is rather a shock its a shock but i prefer to stay thats your call laurie and i wont force the issue at the same time i have to be clear about the stand of the ocme in regard to your series as i said before we are not in the speculation business theres no proof any of these patients of yours are homicides are we on the same page laurie i have to be sure because i dont want you going to the media theres too much at stake here there was another case for my series this morning laurie said a healthy thirtysevenyearold woman that makes eight at the manhattan general alone numbers are not going to sway me laurie and they shouldnt sway you what would sway me is if john came up with something toxicological ill see if i can put some pressure on him on monday to redouble his efforts a lot of good that is going to do laurie thought dejectedly knowing how much effort had already been expended what else is going on calvin asked you implied there was something more there is laurie admitted i wouldnt have bothered you about it but since i have you on the line i might as well inform you laurie went on to tell the story about the two teenage boys when she got to the end she mentioned the media people in the lobby and then added i would like permission to inform them about my findings on these two cases i believe it is in the public interest for this information to get out sooner rather than later in hopes of discouraging kids from doing it again in the future are the media people aware of the headless corpse unfortunately yes if you talk with them will you be able to restrain yourself from talking about the headless corpse or your series theyll undoubtedly ask you i believe so laurie its either yes or no okay yes laurie voiced with some impatience dont get testy with me laurie or im not going to allow you to talk with any media sorry im a little stressed you can talk to the media about the subway incident provided you emphasize your findings are a preliminary impression pending further study i want you to say that specifically yes fine okay laurie said eager to get off the line suddenly she was tired of talking with calvin as he was a constant reminder of the political side of being a medical examiner when laurie finally hung up she turned around to face lou whod also completed his calls she inwardly winced with a sudden sharp pain in her lower right abdomen luckily it was a far cry from what she had experienced in the taxi the evening before but it got her attention nonetheless jacks coming in laurie said she changed her position to relieve the pain it did to some degree but not completely hell do the post on the headless corpse lou nodded i overheard its a good call because theres no way you should do it i also overheard about your plan to talk to the newsmen downstairs i can help you out by talking to them about the headless corpse while you stick to the subway accident that way youll stay out of trouble with calvin sounds like a good plan laurie said she stood up and the pain lessened and i have to tell you that i already found out something very interesting this dr najah has a sheet he was arrested four years ago trying to board a plane to florida with a pistol in his briefcase of course he claimed it was an accident and that he had forgotten it was in there and he did have a license for it was it a ninemillimeter it was interesting laurie placed her hand on her hip so that she could use her fingers to surreptitiously massage her abdomen similar to that morning the maneuver was almost immediately curative and something else lou said before he retrained as an anesthesiologist hed been a surgeon my word laurie said while picturing the neatly cut ends on the corpse where the head and hands had been removed were going to pull him in for a few days and have a couple of our more experienced interrogators have a crack at him were also going to get a search warrant and see if we cant come up with that ninemillimeter he was trying to take to florida sounds like a very good idea to me laurie agreed eighteen it wasnt long after laurie and lou had gone down to face the media that jack arrived much to lauries surprise she had suspected he had taken a cab but jack had corrected her he had explained that at that hour of morning his bike was the vehicle of choice for any crosstown travel when time was of the essence for laurie and lou dealing with the journalists had been taxing from the start just getting them to quiet down had been difficult since they had worked themselves into a minor frenzy the story possibilities of a nameless headless handless corpse discovered by accident in the anatomy cooler of a major hospital were in some respects better than those of the two male teenagers getting run over by the a train with characteristic imagination some truly lurid scenarios had been envisioned laurie had addressed the journalists first the idea that the kids had been electrocuted while peeing on the third rail had raised a few eyebrows but no abiding interest the group had been much more attentive as well as rowdy when lou talked about the unidentified corpse despite his cleverly not saying anything of substance jack autopsied rousseau a little while later working with marvin while lou observed laurie made it a point not to even watch instead she teamed up with sal to post the college student found in the park the cases were finished at about the same time up in the lunchroom over vendingmachine sandwiches and drinks jack gave a thumbnail sketch of the findings on rousseau he explained that the first bullet had severed the mans spinal cord so that the victim would have been a paraplegic had it not been for the second bullet jack described the second projectile as the coup de gr√¢ce since it pierced the heart after grazing a rib ending up in the left ventricular wall during the short monologue laurie struggled to maintain a calm exterior actively suppressing that the details of what she was hearing concerned someone who was dear to her to maintain the charade she actually asked a few technical questions which jack was happy to answer he said there was absolutely no doubt in his mind that the hands and the head had been removed well after the heart had stopped beating it was also his opinion that the man had not suffered as death had been almost instantaneous as far as the bullets were concerned they were definitely ninemillimeter after lou had called his captain to fill him in on the details of the autopsy he suggested that laurie come over to the manhattan general hospital with him to help locate and identify whatever kind of lists could be found in rousseaus office laurie agreed immediately not to be left out jack had asked to tag along he said he wouldnt miss an opportunity to participate in americares deserved comeuppance certain the media was going to have a field day once they got a whiff of what was going on behind the scenes particularly after hearing about patricia pruit he was now firmly in lauries camp before leaving the ocme laurie took a detour into the communications room behind the id office to let the operator know she was leaving she made sure the operator had her cell phone number on hand as the medical examiner on call laurie had to keep in touch to get over to the manhattan general they all climbed into lous chevrolet caprice laurie got in the front while jack sat in the back the morning drizzle had slowed to more of a mist still both jack and laurie preferred to have their respective windows open and deal with the moisture rather than breathe the cars interior air while they rode laurie brought jack up to speed on the phone message roger had left for her this najah sounds like a good candidate jack said maybe too good having an anesthesiologist behind this mystery would go a long way to explain why toxicology has failed to come up with anything there could be some kind of extremely volatile gas involved lou told jack what hed already learned about najah specifically regarding his ninemillimeter handgun he added that the handgun would be tested by ballistics if they were lucky enough to get their hands on it except for a rather obviously increased uniformed police presence the hospital appeared to be functioning in its normal bustling fashion with people coming and going and patients in wheelchairs being discharged a long line of visitors snaked from the information booth and doctors in white coats and nurses in scrubs crisscrossed the lobby lou excused himself for a moment to talk to one of the policemen laurie and jack stepped to the side how are you holding up jack asked better than i would have expected laurie responded im impressed jack admitted i dont know how you can concentrate with everything thats on your mind actually trying to figure out what is going on over here is helpful laurie said it keeps me from dwelling on my own problems at the moment laurie was referring to the abdominal discomfort shed been experiencing it seemed that the jarring shed experienced in the ride over in lous car had aggravated it to a degree it wasnt as sharp as it had been in the cab the night before but it was pain nonetheless and laurie started thinking seriously about it being appendicitis the location was correct even if the presentation was irregular just when she was thinking about mentioning it to jack lou returned lets head down to the crime scene before we hit rousseaus office lou said apparently the csi boys have made some headway they took the elevator down to the basement level and followed the arrows to the old autopsy amphitheater the aged leather double doors were propped open with their stops and a length of yellow crimescene tape stretched across the entrance a uniformed police officer stood to the side lou ducked under the tape but when laurie tried to follow the policeman blocked her way thats okay lou said coming back to lauries aid theyre with me heavyduty droplights illuminated the semicircular amphitheaters interior reaching even the top row of the tiered seats several crimescene investigators were still working word is youve made some progress lou said to the lead tech phil i think so phil said modestly he waved for them to follow over to the far wall of the pit he pointed to markings in chalk on the floor weve determined that the body initially ended up here with the victims head in contact with the baseboard even though the area had been superficially cleaned we were able to clearly delineate blood spatter which gave us an idea where the victim had been when hed been shot phil then took the group back toward the ampitheaters entrance and pointed to two neighboring chalk circles this is where we found the two ninemillimeter shell casings which leads us to believe the killer was about twenty feet from the victim at the time of the shooting lou nodded while looking back and forth between where the body had been found and the cartridge casings and finally phil said while motioning for them to follow him again he walked over and put his hand on the old autopsy table this is where the dismemberment occurred a regular operating theater lou commented that was handy for the killer i should say phil responded he pointed toward the cabinet filled with autopsy instruments he even had access to the proper tools weve been able to determine which knives and saws were used good work lou said he looked at laurie and jack you guys have any professional questions how did you determine the autopsy table had been used to take off the head and the hands jack asked we took the drain apart phil said there was evidence in the trap lets see where the body was found lou asked no problem phil said he led them back across the pit beyond where the body had been outlined on the floor and through a single door into a short hallway they passed a small cluttered office which phil said was the dieners at the end of the hall they came to a stout wooden door that looked as though it belonged in a butcher shop it made a loud click when phil opened it a cool mist that reeked of formaldehyde billowed out to layer itself on the floor both laurie and jack were familiar with the style of the room beyond it was exactly like the anatomy cooler where the cadavers had been stored in medical school before being divvied out for dissection on either side were rows of naked bodies hanging by tongs inserted into their ear canals and attached to a track in the ceiling the victims body was on a gurney in the very back covered by a sheet phil said pointing down the central aisle its a little hard to see the space from here want to go back i think ill pass lou said he turned around cadaver coolers give me the creeps im impressed the body was found so quickly jack said it looks to me like these other guys have been hanging around for years laurie rolled her eyes it always amazed her that jack found humor everywhere the murderer didnt want the body found or identified she added lets get up to rousseaus office lou suggested since it was a saturday the administration office area was mostly deserted a uniformed police officer reading a copy of the daily news jumped when he caught sight of the group particularly detective lieutenant soldano behind the officer was the closed door to rogers office a piece of yellow crimescene tape was stretched across the front i trust that no one has been in here lou said to the policeman not since you called this morning lieutenant lou nodded and pulled the tape off one side but before he could open the door a voice called out his name turning around he saw a tall lean man with moviestar good looks striding toward him with his hand outstretched his sandy hair was streaked with gold and his face was tanned which made his blue eyes seem that much bluer it appeared as if hed just returned from the caribbean lou tensed im charles kelly the man said pumping lous hand with unnecessary vigor president of the manhattan general hospital lou had tried to set up a meeting with him the previous day but had been rebuffed as if it had been beneath the presidents dignity if lou had felt it had been imperative he would have insisted but as it was hed had other more pressing things to do sorry we were unable to connect yesterday charles said it was a ghastly day schedulingwise lou nodded and noticed that charles was casting a look at laurie and then at jack lou introduced them im afraid i know dr stapleton charles said stiffly good recall jack said that must have been a good eight years ago when i helped you guys out when you had all that trouble with those nasty germs charles looked back at lou what are they doing here his tone was anything but hospitable theyre helping me with my investigation charles nodded as if pondering lous explanation i will let dr bingham know they were here on monday meanwhile i wanted to introduce myself to you lieutenant and say that i will avail you of any help we can provide thank you lou said i think were doing okay at the moment there is something i would like to ask of you okay shoot lou said with two unfortunate murders in as many days i would like to ask you to be as discreet as possible particularly about the gruesome details of the one discovered today furthermore i would like to respectfully request that all information to be released goes through our public relations department we have to think of the institution and limit the collateral damage im afraid a smidgen of the lurid facts have already gotten to the media lou admitted i have no idea how it was leaked but i was forced to give a minipress conference i can assure you that i did not give them any details in an investigation like this it is best not to do so thats my opinion precisely charles said although i imagine for different reasons in any event we appreciate any help that you can give us in this most unfortunate circumstance good luck with your investigation thank you sir lou said charles turned and went back into his office what an ass jack commented i bet he went to harvard lou said enviously come on laurie urged ive got to get back to the ocme lou opened the door and the three walked into rogers office while laurie hesitated just over the threshold lou and jack went directly over to rogers desk lauries eyes slowly traversed the room being in rogers space brought back the enormity of her loss shed been acquainted with him for only five weeks and she knew deep down that she really didnt know him yet shed liked him and perhaps even loved him shed felt intuitively that he was a good person and had been generous to her at a time when she was needy in some respects she might have even taken advantage of him to a degree which caused her a twinge of guilt laurie come over here lou called laurie started across the room but stopped when her cell phone jangled in her coat pocket it was the ocme operator with the message that a police custody case had come in laurie assured her that shed be back within the hour and asked the operator to tell marvin to start setting up deaths in police custody were politically notorious and this was certainly one that shed have to post rather than wait until monday looks like weve got a lot of material here lou said when laurie joined him and jack these sheets might be the most important theyve even got stars next to the names he handed the sheets to jack who scanned them before handing them on to laurie they were the credentialing records for dr jos√© cabreo and dr motilal najah laurie read through both the timing of najahs transfer and the fact that he apparently favored the night shift are suspicious to say the least im wondering why the record of his arrest isnt on there lou questioned thats important for someone handling controlled substances i mean it would have to have been on his dea application laurie shrugged heres another list that rousseau put on star on lou said its people who transferred from saint francis to the general between midnovember and midjanuary jack glanced at it and handed it to laurie laurie read down the list of seven names noting which department in the hospital they worked all these people would easily have access to patients especially on the night shift lou nodded weve got our work cut out for us its almost too much heres a list of eight docs that got kicked off the generals staff over the last six months i imagine one of them could be a deranged oddball whod like to get back at americare somehow that sounds familiar jack said maybe you should add me to that list im going to have to get a whole team to start working on all this lou said if najah isnt our man then well be looking at interviewing the lot hmmm whats this i wonder lou held up a cd that was on top of several of the lists lets check it out laurie said she took the cd and booted up rogers computer by quickly typing in his password which caused jacks eyebrows to rise laurie caught the reaction but opted to ignore it the cd turned out to be the digital hospital records of all the cases in her series including those from st francis she guessed that roger had gotten the st francis data when hed gone over to get the employee records laurie explained to lou what it was and asked if she could take it with her back to the ocme it might help her when she went over the charts lou thought for a moment can you make a copy laurie located the computers cd burner and made herself a copy actually i wouldnt mind having copies of all this printed material as well laurie said after she thought about it later this afternoon ill have time to go over it all and maybe ill have some helpful ideas im sure theres a copy machine somewhere close by not a problem lou said with this much material we can use all the help we can get the copy machine was just outside rogers office and laurie made copies of all rogers lists when she was finished she told lou and jack that she was heading back to the ocme do you want me to go back with you jack asked i mean ill even take call if you want to go home ill be fine laurie assured him id rather stay busy than sit around in my apartment youre welcome to come but its up to you jack looked at lou whats your plan i want to interview the man who found the body lou said then i want to meet this najah and check to see if we lucked out obtaining his gun it might be that just reminding him of the science of ballistics might make him spill the beans and wouldnt that be nice mind if i hang with you for a while jack asked id like to meet dr najah myself be my guest jack turned to laurie ill be over ill even help you with that police custody case if youd like its not going to be a problem laurie said ill see you when i see you but thanks for coming in and doing the case that you did i really mean that laurie gave each man a hug and lingered a little longer with jack she even gave his arm an added squeeze before walking out prior to leaving the hospital administration area laurie took a detour into the ladies room balancing rogers lists and the cd on the edge of the washbasin laurie went into the stall while she relieved herself her mind flipflopped from rogers untimely demise to those of the two teenagers whose innocent mischief had caused their deaths it reminded her that humans like all living organisms large and small were always precariously poised on the edge of the abyss preoccupied with such thoughts laurie used a small folded wad of toilet tissue to wipe herself as she was about to drop the paper in the toilet she noticed something abnormal there was a tiny bit of blood she was spotting laurie instinctively recoiled from the implications it was only a minute amount of blood yet as far as she could remember any bleeding wasnt a good sign during a pregnancy especially so early at the same time the limited exposure shed had to obstetrics as a medical student had long since faded in her memory so she didnt want to jump to conclusions why does something like this always have to happen on a weekend laurie silently lamented shed like to ask laura riley the significance but was reluctant to call her on a saturday laurie took a fresh piece of toilet tissue and again blotted herself the blood didnt reappear which provided a bit of consolation yet combining the fact that there had been any blood with the right lower quadrant discomfort shed been having lately seemed inauspicious at best out at the sink while she was washing her hands laurie looked at herself in the mirror the last few nights of restless sleep had taken their toll although hardly in janices league her eyes had dark circles and looked tired and her face was drawn she had a bad feeling that she might be facing yet another upheaval and prayed that if it were to happen shed find the emotional reserve to deal with it nineteen it didnt take laurie as long as shed feared to get back to the ocme but once again the ride in the taxi markedly aggravated her abdominal distress marvin had been waiting for her and she immediately posted the police custody case which turned out to be therapeutic by the time she finished the autopsy the pain had vanished and in its stead was a vague sensation of pressure as she changed out of her scrubs she pressed the area with her fingers in contrast to what had happened that morning palpating the area made it feel worse as confused as ever she went into the toilet stall to see if she was spotting but she wasnt laurie went up to her office and stared at her phone once again she thought about calling laura riley but had the same reluctance she didnt even know the woman and she hated to start out the relationship by bothering her on a weekend with a problem that could probably wait until monday after all laurie had been having the symptoms for a number of days the sudden appearance of the few drops of blood was the only aspect that was truly different and that seemingly had stopped annoyed with herself for her indecisiveness laurie switched to thinking about calling calvin she could update him on roger and give him a headsup on the police custody case shed found extensive trauma to the prisoners larynx with the implication that excessive force had been used such cases were invariably politically challenging and calvin would need to be apprised yet there was no apparent pressure from the media and the toxicology had yet to be done laurie decided it could all wait until monday unless calvin took it upon himself to call instead of making any phone calls laurie decided to spend some serious time with the charts from queens and then rogers lists she felt she owed it to him since he had in a way sadly given his life for the cause the first thing that she noticed was that the st francis charts were significantly different from the generals whereas the manhattan general was a tertiary teaching hospital st francis was a mere community institution there were no interns or residents writing notes so the charts were much skimpier even the attending doctors notes and the nurses notes were shorter which made them much easier to go through as she expected from having read the forensic investigators reports on each of the cases the demographics matched those of the general the victims were all relatively youthful and had died within twentyfour hours of elective surgery they were also all healthy compounding the tragedy laurie then remembered roger saying that hed discovered that the general cases were all relatively recent subscribers to americare turning to the biographical data section of the chart she was currently examining laurie saw that it was the same she quickly checked the other five queens charts all of the patients had been americare subscribers for less than a year two of them had been subscribers for only two months laurie pondered this curious fact and wondered if it was significant she didnt know but she took out a ruled pad of paper and wrote all victims recent americare subscribers beneath that she wrote all victims within twentyfour hours of anesthesia all victims on ivs all victims young to middleaged all victims healthy laurie looked at her list and tried to think of any other ways the victims had been related nothing came to mind so she put the pad aside and went back to the charts although she knew the general cases had occurred in various parts of the hospital with many on the surgical floor she didnt know about the queens cases quickly she determined that it was similar with cases spread around the hospital since the queens charts were considerably thinner laurie was more tempted to look at every page and with one chart she found herself even reading the admission orders which were standardized on a printed form they described prepping the operative site proscribing anything by mouth after midnight and various routine laboratory studies as lauries eyes ran down the list she stopped on a test she didnt recognize it was grouped with blood tests so she assumed it was a blood test it was called masnp shed never heard of a test called masnp she wondered if np stood for nuclear protein but if it did what did mas stand for she didnt know but if she was right about the meaning of np then the test might be some kind of immunological screen switching to the back of the chart where all the laboratory test results were appended laurie searched for the result she didnt find it although she found all the other test results there was no masnp result with her curiosity piqued laurie looked in the other queens charts each one had an order for an masnp but no result it was exactly the same with the charts from general each chart had the order but no results laurie reached for her ruled pad and wrote all victims had an masnp ordered but no masnp result whats an masnp thinking about laboratory tests reminded laurie of the short run of ekg in sobczyks chart taken by the resuscitation team she shuffled through the charts until she found the right one it was easy since it still had her ruler sticking out laurie opened the chart unfolded the segment and reread the postit note shed written to herself to show the segment to a cardiologist putting sobczyks chart aside but open to the ekg she then checked to make sure none of the other charts had any ekg associated with the resuscitation attempts she hadnt remembered seeing any but she wanted to be certain i hope im not interrupting anything a voice said laurie turned around jack was standing in the doorway instead of his usual mildly sardonic expression his face reflected concern you look awfully busy he added its best i stay busy laurie responded she reached over for rivas chair and pulled it over next to her desk im glad to see you come on in and sit down jack lowered himself into the seat and scanned lauries desk what are you doing i wanted to make certain the queens cases were the equivalent of those at the general they are to a surprising degree i also found something curious are you acquainted with a blood test called masnp i assume it is an acronym but ive never heard of it me neither jack said where did you see it its part of the standardized preoperative orders in all these cases laurie said she picked up a chart at random and showed the order form to jack its in every chart i guess its part of americares established routine at least at these two hospitals interesting jack commented he shook his head did you look in the back to see what kind of units the results are recorded in that might be a clue i tried that but i couldnt find any results not in any one of the charts nope not one well im sure we can clear that up on monday by asking one of the forensic investigators to look into it good suggestion laurie said she made herself another postit note there is something else curious about all these victims without exception every one of them is a relatively new subscriber to americare having joined the plan within the last year now thats a cheery thought considering thats what we are laurie gave a half laugh i hadnt thought of that the plan is growing so fast i imagine a fair percentage of subscribers falls into that group true but it still seems odd to me anything else of note jack asked laurie glanced around at the charts scattered across her desk there is one other thing she picked up sobczyks chart with the short run of ekg recording folded out and handed it to jack does this tracing ring any bells with you it was taken by the resuscitation team the moment they got to the patient and just before the patient flatlined jack glanced at the squiggles too embarrassed to admit hed never been much good at ekg interpretation in even the best of circumstances he had decided early in medical school that he was going into ophthalmology and he didnt pay too much attention to skills that he wasnt going to need with a shake of his head jack handed the chart back to laurie if i was forced to say something id say that it looks to me as if the conduction system of the heart is failing but thats obvious with the way the complexes are spread out but you shouldnt be asking me my advice would be to show it to a cardiologist thats my plan laurie said taking the chart back and putting it with the others what about rogers lists jack asked have you had time to go over them not yet i had to do the police custody case first so ive only been here for half an hour or so ill spend some time with the lists when i finish the charts its with the charts that i feel i can make the biggest contribution theres got to be some piece of the pie im not seeing you dont think its random no theres something that links these patients together beyond what we already know im not so sure i think the cases are opportunistic with the victims being at the wrong place at the wrong time did you guys have any luck with najah yes and no jack said they picked him up all right but hes not cooperating he claims hes being discriminated against and victimized by racial profiling theyve got him in custody but he wont talk hes insisting on waiting for his attorney wholl be up from florida tomorrow for the arraignment and the gun its been sent to ballistics but results wont be available for a while in the meantime im sure hell be given bail whats lous take on whether hes the man hes optimistic especially given his behavior lou says if someone is innocent theyre happy to cooperate of course lou is only concentrating on who shot the nurse and rousseau hes not thinking about your series what about you as i said i like the idea hes an anesthesiologist given his training he could be knocking these patients off in a way that would be hard for us to figure out as for him shooting the nurse and rousseau thats equally circumstantial since its based merely on knowing he owned a ninemillimeter handgun the problem is that there are a lot of those weapons out there you dont think that whoever is killing the patients killed the nurse and roger im not sure i am laurie said it stands to reason the nurse probably saw something suspicious her death occurred the morning after there were two additions to my series as for roger hed gone up in the hospital specifically to talk to people he thought were potential suspects he could have confronted najah maybe he even saw him in pruits room very good points jack conceded im glad they arrested najah laurie said if hes the one hell think twice about any more shenanigans while lou is breathing down his neck which means im going to sleep a little better tonight in the meantime im going to go over rogers lists very carefully in case he doesnt pan out jack nodded several times that he agreed with lauries plan there was a brief pause until jack said i know its a bit offtopic but can we pick up where we left off last night laurie eyed jack warily as they had been talking shed noticed that his typical sardonic expression had gradually reappeared which she couldnt help but feel was a bad sign now that he was suggesting turning the conversation to personal issues deep down a combination of frustration and irritation begin to brew with everything else going on from guilt about rogers death to the pressure in her lower abdomen she was uninterested in weathering any more disappointment whats the matter jack asked in response to lauries silence misinterpreting her hesitancy he raised his eyebrows questioningly and superciliously added is this still not the time or the place you got that right laurie blurted struggling for control in the face of jacks tone the city morgue is hardly the place to discuss starting a family and furthermore to be honest with you i suddenly realize im finished discussing it the facts are pretty damn plain ive made it clear how i feel up to and including the new development of my pregnancy what i dont know is how you feel and ive got to know whether youre interested and capable of abandoning your selfabsorbed grieving role if that is what you want to tell me then fine tell me im sick and tired of discussing it and im sick and tired of waiting for you to make up your mind i can see this is definitely not the time or the place jack said with equal irritation he stood up i think ill wait until a more opportune circumstance you do that laurie snapped well be in touch jack said before walking out the door laurie turned to her desk cradled her head in her hands and sighed for a brief second she considered running after jack but even if she did she wouldnt know what to say when she caught him it was obvious he wasnt about to tell her what she wanted to hear at the same time laurie questioned if she was being too pushy and demanding especially since shed not told him about her latest symptoms and the fear that she had yet to voice even to herself the fear of a miscarriage which would change everything all over again it was a little after four in the afternoon when david rosenkrantz turned his car into the parking lot of the small commercial building where robert hawthorne had his office in its previous life the building had been a warehouse but like much of the renovation in downtown st louis it had been recycled it now had an upscale restaurant on the first floor and boutique offices on the second when robert hawthorneor mr bob as he was known to his operativescame to town first to found a company called adverse outcomes and subsequently to set up operation winnow he had found the space and thought it convenient since it was close to the law offices of davidson and faber david didnt know what the relationship was with the law firm and he knew he wasnt supposed to ask what he did know was that robert was called over there on a fairly regular basis it wasnt often that david was in town since it was his job to travel around to the various cities and check in on the field operatives and deal with them as necessary this was not an easy job considering the oddball characters they had functioning as independent contractors at first david just put out fires but now that hed worked for robert for more than five years hed been entrusted with recruitment as well the recruitment was more fun and challenging robert would come up with the names from an old army buddy who still worked in the pentagon they were mostly people who had worked in some sort of medical capacity in the military and who had been discharged less than honorably david hadnt been in the military himself but could appreciate how the experience could affect people who were trying to return to civilian life especially those who had seen any sort of combat with iraq grinding on they had plenty of potential recruits of course they also looked for people fired from civilian hospitals most of those tips came from people who were already embedded the door to the office was unmarked david rapped on it with his knuckle in case yvonne the secretary who was also roberts livein girlfriend was in the back office it wasnt a big operation robert yvonne and david were the only employees and for quite a few years it had been just robert and yvonne there was a loud click of the locking mechanism as bigbusted yvonne opened the door with her syrupy southernaccented voice she coquettishly invited david to step inside her syntax was interspersed with a lot of honeys and dears but david wasnt fooled despite the bleachblond hair and the floozy affectations like spike heels and a short skirt he knew that she worked out regularly with robert and was proficient in tae kwon do david felt sorry for anyone who might mistakenly decide after a few drinks to take advantage of her flirtatious behavior the office was simple there were two desks one in the front room and one in roberts inner office two computers a couple of small tables a few chairs a file cabinet and two couches it was all rented the ugly old boss is in the back room honey yvonne whispered now dont you go off and upset him you hear david had no intention of upsetting robert he knew something was up when robert called him in david had arrived back in town the night before after a number of days on the west coast and was supposed to be enjoying some downtime sit down robert said when david entered robert was at his desk with his legs crossed and his feet perched on the corner hands behind his head his brioni jacket was tossed over the arm of the couch you want any coffee dear yvonne questioned there was an italian espresso machine on the table in the front room david smiled and thanked yvonne but declined he looked at robert who had his lips pressed together in an expression of frustration i got some bad news a little while ago robert said it seems that our little hungarian number in the big apple just cant control herself another shooting david asked im afraid so robert said this time it was one of the doctor administrators the woman is a menace shes good but shes jeopardizing the whole operation are you sure she did it a hundred percent sure no ninetynine percent sure absolutely shootings follow her around like flies on a hunk of smelly cheese obviously this kind of thing cant go on so im afraid your little vacation has to be put on hold yvonne got you a reservation on a flight that gets in around tenthirty its short notice what about a gun yvonnes taken care of that as well youll just have to make a detour on your way into the city i dont remember her address yvonnes got that too dont worry weve thought of everything david got to his feet you dont mind do you robert asked no i dont mind i knew it was going to happen sooner or later yeah i guess i did too outside of lauries rather dirty office window the gray day had faded into night as shed pored over the charts yet another time hoping to find some hidden piece of critical information as had been the case on her previous readings nothing jumped out at her she had her postit notes to show the short strip of ekg to a cardiologist and to get the forensic investigators to clarify the nature of the masnp test other than that she didnt know what else to do shed also carefully reviewed all of rogers suspect lists ranking them in order of their potential relevance she still thought najah was the most intriguing and most likely suspect but the other seven individuals from various hospital departments who worked the night shift and who had transferred from st francis to the general around the critical time were almost equally interesting especially since the entire group had easy access to the patient floors the next list featured eight physicians whose hospital privileges had been canceled during the immediately preceding sixmonth period shed like to find out if possible what each one had done to warrant the disciplinary action between studying rogers lists and going over the charts for the final time laurie had thought about calling jack although she felt her reaction to him earlier was understandable under the circumstances she regretted it shed been far too precipitous and bitter and she should have at least given him a chance to speak his mind even if she suspected he was not going to say what she wanted to hear at the same time what she had said to him was unfortunately all too true she was tired of his indecisiveness which was the reason shed moved out of his apartment when she had ultimately laurie decided not to call it would have been like throwing salt on a wound instead she decided to wait until morning and if he hadnt called by then she would call him laurie stacked the hospital charts into two neat piles next to them she put the notepad with her own list of how all the cases resembled one another she put the cd with the digital records on top of the pad she looked at her watch it was quarter to seven which she thought would be a good time to head back to her apartment she would make herself a light supper before bed whether she would be able to sleep was another issue entirely she hadnt wanted to go home earlier for fear of becoming depressed it had been better to stay busy all afternoon to keep from thinking about rogers death jacks aggravating behavior and her own looming problems pushing back from the desk laurie was about to get up when she looked back at the cd suddenly the idea occurred to her to look and see if there was a difference between the digital record and the hardcopy hospital chartspecifically in respect to the unknown blood test maybe she could find a result and if so maybe she could figure out what the test was pulling herself back to the desk laurie booted up her computer and inserted the cd scrolling through the pages until she arbitrarily found herself at stephen lewiss laboratory values the print was very small and laurie used her finger to run down the column on the left side of the page near the bottom she found masnp running her finger horizontally she saw the result it was positive mefa laurie absentmindedly scratched her scalp as she stared at the recorded result there was no explanation mefa didnt make any more sense to her than masnp it was like looking up the definition of an unknown word and finding an unknown synonym laurie took another postit from the dispenser and wrote down the result followed by a question mark in order to put the new postit with the others which she had stuck to the wall behind her desk she scooted her chair back and half stood leaning forward with her hand outstretched a muffled cry of pain escaped from lauries lips instead of pasting the postit to the wall both her hands went down on the surface of her desk to support her weight shed gotten a sudden strong cramp in her lower abdomen and for a few seconds she held her position as well as her breath thankfully the pain began to lessen and laurie slowly let herself sink back into her chair she held herself stiffly lest she aggravate whatever was going on inside her body a continuous lowgrade discomfort had persisted in lauries abdomen following the autopsy on the police custody case it had waxed and waned to a degree but it had never entirely gone away she had characterized it more as pressure than pain until shed tried to place the new postit with the others once the pain had lessened to the point that laurie could breathe normally she allowed herself to adjust her weight in her chair by sitting up straighten thankfully what had now become an ache stayed at the same tolerable level perspiration had appeared on her forehead and she wiped it off with the back of her hand she knew she was anxious but she was surprised that she was anxious enough to perspire so freely she wondered if she could have a fever but didnt think so gingerly she palpated her abdomen with a single finger in contrast to previous occasions there was now an area of definite tenderness which seemed ominous to her as she had noted earlier it was exactly the location where the pain of appendicitis occurred with hesitation laurie slowly got to her feet it had been the sudden motion of half standing a few minutes earlier that had brought on the current episode and she was eager to avoid a repeat luckily there was no reoccurrence her perspiration was another matter that had actually gotten worse cautiously laurie took a few steps out of her office and into the hallway while continuing to support herself with her hand against the wall the pain remained bearable with gathering confidence she walked slowly down the length of the corridor to the ladies room inside she got some toilet tissue and wiped herself the spotting had reappeared and there was more blood than there had been earlier she knew she didnt have appendicitis with gathering anxiety laurie retraced her steps back to her office and returned to her chair she eyed the phone she was still hesitant to call dr riley though now she felt she had little choice the spotting ruled out appendicitis and along with the location of the pain suggested a possible ectopic pregnancy which was far more serious than a mere threatened miscarriage finally she reluctantly picked up the phone and called laura rileys office number when the operator answered laurie gave her name and directdial number thinking it might expedite the callback she included her md title and said she needed to talk with the doctor she said it was an emergency as laurie put the receiver back down she noticed a new sensation vague shoulder discomfort it was so mild that she wondered if she was imagining it yet it added to her already considerable anxiety if it was real it suggested the ominous development of peritoneal irritation to test the possibility laurie carefully pushed in on her abdomen with her index finger then suddenly took her hand away she grimaced with a fleeting stab of pain what she had felt was called rebound tenderness and it also suggested peritoneal irritation which now made her worry that not only might she have an ectopic pregnancy but that it might have already ruptured if so it was a true medical emergency for which time could be a critical factor she could be hemorrhaging internally the phones harsh ring interrupted her obsessing and she snapped the receiver up to her ear she was relieved when dr riley identified herself laurie could tell she was on a cell phone and in a public place loud conversation could be heard in the background laurie began by apologizing for calling on a saturday night and said that she had resisted because she worried it was a bad way to start out a professional relationship but she believed she truly had no choice laurie went on to describe her symptoms in detail including the rebound tenderness she admitted shed had discomfort prior to speaking with her on the phone the previous day but had forgotten to mention it and had thought it could wait until her scheduled visit the following friday first of all laura said when laurie had finished theres no need to apologize in fact i would have preferred you call sooner i dont want to alarm you but it we should consider an ectopic pregnancy until we can rule it out you might be bleeding internally i thought as much laurie admitted are you still diaphoretic laurie felt her brow it was damp with perspiration im afraid so whats your pulse approximately is it fast or normal using her shoulder to hold the phone laurie felt her pulse at her wrist she knew it had been fast earlier and she wanted to be certain it had remained so its definitely on the fast side she admitted she had hoped the sweating and the rapid heartbeat had been due to her anxiety but lauras questions had made her acknowledge that there could be another explanation she could be going into shock okay laura said in a controlled businesslike voice i want to see you in the emergency room at the manhattan general hospital laurie felt a shiver descend her spine at the thought of being a patient at the general could we pick another hospital she questioned im afraid not laura said its the only hospital where i have privileges besides they are fully equipped if we have to be aggressive where are you at the moment im in my office at the office of the chief medical examiner on first avenue and thirtieth street yes and where is your office in the building its on the fifth floor why do you ask im going to send an ambulance good god laurie thought she didnt want to ride in an ambulance i can take a taxi she suggested you are not going to take a taxi laura stated unequivocally one of the first rules about being a patient in an emergency medical situation a rule which is particularly hard for doctors to accept is that you must follow orders we can argue about the necessity later but right now we are not taking any chances im going to send an ambulance asap and i will meet you in the er do you know your blood type o positive laurie said see you in the emergency room laura said and disconnected with a shaking hand laurie hung up the phone she felt shellshocked upheavals were becoming the norm in a single day shed been forced to identify a friends corpse and now face the terrifying prospect of a medical emergency and possibly surgery at a hospital where a suspected serial killer was killing patients like her the only consolation was that the most likely suspect was in custody laurie snatched up the phone shed been reluctant to call jack for a variety of reasons but with this new development her hand was forced she needed his support she needed him as an ombudsman or guardian in the hospital if she did end up having emergency surgery the phone rang once then twice come on jack laurie urged answer it the phone rang again and laurie knew he wasnt there as she suspected after the next ring his answering machine picked up as laurie waited to leave a message she felt a wave of resentment wash over her it seemed uncanny how jack managed to irritate her in so many different ways undoubtedly he was out on his neighborhood basketball court pretending he was a teenager laurie knew she was being unreasonable but she couldnt help it she was actually angry that he wasnt there although she knew it was an unfair comparison she couldnt help but think that had roger not been killed he would have been available a major problem has come up laurie said when it was time for her to speak i need your help again at the moment i am waiting for an ambulance to take me to the manhattan general dr riley thinks i might have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy on the plus side it will mean that the pressure will be off you but on the negative side ill be facing emergency surgery i need you to be there i dont want to become part of my own series please cornel after pressing the disconnect button laurie dialed jacks cell phone she went through the same process leaving a similar message in hopes hed get one or the other then she pushed away from the desk with the idea of getting her coat before heading down to the basement level where she expected the ambulance to arrive as she stood up she kept her hand pressed against her lower abdomen hoping to avoid another severe cramp instead she heard ringing in her ears and felt a wave of dizziness the next thing laurie was aware of was voices particularly the voice of a man seemingly talking on the telephone he was saying something about the blood pressure being low but steady the pulse at one hundred and the abdomen being slightly tense laurie realized her eyes were shut and she opened them she was on the floor of her office facing up at the ceiling a female emt was busily taping an iv line against her left arm a male emt was standing to the side while speaking on his cell phone behind him she recognized mike laster alongside laurie was a collapsed gurney with an iv pole what happened laurie asked she started to get up easy the female emt said placing her hand on lauries chest you just had a little fainting episode but everything is okay were going to be getting you out of here in two seconds the male emt snapped his phone shut all right lets go he walked around behind lauries head and insinuated his hands beneath lauries back and into her armpits the woman went to her ankles on three the man said and then quickly counted laurie felt herself lifted over onto the gurney the emts quickly secured her with straps raised the gurney to waistheight and jockeyed it out into the corridor how long was i unconscious laurie questioned shed never fainted before she had no recollection of falling to the floor it couldnt have been for very long the woman said she was at the foot pushing while the man was at the head pulling mike walked alongside sorry about this laurie said to mike dont be silly mike responded they took the elevator down to the basement level as they passed the mortuary office laurie saw the evening tech miguel sanchez standing in the doorway laurie waved selfconsciously miguel waved back the gurney bumped across the morgues concrete floor past the security office and out onto the loading dock the ambulance was parked next to one of the health and hospitals mortuary vans laurie thought of the irony that she was going out the same way the bodies came in once in the ambulance the female emt inflated a bloodpressure cuff around lauries right upper arm what is it laurie asked its fine the woman said although she reached over and opened the iv a little more for laurie the ride over to the manhattan general hospital was surprisingly rapid shed felt detached enough to close her eyes she could hear the siren although it seemed as if it were in the distance the next thing she knew the doors of the ambulance were flung open and she was rolled out into bright light the emergency room was typically chaotic but she didnt have to wait she was whisked into the depths and directly into the acute care section as she was being transferred onto an examination table laurie felt a hand grip her forearm laurie turned and found herself gazing up into the face of a youthful woman dressed in scrubs complete with a hood im dr riley we are going to be taking good care of you i want you to relax im relaxed laurie responded since weve not met before tonight i need to ask if you have any medical problems whether you are taking any medication or whether you have any allergies no to all of those questions ive been blessed with very good health good laura said wait a second laurie said there is something i wanted to mention to you ive recently been tested positive for the brca marker have you seen an oncologist about it not yet well i dont think that is going to influence what we need to do in this situation let me give you the game plan first well do a rapid culdocentesis which is to confirm if you have any blood in the space behind your uterus its done with a needle through the apex of your vagina it sounds worse than it is youll feel a pinch but thats about all i understand laurie said true to her word laura quickly did the procedure with little discomfort to laurie the result was positive this pretty much makes the decision about surgery for us laura said my biggest concern is that you are continuing to hemorrhage into your abdominal cavity weve got to stop that we also will need to give you some blood do you understand everything that im saying i do laurie said im sorry youve had to experience a problem like this i want to make certain you dont think it is your fault ectopic pregnancies are more common than people realize there is something in my past that may have contributed in college i had an episode of pelvic inflammatory disease associated with an iud that may or may not have contributed laura said meanwhile is there anyone you would like us to call ive already called the person id like to be here laurie said okay im going up to the surgery floor to make sure everything is ready ill see you in a few minutes thank you again im sorry if ive ruined your saturday night what are you talking about getting you back to normal is going to make my saturday night for a few minutes laurie was left by herself she felt curiously detached as if the whole episode involved someone else she could hear telltale evidence of dramas unfolding in neighboring rooms and saw people dash by the open doorway on various urgent errands laurie felt lucky to have laura riley as her doctor and was indebted to sue for recommending her with the kind of confidence and professionalism that laura projected laurie wasnt as fearful about the upcoming surgery as she would have imagined she knew she needed it with the growing fullness in her abdomen and the general weakness the blood loss caused her only real worry was the fear of being victimized by sads after the surgery and becoming a member of her own series but she put the thought out of her mind instead she thought about jack and wondered when he would get her message there was some concern that he was upset enough at her not to come in if that were to happen laurie had no idea what she would do so she put that thought out of her mind as well twenty jack had managed to fool flash with a head fake and clever use of a pick and for a moment flash had no idea where jack was by the time flash had figured out what had happened jack had snaked his way in under the basket warren had seen the move out of the corner of his eye and shot a perfect pass into jacks waiting hands jack twisted around and was poised to make a simple layup to win the tied game unfortunately that was not what happened by some inexplicable miscalculation on jacks part the ball didnt glance off the backboard and drop through the basket as he intended instead it fell far short lodged between the baskets rim and the backboard and stayed there play ground to a halt totally embarrassed to have missed such an easy shot jack had to leap up to knock the ball free then as the final indignity a player on the opposing team grabbed the ball stepped out of bounds then let loose with a long pass down the court to flash whod taken advantage of jack being under the basket to break free jack was supposed to be guarding him instead jack had to watch impotently while flash went in to make a layup at the opposite end and unlike jack he didnt miss the game was over flashs team had won jack slunk off the court wishing he could disappear he dodged some of the puddles along the sidelines with his back pressed against the chainlink fence in a dry area he sank to a sitting position with his knees up in the air warren sauntered over hands on his hips and a mocking wry smile on his face warren was fifteen years jacks junior with a body that would have made a mens underwear model jealous as the best basketball player in the neighborhood and as a keen competitor he hated to lose and not just because it meant he might have to sit out a game or two for him it was a personal affront what the hells the matter with you warren questioned how could you miss that shot i thought you had recovered but that has to go down as one of your more pitiful exhibitions sorry man jack said i guess i wasnt concentrating warren gave a short derisive laugh as if that was the understatement of the year before taking a seat next to jack with his knees angled up in a similar fashion in front of them a new group of five was getting ready to take on flash and his team despite the crummy weather and the fact that it was saturday night there had been a big turnout jacks basketball had recovered to a degree over the last several weeks but that afternoon lauries pushiness and her playing the victim role had provoked him to no end he could sympathize with her about what she was facing lately but from his perspective she had no idea what being a victim was really like on top of that he couldnt believe she kept harping on him about his use of humor which he felt was his only defense against the harsh reality that fate and americare had thrown at him and worse yet he couldnt comprehend that she wouldnt listen to what hed been thinking about this new curveball of her being pregnant after shed broken the news hed thought of nothing else and had been looking forward to sharing his feelings both pro and con the news had forced him to face the idea of a second family as a reality and hed come around to believing he might not be quite as scared of the situation as he thought at least until that afternoon when she acted so demanding and victimized when he thought about the conversation again he couldnt believe she was sick and tired of discussing having a family because prior to her moving out he couldnt remember that last time shed even brought up the subject hell jack exclaimed suddenly snapping his headband off his forehead and throwing it to the pavement warren looked at him questioningly man youre in bad shape let me guess lauries still acting up youve no idea jack said scornfully he was going to elaborate when he heard a distant muffled beeping grabbing his backpack he opened the zipper and took out his cell phone which he normally didnt bring out onto the court unless he was on call but that evening after the fracas with laurie he wanted to stay in touch in case she came to her senses when he flipped the lid and saw that he had a message he checked caller id its her jack said with a touch of exasperation with no idea what to expect and scant hope for a miracle he called his voicemail as he began to listen to the message he stood up as he continued to listen his jaw slowly dropped then he disconnected and looked down at warren momentarily paralyzed good god shes been taken by ambulance to the manhattan general for emergency surgery breaking free from his brief stunned immobility jack bent down and snatched up his gear i got to change and get the hell over there he turned and started at a run toward the playground exit hold up warren called after him jack didnt stop or slow down knowing full well the seriousness of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy when he was held up by traffic on the street warren caught up to him how about i give you a lift warren said my rides just around the corner fantastic jack responded by the time you get your ass back down ill be sitting out here waiting on you warren said jack waved acquiescence before sprinting across the street he took the stairs in his apartment building by twos and started pulling off his clothes on the final flight the rest of his basketball outfit came off as he traversed his apartment anxious to get to the hospital before laurie was taken up to the or he didnt like the idea of her having surgery and he didnt like the idea of her being at the manhattan general as he thundered down the stairs jack struggled into the same clothes hed worn that day true to his word warren was sitting in his black suv when jack emerged from his building jack jumped in and warren took off with a screech is this surgery serious warren asked youd better believe it jack answered while he tied his tie he chastised himself for reacting so emotionally to lauries minioutburst that afternoon what he should have done was just let her rant without getting his dander up but hed not been in control hed not been in control since she walked out of his apartment how serious warren asked let me put it this way people have died from the problem she has no shit warren murmured as he pressed his foot down on the accelerator jack grabbed the handhold above the passengerside door to steady himself as warren s suv surged forward to make the traffic light at the th street traverse a few minutes later warren had the manhattan general in his sights where do you want to be dropped off warren asked follow the signs for the emergency department jack said warren ended up nosing in between two ambulances at the receiving dock and jack jumped out thanks man jack called let me hear how things go warren shouted out his window jack waved over his shoulder then vaulted up onto the platform and ran inside the waiting area was packed with people jack headed directly for the double doors that led into the emergency room proper but he was barred by a beefy redfaced uniformed policeman the man had been standing to the side but stepped in front of the doors as jack neared you gotta sign in at the desk the officer said pointing over jacks shoulder with a bit of effort jack got out his wallet and flipped it open attached was his formal medicalexaminer badge the policeman drew jacks hand closer to examine it sorry doc he said when he recognized what it was after glancing into a few of the cubicles and having no luck finding laurie jack stopped one of the nurses who was scurrying down the corridor with a clutch of bloodsample tubes in her hands when jack asked for laurie by name she squinted as if she were slightly myopic at a dryerase board that jack had not seen back near the entrance doors shes in the acutecare area the woman said she pointed into the depths of the complex room jack found her alone in the room surrounded by all sorts of acutecare equipment behind her was a flat lcd screen with realtime tracings of her blood pressure and pulse her eyes were closed and her hands were folded on her chest with her fingers intertwined except for her pallor she looked the picture of contented repose behind her and hanging from an iv pole were a cluster of bottles and a plastic pouch of blood which ran into her left arm a few steps brought jack to lauries side he put his hand on her forearm reluctant to wake her from her peaceful slumber but afraid not to laurie he called softly lauries heavily lidded eyes opened she smiled when she saw jack thank goodness youre here how do you feel considering everything i feel pretty good anesthesia came down and gave me some kind of preop im about to go up to surgery i was hoping youd get here before i went in is it a ruptured ectopic pregnancy all indications point to it im so sorry youre going through this arent you a little relieved i mean be honest no im not relieved in fact im worried cant we get you over to another hospital what about your fathers hospital laurie smiled with druginduced serenity she shook her head my doctor only has privileges here i asked about going someplace else right off but im afraid im stuck shes pretty sure im still bleeding internally so we dont have the benefit of a lot of time laurie detached her forearm from jack and gripped his i know what you are thinking but im okay with being here and more so now that youve come although theoretically im at risk of being a victim of my series i dont think its that high the odds are in my favor especially with najah away from the scene jack nodded he knew she was right statistically but it was hardly consolation particularly with the case against najah so circumstantial the fact was he didnt like laurie being there period yet he resigned himself to there being little choice she could exsanguinate during a transfer im okay really laurie added i like my doctor ive great confidence in her and i asked her what was going to happen to me tonight she said that after the surgery id go to the pacu what the devil is the pacu postanesthesia care unit what happened to the recovery room laurie smiled and shrugged i dont know now its called the pacu anyway she told me that id probably stay in the pacu all night and if i were to leave she wants me in an acutecare unit because of how much blood ive lost none of the cases in my series happened in intensive care only on hospital floors i feel safe until tomorrow when im sure we can arrange for a transfer my father can get me over to the university hospital and even if my doctor cant follow me over there my old gyn would fill in im certain jack nodded he still wasnt happy but he could see her point besides in terms of emergency surgery the manhattan general was right up there with the best are you as comfortable as i am laurie asked i guess so he admitted good laurie said and remember all this is in addition to the fact that the prime suspect is safely in custody im not willing to rely on that jack said nor am i if it were the only thing laurie said but it adds to my peace of mind good jack responded and your peace of mind is the most important for me i like the idea youll be in the pacu thats real security the case against najah is pure supposition without a doubt laurie agreed which leads me to a suggestion theres no reason for you to hang around here doing nothing while im up in surgery why dont you go back to the ocme and take a look at the material on my desk particularly rogers lists you could even bring them back here ive written down some of my ideas but it would be good to get your take especially if najah turns out to be a dead end pardon the pun sorry jack asserted forcibly i aint leaving here while youre in surgery no way okay dont get huffy it was just a suggestion thanks but no thanks jack reiterated there was a pause in the conversation jack glanced up at the lcd screen he was mildly concerned that lauries blood pressure was low and her pulse was high but he was pleased to see that they were staying steady jack laurie said gripping his arm tighter im sorry i was so irritable this afternoon it was wrong of me not to let you talk i apologize apology accepted jack said directing his eyes back down at laurie and im sorry i was so damn sensitive youve had plenty of reasons to be distraught the problem is ive been pretty upset myself of course thats hardly an excuse okay laurie a cheerful voice said laura riley bounded into the room along with an orderly the operating room is ready and all we need is you laurie introduced laura to jack and was careful to mention that jack was a fellow medical examiner laura was gracious but cut the conversation short saying she really wanted to get things under way there had already been a little delay waiting for one of the operating rooms to free up would it be okay if i observe jack asked no i dont think that is a good idea laura said without hesitation but since its the evening shift i can probably take you up to the surgical lounge and you can wait there thats bending the rules a bit but you are a physician then as soon as weve gotten laurie taken care of i can give you an update that is of course if its all okay with laurie its okay with me laurie said ill take you up on the surgical lounge offer jack said but first maybe it would be a good idea if i gave blood laurie and i are the same blood type and if she needs another unit id like to be the donor thats very generous laura said chances are well use it turning to laurie she said now lets get you up to the or and get you fixed up she nodded to the orderly who unlocked the wheels of the gurney and began angling it toward the hallway excuse me an accented voice called out in a peremptory tone jazz stopped and turned around it was the owner of the sundry store on columbus avenue that she frequented he had also tapped her on the arm at the same time he had spoken you forgot to pay the man said pointing to her canvas bag which was slung over her shoulder a wry smile appeared on jazzs face she estimated that this anemiclooking guy weighed less than ninety pounds when he was wet yet here he was accosting her in the middle of the sidewalk on columbus avenue it was amazing the nerve some people had de spite having no way to back up their behavior of course he could be packing but jazz seriously doubted it he had on a snug white apron tied around his middle precluding access to any pockets you took milk bread and eggs but no pay the man elaborated he then bunched his lips into a tight ball and thrust out his chin from jazzs perspective there was no doubt he was pissed and he acted as if he was ready to fight which didnt make sense unless he was gazillionlevel black belt in some exotic martial art she was bigger than he invariably in better shape and had her right hand holding her glock in her coat pocket you come back to the stored the man ordered jazz instinctively glanced around no one seemed to be paying them any attention yet that would undoubtedly change if she created a scene still she was tempted she looked back at her heckler but before she could speak her blackberry in her left coat pocket beeped and vibrated in her hand she usually left it on when she was out walking around one second jazz said to the store proprietor as she pulled her blackberry out in the open a larger more genuine smile took over her face as she noticed it was a message from mr bob after getting three names in the last two days she wasnt expecting another but why else would he be contacting her at the time of day when she got names she quickly opened the message all right jazz exclaimed there on her screen was the name laurie montgomery taking her right hand out of her pocket she gave the storekeeper a thumbsup sign she couldnt have been more pleased another five thousand dollars was coming her way meaning that in three nights shed earned a whopping twenty thousand dollars my wife will call the police if you dont come back and pay the man insisted with the windfall addition of five thousand dollars to her net worth jazz experienced a flush of uncharacteristic magnanimity and largesse you know now that you mention it i think i did walk out without paying why dont we wander back and settle up the airplanes wheels thudded against the runway and the fuselage shook from the impact the noise and vibration yanked david rosenkrantz from the depths of sleep momentarily disoriented it took him a moment to get his bearings turning his head to the side he looked out the rainstreaked window he had landed at laguardia airport the terminals lights barely visible through the misty air a good night for ducks a voice said they said it was going to start raining again around ten and for once they were right david turned to the man sitting next to him he was a prim latemiddleaged fellow with rimless glasses dressed like david in a shirt and tie robert insisted david wear business clothes he explained it lent an aura of legitimacy to their operation david liked it because he felt he blended in better with all the flying he had to do he looked like just another businessman davids fellow passenger was leaning forward to see out of davids window are you coming home or are you on business here in new york the man asked throughout the entire flight hed not uttered a word hed had his nose in his laptop the whole time business david said without elaborating he didnt like talking too much with his fellow travelers conversations inevitably worked their way around to what kind of business david was in in the past if forced david had said he was in healthcare consulting that had worked until the day he found himself chatting with a fellow passenger who was legitimately in the field the remainder of the conversation had been rather dicey and david had been saved by the opportunity to deplane im in business too the prim man said computer software by the way where are you staying if youre staying in manhattan maybe we could share a taxi when it rains in new york theyre like hens teeth thats very generous david said but ive yet to make arrangements this trip was put together at the last minute i can recommend the marriott the man persisted they almost always have availability on the weekend and its a good central location david smiled as best he could ill keep that in mind but im not going directly into town i have to make a stop here in queens he planned to take a taxi to long island city where hed have the cab wait while he picked up the arranged gun remember this hellcat is usually packing robert had advised so dont give her much breathing room in fact dont give her any breathing room at all the whole problem is that she has no compunction whatsoever about using her piece david had nodded at this unsolicited advice but he didnt need to be told any such thing he was a professional and had been doing this for years he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a piece of paper the address was vernon avenue long island city he wondered what kind of place it would turn out to be he also wondered if getting the gun would go smoothly on a recent trip to chicago the gun source had been picked up the day before on unrelated charges throwing off the whole operation and forcing david to stay in the windy city for five days he hoped the same snafu wouldnt happen in new york since he was anxious to be on his way back to st louis in twentyfour hours or so david looked at the other addresses he had written down on the paper they were jasmine rakoczis apartment and her health club both on the upper west side where is that marriott david asked the prim man who was busy packing his laptop into its carrying case times square the man said is that on the west side it sure is right near the theater district he thought hed keep the marriott in mind his general plan was to get the gun and then find a hotel he was exhausted from having spent a number of long nights out on the west coast and he was looking forward to a good long sleep then hed figure out the best way to deal with the rakoczi woman the nicest part of the whole affair was remembering what she looked like robert had even said she had one of the best bodies hed ever seen and robert definitely had good taste david fully planned to see for himself which meant her apartment would be the best bet twentyone with a backhanded motion jack tossed the cosmopolitan magazine back onto the surgical lounges coffee table he was desperate for something to read but that particular magazine wasnt going to do it for him hed been through just about everything else including old copies of time people national geographic and newsweek plus saturdays papers hed even tried to watch cnn for a while but he couldnt concentrate on the tv especially after the two cups of coffee hed drunk it was a quarter to twelve and laurie was still in surgery which made him progressively antsy jack had gone up to the third floor with laurie dr riley and the orderly he had given lauries hand a final reassuring squeeze before she and the others disappeared into the or with the hope that laura might reconsider his watching the procedure hed gone into the mens locker room and changed into scrubs using an empty locker with no lock for his clothes but laura was steadfast in her insistence that he remain in the surgical lounge saying that shed be in as soon as the procedure was over jack tried to entertain himself to keep from obsessing about what was taking so long while he waited the hospital shift had changed with an entirely new group manning the or and rotating in and out of the lounge no one bothered jack which he appreciated he was in no mood for socializing just before midnight dr riley finally appeared at the lounges arched entranceway when she spotted jack she walked over jack stood up she appeared exhausted but to his relief she was smiling im sorry to keep you in suspense laura said it took a little longer than we expected but everything is okay thank goodness jack said what was the problem continued bleeding shed lost a lot of blood and her clotting wasnt what we would have liked shes now in the pacu where i want her to stay so they can follow her clotting status and blood pressure sounds like a good plan i see you changed into scrubs i was hoping youd relent and allow me to observe sorry laura said i know from laurie that your association with her isnt just professional with births im happy to have actual participation of partners but with operations like this im not you dont have to apologize jack said shes okay and thats all that matters actually its good youre in scrubs i got approval for you to come in and have a quick visit provided youre okay with the idea id love to come in jack said but tell me was it an ectopic pregnancy yes laura said in the isthmus of the oviduct fairly close to the uterine wall which might be why there was so much bleeding the oviduct itself was visibly abnormal and we ended up removing it along with the right ovary on the positive side the left oviduct and ovary appear entirely normal so her fertility shouldnt be significantly affected shell be pleased to hear that jack said now that he knew laurie was on the road to recovery he allowed himself to think about the lost conceptus surprised at his emotion he was saddened even though hed anticipated being relieved that the pressure was off as laurie had suggested although mourning on any level wasnt pleasant in this situation he felt there was a positive side since it lent further credence that he might be more capable of having a child than he would have thought only a few days earlier with a wave for him to follow laura led him into the main portion of the operating room several women were at the main or desk bent over paperwork on the opposite wall was a large dryerase board scribed like graph paper on the left were the numbers of all the operating rooms across the top forming columns were spaces for patient name anesthesiologist surgeon circulating nurse scrub nurse and procedure jack could see that there were eight cases under way he saw lauries name with a line drawn through it the pacu was located just beyond the desk it was a large starkly white room with sixteen beds eight on a side each backed up into an array of anesthesia equipment including banks of monitors for blood pressure and pulse an ekg lead and blood oxygenation only four of the sixteen beds were occupied all the patients appeared to be sleeping despite the bright ambient light and the sense of frenetic activity each patient had his or her own nurse who constantly checked everything from vital signs to urine output from respiratory status to core body temperature writing the results on a clipboard attached to the bed in between these activities they were adjusting iv rates checking surgical drains or running into a supply closet for iv fluids or medications a nononsenseappearing female charge nurse with frizzed blond hair and a stocky bulldog habitus manned a centralized main desk she exuded a drill sergeants sense of control laura introduced jack her name was thea papparis i hope you understand you can only stay a few minutes thea said her voice was as commanding as her physical presence i appreciate you letting me come in at all jack said showing uncharacteristic respect for the rules under more normal circumstances he viewed bureaucratic edicts as mere guidelines but with lauries potential care possibly dependent on his behavior he was being particularly circumspect as evidenced by his restraint in not having run down to lauries or when her case had dragged on you got a fine wife there doctor thea said shes a charmer even under the influence of the anesthesia for a second her attention switched to a monitor built in over the desk one of the patients had had an extra heartbeat with a compensatory pause jack used the opportunity to glance at laura who flashed him an exaggerated expression of guilt meaning shed fibbed about marital status to get jack invited into the pacu thea redirected her attention back to the visitors what was i saying oh yeah your wife is one amiable individual most of the people we see in here are just out of it although some can be uncooperative and even belligerent not your wife shes just as nice as pie thank you jack said i appreciate the attention youve given her thats our job thea said laura motioned for jack to follow her and they walked over to the bed farthest against the wall a male nurse with an impressive tattoo of a mermaid on his left upper arm was adjusting lauries iv she was also getting another unit of blood hows she doing pete laura asked she glanced briefly at the clipboard before walking up along the right side of the bed smooth as silk pete said blood pressure and pulse hanging in there just fine shes putting out urine and nothing has come out of the drain good laura said she grasped lauries forearm gave it a little shake and called her name lauries eyes popped open but only about halfway her forehead was wrinkled as if she was struggling keep them open she looked at laura then over at jack whod come up along the left side she smiled placidly and reached out and laid a limp hand in jacks do you remember me telling you that your operation is over laura asked not really laurie admitted without taking her eyes off jack well it is laura said youre doing fine the bleeding has been stopped id tell you to relax but you are already doing that laurie turned her head slowly toward laura thank you for all you have done and im sorry about your saturday night dont you worry laura said its been a blast am i in the pacu at the moment yes you are and im going to stay here overnight thats affirmative ive asked for them to keep you here and monitor you until i come in and make my rounds the intensive care unit happens to be full but this is just as good and maybe better i hope you dont mind it might be hard to sleep with all the activity i dont mind in the slightest laurie said giving jacks hand a squeeze now laura added im going to leave you two and laurie ill see you in the morning at seven im sure everything will be fine and we can move you to a room on the obgyn floor provided they have a bed i know they are overbooked tonight but well worry about that tomorrow okay okay laurie responded with a final wave laura walked away laurie turned back toward jack what time is it around midnight jack said my gosh where did the evening go time really does fly when youre having fun jack smiled its good to hear you havent lost your sense of humor how do you feel great i know that sounds ridiculous but ive got no discomfort whatsoever the worst thing is a dry mouth whatever they gave me has me on cloud nine and now that its over i can admit i was pretty darn scared i was foolish to let the problem get out of hand i dont think you should be blaming yourself i do my not reacting to incriminating symptoms is a prime example of one of my notsowonderful character traits namely putting out of my mind anything potentially unpleasant physically or emotionally im more of my mothers daughter than id ever cared to admit youre starting to scare me with this kind of insight under the influence of anesthesia jack joked what did they give you some kind of truth serum dont answer lets talk about something a bit more topical did they tell you had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy im sure they did but my shortterm memory is not up to speed as soon as i heard you were all right i felt a curious emotion now thats a weird thing to say laurie said with a slight smile on her lips what were you disappointed i was going to pull through that didnt come out right what i meant to say was that when i didnt have to worry about you i felt sad that we had lost a child laurie didnt say anything for a moment and her smile faded she stared at jack with a look of disbelief hello jack called are you still with me in slow motion laurie lifted her free hand to her face and used a finger to wipe away a tear she shook her head as if she still couldnt believe what jack had said if i heard correctly under the circumstances that might have been the dearest thing youve ever said to me youre going to make me cry dont cry jack said nervously as he noticed lauries pulse rate quicken on the lcd screen behind her bed he certainly didnt want to be disturbing her in her fragile state lets talk about something less emotional provided we have time he glanced first at pete who pretended he wasnt listening and then back at thea at the central desk to make sure she hadnt caught lauries reaction luckily the charge nurse was momentarily preoccupied with another problem with a sense of reprieve jack redirected his attention to laurie im not going to be able to stay in here very long and i might not be able to come back normally i wouldnt be so restrained but they have you as a hostage im afraid if i step out of line theyll take it out on you in some way i know its a ridiculous idea but it seems to me this place is run by the gestapo what did you do with yourself for three hours laurie asked i had a ball jack said i he tried to think of something witty but nothing came to mind embarrassed he gave a short laugh i cant believe it my sense of humor has abandoned me youre bored and exhausted why dont you go home and get some sleep sleep jack questioned thats out of the question i had several cups of coffee in the surgical lounge im not going to sleep until about tuesday you cant just sit here in the hospital laurie said if you really think you cant sleep why dont you do what i suggested earlier and go back to my office if you have to be awake you might as well make use of the time you know i might just do that jack said it crossed his mind that he could bring all that material back to the surgical lounge after all the night shift was in the hospital it might help to pass the time if he tried to talk to a couple of the people on rogers lists although when he thought about it again he had to admit that rogers fate took away some of his enthusiasm for the idea sorry to interrupt here thea said she had appeared at the foot of the bed you people are going to have to wind things up weve got a couple of cases coming in imminently just a moment longer jack said to thea who nodded and retreated back to her command post listen jack said to laurie bending over to be close to her ear before i go i want to be absolutely sure you feel comfortable here be honest otherwise ill just park myself right outside the door and refuse to budge perfectly comfortable you should get some sleep im telling you im not going to sleep im charged up ready to do a triathlon okay calm down then go back to my office so you can at least keep yourself busy bring everything back here youre sure youre comfortable im very sure okay jack said giving lauries forehead a kiss before straightening up you can get some sleep for both of us ill be back and try to come in here in a few hours if that brunnhilde lets me he hooked a thumb over his shoulder ill be fine laurie said dont worry with a final squeeze of lauries hand jack walked back to the central desk while thea was on the phone standing behind her desk chair jack wrote down his name and cell phone number thanks again for letting me come in here jack said when she hung up and looked at him dont mention it thea said she went up on her tiptoes looking at something over jacks shoulder and shouted you got it claire thats the line i was talking about i dont think its running right she looked back at jack sorry dont worry about your wife well take good care of her ive written down my cell phone number jack said he handed the paper to thea if there is any change in her status in any way or form id appreciate hearing about it well do our best thea said she glanced at the paper then tossed it onto the desk in front of her she flashed jack a brief smile and a quick wave then turned to one of the nurses whod approached with a question with a final look in lauries direction jack walked out of the pacu he crossed through the surgical lounge the faces had changed but the scene hadnt inside the mens locker room he quickly changed out of the scrubs and put on his clothes the main lobby of the hospital was eerily quiet and a far cry from its daytime bustle as he exited through the front door he was pleased to see that a few taxis were patiently waiting in the taxi line the rain that had been forecasted had started the cab dropped jack off at the morgues loading dock and he walked in past the security office carl novak the night security officer bounded out of his chair as if caught unawares causing the paperback book he was reading to fall to the floor he leaned out his door and called after jack is something up that i should know about dr stapleton nope jack called over his shoulder the night mortuary tech mike passano had a similar reaction when he heard jacks voice echo about the tiled morgue and jack passed the mortuary office while jack waited for the elevator mikes head appeared is a case coming in that well be posting he asked nope jack said i just love this place so much i cant stay away the fifth floor was barely illuminated such that the orange office doors appeared a muddy graybrown once inside lauries office jack flipped on the overhead light and squinted in its relative glare he sat down in lauries chair and surveyed all the series material on her desk there were two neat piles of hospital charts next to them were rogers lists and a ruled notepad on the pad was a list of the ways laurie had determined that the cases were related on the wall above the desk were two postit notes one a reminder to show sobczyks ekg segment to a cardiologist and the other questioning what kind of lab test an masnp was looking down on the desk was another postit wrinkled enough to make it hard to read jack spread out the wrinkles on it was written in lauries handwriting positive mefa followed by a large question mark jack had no idea what mefa stood for what jack didnt see was the cd that he remembered laurie making in rogers office and he briefly looked under the charts and under rogers lists he even opened lauries desk drawers which were extraordinarily neat in sharp contrast to his there was no cd he scratched his head where would she have put it then he glanced at his watch it was almost onethirty in the morning after taking a deep breath jack tried to organize his thoughts his heart was racing from the coffee and his mind was going a mile a minute it was hard to concentrate on anything he didnt like being away from the manhattan general hospital with laurie in such a vulnerable state yet it truly would have driven him crazy to sit in the surgical lounge hour after hour staring at the clock as laurie had suggested he had it in his mind to take all the material on her desk back to the surgical lounge but before he did that he had another idea he thought he could take the time to possibly get answers to the three postit questions with several hospitals literally next door it would be a quick errand and might have some significance getting to his feet jack shuffled through the charts until he found sobczyks the ekg segment was easy to find since laurie had it marked with a ruler he looked at it again and again admitted that it made no sense to him in fact it was his opinion that no one would be able to make any sense of it it was essentially the serendipitous recording of cardiac conduction cells in the throes of cellular death carefully he extracted the page with the recording from the rest of the chart taking it and the other two postit notes he stepped out of lauries office leaving the light on and walked back to the elevator when he pressed the button the door immediately opened that never happened in the daytime it was as if he was the only person in the building as he rode down to the basement level he mapped out his strategy despite his mind jumping all over creation he thought hed run over to the nyu bellevue medical center pop in to the er and have the oncall cardiology resident paged jack couldnt imagine that that would take too long as the resident might very well be in the emergency unit already then jack thought hed head to the laboratory and see if he could find the night supervisor if anybody could tell him what kind of test an masnp was and what a positive mefa meant it would be a hospital laboratory supervisor vaguely he wondered if the two unknowns were related it was still sprinkling outside so jack literally ran up first avenue with the page from sobsczyks chart protected under his coat the emergency room looked pretty much the same as manhattan generals had looked when jack had gone in to see laurie the crowds generally didnt thin out until after three in the morning jack went to the main desk and caught the attention of one of the nurses who looked like he could have been a bouncer in a club his name was salvador and he had on what looked like a dozen gold chain necklaces nestled on a remarkably hairy chest im dr stapleton jack said do you happen to know who the oncall cardiology resident is i dont but ill find out he said before bellowing the question to a colleague within the treatment area which the main desk opened onto on its opposite side he put his hand behind his ear to catch the response the other individual was out of jacks line of sight dr shirley mayrand the nurse said redirecting his attention to jack do you know if dr mayrand is in the emergency room at the moment the nurse shrugged his shoulders no idea how can i page her i can do it for you salvador said he picked up the phone and dialed the page operator should i page her for the emergency room jack nodded ill wait right here he turned around and gazed at the scene if nothing else it was visually entertaining spread out in front of him and filling the vinyl waitingroom chairs was an egalitarian slice of new york city life in both its glory and banality from crying infants to the tottering aged from homeless bums to folks in fancy clothes from the drunks to the mentally anguished from the injured to the sick they were all there waiting to be seen hold your horses thea shouted at her jangling phone she was trying to fill out a supply requisition form giving up she picked up the phone it was the night shift or supervisor helen garvey whats your bed count helen demanded without mincing words occupied or empty thea questioned now thats one of the dumber questions ive heard tonight youre in a bad mood i have a right to be according to the er were about to be inundated with trauma cases and the first wave is on its way up there was a headon collision with a bus and a van and the bus went over a guardrail as i understand it they distributed the victims but we got the lions share ive contacted all the oncall people so we can be running up to twenty ors its going to be a long night ive got thirteen patients with only three empty beds thats not encouraging what are the patients statuses thea let her eyes roam around her domain while she mentally reviewed each case everybody is in good shape except for an abdominal aneurysm rebleed hes got to stay because he might have to be opened up yet again hes still losing blood out of his drain so the others are stable at the moment then clean house because youre next for this tidal wave thea hung up the phone she was psyched challenges like this were her forte listen up she called out to her troops were switching to disaster mode and this is no drill the release of the wheels jolted laurie from her drugged slumber to a semiwakefulness her eyes squinted against the bright overhead fluorescent lights and for a moment she was disoriented to time and place there was another jolt when the bed began to move and the jostling brought a brief but sharp reminder that she had had intraabdominal surgery all at once laurie knew where she was and the large clock over the pacu rooms door which she was approaching told her the time it was twentyfive minutes past two turning her head to the side in response to a babble of voices laurie caught a glimpse of the flurry of activity at the central desk bending her head back so she could see behind her she looked up at the face of the orderly pushing her he was a railthin lightskinned africanamerican with a pencilline mustache and graying hair the muscles of his neck stood out as he strained to angle lauries bed toward the swinging doors whats happening laurie questioned the orderly didnt answer focusing instead on stopping the beds forward motion before backing it up a few steps the pacus doors had burst open another bed was coming into the room with a patient fresh from surgery there was a person at the foot of the bed pulling and another at the head pushing an anesthesiologist walked alongside maintaining the patients airway patent by holding the individuals chin back all three seemed to be talking at the same time laurie repeated her question to the orderly behind her she felt the stirrings of apprehension in the pit of her stomach something was up her understanding was that she was not be moved until laura riley came in to see her in the morning youre going to your room the orderly said preoccupied with maneuvering lauries bed to allow the incoming patient to get by i was supposed to stay here in the pacu laurie said with building alarm here we go the orderly said as if hed not heard laurie he grunted as he managed to get the bed rolling forward again wait laurie yelled the effort of her outcry made her wince with pain from her incision shocked by lauries outburst the orderly halted the bed yet again he looked down at her with concern whats the matter im not supposed to be leaving here laurie stated she had to talk loudly to be heard over the general level of conversation in the room to keep the pain to a minimum she had to press her hand gently over the upper part of her abdomen to avoid jostling the lower part earlier when jack had visited shed had very little discomfort from the operation unfortunately that had changed i got strict orders to take you to your room the orderly said his expression was half defiant half confused he took a piece of paper out of his pocket and glanced at it youre laurie montgomery arent you ignoring the orderlys question laurie lifted her head off her pillow and looked over at the central desk which was a beehive of activity ahead the doors to the hall burst open again and another patient fresh from surgery was whisked into the room once again the orderly had to back lauries bed up to allow them to pass i want to talk to the charge nurse laurie demanded with obvious indecision the orderly looked back and forth between laurie and the central desk he shook his head with frustration youre not taking me anywhere laurie stated im supposed to stay here i need to talk with a supervisor anyone in control shrugging his shoulders in resignation the orderly walked over to the counter leaving laurie and her bed stranded in the middle of the room he was holding in his hand the piece of paper hed taken from his pocket laurie watched as he tried vainly to get someones attention when he did the person pointed out a squarebuilt woman with a helmet of blond hair laurie watched as the orderly showed thea his paper then pointed in lauries direction thea bounced her palm off her forehead as if dealing with this new problem was the last thing she needed she rounded the edge of the central desk and walked directly up to laurie the orderly a few steps behind whats your problem thea demanded she had her hands on her hips i was supposed to stay in the pacu until dr riley saw me laurie said as she struggled to think what to say coupled with having been just awakened by such an urgent situation the lingering effects of the drugs and anesthesia were causing her mind to work in slow motion let me reassure you that you are doing just fine youre as stable as the rock of gibraltar you dont need the pacu and unfortunately we have a slew of patients who do wed love to entertain you all night but we have work to do so until next time be well with a final reassuring squeeze of lauries forearm she turned back to the central desk immediately barking orders about another patient to one of the other nurses excuse me laurie called after her vainly can you call my doctor or can you let me make a call thea didnt even turn around she was already immersed in the next problem the orderly returned to his position behind lauries head and once again got her bed rolling he aimed it at the pacu double doors and the bed collided with them and pushed them open out in the hall he struggled to orient the bed parallel with the corridor before getting it to move forward laurie noticed several gurneys parked against the wall with patients waiting to be taken down to operating rooms i need to make a phone call laurie said as they passed the surgical desk youre going to have to wait until you get in your room the orderly said he aimed the bed at the doors leading from the operating room a sense of desperation gripped laurie as they reached the bank of elevators she was being rudely removed from her promised sanctuary and thrust out in harms way and she was powerless to prevent it suffering the double whammy of weakness from blood loss and pain with the slightest movement made it hard for her to imagine herself any more vulnerable and remembering her list of how the patients in her series had been related she knew she fit the profile she was the right age she was healthy she was on an iv shed had surgery and she was a relatively new subscriber to americare her only consolation was in statistics and the fact that najah had been arrested where am i going laurie asked trying to find a ray of hope to obgyn the orderly consulted his piece of paper no theyre full in obgyn youre going to room on the general surgical floor laurie closed her eyes as she felt a shudder pass through her twentytwo dr stapleton hey dr stapleton hearing his voice over the buzz of conversation and the sound of crying infants jack looked back at the emergencyroom desk with all the caffeine on board hed been pacing back and forth from the desk to the front doors intermittently staring outside at the rain falling on the cement of the wheelchair ramp as the time had passed he had begun to think of switching to plan b which was to give up on the postit quest run back to the ocme grab the material in lauries desk and beat it back to the manhattan general it was twothirty in the morning and hed already been away for an hour and a half jack could see salvador waving for jack to come back to the desk next to him was a girl who looked as if she were fifteen she had straight shoulderlength light brown hair parted in the middle and swept back on either side behind conveniently large ears her eyes were huge and separated by a narrow upturned nose this is dr shirley mayrand salvador said motioning toward the cardiology resident as jack quickly returned to the counter jack was momentarily mesmerized by the womans youthfulness for the first time in his life he felt old although he was pushing fifty playing basketball with kids half his age made him forget how old he really was as the cardiology resident on call this woman in front of him had to have been through college medical school and a significant number of years as a resident what can i do for you shirley asked to jack even her voice sounded prepubescent after jack introduced himself he fumbled with the page from sobczyks chart placed it on the countertop and folded out the electrocardiograph tracing ill leave you two salvador said and walked away i know this is not much jack said pointing to the strip of ekg but i was wondering if you could comment on it its awfully short shirley complained while bending over the tracing yeah well its all we have jack said he noticed that the part in shirleys hair meandered around as it made its way from her forehead over the crown of her head what lead is it good question i have no idea it was a strip taken at the outset of an unsuccessful cardiac resuscitation probably one of the standard leads shirley remarked maybe so jack said the resident looked up jack realized one of the reasons her eyes appeared so big was that he could see the whites all the way around her corneas it gave her the look of continuous innocent surprise i dont know what i can say shirley said youd really have to show me more for me to be able to comment with any confidence i assumed as much jack said but this tracing is from a patient who unfortunately is already dead which you know since i said it was taken at an unsuccessful resuscitation attempt my point is its not going to be to the patients detriment if you take a wild guess say if you were forced to come up with some opinion anything shirley looked back at the tracing well as you certainly have already noticed it does suggest a widening of both the pr interval and the qrs complex while the qtrs seems to have been fused with the t wave jack gritted his teeth somehow it seemed unfair that this petite youthful woman made him feel both old and stupid maybe jack suggested it would be best if you could limit your comments to something that i can understand i mean you could tell me your impression without telling me how you came to it well it does suggest something to me shirley said looking up at jack but i have an idea okay what is it dr henry wo one of my attendings happens to be here in the er at the moment hed been called in to do an angiogram on a suspected acute myocardial infarction why dont we show it to him jack was pleased the possibility of getting an attendings opinion in the wee hours of the morning hadnt even occurred to him come on around into the er proper shirley said while leaning over the counter to point out the route jack would have to take ill meet you and take you back to the cath room where he is working the elevator doors opened and with a grunt the orderly got lauries bed to roll out into the lobby on the sixth floor since there was a slight discrepancy between the level of the floor of the elevator and the lobby floor there was a jolt and laurie grimaced from the pain it caused it was apparent that whatever shed been given for pain had all but worn off although laurie felt just as panicky as she had when shed first left the pacu shed at least reconciled herself to the reality that there was little she could do until she got to use a phone shed asked the orderly where her belongings were with the idea of getting a hold of her cell phone unfortunately hed said he had no idea the orderly pushed her down the short corridor from the elevator lobby toward the nurses station which loomed like a beacon of bright light in the dimmed and mostly sleeping hospital the recessed nightlights with frosted glass were spaced at intervals along the walls about two feet off the floor after getting the bed up to the speed of a brisk walk the orderly had to struggle to get it to stop abreast of the nurses station once he did he engaged the foot brake before leaving laurie and approaching the counter over the nurses station desk laurie could see the tops of two female headsone with cropped hair the other with a ponytail both women looked up when the orderly plopped lauries metalcovered hospital chart on the countertop got a patient for you people the orderly said laurie saw the woman with the cropped hair take the chart and read the name emblazoned on the front she immediately stood up well well miss montgomery i must say we have been wondering where you were the two nurses came around from behind the desk while the orderly walked back toward the elevators laurie watched as the women approached her bed each going to a separate side both were dressed in hospital scrubs the one with the cropped hair had dark skin almondshaped eyes and a narrow aquiline nose the others complexion was paler with broader features that gave a hint of an asian mix since both faces were illuminated from below by the nightlights only the bony prominences were clearly visible the rest of their faces was lost in relative shadow to laurie who was already anxious they looked decidedly creepy i need to use a phone laurie said looking from one to the other unsure if one was more senior than the other jazz ill take her down to the room and get her settled the asianappearing woman said ignoring lauries comment thats good of you elizabeth jazz said but i think ill take care of miss montgomery personally really elizabeth questioned she was obviously surprised hello laurie said with some annoyance i need to use a phone suit yourself elizabeth said to her colleague and walked back toward the nurses station jazz tossed lauries chart onto the foot of lauries bed and went behind to start pushing excuse me laurie said rolling her head back to keep jazz in view it is very important for me to use the phone she grimaced as the beds brake was released and again when the bed lurched forward down the long dark hall i heard you the first time jazz said her voice reflected the strain of pushing the bed i think i should remind you its twothirty in the morning i know what time it is laurie snapped i have to call my doctor im not supposed to be here i was supposed to stay in the pacu until she came in to do her rounds in the morning i hate to break this news to you jazz said but your doctor like all the other doctors is fast asleep she doesnt want to be disturbed about some logistics problem stop this bed at once laurie commanded im not going to this room oh jazz questioned but she didnt so much as hesitate she continued pushing lauries bed at a speed significantly quicker than the orderly she was eager to get laurie to her room earlier that evening when jazz had first come into the hospital she had trouble locating laurie at first she thought perhaps mr bob had made a mistake about the name of the hospital but it turned out the problem was only a delay in lauries name being entered into the hospital computer system jazz had figured that out when shed checked the er log while getting the potassium ampoule i demand that you stop laurie cried when jazz ignored her laurie was forced to press her hand against her upper abdomen to control the pain yelling jarred her incision i can see you are going to be a difficult patient jazz said with a short laugh actually she felt the opposite laurie was going to be one of her easier sanctions thanks to obgyn being full having laurie on her floor while she was acting charge nurse made everything a snap at room jazz rapidly rotated laurie a hundred and eighty degrees to push her bed into the room headfirst as they crossed the threshold jazz flipped on the rooms overhead light making both women squint jazz maneuvered laurie over next to the regular hospital bed which was significantly wider than the gurneylike bed that laurie currently occupied laurie glared at the nurse whose attitude she couldnt fathom she blanched when she caught sight of the womans nametag jasmine rakoczi despite the drugs still in her system laurie remembered it instantly as one of the names on rogers list of people who had transferred from the night shift at st francis to the night shift of the manhattan general whats the matter jazz questioned as she lowered the guardrail on the appropriate side she couldnt help but notice lauries startled reaction something amiss without waiting for an answer jazz pushed laurie alongside the hospital bed she grabbed the top edge of lauries blanket and whipped it off with a flick of her wrist catching laurie by surprise and exposing her to the world she was clad only in a hospital johnny with her bare knees lower legs and feet sticking out a bulge over the right lower part of her abdomen covered the dressing applied to her incision and a surgical drain snaked out from under the edge of the gown and entered a plastic device that maintained a negative pressure a streaking of blood was evident within the tubing okay jazz said dispassionately scoot over there and well get you nice and comfortable she then went to the head of the bed and transferred lauries iv bottle to the pole on the hospital bed laurie didnt move the panic shed felt from being taken from the pacu had ratcheted up a notch after seeing jazzs nametag she was paralyzed with fear for all she knew jazz could be the serial killer come on sister jazz said she stepped back around to lauries side and looked down at her lets move your butt over onto the bed laurie stared back with the most defiant look she could manage it was all she could think of doing if you want to be uncooperative ill have to get elizabeth down here and well move you one way or the other this isnt a negotiation i want to speak to the charge nurse laurie blurted well isnt that convenient jazz laughed youre already talking to her i am the charge nurse at least the acting charge nurse which is the same thing lauries sense of desperation went up yet another notch she felt progressively snared in a treacherous web of terrifying circumstance now why dont you want to move jazz questioned with obvious frustration she extended her hand over laurie to point out the rooms amenities check out that comfortable bed with all its controls you can crank yourself into just about every position you can imagine and then some youve got a tv a pitcher for water with no water since youre still npo a call button for us slaves all the comforts of home what else can you ask for lauries eyes involuntarily took in what jazz described and did a double take sitting on the nightstand was a telephone she questioned why she had not thought about it until that second the orderly had even mentioned it it would be her lifeline gritting her teeth laurie rose up on her elbows and began moving her backside over toward the hospital bed then she repositioned her legs and repeated the maneuver inching herself across the divide very good jazz said i see youve decided to be cooperative im pleased for both of us as soon as laurie was in the hospital bed jazz moved across the suction device for lauries drain she pulled up the cover that had been positioned across the foot of the bed and let it settle across lauries chest she then took lauries blood pressure and pulse as she did this laurie watched her intently jazz avoided eye contact okay jazz said finally making eye contact as she lifted up the guardrail with a jolt everything seems in order other than your pulse is a little on the high side ill mosey on back to the desk and go over your orders im sure you have something ordered for pain on an asneeded basis are you in need or are you fine at the moment laurie was amazed at the lack of normal human warmth in jazzs voice and actions ostensibly there wasnt anything specific that laurie could complain about other than her requests being ignored yet there was a worrisome detachment that seemed incredibly out of place and as such it added to her already considerable unease there was something definitely strange about jasmine rakoczi cat got your tongue jazz questioned with a wry smile she spread her hands waistheight thats okay with me you dont have to talk if you dont want to frankly it makes my job that much easier if you dont but if you change your mind youve got your call button of course when you get around to pressing it i might be involved with someone a bit more communicative with a final smile that laurie interpreted as brazenly indifferent jazz walked out of the room being careful not to move too quickly laurie reached out over the beds side rail and lifted the phone the effort required her to tighten her abdominal muscles which caused significant discomfort gritting her teeth in the face of the pain she managed to move the phone from the night table to the bed she put it next to her and then struggled to remember jacks cell phone number in the face of her anxiety and the drugs shed had it took her a moment but then it reassuringly popped into her mind she then snatched up the phone receiver and put it to her ear lauries heart skipped a beat there was no dial tone frantically she pressed the disconnect button hoping for the familiar sound there was nothing the phone was dead just as frantically she grabbed the nurses call button and pressed it not once but several times in a row although getting an attendings opinion on sobczyks short segment of ekg tracing seemed like a great idea jack hadnt factored in the attendings availability when jack and shirley got back to the cath room jack found out that dr henry wo was in the middle of his catheterization jack was forced to resort to additional caffeinedriven pacing in the corridor punctuated by frequent glances at his watch shirley stood by stoically if she was aware of jacks restless agitation she didnt mention it it wasnt until almost three am that henry came out of the room snapped off his latex gloves and removed his mask he was a rotund asian man with flawless skin and dark closely cropped hair he snapped up jacks hand and pumped it enthusiastically as shirley introduced them shirley mentioned the quandary about the short ekg segment and jack handed over the page from sobczyks chart with the tracing attached i see i see henry said nodding his head and smiling as he glanced at the egk strip very interesting is this all we have im afraid so jack said he recounted the brief story as he knew it concerning the failed resuscitation attempt he added why he thought that even a guess on their part might be helpful its dangerous to say too much with so little henry said while again studying the tracing he then looked up at shirley dr mayrand perhaps you could tell us what you were thinking shirley reiterated what she had said to jack about the various waves intervals and complexes while henry continued to nod when shirley had finished henry asked her if she had any idea of what might have accounted for such alterations the conduction system seems to be failing shirley said perhaps that means the sodium pumps within the cells of the bundle of his are not functioning or perhaps overwhelmed resulting in a deleterious alteration in membrane potentials jack again gritted his teeth he had a sudden urge to throw a tantrum shirleys short monologue painfully reminded him of the academic gibberish hed endured in medical school in the grip of coffeeenhanced anxiety jack had little tolerance for such didactic mumbo jumbo and was about to make his impatience known when henry took the words out of his mouth i think dr stapleton is interested in some particular agent that might account for what we are seeing on this short strip of ekg am i correct dr stapleton jack nodded enthusiastically well shirley said visibly uncomfortable in being put on the spot im sure there are a number of drugs that could create this type of picture including toxic amounts of most of the arrhythmia drugs but i think it could have possibly been caused by a sudden electrolyte imbalance particularly potassium or calcium but thats about all one could say well said henry complimented he handed the page from sobczyks chart with the ekg tracing back to jack jack took the paper from henry mulling over what shirley had said she hadnt added anything new but the words sudden electrolyte imbalance gave him an idea the reason he and others had dismissed the possible role of potassium was because the lab had reported that the victims potassium levels had all been normal now that jack thought about it what the lab was saying specifically was that the postmortem potassium levels were normal as everyone knew potassium levels soar after death because the bodys vast potassium store is intracellular and is maintained by an active transport system after death the transport system stops and the potassium immediately leaks out any sudden increase in potassium in an individual by an injected bolus prior to death would be effectively masked jack had to admit that if someone wanted to kill off patients it would be an insidiously clever way to do it if you happen to find any additional ekg recordings let us know henry was saying perhaps we could be more definitive with more leads just let us know one other thing jack said catching sight of lauries two postits attached to the back of the page do either of you know what this laboratory test is he pulled off the postit with masnp written on it and handed it to henry henry glanced at it shook his head and looked at shirley shirley shook her head as well no idea henry said he handed the piece of yellow paper back to jack but i know someone who probably would david hancock the night lab supervisor the labs conveniently right down the hall henry pointed to a door no more than twenty feet away i know hes here tonight because he helped me earlier jack took back the postit and reattached it to the page next to the other one with the lab so close he thought it would be worth taking the time to duck in and see if david hancock was available i dont know what kind of test an masnp is but i do know what mefa is henry said catching sight of the second slightly wrinkled postit oh jack questioned he wasnt even sure where laurie had come up with the acronym thats a gene henry said it produces a protein that controls the cascade of events that assures the health of the coronary arteries inner lining interesting jack said vaguely wondering how it could be associated with lauries series or if it was associated at all what would a positive mefa mean now thats a bit misleading henry admitted when they write positive mefa in the literature what they really mean is positive for the marker for the mutated form of mefa in that case it is someone who produces a defective protein and as a consequence will have a high probability of experiencing coronary artery disease such as my patient tonight hes positive for the mefa marker and here he is having had an acute myocardial infarction even though weve tried to avoid it by keeping his ldl cholesterol as low as possible well im sure this will all be helpful jack said although in reality he had no idea when he got back to the manhattan general and got to see laurie hed have to ask her about where shed found the acronym and then if appropriate tell her what hed learned jack thanked both henry and shirley and quickly headed down toward the laboratory door hoping david hancock would be conveniently available as he entered the lab he glanced at his watch and his level of anxiety inched upward it was twentytwo after three laurie pressed the nurses call button several more times she had lost count of how many times she had pressed it since jazz had left and the fact that no one responded made her feel even more vulnerable it occurred to her that rakoczi was being purposefully passiveaggressive as she had suggested she might be when shed left laurie looked down at her hand holding the call button she was shaking to add to her anxiety lauries pain from her surgery had gotten worse particularly after moving herself from the gurney to the bed and then lifting the telephone earlier she felt it only when she moved but now it was constant there was no doubt that she needed some analgesia but she was reluctant to ask for it because of the inevitable hypnotic effects under the circumstances laurie didnt want to be any more obtunded than she was already she had to keep her wits if she was to have any chance of protecting herself until jack got there just when laurie had decided to see what it would be like for her to get out of bed and stand up someone came sweeping into the room it wasnt jazz or elizabeth it was another woman even more swarthy than jazz with long straight black hair held back with a clip she carried a large tray by its handle the tray was divided into numerous cubbies filled with blood tubes syringes and the like laurie montgomery the woman questioned while glancing at a requisition form yes laurie said i need to draw some blood for some clotting studies the woman put her tray on the foot of lauries bed took out the proper colorcoded stoppered tubes and came alongside laurie dangling a tourniquet i need a telephone laurie said as the woman picked up lauries arm and began searching for veins and patting those she saw to check if theyd be appropriate for venipuncture the one here by my bedside doesnt have a dial tone i cant help you with your telephone the woman said in a high singsong voice im just a laboratory tech she found a vein that she thought was promising and applied the tourniquet laurie was about to explain at least a part of her dilemma when she caught sight of the womans laboratory nametag it said kathleen chaudhry like rakoczi it was a rather unique name also like rakoczi it was a name on rogers list of people who had transferred from st francis during the suspect period and like rakoczi laurie thought she too could be the serial killer laurie yanked her arm away from kathleen such that the lab tech took a shocked step back kathleen quickly regained her equilibrium calm down she said im just going to draw a little blood i dont want my blood drawn laurie stated she was adamant and her voice reflected it she felt paranoid but for good reason it was as if she was being tormented surrounded by potential serial killers your doctor has ordered these tests kathleen said it is for your own good it will just take a second youll barely feel it i promise im not having any blood drawn laurie said unequivocally im sorry theres no use in trying to talk me into it okay have it your way kathleen said throwing up her hands fine with me ill just have to let the nurses know you do that laurie said and while youre at it tell one of the nurses to come back down here immediately after making it a point to express her frustration by literally tossing the blood tubes haphazardly into her tray kathleen walked out of the room once again the heavy silence of the sleeping hospital closed in around laurie she was now beginning to question her sanity had those names really been on rogers lists or was her overwrought mind making it all up laurie wasnt sure but she knew one thing without a shred of doubt she wanted jack to come in and get her the hell out of there steeling herself against the pain which was made worse with any movement of her abdominal muscles laurie began to inch herself down toward the foot of the bed she wanted to get beyond the side rails and try standing shed only gotten halfway when jazz breezed in hold on there girl jazz said where do you think youre going laurie stared at her with uncamouflaged scorn i need to find some nurses who will respond to the call button let me tell you something dearie jazz said you are not the only patient on the floor and you are hardly the sickest we have to prioritize which im sure youd understand if you stopped to think for one lousy minute what is it you want pain meds i want a telephone laurie said the one on the night table has no dial tone getting your phone functioning is the mission of the daystaff communications department this is the nursing night shift we dont have time for that kind of stuff where are my belongings laurie demanded everything could be solved if she could get her hands on her cell phone surgery must still have them i want them down here this minute you do have a lot of demands jazz ridiculed i have to give you that but listen sweetheart surgery happens to be very busy tonight which means were going to be busy they will get to your crap when they have the time now if youll excuse me ive got patients to see wait laurie cried before jazz ducked out the door when jazz turned back to her she added i want this iv out sorry jazz said with a shake of her head she came back into the room and coming alongside laurie she hooked a hand under lauries armpit without warning she pulled laurie back to where she had been in the bed laurie winced with the pain she was also impressed with jazzs strength you were in shock when you came into the emergency room jazz continued you need that iv in case you relapse you need fluid and you might need more blood another iv can be put in laurie contended i want this one out if you dont take it out ill pull it out myself jazz stared at laurie for a beat you are a feisty one arent you well you might have some trouble pulling that baby out its a peripheral central line which sounds a bit contradictory but its a long catheter thats been stitched under that little bandage covering the entry point youd be pulling away a sizable hunk of tissue if you were to yank it out i want my doctor called laurie said otherwise im going to take out this iv no matter what get myself out of this bed and walk out of here jazzs wry brazen smile that she had left with earlier reappeared you are too much seriously i read that you practically bled out this evening and now a few hours later youre giving orders ill tell you what ill do ill call the doctor and explain exactly what you just told me how does that sound it would be better if i told her myself maybe but that is problematic since your phone is not yet set up anyway ill make the call explain the situation exactly including your refusal to have blood drawn for a clotting study and then ill be right back how is that its a start laurie conceded as jazz walked out of the room laurie let her head fall back against the pillow her bed was cranked up about thirty degrees her heart was pounding in her temples and the pain in her incision site was worse and she now had the new concern that she might have torn a few stitches yet she felt as if her panic had peaked she took a deep breath and let it out trying to relax a degree she even closed her eyes having jazz get in touch with laura riley wasnt as good as getting jack on the line but as she had said to jazz it was a start twentythree once again events didnt progress as jack would have preferred david hancock was at lunch but due back any minute at first jack thought this news was someones idea of a joke since it was in the middle of the night that was before he remembered that people who worked the night shift lived in a completely opposite world timewise and for them their middleoftheshift meal was lunch no matter what the clock said jack paced the room until david hancock appeared he was a slight man of indeterminate genealogy as if in compensation for the scant hair on the top of his head he wore a scraggly graying goatee and mustache giving him a decidedly devilish look he listened to jacks request without comment before taking the postit while he looked at it he noisily sucked his teeth are you sure this is a laboratory test david asked raising his eyes to jack jacks optimism about getting an answer took a nosedive reasonably sure he said as he reached out to retrieve the note david moved the postit from jacks reach as he continued to stare at it what made you think it was a laboratory test it was part of the preoperative orders on a number of patients jack said while looking over his shoulder at the door it wasnt a preoperative order in this hospital david said no jack agreed nervously shifting his weight trying to make up his mind if he should just turn around and leave it was at the manhattan general and at the saint francis out in queens pshaw david voiced disparagingly two americare institutions caught off guard by the lab supervisors comment jack leaned forward to get a better look at the mans expression do i detect a value judgment in your voice youd better believe it david said ive got a sister in staten island who works for the city and shes had some medical problems americare has given her the runaround its all a business with those people and taking care of patients is the last thing on their mind ive had my differences with them as well jack admitted maybe someday we could share war stories but right now im interested in learning what kind of test an masnp is well i have to admit i dont know what it is with a hundred percent surety david began but my guess would be it is a medical genomics test jack was taken aback a half hour earlier shirley mayrand had made him feel old now he was afraid david was about to do the same thing in terms of knowledge jack was acquainted with the science of medical genomics but his knowledge was limited to identity markers used in forensics he knew the relatively new field spurred by the decipherment of the entire human genome was racing ahead at an exponential rate my guess would be that the ma stands for microarray which is a highthroughput technology generally used for gene expression is it now jack questioned innocently he was already over his head and was embarrassed to admit it although what david was saying was now relating to what henry had said about the positive mefa on the other postit note youve got a funny expression doctor i mean you do know what a microarray is dont you well not exactly jack admitted then let me explain microarrays are a grid or checkerboard of minute spots of a mixture of varying but known dna sequences usually affixed to the surface of a microscope slide and were talking about a lot of spots i mean thousands such that they can give information on the expression of thousands of genes at any given moment really jack said and then wished he hadnt he knew he was sounding stupid but i doubt the test you are questioning about is a test for gene expression no jack voiced meekly no i dont think so my guess is that the snp stands for single nucleotide polymorphism which im sure you know is a point mutation in the human genome also as you know thousands of snps have now been mapped so exactly throughout the human genome that they can be linked to specific mutated genes that are passed from generation to generation those snps that are so linked are called markers theyre markers for the bad mutated gene it was as if the proverbial lightbulb lit up in jacks mind he hadnt followed everything david was saying but it didnt matter with trembling fingers he hastened to get out the page from sobczyks chart when he did he pulled off the other wrinkled postit he showed it to david could this possibly be a result of an masnp david took the second postit and scratched his head positive mefa he read out loud does that ring a bell hmmm he looked away and tapped his baldpate with a knuckle then he looked back at the postit yes i remember mefa if im not mistaken its a gene somehow associated with coronary arteries i dont know exactly how it is related but i recall that if someone gets the mutated form of the gene then the individual has a high probability of getting coronary artery disease so to answer your question positive mefa could be the result of an masnp test meaning the test determined the individual had the specific snp that was a marker for the mutated mefa gene jack suddenly reached out and grabbed davids hand and gave it a rapid sincere shake lets get together some time and thanks i believe you might have solved a mystery what kind of mystery david asked but jack was already running for the door having come into the lab through the emergency department jack used the same route on his way out he guessed that there was another exit that might have been more convenient but he didnt want to take the time to inquire the postit quest as he called it had turned out to be more successful than hed imagined he now thought he had both a possible motive and a possible although unprovable method for the deaths that laurie had been so clairvoyantly documenting all that he needed was to find out where laurie had come up with the positive mefa to see if there were other markers with other patients jack burst through the double doors that separated the emergency department from its waiting room and partially collided with a man in a wheelchair who was being brought in for treatment the man was wheezing and his wheezing got worse with the fright of the near collision apologizing jack wished the man well and ran across the waiting room and out into the night the rain had picked up but he didnt care if what he was thinking was correct americare was even more shockingly amoral and venal than he had imagined and he was even gladder that laurie was being held in the pacu and not allowed out on the hospital floors reaching first avenue jack turned south he squinted as he ran into the rain and he could feel rivulets running down his face he had a definite idea of where laurie had come across the positive mefa he just had to find it as the clincher he thought hed give himself fifteen minutes in lauries office if he was unsuccessful after fifteen minutes hed put it off until a later time and beat a retreat over to the manhattan general even if brunnhilde wouldnt let him back into the pacu hed be content to park himself outside the door laurie woke up with a start the fact that she had fallen asleep in the face of her anxiety scared her as much as the commotion that had awakened her it was jazz and elizabeth both of whom had breezed into the room talking about another patient jazz came over to lauries right while elizabeth rounded the foot of the bed and ended up on lauries left with effort laurie straightened herself upright while sleeping she had sagged over to the point that her shoulder was resting against the beds guardrail she glared at both women in turn she had a constant lowgrade pain in her abdomen and her mouth was bonedry up in the pacu she had been given ice chips whereas in her current room shed been given nothing my gosh jazz said with surprise looking down at laurie if wed known youd fallen asleep we could have saved ourselves some trouble did you talk with my doctor laurie demanded lets say i talked with one of them jazz answered her brash smile reappeared as if she was enjoying teasing laurie what do you mean one of my doctors laurie questioned i talked with dr jos√© cabreo jazz said he happens to be available whereas your dr riley is undoubtedly sleeping laurie felt her pulse quicken she also remembered dr jos√© cabreos name from rogers lists in fact she had read the mans credentialing record and had learned about his malpractice and addiction problems there was no way she wanted anything to do with the anesthesiologist he was very upset to hear you were acting up jazz continued he reminded me under no uncertain terms that the clotting study ordered for you must be done he was also very disturbed about your threats to yank out your iv and climb out of your bed drain and all i dont care what dr cabreo thinks laurie snapped you said you were going to call my doctor i want to talk with dr laura riley correction jazz said holding up her index finger i said i would call the doctor not your doctor i should remind you that the anesthesia department still feels that they have responsibility for you to a large degree you are technically in a postanesthesia state i want my doctor laurie growled through clenched teeth shes a pistol isnt she jazz said to elizabeth elizabeth smiled and nodded jazz looked back down at laurie and said since its almost four am you should be getting your wish in just a few more hours meanwhile we intend to strictly follow dr cabreos orders that he has been nice enough to communicate to us for your own protection jazz nodded to elizabeth laurie started to reiterate her feelings about dr cabreo but before she could complete a sentence jazz and elizabeth simultaneously lunged for her forearms pinning them to the bed shocked by this sudden unexpected assault laurie struggled to free herself but a combination of her pain and the nurses strength made it impossible the next thing she knew her wrists were secured in velcro restraints which were in turn affixed to the undercarriage of the bed it had all happened so quickly laurie was dumbfounded there mission accomplished jazz said to elizabeth as she straightened up we can now relax with the confidence the iv will stay put and this uncooperative patient will not go wandering off this is an outrage laurie sputtered she yanked ineffectually against the restraints which only made the guardrail rattle the restraints held firmly dr cabreo doesnt think so jazz said with a smile the stress of surgery does disorient some people and they need to be protected from themselves at the same time he was concerned you might be a little upset so he ordered a nice strong quickacting sedative from her pocket she produced a syringe that was already prepared for an injection she took off the needle cap with her teeth and held the syringe up to the light tapping it gently with the nail of her right index finger i dont want any sedative laurie shrieked she tried again to free her hands thats just the kind of response the sedative is to prevent jazz said elizabeth would you mind holding miss montgomery while i do the honors with a smile not too dissimilar from jazzs elizabeth grasped lauries shoulders and leaned her considerable weight over her laurie tried to squirm but it was to no avail she felt the cold alcohol pledget swipe across the skin of her upper arm followed by a pinch and a short sharp pain jazz straightened up replacing the cap on the used needle sleep tight jazz said she waved to elizabeth and the two women walked out of the room a helpless moan escaped from lauries lips as she settled back onto the pillow earlier with her pain and the effects of the drugs shed been given she had believed it would have been impossible for her to feel more helpless than she already had but she was wrong she was now literally tied to the bed like a potential sacrificial victim she had no idea what kind of injection shed been given for all she knew it was a poison and the struggle was already over if it was a sedative as jazz had claimed then soon she was destined to be that much more vulnerable although jack was in superb aerobic shape from both basketball and biking he was out of breath when he skidded to a stop in front of the elevators in the ocme hed heard carl novak yell out his name as jack ran past the security office but jack didnt slow down no one was in the mortuary office jack struck the elevator button repeatedly as if doing so would speed up its arrival as he waited he tried to think of what laurie could have possibly done with the cd shed burned in rogers office it had to have been on the cd that laurie had come across the mefa reference the elevator arrived and jack jumped on the cd hadnt been with the charts or the lists and he hadnt seen it in her desk drawers the only place he hadnt looked was the fourdrawer file cabinet he glanced at his watch it was five minutes past four hed now been gone from the manhattan general a little more than three hours which he felt was the upper limit of what he was comfortable with as he had decided he was going to hold himself to fifteen minutes for the cd search the elevator bumped to a stop and it seemed to take an inordinately long time for the door to open impatiently jack hammered at it with the base of his fist in its own time it slid open and jack took off down the darkened hallway like a cartoon character he almost missed the door into lauries office because of how quickly he was running he had to grab the jamb to keep from sliding past on the heavily waxed floor once inside lauries office he started with the top drawer of the file cabinet after five minutes of vain searching jack slid the bottom drawer closed and stood up he scratched his head puzzling over where on earth she would have put the damn cd he glanced at rivas desk but dismissed it as a possibility there would be no reason for her to store it there a better possibility was that he had missed it when hed gone through lauries desk so he sat down and searched all her drawers again this time he was particularly thorough believing the cd had to be in there somewhere jack sat up again after closing the last drawer damn he voiced out loud he looked at his watch he had less than five minutes of his allotted time left as he looked back up at the desk surface with the idea of going through the stack of charts to see if the cd had inadvertently gotten into one his eyes noticed the tiny yellow light on the frame of lauries computer monitor although the screen was dark the light suggested that the computer was booted but the monitor had powered itself down with his right index finger jack hit one of the keys on the keyboard instantly the screen illuminated and jack found himself looking at a page of stephen lewiss record listing the results of all his laboratory tests the print was small and jack had to fumble with the reading glasses hed secretly gotten with the glasses on he was able to read the print and his eye went down the column on the lefthand side of the page eventually he came to masnp and running his finger along horizontally he found positive mefa with a shake of his head at his stupidity of not looking for the cd in lauries cd drive jack took hold of lauries mouse and spent the next several minutes scrolling through the digital record of various patients in lauries series what he found didnt surprise him with every case that he looked at from both the manhattan general and st francis he found that the masnp test was positive for a marker for any one of a number of deleterious gene mutations some he recognized but others he did not when he got to darlene morgans chart he got a particularly chilling wakeup call her masnp was positive for the brca gene for a split second jack stared frozen at the screen up until that very minute hed thought of lauries risk as a potential target for whoever was killing these patients as relatively low since statistics were on her side suddenly that was no longer the case whoever was doing the killing was seemingly targeting people with inherited deleterious genes and he remembered that laurie like darlene morgan had brca as if propelled by a rocket jack leaped up dashed out of lauries office and rushed headlong back down the corridor to the elevator luckily the car was still there when he pressed the down button as he descended he fumbled for his cell phone in his coat pocket he looked at his watch it was sixteen minutes after four quickly he dialed the manhattan general hospital but he didnt try to put the call through he had no signal the moment the doors opened on the basement level jack ran the length of the hall passing a surprised carl novak for the second time just going in the opposite direction again jack ignored the man he had his cell phone plastered to his ear after having pressed the call button the moment hed emerged from the elevator the hospital operator answered as he thundered down the short run of stairs from the morgues loading dock to the pavement after identifying himself as a doctor and without slowing down jack breathlessly asked to be put through to the pacu what he wanted was reassurance that laurie would not be moved until dr riley made rounds running full tilt jack reached th street and turned west just as he reached first avenue the pacu phone was picked up he recognized the charge nurses authoritative voice and jack pulled himself to a stop it wasnt raining as hard as it had been a quarter hour earlier when hed dashed back to the ocme but it was still raining just the same such that he felt he had to shield his phone with his free hand in front of him relatively infrequent cars raced northward between breaths jack identified himself to thea wait a second thea said then off the line jack could hear her yelling directions about which bed a new patient should be put in then she came back on the line sorry were kind of busy here what can i do for you dr stapleton i dont mean to be a bother jack said while he was talking he was looking for a taxi hed not seen any i wanted to check on laurie montgomerys status he finally saw a cab in the distance with its vacant light illuminated he was about to step off the curb and raise his hand when thea shocked him with her response we dont have a laurie montgomery what do you mean jack questioned with a start shes in the bed against the opposite wall i was in there tonight you even told me she was a charmer oh that laurie montgomery i beg your pardon over the last few hours weve had a revolvingdoor situation with a bunch of trauma victims laurie montgomery left the pacu she was doing just fine and we needed the bed jacks mouth went suddenly dry when did this happen right after i got the disaster call from the or supervisor my guess would be about twofifteen i left you with my cell phone number jack sputtered you were supposed to call me if there was any change in her status there wasnt any change her vitals were rocksolid we wouldnt have let her go if there had been any trouble whatsoever believe me where did she go jack managed desperately trying to control the anger and dismay in his voice to the icu nope she didnt need the icu and it was full anyway so was obgyn she went to room on the surgical floor jack snapped his phone shut and desperately looked out into the mostly empty dark wet avenue the cab hed seen earlier had gone by during his preoccupation with the shocking disastrous conversation with thea papparis the idea that laurie had been out of the pacu in her vulnerable state for two hours while hed been out running around on his stupid errands was almost too horrible for him to contemplate the question what have i been thinking reverberated around inside his mind like clashing cymbals overwhelmed with panic jack began running northward up first avenue mindless of the puddles that appeared like pools of black crude oil he knew it would take him much too long to run all the way to the manhattan general but also knew he couldnt just stand there twentyfour it had been a busy night maybe one of the busiest jazz could remember at her present place of employment theyd been inundated with trauma patients coming up from the pacu and filling all the empty beds as the selfappointed acting charge nurse a status that was soon to change according to rumor with the hiring of a new senior nightshift rn it had fallen to jazz by default to divvy the patients up among the current nightshift nurses and the nurses aides there hadnt been too much complaining since jazz had made it a point to take her share more important shed also made it a point to add laurie montgomery to her patient roster once that had been established and accepted jazz relaxed she knew shed be able to carry out her operation winnow responsibility at her whim jazz stretched her arms over her head and rotated her head a few times to loosen up her neck muscles she was tense shed just finished the last of some paperwork and was looking at some wellearned downtime from patient care which she intended to put to good use even the lunch break had been truncated for everyone because of patient demand forcing jazz to skip eating altogether instead she used the time to disappear into the ladies room outside the cafeteria to load a syringe with the potassium chloride shed pilfered from the er stock and to dispose of the empty ampoule from her perspective the preparation for a sanction had become routine it was fourforty am and all was ready she had been waiting for the right moment and it had arrived elizabeth who had been sitting there with jazz two seconds earlier doing her own paperwork had been called to help a patient in room and had just disappeared from view at the same time all the other nurses and aides were likewise out of sight tending to their assigned patients the dimly lit corridors had that peaceful nighttime tranquility that jazz had come to appreciate she looked up one corridor and down the other it was a perfect opportunity pushing back from the desk jazz stood up her hand went into her right jacket pocket for a reassuring fondle of the full syringe taking a deep breath to control her excitement she set off with quickening steps she silently hastened down to room pausing outside the door she cast yet another glance up and down the long corridor once shed started a mission she preferred not to be seen to avoid any talk after the fact conveniently no one was in sight the only sound was the quiet metronomic beeping of a monitor in a nearby room jazz smiled sanctioning laurie montgomery was possibly going to be the most effortless assignment shed done both because shed been able to pick the time and because the target was sedated and in restraints what could be easier jazz questioned under her breath jazz stepped into the room a half hour earlier when she had found herself passing by on her way back to the nurses station after tending another patient shed ducked in to make certain the sedative had taken effect it had while she was there shed lowered the back of lauries bed so she was horizontal she had also turned off the overhead fluorescent lights now similar to the corridor the room was bathed in a gentle incandescent glow from the recessed nightlights positioned just above the baseboard without a sound jazz moved over to lauries bedside laurie was in a deep druginduced sleep her mouth was slightly open and jazz could see that her lips and tongue were dry and crusted oh poor dear jazz whispered scornfully jazz was enjoying herself of all the patients jazz had so far sanctioned she felt laurie deserved it the most with all her demands and poor attitude for jazz laurie was the quintessentially entitled rich bitch who was the female equivalent of all the mr ivy leagues jazz had to endure and on top of that she was a doctor who was still ordering jazz around while she was a patient from jazzs perspective laurie montgomery with her silverspoon past had it coming to her to be taken down one big ultimate peg jazz eyed the restraints binding lauries wrists and felt a shiver of pleasure there was no doubt that the restraints made the mission easier and she was confident that laurie wouldnt be scratching her arm like that bastard stephen lewis but beyond the practical she thought the restraints had an appeal similar to what she felt when she watched the collection of bondage movies she had downloaded off the web for her it was a control issue gently jazz lifted lauries head and slipped out the pillow she was confident with the sedative shed given her that laurie wouldnt stir and she didnt jazz tucked the pillow under her arm she wanted it handy to slap over lauries face in the eventuality that laurie made any untoward noises like painintheneck sobczyk she didnt expect laurie would the iv was a central line meaning the concentrated potassium would be dumped into a major vein and would be less painful than a superficial one but jazz wanted to be prepared she prided herself in being a quick learner and the fewer the surprises the better reaching up jazz grasped the iv line and opened it so it flowed freely she waited for a few minutes to be sure it was running well when she was certain the iv was functioning perfectly she got out the syringe with the potassium using her teeth to take off the needle cap she inserted the needle deep into the iv port after looking back at the door to the corridor and listening for a moment for any suspicious sounds jazz made the injection with strong sustained pressure it only took five seconds she knew that the more the potassium arrived at the heart in a concentrated bolus the more effective it would be as usual as she injected she saw the fluid level rise in the micropore chamber below the iv fluid bag as soon as the syringe was empty jazz withdrew the needle and replaced the cap she then pulled the pillow from under her arm as laurie stirred moaned and popped open her eyes bon voyage jazz whispered with the pillow in her right hand poised for action and the syringe in her left jazz then bent over laurie because she thought laurie had mumbled something jazz started to ask her to repeat herself when jazz recoiled in shocked surprise at the sound of the door to the room being slammed against its doorstop in the next instant an apparent maniac dashed into the room jazz was momentarily dumbfounded by the sudden whirlwind arrival in the silent and dimly lit environment particularly because she was tense and engrossed in what she was doing and also because she thought shed been so careful to avoid surprises except for taking a reflexive defensive step back jazz was momentarily paralyzed how is she jack barked as he rushed to the foot of lauries bed his breaths were coming in noisy heaves his hair was dripping and plastered to his forehead he appeared like a wild man with an unshaven face red eyes wet clothes and soggy shoes he leaned with both hands on the metal foot of the bed as if exhausted but quickly revived it was apparent he immediately didnt like what he saw his eyes darted to jazz who had not answered him he saw the pillow and the syringe in her hands his attention reverted back to laurie who was softly moaning and fighting weakly and futilely against the wrist restraints whats going on jack demanded he rushed around the side of the bed to lauries right across from jazz laurie jack yelled his hand briefly clutched lauries wrist but then shot up and gripped lauries forehead to keep her from moving her head from side to side what the hell are the restraints for jack cried but he didnt wait for an answer on closer inspection it was apparent laurie was in a worsening desperate state and possibly agonal her face reflected a mixture of terror confusion and pain hit the lights jack yelled call a code jazz still didnt respond other than to take yet another step back stunned by the unexpected events fuck jack screamed at the nurses paralysis his voice reverberated off the sleeping hospitals walls he needed help fast but he didnt want to leave laurie alone even for a few seconds in frantic desperate frustration jack yanked the bed away from the wall its locked wheels made a screeching sound on the composite flooring after pushing the night table to the side causing the collection of objects on its surface to crash to the floor in a clatter jack squeezed himself between the head of the bed and the wall with his foot jack released the wheel locks gritting his teeth and allowing a battlelike yell to escape from his lips he pushed the bed farther from the wall yanking out its power cables in the process with a grunt he angled the rolling bed toward the door it picked up speed and although it hit the door and then the opposite jamb they were glancing collisions and didnt interrupt his forward progress in seconds he was out in the hall and using all his strength he got the bed rolling at a good clip down the hallway toward the bright lights of the nurses station call a code jack shouted at the top of his lungs as he pushed an unfortunate housekeeping cart loomed in the way but jack ignored it the bed with laurie in it had considerably more inertia and the hapless cart was bowled over with a crash spilling its supply of individual hand soaps and other material out onto the floor next came a walker which was nearly crushed by the beds momentum call a code jack yelled again nurses nurses aides and even ambulatory patients began appearing in doorways to see jack streak by jack tried to slow the bed down as he closed in on the nurses station with only partial success the bed caromed off the counter taking with it all the charts that had been left on the top as well as a vase of cut flowers that had yet to be delivered to one of the patients in the bright light jack could see how bad laurie looked she was ghostly pale and unmoving her eyes with dilated pupils blankly stared up at the ceiling stripping off his wet coat and jacket and letting them fall to the floor jack moved to lauries side after quickly determining that she was definitely not breathing and had no pulse he pulled lauries chin back pinched her nose and sealed his mouth over hers he breathed into her several good breaths then vaulted up onto the bed and began closedchest cardiac massage seconds later several nurses were at his side one produced an ambu bag and began respiring laurie carefully pacing herself with jacks compressions she inflated lauries lungs after jack had applied five compressions another nurse wheeled over a bottle of oxygen and connected it to the ambu bag has a code been called jack yelled out yes the nurse said who was breathing for laurie well where the hell are they jack demanded its been less than a minute since theyve been called damn damn damn jack sputtered through clenched teeth he was out of breath from the running the pushing and now the compressions silently he lambasted himself for having left laurie even if it had been her suggestion he should have parked himself outside the pacu as he had threatened from his position looming over her he could tell her color was a tiny bit better prior to starting the cpr so they were making a little progress what are her pupils doing jack asked the nurse who was bagging her not a lot of change jack shook his head in frustration how long does it usually take for the resuscitation team to get here he yelled between compressions if what he had suspected had happened to laurie her life was clearly in the balance until resuscitation team arrived and even then he didnt know what the chances were one thing he was dead certain of cpr alone wasnt going to hack it she had to be treated as if an answer to a prayer an elevator door opened out in the lobby and a cardiac crash cart rattled out accompanying it were four medical residents two women and two men who came running the leader of the pack was caitlin burroughs who looked as if she had been in shirley mayrands medicalschool class for gifted toddlers if jack had seen her on the street he would have thought she was a highschool senior not a senior medical resident the men looked young too but not nearly in shirley or caitlins league one of the residents immediately took over the ambu bag from the nurse two of the others started attaching ekg leads they obviously knew how to work as a team whats the story here caitlin barked checking lauries pupils hyperkalemia jack shot back thats a rather specific diagnosis caitlin exclaimed she spoke in a rapid staccato fashion she might have looked young to jack but she exuded confidence that could only have come from experience how do you know her potassium is too high is she a renal patient no renal disease jack snapped back he wasnt one hundred percent sure laurie was suffering from high potassium but he was a hundred percent sure that if they didnt act immediately and it turned out that she was hyperkalemic as he suspected theyd lose her for certain and shed end up a statistic in her own series it would take too long right this minute for me to tell you how i know but i know jack continued emphatically we have to treat for high serum potassium and we have to do it now this second how come youre so sure and by the way who are you im dr jack stapleton jack blurted im a medical examiner here in the city listen youve had a series of unexpected cardiac deaths in this hospital since january all have been unsuccessful resuscitation attempts on young healthy people just like this patient a red flag has gone up over at the ocme we think its purposeful iatrogenic hyperkalemia weve got almost nothing on ekg one of the residents announced standing by the machine mounted on the crash cart ekg tape was spewing out the side tracing poorly formed complexes caitlin grabbed a quick look whatever she saw pushed her over the edge into jacks camp and she began barking out orders that had the nurses scurrying she wanted calcium gluconate she wanted twenty units of regular insulin along with a fiftygram dose of glucose she wanted sodium bicarbonate she wanted cationexchange resin set up for a retention enema she wanted blood sent for stat electrolytes and most important from jacks perspective she wanted a surgical resident paged to help with emergency peritoneal dialysis in jacks mind it was the dialysis that could potentially save the day while the nurses were busy carrying out the orders and obtaining and drawing up all the medication one of the male residents climbed up on the bed and relieved a reluctant jack but as soon as the man started his compressions jack acknowledged the resident was probably doing a better job as an ophthalmologistturnedmedical examiner jack was out of practice when it came to cpr he was also exhausted but it was hard for him to stand there at the foot of the bed and do nothing while lauries life hung in the balance while concentrating on doing the chest compressions hed been less able to think about the potential tragedy of what he was witnessing jack hadnt run all the way from the ocme to the manhattan general hospital but he had run quite far just the same hed run almost ten blocks up first avenue without seeing an empty taxi a number of cars had passed him and sprayed him with water but none had stopped then his luck changed near the un headquarters a police patrol car had pulled over in front of him apparently thinking he was fleeing from a crime when jack flashed his medical examiner badge and breathlessly said he was on an emergency run to the manhattan general the police had told him to jump in they took him nonstop with their siren blaring if it had crossed their minds why a medical examiner who deals with dead bodies had an emergency in the middle of the night requiring him to sprint up first avenue they hadnt let on as lauries hyperkalemic treatment began to bring down the high potassium that jack feared was coursing around in her blood an anesthesiologist showed up he proceeded to deftly intubate laurie so she could be respired with more certainty when he straightened up after finishing the procedure jack caught his name it was jos√© cabreo and jack did a double take he remembered the mans name from rogers lists jack found himself watching jos√©s every move and was relieved when the anesthesiologist quickly left the peritoneal dialysis was started percutaneously without a hitch using a large bore trocar jack averted his eyes as the trocar was punched through lauries abdominal wall but he was close enough to hear the popping sound it made as it went through the fascia and he winced a moment later he watched as isotonic fluid free of potassium was then run into her abdomen jack secretly crossed his fingers and prayed that the procedure would help he was aware that with the extensive surface area within the abdomen as a result of the loops of intestine combined with the rich plexus of blood vessels peritoneal dialysis was the most efficient even if passive way to lower potassium or any other elevated electrolyte in the blood unfortunately after ten minutes of the aggressive therapy there was disappointingly little change in lauries status caitlin ordered more calcium gluconate and injected it herself jack heard this from afar as hed begun pacing between lauries bed in front of the nurses station and the elevator lobby it wasnt the caffeine that was propelling him now it was his mounting fear and guilt his nagging concern was that this episode might be another instance of his being a jinx to those he loved the thought haunted him mercilessly in one night he already had lost a potential child now he was on the verge of losing the person he loved to make matters worse he knew he was at least partially to blame when the stat woodwork came back caitlin brought it over to jack well you were absolutely right she said while pointing to the highlighted abnormally high potassium level thats about as high as ive ever seen it after this is all over id like to hear how you knew ill be happy to tell you jack said provided miss montgomery pulls through if laurie didnt make it he didnt know if hed be willing to talk to anybody were doing our best caitlin said at least her color is good and her pupils have definitely come down as the minutes inexorably passed jack kept his distance as a bystander it was progressively upsetting to him to see laurie splayed out on the bed with a stranger pounding on her chest and another dispassionately squeezing the breathing bag the ambulatory patients who had earlier come to their respective doors to watch the unfolding drama had gone back to their beds most of the floor nurses had also been called away by the needs of their own patients it was twenty minutes to six when the first truly optimistic sign occurred and it was caitlin who noticed it hey gang she shouted were getting some electrical activity in the heart the medical resident who was not currently doing either the closed chest massage or the breathingbag compression rushed over to the ekg machine to look over caitlins shoulder send off another stat potassium level caitlin yelled to the nurse who was assisting them wow those complexes are starting to look quite normal the resident said to caitlin who nodded in agreement and they are getting better hold up on the compressions caitlin called out to the resident who was kneeling on the bed over laurie see if shes got a pulse the resident who had been breathing for laurie also stopped long enough to feel along lauries neck for a pulse shes got a pulse and my gosh shes breathing on her own he took the mask away from the end of the endotracheal tube with his palm he could feel the amount of air she was breathing in and out shes breathing pretty darn normally and shes bucking the endotracheal tube deflate it and pull it out caitlin ordered her ekg now looks completely normal the resident quickly followed orders and slipped the tube out of lauries mouth but still held her chin back to make sure her airway stayed open laurie coughed several times hearing these exchanges jack rushed back from where he was pacing in the darkened elevator lobby and went behind the nurses station desk laurie had been connected to one of the monitors built in over the desk but to see it one had to be on the opposite side of the counter from where the action was a half hour earlier when hed looked at it the blips for the blood pressure and pulse had been tracing straight lines across the screen it was different now and his heart leaped in his chest laurie had both a pulse and blood pressure hold up on the peritoneal dialysis caitlin ordered and drain out the cation exchange resin we dont want to overshoot and then have to worry about too low a potassium level jack rounded the nurses station counter there was once again a flurry around laurie as caitlins latest orders were carried out jack didnt want to get in the way but as hopeful as these developments were he wanted to be close to her hallelujah said the resident who had been most recently breathing for laurie shes waking up unable to hold himself back jack crowded in at the head of lauries bed that had been backed up against the nurses station countertop he looked down and saw what he thought was a miracle lauries eyes were open and they were moving from one face poised over her to another and reflected not a little confusion and fear unexpectedly jack burst into tears such that it was hard for him to see all he could do was shake his head when he tried to talk release her wrists ordered caitlin who had pushed in across from jack the restraints had been left in place during the ordeal caitlin bent over laurie and gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze everything is okay just relax weve got things under control youre going to be all right laurie tried to speak but her voice was barely audible caitlin had to bend down to put her ear next to lauries mouth youre in the manhattan general hospital caitlin said do you know your name and what year it is caitlin listened and then straightened up she looked across at jack who had calmed enough to control his crying and wipe away the tears this is looking very good indeed shes oriented i have to say your rapid diagnosis undoubtedly saved the day with as high as her potassium was when we started she surely wouldnt have been able to be resuscitated jack nodded he still couldnt talk instead he bent down and put his forehead on lauries now that her hands were free laurie reached up and patted the side of his head and whispered in a scratchy voice why are you so upset whats going on lauries questions unleashed another wave of tears all he could do for the moment was squeeze lauries hand a nurse at the nurses station desk stood up behind the counter shed just answered the phone dr burroughs she called the stat potassium on montgomery is four milliequivalents my word caitlin exclaimed thats darn near perfect she turned to her three resident underlings okay heres what we are going to do while i call the attending physician and give her an update you three get the patient down to the cardiac care unit and get her set up on the monitor ill want another potassium level as soon as you get there and ill be there as soon as i finish here so we can decide on her fluids as the preparations were quickly made to move laurie jack found his voice im not upset he whispered in lauries ear im happy youre okay you gave us a scare i did laurie questioned her voice was returning as well but it hurt her to talk you were unconscious for a while jack said what was the last thing you remember i remember leaving the pacu but nothing after that what happened ill explain everything i know at the first opportunity jack promised as the bed started to move are you coming laurie asked holding on to jacks arm youd better believe it jack said as he walked alongside a nurse ran up and handed jack his damp coat and jacket they used a patient elevator to take laurie down to the third floor where the ccu was located at the door to the ccu there was a holdup the charge nurse would not let jack come in although he would be able to visit once she was situated at first jack had balked at the idea he wanted to stay by lauries side considering what had transpired when he hadnt eventually jack relented convinced that laurie would be in good hands the resuscitation residents assured him that one of them would be at the bedside continually ill be right here jack assured laurie pointing out a small waiting room just opposite the ccu door laurie nodded preoccupied with her physical symptoms which had become progressively more bothersome as her mind had cleared what she wanted at the moment was some ice chips for her dry mouth and sore throat as well as something for the pain she felt at her incision site and in her chest as far as her memory was concerned it was still a blank after leaving the pacu jack went into the waiting room which was empty of visitors a clock on the wall indicated it was sixfifteen in the morning there were several couches and a number of chairs a mixture of old magazines littered a coffee table complimentary coffee was available in a corner jack tossed his coat and jacket on the arm of one of the sofas and sat down letting out a heavy groan in the process he leaned back put his hands behind his head and closed his eyes he felt shellshocked hed never had such stress combined with such physical exertion and wide swings of emotion making matters worse were the residual effects of the caffeine which were enough to make him sick the process of closing his eyes made it possible for jack to think about the sheer criminality of what laurie had luckily endured with the immediacy of taking care of her he hadnt thought about it until that moment in his minds eye he could see the tanned nurse in lauries room when hed barged in in the dim light shed appeared almost gaunt with dark short hair deeply set eyes and startling white teeth what he remembered the most was the pillow in one hand and the large syringe in the other he knew there could be many explanations for why she had been holding such things just as there could be an explanation for her apparent paralysis in the face of what was obviously a lifeanddeath emergency jack had seen others freeze like that when he was a resident in fact he had done essentially the same thing on his first cardiac arrest after graduating from medical school yet under the circumstances jack couldnt help but think of her actions as being suspicious hed seen her again during the nervewracking resuscitation but only for brief glimpses when shed appeared at the nurses station to go into the drug room to use the computerized dispenser shed not participated in the resuscitation jack had asked one of the nurses who had helped what the tanned nurses name was when she told him jack was even more suspicious it was another name on rogers lists jacks eyes popped open he fumbled in this coat pocket for his cell phone knowing lou soldanos private home number in soho and despite the hour he quickly put in a call to him after what he had witnessed lou had to get involved there could be no more excuses the phone rang six times before lou picked up his voice was gravelly and jack had to wait through a coughing jag on the detectives part are you going to live jack questioned when lou finally fell silent cut the humor lou growled this better be important its more than important jack said laurie had to have emergency surgery last night at the manhattan general then a couple of hours ago someone put her on the edge of the abyss and gave her a good shove she came as close to dying and not dying as you can get in fact for a few seconds or maybe even minutes she was dead my god lou blurted which initiated another fit of coughing do you cough like this every morning jack asked when lou came back on the line where is she now lou asked ignoring jacks question shes in the cardiac care unit on the third floor jack said im sitting in a visitors room just opposite the door is she in any danger medically or otherwise both medically i think they have things pretty much in hand she lucked out with a particularly sharp cardiology resident who looks like she belongs in middle school shes the second person tonight that has made me feel over the hill as far as the person who tried to kill laurie getting another crack at it i dont think thats a problem not in the cardiac care unitthere are too many people around and im sitting outside the only door do you have any idea who did it theres one person a nurse actually who id be willing to put some money on but its circumstantial ill tell you the details when you get here weve also got rogers lists so your work is cut out for you but the idea of lauries series being hypothetical is no longer tenable she almost became a statistic herself do you know the name of this nurse rakoczi what kind of name is that beats me does this rakoczi know you suspect her i imagine jack said shes steered clear of me during lauries resuscitation she was in lauries room when i got to laurie and found her moribund jack went on to briefly describe the scene as he remembered it well shell be the first person i want to talk to lou said ill be there as soon as possible which will realistically be about a half hour meanwhile ill call the local precinct and have a couple of uniformed officers over there to stand outside the cardiac care unit door in case you have to go to the can or something sounds like a good plan have you been up all night i have jack admitted all right hang in there and ill see you shortly jack was about to hang up when he heard lou add one other thing dont be a hero okay just stay put dont worry jack said after what ive been through already im having trouble breathing in and out im staying right here jack disconnected put his phone away and closed his eyes again he felt a certain relief after having talked with lou soldano the burden of the criminality of what had happened to laurie and the other victims in lauries series was off his shoulders for jack it was a little like passing the baton in a relay race meaning his contribution was over what he didnt know was how much he was going to regret not following his own advice twentyfive excuse me caitlin said after giving jacks shoulder a nudge jack blinked and pulled himself from the depths of sleep he felt like death warmed over but as his vision cleared and he became oriented to time place and person he quickly straightened up he was surprised and frankly aghast that he had fallen asleep whats the matter he sputtered is she okay shes fine caitlin said her repeat potassium was normal and her vital signs have stayed rocksolid shes even had some fluid by mouth which was ordered by dr riley the drain from her incision has also been removed so shes doing very well fantastic jack said as he slid forward to stand up caitlin reached out and gently pushed against his shoulder keeping him sitting on the couch i know you want to visit but i think it might be better to leave her be for now shes exhausted and shes sleeping jack sat back and nodded im sure youre right actually im more concerned about her safety at this point needless to say as im sure you have surmised someone deliberately gave her the potassium i gathered as much caitlin said but rest assured im confident the ccu is safe but to be one hundred percent sure ive asked one of my residents to stay at the bedside continually hell watch everything like a hawk no one without his authorization will get near her perfect jack said i suppose i shouldnt ask about who you think might have done this to her probably the less talk the better until it is resolved jack agreed i know thats difficult in a hospital where gossip spreads like wildfire but it will probably be best for everyone if you and your colleagues dont say anything about what happened for a day or so a homicide detective will be here shortly and i hope he can get to the bottom of things at that moment two uniformed policemen appeared at the doorway one was a beefy africanamerican male whose bulging muscles stretched the limits of the fabric of his uniform his name was kevin fletcher the other was a comparatively slight hispanic woman named toya sanchez both acted selfconscious about being in the hospital they introduced themselves to jack speaking in no more than a whisper they said that their orders were merely to check in with him then they acted as if they didnt know what to do why dont you take a couple of chairs out and sit by the cardiac care unit door jack suggested make sure that everyone going in is legitimately supposed to go in then looking at caitlin he said im assuming that is the only door it is the only door caitlin assured him glad to have some direction the two policemen took jacks advice and were soon sitting on either side of the units double doors jack felt their presence was imposing if nothing else it was the busy ccu itself that provided the safety ive got rounds to do caitlin said so ill leave you here on your vigil thanks for all you did jack said as sincerely as he could you were terrific your tip about potassium was key caitlin said maybe you should think about taking a cardiology residency wed make a good team jack laughed and wondered if the youthful woman was flirting with him then he smiled at his own vanity thinking he was trying to compensate for how old she made him feel he waved as the woman walked out of the waiting room after caitlin left jack settled back in the sofa he wasnt about to fall asleep again since hed gotten a shot of adrenaline when shed awakened him instead he began musing about what it really meant for someone to be killing patients who had positive markers for bad genes it was immediately obvious to him that the explanation for such an unspeakable villainy couldnt simply be a person with an antisocial personality disorder although the person who was actually injecting the potassium surely had to have such an affliction jack knew intuitively that it had to be a more extensive conspiracy with the involvement of some higherups in the americare organization in his mind it was a horrid example of how the practice of medicine could be distorted from having evolved into big business with business interests in the ascendancy he was personally aware that there were people hidden in the topheavy administrations of these huge sprawling managedcare and hospitalmanagement companies similar to americare that were so far removed bureaucratically and often geographically from the professed primary mission of the organization that they could easily be blinded by the needs of the bottom line and ultimately the share price a commotion in the hall interrupted jacks thoughts a group of nurses had arrived and there was a great titter about the presence of the police who were checking ids before letting them into the ccu jack watched them laugh and joke and he wondered if they would be carrying on as they were if they knew what was going on behind the scenes in their hospital even more than the doctors the nurses were in the trenches on a daily basis involved in handtohand combat with disease and disability he was certain they would be outraged if they heard that one of their own was suspected of such treachery such thinking brought jacks mind back to jasmine rakoczi if she was the culprit as he thought was possible then she surely had to be severely antisocial jack couldnt help but think he had to be wrong about her how could someone who is antisocial be a nurse it seemed an oxymoron to him but in the unlikely case she was antisocial how could she have gotten a nursing job at such a prestigious hospital it didnt make any sense especially with the idea that some bean counter buried deep in the fabric of americares organizational structure had to tell her who to pump full of potassium the door to the ccu burst open and another group of both male and female nurses emerged they were equally surprised and curious about the uniformed police the police were polite but noncommittal and within a few minutes the nurses voices trailed off as they disappeared down the hallway jacks eyes wandered up to the wall clock it was a little after seven in the morning all of a sudden it dawned on his tired mind why the group of nurses had come in and another group had gone out it was the shift change the day people were taking over from the night people jack leaped off the sofa it hadnt even occurred to him that jasmine rakoczi would be getting off before lou got there if she was the culprit and if she sensed that jack knew it she might disappear for good several strides took him out into the hall where he quickly told the two police officers that he was going up to the sixth floor he said that if detective lieutenant soldano came in while he was away they should tell him where he had gone and send him up there then jack rushed down to the elevator lobby where it was apparent that the hospital had transformed itself the busy day had begun there were at least a dozen people waiting for an elevator which included a number of orderlies with gurneys on their way to fetch patients for their scheduled surgeries the first up elevator that arrived appeared full when its door opened several people boarded just the same and not to be deterred jack literally pushed on as well he could sense peoples indignation as the door was barely able to close pressed cheek to jowl no one spoke as the car rose to jacks chagrin the ascent was frustratingly slow the elevator stopped on every floor and disgorged passengers more often than not from the rear making jack and a few others step out at each successive elevator lobby by the time the elevator got to the sixth floor jack was having trouble controlling his impatience and when the door opened he was the first one out his plan was to rush to the nurses desk to inquire about jasmine rakoczi he hoped by chance shed been delayed so he could catch her before she left directly opposite from jacks elevator was another whose door was in the process of closing out of the corner of his eye jack thought he caught a glimpse of the nurse with her rather striking features it had been a fleeting image and by the time he had jerked his head around to look again the elevator doors had closed for a second jack debated what to do if he ran down the stairs he had a good chance of beating the elevator but what if he was wrong and it hadnt been rakoczi after several false starts jack impulsively reverted to plan a and ran toward the nurses station there were a number of nurses in sight some of whom he recognized which he thought was encouraging there was also a ward clerk who had just come on duty he was busy straightening up the litter on the desk a lot of which had resulted from lauries resuscitation in a rapidfire manner jack introduced himself as dr stapleton and asked for jasmine rakoczi the ward clerk who was a slightly built blond fellow with a ponytail told him that jazz rakoczi had just left two seconds ago he tried to look around jack to see if he could see her in the elevator lobby do you know where she goes jack demanded quickly guessing that it had indeed been her in the elevator i mean which door she goes out or which direction she walks i need to talk to her its important she doesnt walk home the clerk said shes got a cool black h hummer which she actually showed me once its got a sound system you wouldnt believe its always parked on the second floor of the garage across from the door to the pedestrian bridge what floor do you get off the elevator for the pedestrian bridge jack hurriedly asked the second floor of course the clerk said making a face as if it had been the stupidest question hed ever heard jack took off at a run for the stairs earlier he thought he could have beat rakoczis elevator but now having spent the time going to the nurses station he knew it was out of the question but he didnt regret his decision since he would have missed her anyway he would have run all the way down to the first floor to try to catch her going out the front door as things turned out he felt he still had a chance of catching her she had to walk across the pedestrian bridge and then start her car knowing what kind of car she drove might turn out to be key the stairwell was painted gunmetal gray the stairs themselves were steel and each step sounded like a drum as his shoe thumped against it the repetitive booming reverberated around the enclosed space there were two flights for each floor causing jack to continually turn as he spiraled down clockwise he was dizzy by the time he reached the secondfloor door and he staggered a bit when he entered the hallway as unshaven and disheveled as he appeared coupled with his momentary careening people gave him a wide berth as he hurriedly tried to get directions for the pedestrian bridge finally someone took pity and responded by pointing and jack took off moving as quickly as he could while saying excuse me over and over he pushed his way ahead in the stream of hospital personnel heading toward the parking garage after a pair of doors he could tell he was on the pedestrian bridge as he could suddenly see up and down madison avenue there was another pair of doors on the garage side that led into a small lobby area which was crowded with people waiting for an elevator jack was reduced to squeezing through until he could push open the heavy door out into the garages second level the garage was alive with cars coming and going with their headlights crisscrossing in the exhaustfilled dim light outside the dawn was just bleaching the night sky whereas infrequent fluorescent lights poorly illuminated the interior of the garage knowing the make of jazzs vehicle was indeed key and he was able to pick it out from all the others immediately as the ward clerk had said it was parked directly opposite the door to the connecting pedestrian bridge elevating himself on his tiptoes so he could see over the cars passing between him and the hummer jack saw rakoczi shed just made it across to her car jack could even make out what he guessed was a remote in her hand which she was aiming at the car as she squeezed along its drivers side it was separated by a little more than two feet from the neighboring vehicle miss rakoczi jack yelled over the sound of the car engines he saw her turn and look in his direction hold up a second i need to talk with you for an instant jacks tired mind questioned the rationale for approaching a woman he suspected might be a serial killer yet his desire to keep her from leaving trumped his concerns with all the commotion of people and cars he felt reasonably safe especially since he had no intention of being confrontational in any way or form just firm jack looked left and right gauging his crossing with the comings and goings of the traffic the exhaust as well as noise was unpleasant jack got over to the opposite side jazz was standing by her car with the driversside door ajar the remote was gone and apparently in her pocket she was dressed in an oversized olivedrab coat over her scrubs her right hand was in her pocket her expression was haughty to the point of being challenging slipping between jazzs car and the one right next to it jack walked right up to the nurse whose eyes narrowed the closer he got jack sensed that there wasnt a lot of human warmth in this person youre needed back in the hospital jack said speaking loud enough to be heard over the roar of the traffic he tried to sound authoritative to avoid an argument he even pointed over his shoulder with his thumb there are some people who want to talk with you im off duty jazz sneered im going home jazz turned and put a foot up into her suv with the obvious intention of swinging herself up behind the steering wheel jack caught her right arm just above the elbow and gripped it hard enough to keep her where she was its important you talk with these people jack said he started to say something else about coming with him but he never got it out with totally unexpected swiftness jazz used a karatelike blow to free her arm and practically simultaneously kneed jack in the groin jack doubled over clutching his genitals while an involuntary groan escaped from his lips the next thing he knew the cold barrel of a gun was pressed against the back of his neck stand up asshole jazz scoffed loud enough to be heard and get in the damn car jack raised his head he was squinting with pain and wasnt entirely sure he could walk this guns going to go off if you dont get the hell in there jazz hissed jack moved forward as jazz backed up a step still supporting his genitals with his right hand he used his left to help him get up behind the steering wheel the pain was like nothing else hed ever experienced it made him feel weak as though he were made out of rubber climb over into the passenger seat jazz ordered as she took a quick glimpse around to see if anyone had noticed what had happened with all the confusion and noise in the garage no one paid the slightest heed come on jazz snapped as an added incentive she poked the side of jacks head with the tip of the guns suppressor with the vehicles gear box in the way jack wasnt sure he could physically do what jazz was ordering but he felt as if he had no choice but to try he sagged over the median console into the passenger seat rotated onto his back and with his knees bent brought his feet over he was now in a tight ball more or less on his back jazz quickly climbed in behind the steering wheel and pulled the driversside door shut eliminating most of the garages noise she kept her gun pointed at jacks face just inches from his forehead and what do these people want to talk to me about jazz demanded with obvious derision jack started to answer but jazz cut him off dont bother answering because it doesnt matter what matters is that youve managed to get yourself killed the sound of the gun going off despite its suppressor was loud enough within the confines of the vehicles cab to cause ears to ring jacks eyes which had reflexly blinked closed at the noise popped open in time to see jazzs head sag forward and bump against the steering wheel a rivulet of blood appeared and ran down the nape of her neck to add to his confusion jazzs gun fell onto his chest excuse me a male voice said from the dark depths of the backseat would you mind handing miss rakoczis glock back to me i prefer that you do it by holding on to the suppressor not the butt jack picked up the gun as he was directed and then by wiggling himself backward he was able to partially right himself so that he could raise his head high enough to see over the back of the passenger seat the view was limited because of the heavily tinted windows all jack could see was the mere outline of a figure sitting in the backseat directly behind the drivers seat there was a heavy smell of cordite in the air im waiting for the gun the shadowy man said if you dont do as i say there will be dire consequences i would think you would be eager to help since i obviously saved your life bewildered at these unexpected and shocking developments jack was in no condition to question the mans request and he started to extend the gun through the separation between the two front seats it was at that instance that the driversside door was yanked open and jazzs limp body tumbled out onto the concrete surprised anew jack caught sight of an equally surprised lou in the backseat jack yelled watch out lou disappeared at the same instant the shadowy backseat figure discharged his pistol yet again followed by the noise of shattering glass without thinking jack flipped the gun he was holding around so that his index finger slipped into the trigger guard still crouching behind the back of the passenger seat he raised the gun and aiming blindly in the direction of the shadowy person pulled off three shots in rapid succession to jack the sound of the weapon was a loud hissing thud like a combination of a fist hitting a punching bag and air being let out of a tire the expended shell casings clanked down between the front seats although his ears were ringing silence returned again the smell of cordite permeated the vehicles cab jacks heart was pounding as he huddled against the back of his seat he heard a gurgling sound from the rear seat he was afraid to move and half expected the man in the back to loom up and shoot him like he had shot rakoczi lou jack called he was afraid to move and he was afraid lou might have gotten shot yeah lous voice sounded from someplace outside the car are you all right yeah im fine who fired those last three shots i did i shot blindly who is it you shot at i havent the slightest idea is this the nurse you were talking about on the phone lying next to me on the pavement out here it is jack said he switched positions his back was killing him the way it was pressed up against the passengerside door i thought you promised you werent going to be a hero lou complained did you shoot her too or what i didnt shoot her jack exclaimed it was the guy in the backseat whoever the guy is shot at me lou said i dont like that in addition to the gurgling jack now heard definite wheezing at that moment he caught sight of lous eyes between the open drivers side door and the doorframe he was now squatting next to the driversside front wheel holding his pistol up alongside his head jack managed to get his legs down where they belonged under the dash so that he could move his head and cautiously look into the backseat between the front seats in the dim light and limited view he could see a flaccid hand lying on the backseat with its index finger still within the trigger guard of a pistol at that point jack heard stertorous breathing gaining courage jack raised his head and peered over the top of the front seat he could just make out a man sitting upright but with his head back and arms splayed out to the sides with his head back jack could see that he was wearing a ski mask his breathing was labored i guess i shot him jack said lou stood up walked along the side of the car and stuck his pistol through the back window that had been blown out he was holding his gun in both hands and pointing it at the stricken individual can you hit the lights lou asked jack spun around and briefly searched for the interior lights when he found them he switched them on he looked into the backseat at the man an expanding stain of blood was on the mans chest can you reach his gun lou asked he kept his gun trained on the apparently unconscious stranger jack extended his hand warily toward the gun as if the man would suddenly wake up like in a thriller movie for one more desperate struggle just touch the barrel not the butt lou directed and put it on the front seat jack did as he was told then quickly got out the passengerside door he opened up the back door and leaned in to get a closer look at the man up close it was more apparent how labored the individuals breathing was jack pulled off the ski mask in hopes it would help the man breathe lou opened the door on the mans other side do you recognize him lou asked not at all jack said while jack felt for a pulse lou grabbed the fabric on the front of the mans shirt and with a sudden lateral tear ripped the shirt wide open buttons popped off three entrance wounds were apparent in the mans chest ill say you shot him lou remarked with admiration his pulse is thready and rapid jack said hes not long for this world unless we act fast on the positive side hes already at the hospital you check the nurse lou said ill start getting him out of the car jack ducked back out of the vehicle and ran around to the other side bending down it took him only a second to ascertain that jazz had been shot executionstyle through the back of the head at very close range the bullet had undoubtedly passed through the brainstem she was clearly moribund jack stood back up and stepped over the woman he could see that lou had the injured individual half out of the car whats the situation with the woman lou grunted shes gone lets concentrate on the guy with the back door open against the neighboring vehicle jack had to reverse directions step back over rakoczi and run all the way around the suv to lend a hand with the man lou had his hands under the individuals armpits jack squeezed by and grasped the man around the thighs god he weighs a ton lou complained as they managed to get out from between the parked cars they were immediately caught in the headlights of a car attempting to exit the garage the driver had the nerve to beep the horn only in new york lou complained at the impatient driver through clenched teeth he struggled with the injured man what the hell is this guy anyway a professional football player as they approached the doors to the pedestrian bridge a few of the departing hospital workers stopped to gawk unsure of what they were witnessing at least one had the sense to reverse direction and reach back to hold open the door halfway across the bridge lou staggered i got to stop he said while panting lets switch jack suggested they put the man down on the concrete floor of the bridge quickly changed places and then picked up the man again you certainly picked a good time to show up jack said and grunted apparently i just missed you outside the ccu lou said then i just missed you on the sixth floor it was a good thing the clerk told me to look for a black hummer in the better light it was apparent that the stains on the mans shirt were blood and people were now willing to help by the time they got across the bridge two male nurses had pitched in one was at the head with jack while the other had a leg with lou the er is on the floor below one of the nurses said between breaths should we wait for an elevator or try the stairs the elevator jack answered he was aware the man was no longer breathing but were going up not down he needs a thoracic surgeon and he needs him now the two nurses looked at each other in consternation but didnt say anything rather than put the man down jack backed up against the wall and hit the elevator button with his free hand luckily a car arrived almost immediately unfortunately it was full coming in jack yelled he was not to be deterred and he backed right into people who momentarily had not moved recognizing the degree of the emergency a number of people got off creating the necessary space the door closed the four people holding the injured man looked at one another while the people in the elevator stared at the wounded individual no one said anything as the elevator rose up a floor when the doors opened on the third floor they carried the man out and then pushed through the double doors as they passed the arched opening into the surgical lounge jack cried out that they had a man who had been shot in the chest three times by the time they got to the doors leading into the or itself a number of surgeons who had been waiting for their cases to start were walking alongside several of them were thoracic surgeons and they started to assess the mans condition as evidenced by the position of the entrance wounds although there was some disagreement about the nature of the injuries all thought that the only chance the patient had for survival was to be put on cardiopulmonary bypass immediately as the group came abreast of the or desk several of the nurses were aghast that people had entered their sterile domain in street clothes their indignation was shortlived when they realized that a patient with a mortal wound was being rushed in room is being set up for openheart surgery one of the nurses behind the desk yelled the group hustled down to room where they put the man directly onto the operating table the surgeons wasted no time they cut off the mans clothes an anesthesiologist appeared and yelled that the man was no longer breathing and had no pulse he quickly intubated the patient and started respiring him with one hundred percent oxygen another anesthesiologist started several largebore ivs and began running fluid into the man as fast as possible he also called for blood to be typed and crossmatched stat jack and lou stepped back as the surgeons crowded around one of the thoracic surgeons barked for a scalpel and one was quickly slapped into his waiting palm with no hesitation and without even bothering to glove the surgeon cut through the mans chest with a decisive swipe then using his bare hands he cracked open the ribs only to be faced with an enormous amount of blood at that point lou decided hed wait out in the surgical lounge suction the surgeon yelled jack tried to see as best he could from the head of the table it was a spectacle the likes of which he had never seen none of the surgeons had on gloves masks or gowns and they had blood up to their elbows it had all happened so quickly that no one had had a chance to follow the normal presurgical protocol jack listened intently to the banter which only underlined something that he had already known namely that surgeons were a breed unto themselves despite the unorthodox nature of the event and the gore they were enjoying themselves it was as if the episode served to conveniently validate their enormous curative powers it was quickly determined that the man had suffered what would have been a mortal wound except for the fact that it had happened at a major hospital two of the bullets had gone through the lungs for the surgeons that was a pedestrian problem it was the third bullet that presented the challenge it had among other things pierced the great vessels quickly the damaged vessels were clamped off and the patient was put on the heartlung machine at that point some of the surgeons left to start their own scheduled cases while the two thoracic surgeons stopped long enough to scrub and don the usual operatingroom apparel jack moved over to chat with the anesthesiologist about what she thought the chances were the man would survive but the nursing supervisor tapped him on the shoulder im sorry the supervisor said but were trying to reclaim sterility here youll have to leave and put on scrubs if you want to observe she handed him a pair of booties to cover his street shoes okay jack said agreeably hed been amazed that he hadnt been kicked out earlier as jack walked back down the long operatingroom corridor the events of the long night began to take their toll he was exhausted to the point that his legs and feet felt as if he had weights strapped to them as he passed the operatingroom desk he shivered through a bout of discomfort akin to nausea he found lou sitting in the crowded surgical lounge talking on his cell phone in front of him on the coffee table were a wallet and a drivers license jack sat down heavily in a chair facing lou lou pointed to the drivers license without interrupting his conversation jack leaned forward and picked up the license the name was david rosenkrantz holding the card closer jack studied the laminated picture the individual appeared like an allamerican football player with a thick neck and a broad toothy smile he was a handsome man after flipping his phone shut lou looked over at jack then he leaned forward with his elbows on his knees at the moment i dont want a long explanation how this all happened he said in a tired voice but id just like to know why the last thing you promised me was that you were going to sit outside the ccu i meant to jack said then i realized the shift was changing and i was suddenly worried the rakoczi woman would disappear i just wanted to make sure she hung around until you got here lou rubbed his face briskly with both hands and groaned when he took his hands away his eyes were red he looked almost as bad as jack amateurs i hate them he remarked rhetorically it never dawned on me shed have a gun jack said what about the other two recent gunshotwound deaths over here didnt they at least go through your pea brain no jack admitted i was really worried we wouldnt see her again i thought id just ask her to stay i wasnt going to accuse her of anything bad decision lou said thats the way people like you get killed jack shrugged in retrospect he knew lou was right did you look at the license of the man you shot jack nodded he didnt like to think hed actually shot somebody well who is david rosenkrantz jack shook his head i havent the slightest idea ive never seen him before nor heard his name is he going to live i dont know i was about to ask the anesthesiologists opinion but i was told to leave i think the surgeons are pretty optimistic the way they have been talking if he does make it it proves that if you are going to get shot make sure you get shot in a decent hospital very funny lou said without laughing whats lauries status good very good or at least it was when i left lets walk down and check in with the ccu i didnt expect to be gone this long its just down the hall fine with me lou said getting to his feet the ccu charge nurse came out of the unit and told jack and lou that laurie was doing fine she was sleeping and that her doctor had been in to see her she also said that there were plans afoot to move her to the university hospital where her father was on staff sounds good jack said he looked at lou sounds good to me too lou said after the ccu lou wanted jack to come with him down to the emergency room he wanted jack to identify for the record that the dead woman was the nurse who jack had seen in lauries room he explained that when hed left the or earlier hed called police headquarters about setting up the hummer as a crime scene and bringing the body inside the hospital he was particularly interested in having the glock checked by ballistics as they walked back toward the elevator lou cleared his throat i know youre exhausted and for good reason but im afraid i have to know what happened from the moment you got down to the garage i caught the nurse just as she was about to get into her car jack said she already had the door open so i yelled and ran up to her obviously she wasnt cooperative which is an understatement when i grabbed her arm to keep her from getting in the vehicle she kneed me in the balls ouch lou commiserated that was when she pulled out the gun and ordered me into the car take this as a lesson lou said never get into a car with an armed felon i didnt think i had a lot of choice jack said they reached the elevator lobby where there was a smattering of people waiting they lowered their voices thats when i appeared on the scene lou said i saw you get into the car i could even see the womans gun unfortunately i had to wait for a few cars before i ran over what went on in the car it all happened so fast the guy was obviously already in there apparently waiting for rakoczi just when she was about to shoot me he shot her god jacks voice trailed off as he thought of how close he had come to one last trip over to the ocme you crazy ass lou complained he gave jacks shoulder a light smack and then shook his head you have this weird penchant for getting into the damnedest situations you walked right into the middle of an executionstyle hit are you aware of that i am now jack admitted the elevator arrived and they boarded they moved to the back of the car okay lou said the question is why do you have any ideas i do jack said but let me backtrack first of all laurie was almost killed with a sudden overwhelming dose of potassium which is a clever way to kill someone theres no way to document it thanks to the physiology of potassium in the human body but dont get hung up on that the point is that i think all the patients in lauries series were killed in this shrewd fashion but they werent random targets all of them including laurie had tested positive for the genetic markers of serious medical illnesses the elevator arrived on the first floor and lou and jack got off the hospital was crowded with people and they kept their voices down so how does all this add up to a ganglandstyle hit on the nurse lou questioned i think it is evidence that there is a major conspiracy here jack said i think if you are lucky youre going to learn the nurse was working for someone in some tangled web which will eventually lead back to an actuarial type within the americare administration wait a second lou said pulling jack to a stop are you suggesting that a major healthcare provider like americare might be involved with killing their own patients thats crazy is it jack questioned in any geographical area where these healthcare giants actually compete with each other something they try to avoid by choking off competition or buying out the opposition if they are big enough they compete with the cost of premiums how do they determine their premiums well the oldfashioned actuarial way was to pool risk figure out how much it is going to cost to take care of a group of people by essentially guessing then add on profit divide by the number of people and bingo theres the premium suddenly under everybodys noses the rules have changed with the decipherment of the human genome the old concept of health insurance is bound for the trash heap using single easily performed tests people who are destined to cost them significant money can be recognized the problem is that the large healthcare companies cannot show discrimination so they have to take them at that juncture from a purely business perspective they should be eliminated you mean to tell me that you think some americare administrators are capable of committing murder actually no jack said the actual killing has to be done by severely screwedup individuals which im quite certain youll be learning about miss rakoczi if she is indeed the culprit what im talking about is a horrid variant of whitecollar crime with varying levels of complicity at the top im talking about some person who might have been recruited from the automobile industry or any other business who sits in an office far removed from patients and thinks about the bottom line exclusively unfortunately thats the way business works and why some level of government oversight is necessary as a general rule in a freemarket economy i might sound like a misanthrope but human beings tend to be basically selfinterested and often function as if they are wearing blinders lou shook his head he was disgusted i cant believe youre saying all this hospitals for me have always been the place you go to be taken care of sorry jack said times are changing the deciphering of the human genome has been a monumental event it has briefly dropped off everyones radar but it is coming back bigtime it is going to change everything we know about medicine in the nottoodistant future most changes are going to be for the good but some are going to be for the bad its always that way with technological advances maybe we shouldnt label them advances maybe a less valueladen word like changes would be better lou stared at jack jack stared back jack thought the detectives expression hovered somewhere between frustration and irritation are you pulling my leg about all this lou questioned no jack said with a short laugh im being serious lou meditated for a moment and then said moodily i dont know if i want to live in your world but screw it come on lets make this id on rakoczi they entered the er which was already overflowing with patients several uniformed policemen were in evidence lou sought out the er director dr robert springer dr springer took lou and jack back to a trauma room the door of which was closed inside they found jasmine rakoczi she was lying naked on an er bed an endotracheal tube had been inserted and then attached to a respirator her chest was intermittently rising and falling behind her on a flatscreen monitor blips recorded her pulse and blood pressure the blood pressure was low but the pulse was normal well lou asked is this the lady you saw in lauries room it is jack said then he looked at dr springer why are you respiring her we want to keep her oxygenated dr springer said while he adjusted the respirators rate dont you suspect her brainstem was destroyed jack questioned he was surprised that they were making such an effort in such a clearly moribund situation without doubt dr springer said straightening up the organ people are trying to locate any next of kin they want to salvage the internal organs lou looked up at jack now that is going to be ironic he said she might save a handful of people ironic isnt a strong enough word jack replied id lean toward mordantly satirical to dr springers surprise the detective then cuffed the medical examiner on the head accused him of being a pompous ass and then the two walked out laughing epilogue weeks later detective lieutenant lou soldano nosed his departmental chevy over to the curb next to a fire hydrant and tossed onto the dash the plasticlaminated card that spelled out who he was and who owned the vehicle he then reached over got out his breath spray from the glove compartment and gave himself a few good squirts to hide the marlboros hed inhaled en route tipping his rearview mirror down he looked as his reflection he needed a shave but he always needed a shave especially at a quarter after eight in the evening since he couldnt do anything about his stubble he used his fingers to get his hair all going in the same direction satisfied with his appearance he opened the door and stepped out onto the street the air had the silky feel of a spring night thanks to daylight savings the sky was a light rose color that faded to silvery violet to the east lou walked up second avenue with a spring to his step hed called jack and laurie that afternoon in the hope of meeting up with them to bring them up to speed on the americare case and they had invited him to join them for dinner at their favorite restaurant elios lou had already had a few meals with jack and laurie at elios some good some not so good in the latter category was the evening laurie announced that she was a marrying the twerp she had dragged along lucky for everyone it was a false alarm and the memory of the evening brought a smile to lous face it was also lucky that he and jack didnt shoot themselves right there in the restaurant they both had been devastated lou paused outside directly in front of the door was jacks mountain bike secured to a parking meter with a panoply of locks lou shook his head neither he nor laurie could talk jack out of using the damn thing lou smiled wryly about jack constantly ragging on him about his smoking being dangerous for his health since the danger of riding a bike in the city particularly the way jack rode was a thousand times greater inside the restaurant the evenings festivities were in full swing people were clustered about the bar to the point of impinging on the diners occupying the coveted front tables lou felt decidedly selfconscious as he always did around such high rollers particularly the glitterati who seemed to laugh and talk a bit louder than everybody else after making his way through the bar crowd lou was faced with the jampacked dining room slowly his eyes made the circuit looking for a familiar face with relief he spied jack and laurie at a table in the far righthand corner with as many tables and chairs packed into the room as humanly possible it took lou some time to worm his way over to his friends en route he knocked one mans arm causing him to spill his wine when lou turned around to apologize he dragged the belt of his raincoat which was over his arm through another persons soup despite these travails he eventually made it sorry im late lou said as he gave lauries cheek a peck and shook hands with jack across the table he made sure he didnt knock over their fluted glasses with his arm or his coat no matter laurie said she pulled a bottle of champagne from the ice bucket and filled the glass in front of lou lou tried to drape his coat over the curved back of his chair but his antics quickly brought an attentive waiter who took the coat lou sat down and used his napkin to blot the line of perspiration that had appeared along his hairline to him it felt as though it was inside the restaurant he quickly undid the top button on his shirt loosened his tie and then fanned himself next time well meet down in little italy with my people he said youre on laurie said cheerfully after a few pleasantries jack said im really curious about the americare investigation whats the news me too laurie said lou eyed his friends when he thought about their friendship he was always a little amazed he wasnt even friendly with his own doctor nor his kids doctor for that matter most of lous friends were other police officers although there were a couple of firemen who he played cards with on a regular basis but jack and laurie were different than the other doctors lou had encountered they didnt look down on him for his education or what he did for a living in fact he felt it was just the opposite okay lou said business before pleasure but lets see where shall i begin first off i have to say that what jack told me the morning jasmine rakoczi got shot has turned out to be prophetic jack my boy you were on the money jack smiled and gave lou a thumbsup sign however lou continued the lions share of the kudos goes to laurie for being persistent in the face of universal ignorance on everybody elses part including jacks and for finding rakoczis tissue under stephen lewiss fingernails ill drink to that laurie said she raised her flute and clicked glasses with the others now lou continued after putting his glass down ballistics are back and they indicate that rakoczis gun killed both my captains sisterinlaw and roger rousseau lou reached over and gave lauries forearm a squeeze sorry to bring up a painful subject laurie smiled and nodded acknowledgment of lous sensitiveness ballistics also indicate that david rosenkrantzs gun killed rakoczi so that gets jack off the hook very funny jack said now i know you guys are familiar with rousseaus head and hands being found in rakoczis refrigerator since they were brought over to the ocme so i wont go into that please dont laurie said since david rosenkrantz was from out of state the fbi jumped into the ring from day one and lo and behold there have been similar deaths in americare hospitals across the country and now in each location there is an ongoing investigation as to the perpetrator good grief jack blurted when i suggested a conspiracy i was thinking of one or two higherups and rakoczicertainly nothing on a national scale well let me get to the juicy part lou said he pulled his chair closer to the table and leaned forward our saving that dirtbag rosenkrantz has turned out to be key hes copped a plea and has cooperated by implicating his immediate boss robert hawthorne hawthorne has turned out to be one interesting dude and the lynchpin of the whole operation hes a retired army special forces officer and maintains contact with the military through a network of buddies hes had an ongoing interest in dissatisfied military medical personnel whether he was recruited or had just cleverly created a niche for himself we dont know what we do know is that he has been acting like an independent contractor secretly in the employ of a big saint louis law firm which specializes in plaintiff malpractice work this firm is extremely active carrying on simultaneous cases all over the country as near as can be determined hawthorne recruited and ran a group of mostly disgruntled nurses some of whom had been in the military who were paid to communicate episodes of adverse outcomes from their respective hospitals and who got bonuses if the case went to trial ive heard about that jack said me too laurie said its mostly ob and anesthesia cases its the modern equivalent of the ambulance chasers of old well i dont know about those details lou said but here comes the most interesting part over the last few years there has been movement to make managedcare companies liable for malpractice which as an aside seems reasonable to me whats reasonable and what isnt has little to do with decisions about healthcare in this country jack interjected everything is decided according to vested interests by a strange twist of fate lou continued managedcare companies and malpractice plaintiff attorneys suddenly found themselves in the same bed in their desire to keep any malpracticereform legislation from happening i mean the goals were slightly different in that the managedcare companies didnt want things changed so they could be sued and the malpractice attorneys didnt want changes that would cap painandsuffering awards or eliminate contingency fees among other things both groups employed lobbyists to make sure malpractice law did not change which brought them together so essentially their waking up in the same bed spawned a weird marriage between the two groups how it happened is anybodys guess but someone in americare must have realized they could use the shady services of robert hawthorne since at least some of his contacts were what should we say psychopaths or sociopaths capable of murder without pangs of conscience the newest term is antisocial disorder laurie chimed in okay whatever lou said anyway some americare bureaucrator bureaucrats as the case may bebecame interested in tapping into the law firms cast of unsavory medical insiders which the law firm had formed to drum up business in order to set up an elimination scheme for highrisk subscribers these were the subscribers who they knew would be costing them millions of dollars in specialized care and thereby put upward pressure on premium rates i mean it makes some sort of sick sense good grief jack reiterated this is close to what i feared but on a larger scale let me finish lou said after making sure no one was overhearing whether there was any further cooperation in the works such that the malpractice lawyers would then take advantage of the deaths by appealing to the next of kin to sue the doctors involved we dont know so far we are only aware of one suit involving a doctor at saint francis hospital but that suit will surely be dropped now that homicide is suspected jack said maybe so lou said but i wouldnt count on it since the perpetrator was in the hospitals employ so whats the state of the investigation at this point laurie asked theres a very active hunt for the jasmine rakoczis at these other institutions where a similar pattern of deaths has occurred the hope is to nab one and have that individual turn states evidence if that happens maybe the whole house of cards will tumble down have there been any indictments so far from the hit mans testimony laurie asked only robert hawthorne who isnt talking and is in fact out on sizable bail lou said unfortunately the hit man was not really apprised of the whole operation all he knew was that his boss robert was a frequent visitor to the law firm he didnt know whom he saw or what was ever talked about nobody in the americare hierarchy has been indicted jack asked plaintively not yet lou admitted but we have our fingers crossed what a nightmare laurie said with a shudder remembering something of her ordeal in the hospital hey lou said eyeing the bubbles rising in the flute next to his water glass as if it were the first time hed seen them this is champagne he reached out and lifted the bottle from the ice bucket i dont know why im looking at this i wouldnt know one brand from the next he nestled the bottle back into the ice what is this some kind of celebration sort of laurie said with a smile she looked at jack who raised his eyebrows as if there was a secret okay out with it lou commanded he looked from one to the other well its not that big a deal laurie said i had a medical test today which wasnt very pleasant i must say but the result was reassuring apparently the reason i had an ectopic pregnancy was because i had an abnormal or damaged oviduct the test i had today showed my remaining oviduct is perfectly normal thats great lou said he nodded a few times he again looked back and forth between his two friends both of whom were avoiding eye contact by looking down and swirling their drinks well lou added does this favorable result mean you two are planning to put this oviduct to the real test laurie looked up at jack and said unfortunately at the moment it just means it could be put to the real test too bad lou commented well if you need any volunteers to test that duct im available jack laughed and looked up at lou and then laurie why do i have the feeling you two are ganging up on me hey im just trying to be a good friend lou said while raising both hands to profess his innocence well good friend jack said putting his arm around laurie in the oviducttesting business i think laurie and i can manage just fine ill drink to that lou said raising his glass me too laurie said authors note the announcement of the completion of the first draft of the human genomes billion base pairs was made with great fanfare in june of and included the participation of two heads of state president bill clinton and prime minister tony blair although the medias excitement could be measured by coverage on both the network evening news as well as prominent frontpage space in all the major newspapers on the following day the public greeted the event with vague interest a touch of bewilderment and varying degrees of ennui then quickly forgot about it despite glowing promises of future benefits the subject apparently was too esoteric perhaps because of the publics reaction the mass media soon forgot about it as well except for a few followup articles on the colorful personalities of the leading scientists of the two competing organizations that carried out the painstaking work and the almost soap operalike race to the finish the publics disregard for this landmark achievement has continued even though the involved science and technology have been charging ahead and reporting startling discoveries such as the surprising fact that we humans have only about twentyfive thousand or so genesa far cry from the hundred thousand experts had predicted not too long agoand not that many more than an organism as comparatively simple as a roundworm this discovery is a blow to humanitys hubris equivalent to the copernican revelation that the earth revolved around the sun instead of vice versa in short the decipherment of the human genome and the avalanche of research cascading from it has disappeared from most everyones radar except for those working in the two new and related endeavors of genomics and bioinformatics genomics in simple terms is the study of the flow of information in a cell while bioinformatics is the application of computers to make sense of the enormous amount of data coming from genomics in my mind this lack of interest or apathy or whatever it might be called is startling i believe the decipherment of the human genome might be the most important milestone in the history of medical science to date after all it gives us all the letters of the book of life in the right order despite our having as of yet imperfect understanding of the language or the punctuation in other words in a cryptic form that is now being decoded with gathering speed we have access to all the information nature has amassed to make and run a human being as a consequence the knowledge of the human genome will change just about everything we know about medicine and some of the changes are going to happen sooner rather than later like every major discoverymilestone in science this one will have both good and bad consequences consider the consequences stemming from research into the inner structure and workings of the atom we didnt do so well in that instance as evidenced by current events and we have to do better with the decipherment of the human genome since it behooves society to consider all consequences of major leaps in science and technology and deal with them in a proactive manner rather than on a reactive ad hoc basis marker deals with one of the negative consequencesie the negative impact of the ability to predict illness when confidentiality is breached and the information is obtained by or otherwise falls into the wrong hands unfortunately the chances of this occurring will be high since microarrays as described in marker already exist with the ability to test with ease for literally thousands of markers linked to deleterious genes with a single drop of blood a marker is a point alteration in the sequence of nucleotide bases forming the rungs of the ladder of the dna molecule markers have been mapped throughout the human genome the microarray slides are read automatically by laser scanners and the results thanks to bioinformatics are fed directly into computers armed with appropriate software such that risk and hence cost can be predicted with rapidly advancing speed and accuracy the end result will be that the concept of health insurance which is based on pooling risk within specified groups will become obsolete in other words risk cannot be pooled if it can be determined from my perspective the implications of this developing state of affairs are prodigious as a physician i have always been against health insurance except for catastrophic care and for those financially unable to pay the doctorpatient relationship is the most personal and rewarding for both the patient and the physician when a clear direct fiduciary relationship exists in such a circumstance in my experience both individuals value the encounter more which invariably leads to more time more attention to potentially important detail and a higher level of complianceall of which invariably results in a better outcome and a more rewarding experience with the power of genomics and bioinformatics obviating the pooling of risk within defined groups i have had to revamp my position which has resulted in my switching from one extreme to the other i now feel that there is only one solution to the problem of paying for healthcare in the united states indeed for all developed countries in this global economy to pool risk for the entire nation under the rubric of healthcare i mean preventive care acute care and catastrophic care although i never thought id be advocating this i now believe that the sooner we as a nation move to a governmentsponsored obviously nonprofit taxsupported singlepayer plan the better off we will be only then will we be able to pool risk for the en tire country as well as decide rationally how much we should spend on healthcare in general one of the other effects of genomics on healthcare will be the opportunity to individualize care the entire pharmacological basis of therapeutics will be changing thanks to another new field pharmacogenics which will tailormake drugs for individual patients according to their unique genomic makeup the benefits of such care will be enormous but so will the costs since we already spend over percent of our gdp on healthcare this has to be an important consideration there are other compelling arguments for a national singlepayer plan for healthcare but to my mind none of them is nearly as persuasive as the developing power of genomics but change will not come easily as jack stapleton comments in marker whats reasonable and what isnt has little to do with decisions about healthcare in this country everything is decided according to vested interests difficulties aside it is my fervent belief that the sooner we move to such a plan the better off the country will be luckily we have the experiences of a number of other industrialized countries that have already enacted singlepayer systems to learn from i would like to add just a few words about how a nurse as antisocial as jasmine rakoczi could getand keepa nursing job quite simply there is a severe nursing shortage in the united states and our hospitals even our premier academic centers are forced to continuously recruit nurses as mentioned in marker this recruitment extends to other countries including undeveloped nations the combination of low compensation and the pressure to increase productivity translated into forcing individual nurses to take on more patients than they can reasonably handle has created enough of an adverse working environment that experienced nurses seek alternate employment and young men and women are reluctant to begin the long arduous and expensive training what makes this particularly unfortunate is that we all know at least those who have experienced hospitalization that the onus of care is not on the doctors who write the orders and leave to go back to their busy offices or cozy homes but on the nurses who stay and carry them out and for those people who have suffered a major problem in the hospital its more likely than not that it was a nurse who recognized it called the physicians and instituted lifesaving care in my opinion and experience we need less highpriced administration and better pay and optimum working conditions for our beleaguered nurses who are as jasmine rakoczi herself said in the trenches actually taking care of people robin cook march
