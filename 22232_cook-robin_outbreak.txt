robin cook outbreak for my mother audrey who ultimately is responsible for all this prologue zaire africa september a twentyoneyearold yale biology student by the name of john nordyke woke up at dawn at the edge of a village north of bumba zaire rolling over in his sweatdrenched sleeping bag he stared out through the mesh flap of his nylon mountain tent hearing the sounds of the tropical rain forest mixed with the noises of the awakening village a slight breeze brought the warm pungent odor of cow dung permeated with the acrid aroma of cooking fires high above him he caught glimpses of monkeys skittering through the lush vegetation that shielded the sky from his view he had slept fitfully and as he pulled himself upright he was unsteady and weak he felt distinctly worse than he had the night before when hed been hit by chills and fever an hour or so after dinner he guessed he had malaria even though hed been careful to take his chloroquine phosphate as prophylaxis against it the problem was that it had been impossible to avoid the clouds of mosquitoes that emanated each evening from the hidden pools in the swampy jungle with a hesitant gait he made his way into the village and inquired about the nearest clinic an itinerant priest told him that there was a belgian mission hospital in yambuku a small town located a few kilometers to the east sick and frightened john quickly broke camp stuffed his tent and sleeping bag into his backpack and set out for yambuku john had taken a sixmonth leave from college to photograph african animals such as the highland gorilla which were threatened by extinction it had been his boyhood dream to emulate the famous nineteenthcentury explorers who had originally opened the dark continent yambuku was scarcely larger than the village hed just left and the mission hospital did not inspire confidence it was no more than a meager collection of cinderblock buildings all in dire need of repair the roofs were either rusting corrugated metal or thatched like the native huts and there seemed no signs of electricity after checking in with a nun swathed in traditional attire who spoke only french john was sent to wait among a throng of natives in all states of debility and disease looking at the other patients he wondered if he wasnt likely to catch something worse than what he already had finally he was seen by a harried belgian doctor who could speak a little english though not much the examination was rapid and as john had already surmised the diagnosis was a touch of malaria the doctor ordered an injection of chloroquine and advised john to return if he didnt feel better within the next day or so the examination over john was sent into the treatment room to wait in line for his injection it was at that point that he noticed the lack of aseptic technique the nurse did not have disposable needles but merely rotated one of three syringes john was certain that their short stay in the sterilizing solution was not nearly long enough to render them germfree besides the nurse fished them out of the fluid with her fingers when it became his turn he was tempted to say something but his french was not fluent enough and he knew he needed the medicine during the next few days john was glad that hed been silent since he soon was feeling better he stayed in the yambuku area occupying himself by photographing the budza tribesmen they were avid hunters and eager to demonstrate their prowess to the blond foreigner by the third day john was preparing to recommence his journey up the zaire river following henry stanleys footsteps when his health took a rapid turn for the worse the first thing he noticed was a violent headache followed in rapid succession by chills fever nausea and diarrhea hoping it would pass he took to his tent and shivered through the night dreaming of home with clean sheets and a bathroom down the hall by morning he felt weak and dehydrated having vomited several times in the darkness with great difficulty he got his things together and made his way slowly to the mission hospital when he arrived in the compound he vomited bright red blood and collapsed on the clinic floor an hour later he woke in a room occupied by two other patients both suffering from drugresistant malaria the doctor the same man whod examined john on his previous visit was alarmed by the severity of johns condition and noted some curious additional symptoms a strange rash over his chest and small surface hemorrhages in his eyes although the doctors diagnosis was still malaria he was troubled it was not a typical case as an added precaution he decided to include a course of chloramphenicol in case the boy had typhoid fever september dr lugasa district health commissioner for the bumba region glanced out the open window of his office at the expanse of the zaire river as it shimmered in the morning sunlight he wished it was still called the congo with all the mystery and excitement that name invoked then forcing his mind back to work he looked again at the letter hed just received from the yambuku mission hospital concerning the deaths of an american male one john nordyke and of a visiting farmer from a plantation near the ebola river the mission doctor claimed that their deaths had been caused by an unknown infection that spread rapidly two patients housed with the american four members of the planters household whod been caring for the farmer and ten of the clinics outpatients had come down with severe cases of the same illness dr lugasa knew that he had two choices first he could do nothing which was undoubtedly the wisest choice god knew what kind of rampant endemic diseases there were out there in the bush his second option was to fill out the bewildering array of official forms reporting the incident to kinshasa where someone like himself but higher on the bureaucratic ladder would probably decide it was prudent to do nothing of course dr lugasa knew that if he elected to fill out the forms he would then be obligated to journey up to yambuku an idea that was particularly odious to him at that particularly damp hot time of year with a twinge of guilt dr lugasa let the onionskin letter slip into the wastebasket september a week later dr lugasa was nervously shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he watched the aged dc aircraft land at the bumba airport first out was dr bouchard dr lugasas superior from kinshasa the day before dr lugasa had telephoned dr bouchard to inform him that hed just received word that a serious outbreak of an unknown disease was in progress in the area around the yambuku mission hospital it was affecting not only the local inhabitants but the hospital staff as well he had not mentioned the letter hed received some seven days before the two doctors greeted each other on the tarmac and then climbed into dr lugasas toyota corolla dr bouchard asked if there was any more news from yambuku dr lugasa cleared his throat still upset about what hed learned that morning from the wireless apparently eleven of the medical staff of seventeen were already dead along with one hundred and fourteen villagers the hospital was closed since there was no one well enough to run it dr bouchard decided that the entire bumba region had to be quarantined he quickly made the necessary calls to kinshasa and then told the reluctant dr lugasa to arrange transportation for the next morning so they could visit yambuku and assess the situation firsthand september the following day when the two doctors pulled into the deserted courtyard of the yambuku mission hospital they were greeted by an eerie stillness a rat scampered along the balustrade of an empty porch and a putrid odor assaulted their senses holding cotton handkerchiefs over their noses they reluctantly got out of the land rover and gingerly looked into the nearest building it contained two corpses both beginning to decay in the heat it wasnt until theyd peered into the third building that they found someone still alive a nurse delirious with fever the doctors went into the deserted operating room and put on gloves gowns and masks in a belated attempt to protect themselves still fearful for their own health they tended to the sick nurse and then searched for more of the staff among nearly thirty dead they found four other patients barely clinging to life dr bouchard radioed kinshasa and requested emergency aid from the zairean air force to airlift several patients from the mission hospital back to the capital but by the time the infectious disease department at the university hospital was consulted about how to isolate the patients during transport only the nurse still lived isolation techniques would have to be excellent bouchard pointed out because they were obviously dealing with a highly contagious and very deadly disease september the belgian nurse airlifted to kinshasa died at am despite six days of massive supportive therapy no diagnosis was made but after the autopsy samples of her blood liver spleen and brain were sent to the institut de m√©dicine tropical in antwerp belgium to the centers for disease control in atlanta usa and to the microbiological research establishment in porton down england in the yambuku area there were now two hundred ninetyfour known cases of the illness with a fatality rate of approximately ninety percent october the yambuku virus was isolated almost simultaneously at the three international laboratories it was noted to be structurally similar to the marburg virus first seen in in a fatal outbreak in laboratory workers handling green monkeys from uganda the new virus considerably more virulent than marburg was named ebola after the ebola river north of bumba it was thought to be the most deadly microorganism seen since the bubonic plague november two months after the initial outbreak the unknown disease in yambuku was considered successfully contained since no new cases had been reported in the area for several weeks december the quarantine of the bumba region was lifted and air service reinstated the ebola virus had evidently returned to its original source where that source was remained a complete mystery an international team of professionals including dr cyrill dubchek of the centers for disease control who had played a big role in localizing the lassa fever virus had scoured the area searching for a reservoir for the ebola virus within mammals birds and insects the virologists had no success whatsoever not even a clue los angeles california january present day dr rudolph richter a tall dignified ophthalmologist originally from west germany and cofounder of the richter clinic in los angeles adjusted his glasses and looked over the advertising proofs laid out on the circular table in the clinics conference room to his right was his brother and partner william a businessschool graduate who was examining the proofs with equal attention the material was for the next quarters drive for new prepaid subscribers to the clinics healthcare plan it was aimed at young people who as a group were relatively healthy that was where the real money was in the prepaid healthcare business william had been quick to point out rudolph liked the proofs it was the first good thing that had happened to him that day it was a day that had begun badly with a fenderbender on the entrance to the san diego freeway resulting in a nasty dent in his new bmw then there was the emergency surgery that had backed up the clinic then there was the tragic aids patient with some weird complication whod coughed in his face while he tried to examine the mans retinas and on top of everything else hed been bitten by one of the monkeys used in his ocular herpes project what a day rudolph picked up an ad scheduled for the la times sunday magazine it was perfect he nodded at william who motioned for the ad man to continue the next part of the presentation was a slick thirtysecond tv spot slotted for the evening news it portrayed carefree bikiniclad girls on a malibu beach playing volley ball with some handsome young men it reminded rudolph of an expensive pepsi ad though it extolled the concept of prepaid health maintenance as delivered by an organization like the richter clinic in contrast to conventional feeforservice medicine along with rudolph and william were a handful of other staff doctors including dr navarre chief of medicine they were all directors of the clinic and held small amounts of stock william cleared his throat and asked if there were any questions from the staff there were none after the advertising people had departed the group voiced unanimous approval of what had been presented then after a brief discussion about the construction of a new satellite clinic to deal with the increase in subscribers from the newport beach area the meeting was adjourned dr richter returned to his office and cheerfully tossed the advertising proofs into his briefcase it was a sumptuous room considering the relatively low professional salary he drew as a physician in the group but his salary was just incidental remuneration compared to the profits from his percentage of the outstanding stock both the richter clinic and dr rudolph richter were in sound financial shape after catching up on his calls dr richter made rounds on his own postoperative inpatients two retinal detachments with difficult medical histories both were doing well on his way back to his office he thought about how little surgery he was doing as the sole ophthalmologist of the clinic it was disturbing but with all the ophthalmologists in town he was lucky to have what he did he was thankful that his brother had talked him into the clinic idea eight years ago changing his white coat for a blue blazer and picking up his briefcase dr richter left the clinic it was after pm and the twotiered parking garage was almost empty during the day it was always full and william was already talking about the need to expand it not only for the spaces but for the depreciation issues like that rudolph didnt truly understand nor did he want to musing about the economics of the clinic dr richter was unaware of two men who had been waiting in the shadows of the garage he remained unaware even after they fell in step behind him the men were dressed in dark business suits the taller of the two had an arm that seemed permanently frozen into a flexed position in his hand was a fat briefcase that he held high due to the immobility of the elbow joint nearing his car dr richter sensed the footsteps behind him as they quickened in pace an uncomfortable sensation gripped his throat he swallowed hard and cast a nervous glance over his shoulder he caught sight of the two men who seemed to be coming directly toward him as they passed beneath an overhead light dr richter could appreciate that they were carefully dressed with fresh shirts and silk ties that made him feel a little better even so he moved more quickly rounding the back end of his car fumbling for the keys he unlocked the driversside door tossed in his briefcase and slid into the welcome smell of coach leather he started to close the door when a hand stopped him dr richter reluctantly raised his eyes to what turned out to be the calm blank face of one of the men who had followed him the suggestion of a smile crossed the mans countenance as dr richter looked at him inquiringly dr richter tried again to pull his door shut but the man held it firmly from the outside could you tell me the time doctor asked the man politely certainly said richter glad to have a safe explanation for the mans presence he glanced at his watch but before he had a chance to speak he felt himself rudely pulled from the car he made a halfhearted effort to struggle but he was quickly overwhelmed and stunned by an openhanded blow to the side of his face that knocked him to the ground hands roughly searched for his wallet and he heard fabric tear one of the men said businessman in what sounded like a disparaging tone while the other said get the briefcase dr richter felt his watch yanked from his wrist it was over as quickly as it had begun dr richter heard footsteps recede and a car door slam then the screech of tires on the smooth concrete for a few moments he lay without moving glad to be alive he found his glasses and put them on noting that the left lens was cracked as a surgeon his primary concern was for his hands they were the first thing he checked even before he picked himself up off the ground getting to his feet he began to examine the rest of himself his white shirt and his tie were smeared with grease a button was missing from the front of his blazer and in its place was a small horseshoeshaped tear his pants were torn from the right front pocket all the way down to his knee god what a day he voiced to himself thinking that being mugged made the mornings fenderbender seem trivial by comparison after a moments hesitation he recovered his keys and returned to the clinic going back to his office he called security then debated whether to call the la police the idea of bad publicity for the clinic made him hesitate and really what would the police have done while he argued with himself he called his wife to explain that hed be a little later than expected then he went into the lavatory to examine his face in the mirror there was an abrasion over the right cheekbone that was sprinkled with bits of parkinggarage grit as he gingerly blotted it with antiseptic he tried to estimate how much he had contributed to the muggers welfare he guessed hed had about a hundred dollars in his wallet as well as all his credit cards and identification including his california medical license but it was the watch that he most hated to lose it had been a gift from his wife well he could replace it he thought as he heard a knock on his outer door the security man was fawningly apologetic saying that such a problem had never happened before and that he wished hed been in the area he told dr richter that hed been through the garage only a halfhour before on his normal rounds dr richter assured the man that he was not to blame and that his richters only concern was that steps be taken to make certain that such an incident did not reoccur the doctor then explained his reasons for not calling the police the following day dr richter did not feel well but he attributed the symptoms to shock and the fact that hed slept poorly by fivethirty though he felt ill enough to consider canceling a rendezvous he had with his mistress a secretary in the medical records department in the end he went to her apartment but left early to get some rest only to spend the night tossing restlessly in his bed the next day dr richter was really ill when he stood up from the slit lamp he was lightheaded and dizzy he tried not to think about the monkey bite or being coughed on by the aids patient he was well aware that aids was not transmitted by such casual contact it was the undiagnosed superinfection that worried him by threethirty he had a chill and the beginnings of a headache of migraine intensity thinking he had developed a fever he canceled the rest of the afternoons appointments and left the clinic by then he was quite certain he had the flu when he arrived home his wife took one look at his pale face and redrimmed eyes and sent him to bed by eight oclock his headache was so bad that he took a percodan by nine he had violent stomach cramps and diarrhea his wife wanted to call dr navarre but dr richter told her that she was being an alarmist and that hed be fine he took some dalmane and fell asleep at four oclock he woke up and dragged himself into the bathroom where he vomited blood his terrified wife left him long enough to call an ambulance to take him to the clinic he did not complain he didnt have the strength to complain he knew that he was sicker than hed ever been in his life january something disturbed marissa blumenthal whether the stimulus came from within her own mind or from some minor external change she did not know nonetheless her concentration was broken as she raised her eyes from the book in her lap she realized that the light outside the window had changed from its pale wintery white to inky blackness she glanced at her watch no wonder it was nearly seven holy toledo muttered marissa using one of her expressions left over from childhood she stood up quickly and felt momentarily dizzy she had been sprawled out on two low slung vinylcovered chairs in a corner of the library of the centers for disease control cdc in atlanta for more hours than she cared to think about she had made a date for that evening and had planned on being home by sixthirty to get ready hefting fields ponderous virology textbook she made her way over to the reserve shelf stretching her cramped leg muscles en route shed run that morning but had only put in two miles not her usual four need help getting that monster on the shelf teased mrs campbell the motherly librarian buttoning her omnipresent gray cardigan it was none too warm in the library as in all good humor there was some basis in truth for mrs campbells whispered comment the virology textbook weighed ten poundsonetenth as much as marissas hundredpound frame she was only five feet tall although when people asked she said she was fivetwo though that was only in heels to return the book she had to swing it back and then almost toss it into place the kind of help i need with this book said marissa is to get the contents into my brain mrs campbell laughed in her subdued fashion she was a warm friendly person like most everyone at cdc as far as marissa was concerned the organization had more the feeling of an academic institution than a federal agency which it had officially become in there was a pervading atmosphere of dedication and commitment although the secretaries and maintenance personnel left at fourthirty the professional staff invariably stayed on often working into the wee hours of the morning people believed in what they were doing marissa walked out of the library which was hopelessly inadequate in terms of space half the centers books and periodicals were stored haphazardly in rooms all over the complex in that sense the cdc was very much a federally regulated health agency forced to scrounge for funding in an atmosphere of budget cutting marissa noted it also looked like a federal agency the hall was painted a drab institutional green and the floor was covered in a gray vinyl that had been worn thin down the middle by the elevator was the inevitable photograph of a smiling ronald reagan just beneath the picture someone had irreverently tacked up an index card that said if you dont like this years appropriation just wait until next year marissa took the stairs up one flight her officeit was generous to call it that it was more cubbyhole than officewas on the floor above the library it was a windowless storage area that might have been a broom closet at one time the walls were painted cinder block and there was just enough room for a metal desk file cabinet light and swivel chair but she was lucky to have it competition for space at the center was intense yet despite the handicaps marissa was well aware that the cdc worked it had delivered phenomenal medical service over the years not only in the us but in foreign countries as well she remembered vividly how the center had solved the legionnaires disease mystery a number of years back there had been hundreds of such cases since the organization had been started in as the office of malaria control to wipe out that disease in the american south in it had been renamed the communicable disease center with separate labs set up for bacteria fungi parasites viruses and rickettsiae the following year a lab was added for zoonoses diseases that are animal ailments but that can be transmitted to man like plague rabies and anthrax in the organization was renamed again this time the centers for disease control as marissa arranged some articles in her governmentissue briefcase she thought about the past successes of the cdc knowing that its history had been one of the prime reasons for her considering coming to the center after completing a pediatric residency in boston she had applied and had been accepted into the epidemiology intelligence service eis for a twoyear hitch as an epidemiology intelligence service officer it was like being a medical detective only three and a half weeks previously just before christmas shed completed her introductory course which supposedly trained her for her new role the course was in publichealth administration biostatistics and epidemiologythe study and control of health and disease in a given population a wry smile appeared on marissas face as she pulled on her dark blue overcoat shed taken the introductory course all right but as had happened so often in her medical training she felt totally illequipped to handle a real emergency it was going to be an enormous leap from the classroom to the field if and when she was sent out on an assignment knowing how to relate to cases of a specific disease in a coherent narrative that would reveal cause transmission and host factors was a far cry from deciding how to control a real outbreak involving real people and a real disease actually it wasnt a question of if it was only a question of when picking up her briefcase marissa turned off the light and headed back down the hall to the elevators shed taken the introductory epidemiology course with fortyeight other men and women most of whom like herself were trained physicians there were a few microbiologists a few nurses even one dentist she wondered if they all shared her current crisis of confidence in medicine people generally didnt talk about such things it was contrary to the image at the completion of the training shed been assigned to the department of virology special pathogens branch her first choice among the positions available she had been granted her request because shed ranked number one in the class although marissa had little background in virology which was the reason shed been spending so much time in the library shed asked to be assigned to the department because the current epidemic of aids had catapulted virology into the forefront of research previously it had always played second fiddle to bacteriology now virology was where the action was and marissa wanted to be a part of it at the elevators marissa said hello to the small group of people who were waiting shed met some of them mostly those from the department of virology whose administrative office was just down the hall from her cubicle others were strangers but everyone acknowledged her she might have been experiencing a crisis of confidence in her professional competence but at least she felt welcome on the main floor marissa stood in line to sign out a requirement after pm then headed to the parking area although it was winter it was nothing like what shed endured in boston for the previous four years and she didnt bother to button her coat her sporty red honda prelude was as shed left it that morning dusty dirty and neglected it still had massachusetts license plates replacing them was one of the many errands that marissa had not yet found time to do it was a short drive from the cdc to marissas rented house the area around the center was dominated by emory university which had donated the land to the cdc in the early s a number of pleasant residential neighborhoods surrounded the university running the gamut from lower middle class to conspicuously rich it was in one of the former neighborhoods in the druid hills section that marissa had found a house to rent it was owned by a couple whod been transferred to mali africa to work on an extended birthcontrol project marissa turned onto peachtree place it seemed to her that everything in atlanta was named peachtree she passed her house on the left it was a small twostory woodframe building reasonably maintained except for the grounds the architectural style was indeterminant except for two ionic columns on the front porch the windows all had fake shutters each with a heartshaped area cut out in the center marissa had used the term cute to describe it to her parents she turned left at the next street and then left again the property on which the house sat went all the way through the block and in order for marissa to get to the garage she had to approach from the rear there was a circular drive in front of the house but it didnt connect with the rear driveway and the garage apparently in the past the two driveways had been connected but someone had built a tennis court and that had ended the connection now the tennis court was so overgrown with weeds it was barely discernible knowing that she was going out that evening marissa did not put her car in the garage but just swung around and backed it up as she ran up the back steps she heard the cocker spaniel given to her by one of her pediatric colleagues barking welcome marissa had never planned on having a dog but six months previously a longterm romantic relationship that she had assumed was leading to marriage had suddenly ended the man roger shulman a neurosurgical resident at mass general had shocked marissa with the news that he had accepted a fellowship at ucla and that he wanted to go by himself up until that time they had agreed that marissa would go wherever roger went to finish his training and indeed marissa had applied for pediatric positions in san francisco and houston roger had never even mentioned ucla as the baby in the family with three older brothers and a cold and dominating neurosurgeon for a father marissa had never had much selfconfidence she took the breakup with roger very badly and had been barely able to drag herself out of bed each morning to get to the hospital in the midst of her resultant depression her friend nancy had presented her with the dog at first marissa had been irritated but taffythe puppy had worn the cloyingly sweet name on a large bow tied around its necksoon won marissas heart and as nancy had judged it helped marissa to focus on something besides her hurt now marissa was crazy about the dog enjoying having life in her home an object to receive and return her love coming to the cdc marissas only worry had been what to do with taffy when she was sent out in the field the issue weighed heavily on her until the judsons her neighbors on the right fell in love with the dog and offeredno demandedto take taffy any time marissa had to go out of town it was like a godsend opening the door marissa had to fend off taffys excited jumps until she could turn off the alarm when the owners had first explained the system to marissa shed listened with only half an ear but now she was glad she had it even though the suburbs were much safer than the city she felt much more isolated at night than she had in boston she even appreciated the panic button that she carried in her coat pocket and which she could use to set off the alarm from the driveway if she saw unexpected lights or movement inside the house while marissa looked over her mail she let taffy expend some of her pentup energy racing in large circles around the blue spruce in the front yard without fail the judsons let the dog out around noon still from then until marissa got home in the evening was a long time for an eightmonthold puppy to be cooped up in the kitchen unfortunately marissa had to cut taffys exuberant exercise short it was already after seven and she was expected at dinner at eight ralph hempston a successful ophthalmologist had taken her out several times and though she still had not gotten over roger she enjoyed ralphs sophisticated company and the fact that he seemed content to take her to dinner the theater a concert without pressuring her to go to bed in fact tonight was the first time hed invited her to his house and hed made it clear it was to be a large party not just the two of them he seemed content to let the relationship grow at its own pace and marissa was grateful even if she suspected the reason might be the twentytwoyear difference in their ages she was thirtyone and he was fiftythree oddly enough the only other man marissa was dating in atlanta was four years younger than she tad schockley a microbiologist phd who worked in the same department she ultimately had been assigned to had been smitten by her the moment hed spied her in the cafeteria during her first week at the center he was the exact opposite of ralph hempston socially painfully shy even when hed only asked her to a movie theyd gone out a half dozen times and thankfully he like ralph had not been pushy in a physical sense showering quickly marissa then dried herself off and put on makeup almost automatically racing against time she went through her closet rapidly dismissing various combinations she was no fashion plate but liked to look her best she settled on a silk skirt and a sweater shed gotten for christmas the sweater came down to midthigh and she thought that it made her look taller slipping on a pair of black pumps she eyed herself in the fulllength mirror except for her height marissa was reasonably happy with her looks her features were small but delicate and her father had actually used the term exquisite years ago when shed asked him if he thought she was pretty her eyes were dark brown and thickly lashed and her thick wavy hair was the color of expensive sherry she wore it as she had since she was sixteen shoulder length and pulled back from her forehead with a tortoiseshell barrette it was only a fiveminute drive to ralphs but the neighborhood changed significantly for the better the houses grew larger and were set back on wellmanicured lawns ralphs house was situated on a large piece of property with the driveway curving gracefully up from the street the drive was lined with azaleas and rhododendrons that in the spring had to be seen to be believed according to ralph the house itself was a threestory victorian affair with an octagonal tower dominating the right front corner a large porch defined by complicated gingerbread trim started at the tower extended along the front of the house and swept around the left side above the doubledoored front entrance and resting on the roof of the porch was a circular balcony roofed with a cone that complemented the one on top of the tower the scene looked festive enough every window in the house blazed with light marissa drove around to the left following ralphs instructions she thought that she was a little late but there were no other cars as she passed the house she glanced up at the fire escape coming down from the third floor shed noticed it one night when ralph had stopped to pick up his forgotten beeper hed explained that the previous owner had made servants quarters up there and the city building department had forced him to add the fire escape the black iron stood out grotesquely against the white wood marissa parked in front of the garage whose complicated trim matched that of the house she knocked on the back door which was in a modern wing that could not be seen from the front no one seemed to hear her looking through the window she could see a lot of activity in the kitchen deciding against trying the door to see if it was unlocked she walked around to the front of the house and rang the bell ralph opened the door immediately and greeted her with a big hug thanks for coming over early he said helping her off with her coat early i thought i was late no not at all said ralph the guests arent supposed to be here until eightthirty he hung her coat in the hall closet marissa was surprised to see that ralph was dressed in a tuxedo although shed acknowledged how handsome he looked she was disconcerted i hope im dressed appropriately she said you didnt mention that this was a formal affair you look stunning as always i just like an excuse to wear my tux come let me show you around marissa followed thinking again that ralph looked the quintessential physician strong sympathetic features and hair graying in just the right places the two walked into the parlor ralph leading the way the decor was attractive but somewhat sterile a maid in a black uniform was putting out hors doeuvres well begin in here the drinks will be made at the bar in the living room ralph said he opened a pair of slidingpanel doors and they stepped into the living room a bar was to the left a young man in a red vest was busily polishing the glassware beyond the living room through an arch was the formal dining room marissa could see that the table was laid for at least a dozen people she followed ralph through the dining room and out into the new wing which contained a family room and a large modern kitchen the dinner party was being catered and three or four people were busy with the preparations after being reassured that everything was under control ralph lead marissa back to the parlor and explained that hed asked her to come over early in hopes that shed act as hostess a little surprisedafter all shed only been out with ralph five or six timesmarissa agreed the doorbell rang the first guests had arrived unfortunately marissa had never been good at keeping track of peoples names but she remembered a dr and mrs hayward because of his astonishingly silver hair then there was a dr and mrs jackson she sporting a diamond the size of a golf ball the only other names marissa recalled afterward were dr and dr sandberg both psychiatrists making an attempt at small talk marissa was awed by the furs and jewels these people were not smalltown practitioners when almost everyone was standing in the living room with a drink in hand the doorbell sounded again ralph was not in sight so marissa opened the door to her utter surprise she recognized dr cyrill dubchek her boss at the special pathogens branch of the department of virology hello dr blumenthal said dubchek comfortably taking marissas presence in stride marissa was visibly flustered shed not expected anyone from the cdc dubchek handed his coat to the maid revealing a dark blue italiantailored suit he was a striking man with coal black intelligent eyes and an olive complexion his features were sharp and aristocratic running a hand through his hair which was brushed straight back from his forehead he smiled we meet again marissa weakly returned the smile and nodded toward the living room the bar is in there wheres ralph asked dubchek glancing into the crowded living room probably in the kitchen said marissa dubchek nodded and moved off as the doorbell rang again this time marissa was even more flabbergasted standing before her was tad schockley marissa said tad genuinely surprised marissa recovered and allowed tad to enter while she took his coat she asked how do you know dr hempston just from meetings i was surprised when i got an invitation in the mail tad smiled but who am i to turn down a free meal on my salary did you know that dubchek was coming asked marissa her tone was almost accusing tad shook his head but what difference does it make he looked into the dining room and then up the main staircase beautiful house wow marissa grinned in spite of herself tad with his short sandy hair and fresh complexion looked too young to be a phd he was dressed in a corduroy jacket a woven tie and gray flannels so worn they might as well have been jeans hey he said how do you know dr hempston hes just a friend said marissa evasively gesturing for tad to head into the living room for a drink once all the guests had arrived marissa felt free to move away from the front door at the bar she got herself a glass of white wine and tried to mingle just before the group was summoned into the dining room she found herself in a conversation with dr sandberg and dr and mrs jackson welcome to atlanta young lady said dr sandberg thank you said marissa trying not to gawk at mrs jacksons ring how is it you happened to come to the cdc asked dr jackson his voice was deep and resonant he not only looked like charlton heston he actually sounded as if he could play ben hur looking into the mans deep blue eyes she wondered how to answer his seemingly sincere question she certainly wasnt going to mention anything about her former lovers flight to la and her need for a change that wasnt the kind of commitment people expected at the cdc ive always had an interest in public health that was a little white lie ive always been fascinated by stories of medical detective work she smiled at least that was the truth i guess i got tired of looking up runny noses and into draining ears trained in pediatrics said dr sandberg it was a statement not a question childrens hospital in boston said marissa she always felt a little ill at ease talking with psychiatrists she couldnt help but wonder if they could analyze her motives better than she could herself she knew that part of the reason she had gone into medicine was to enable her to compete with her brothers in their relationships with their father how do you feel about clinical medicine asked dr jackson were you ever interested in practicing well certainly replied marissa how continued dr jackson unknowingly making marissa feel progressively uneasy did you see yourself solo in a group or in a clinic dinner is served called ralph over the din of conversation marissa felt relieved as dr jackson and dr sandberg turned to find their wives for a moment she had felt as if she were being interrogated in the dining room marissa discovered that ralph had seated himself at one end of the table and had placed her at the other to her immediate right was dr jackson who thankfully forgot about his questions concerning clinical medicine to her left was the silverhaired dr hayward as the meal progressed it became even clearer that marissa was dining with the cream of atlantas medical community these were not just doctors they were the most successful private practitioners in the city the only exceptions to this were cyrill dubchek tad and herself after several glasses of good wine marissa was more talkative than normal she felt a twinge of embarrassment when she realized that the entire table was listening to her description of her childhood in virginia she told herself to shut up and smile and she was pleased when the conversation switched to the sorry state of american medicine and how prepaid healthcare groups were eroding the foundations of private practice remembering the furs and jewels marissa didnt feel that those present were suffering too much how about the cdc asked dr hayward looking across at cyrill have you been experiencing budgetary constraints cyrill laughed cynically his smile forming deep creases in his cheeks every year we have to do battle with the office of management and budget as well as the house appropriations committee weve lost five hundred positions due to budgetary cuts dr jackson cleared his throat what if there were a serious outbreak of influenza like the pandemic of assuming your department would be involved do you have the manpower for such an eventuality cyrill shrugged it depends on a lot of variables if the strain doesnt mutate its surface antigens and we can grow it readily in tissue culture we could develop a vaccine quite quickly how quickly im not sure tad a month or so said tad if we were lucky more time to produce enough to make a significant difference reminds me of the swine flu fiasco a few years ago interjected dr hayward that wasnt the cdcs fault said cyrill defensively there was no doubt about the strain that appeared at fort dix why it didnt spread is anybodys guess marissa felt a hand on her shoulder turning she found herself looking at one of the blackdressed waitresses dr blumenthal whispered the girl yes there is a phone call for you marissa glanced down the table at ralph but he was busy talking with mrs jackson she excused herself and followed the girl to the kitchen then it dawned on her and she felt a stirring of fear like the first time she had been called at night as an intern it had to be the cdc after all she was on call and shed dutifully left ralphs number no one else knew she was there dr blumenthal asked the cdc operator when marissa picked up the phone the call was switched to the duty officer congratulations he said jovially there has been an epidemic aid request we had a call from the california state epidemiologist who would like cdc help on a problem in la its an outbreak of unknown but apparently serious illness in a hospital called the richter clinic weve gone ahead and made a reservation for you on deltas flight to the coast that leaves at am weve arranged hotel accommodations at a place called the tropic motel sounds divine anyway good luck replacing the receiver marissa left her hand on the phone for a moment while she caught her breath she didnt feel prepared at all those poor unsuspecting people in california had called the cdc expecting to get an epidemiologic expert and instead they were going to get her marissa blumenthal all five feet of her she made her way back to the dining room to excuse herself and say goodbye january by the time marissa had gotten her suitcase from the baggage carousel waited for the rentacar van gotten the rentacar the first one wouldnt start and had somehow managed to find the tropic motel the sky had begun to lighten as she signed in she couldnt help thinking of roger but she wouldnt call shed promised herself that much several times on the flight the motel was depressing but it didnt matter marissa didnt think shed be spending much time there she washed her hands and face combed her hair and replaced her barrette with no other plausible reason for delay she returned to the rentacar and set out for the richter clinic the palms of her hands were damp against the steering wheel the clinic was conveniently situated on a wide thoroughfare there were few cars at that time of morning marissa pulled into a parking garage took a ticket and found a spot near the entrance the entire structure was modern including the garage the clinic and what marissa guessed was the hospital which appeared to be seven stories tall getting out of the car she stretched then lifted out her briefcase in it were her class notes from the epidemiology portion of the introductory courseas if that would be any helpa note pad pencils a small textbook on diagnostic virology an extra lipstick and a pack of chewing gum what a joke once inside marissa noted the familiar hospital odor of disinfectanta smell that somehow calmed her and made her feel instantly at home there was an information booth but it was empty she asked a maintenance man mopping the floor how to get to the hospital wing and he pointed to a red stripe on the floor marissa followed it to the emergency room there was little activity there with few patients in the waiting room and only two nurses behind the main desk marissa sought out the oncall doctor and explained who she was oh great said the er doctor enthusiastically are we glad youre here dr navarre has been waiting all night for you let me get him marissa absentmindedly played with some paper clips when she looked up she realized the two nurses were staring at her she smiled and they smiled back can i get you some coffee asked the taller of the two that would be nice said marissa in addition to her basic anxiety she was feeling the effects of only two hours of fitful sleep on the flight from atlanta sipping the hot liquid marissa recalled the berton roueche medical detective stories in the new yorker she wished that she could be involved in a case like the one solved by john snow the father of modern epidemiology a london cholera epidemic was aborted when snow deductively isolated the problem to a particular london water pump the real beauty of snows work was that he did it before the germ theory of disease was accepted wouldnt it be wonderful to be involved in such a clearcut situation the door to the oncall room opened and a handsome blackhaired man appeared blinking in the bright er light he came directly toward marissa the corners of his mouth pulled up in a big smile dr blumenthal we are so glad to see you you have no idea as they shook hands dr navarre gazed down at marissa standing next to her he was momentarily taken aback by her diminutive size and youthful appearance to be polite he inquired about her flight and asked if she was hungry i think it would be best to get right down to business said marissa dr navarre readily agreed as he led marissa to the hospital conference room he introduced himself as chief of the department of medicine this news didnt help marissas confidence she recognized that dr navarre undoubtedly knew a hundred times more than she about infectious disease motioning for marissa to sit at the round conference table dr navarre picked up the phone and dialed while the call was going through he explained that dr spenser cox the state epidemiologist was extremely eager to talk to marissa the moment she arrived wonderful thought marissa forcing a weak smile dr cox sounded equally as happy as dr navarre that marissa was there he explained to her that unfortunately he was currently embroiled in a problem in the san francisco bay area involving an outbreak of hepatitis b that they thought could be related to aids i assume continued dr cox that dr navarre has told you that the problem at the richter clinic currently involves only seven patients he hasnt told me anything yet said marissa im sure he is just about to said dr cox up here we have almost five hundred cases of hepatitis b so you can understand why i cant come down there immediately of course said marissa good luck said dr cox by the way how long have you been with the cdc not that long admitted marissa there was a short pause well keep me informed said dr cox marissa handed the receiver back to dr navarre who hung up let me bring you up to date he said switching to a standard medical monotone as he pulled some threebyfive cards from his pocket we have seven cases of an undiagnosed but obviously severe febrile illness characterized by prostration and multisystem involvement the first patient to be hospitalized happens to be one of the cofounders of the clinic dr richter himself the next a woman from the medical records department dr navarre began placing his threebyfive cards on the table each one represented a patient he organized them in the order in which the cases had presented themselves discreetly snapping open her briefcase without allowing dr navarre to see what it contained marissa extracted her note pad and a pencil her mind raced back to the courses shed recently completed remembering that she needed to break the information down into understandable categories first the illness was it really something new did a problem really exist that was the province of the simple table and some rudimentary statistics marissa knew she had to characterize the illness even if she couldnt make a specific diagnosis the next step would be to determine host factors of the victims such as age sex health eating habits hobbies etc then to determine time place and circumstances in which each patient displayed initial symptoms in order to learn what elements of commonality existed then there would be the question of transmission of the illness which might lead to the infectious agent finally the host or reservoir would have to be irradicated it sounded so easy but marissa knew it would be a difficult problem even for someone as experienced as dubchek marissa wiped her moist hand on her skirt then picked up her pencil once more so she said staring at the blank page since no diagnosis has been made whats being considered everything said dr navarre influenza asked marissa hoping she wasnt sounding overly simplistic not likely said dr navarre the patients have respiratory symptoms but they do not predominate besides serological testing has been negative for influenza virus in all seven patients we dont know what they have but it is not influenza any ideas asked marissa mostly negatives said dr navarre everything weve tested has been negative blood cultures urine cultures sputum cultures stool cultures even cerebrospinal fluid cultures we thought about malaria and actually treated for it though the blood smears were negative for the parasites we even treated for typhoid with either tetracycline or chloramphenicol despite the negative cultures but just like with the antimalarials there was no effect whatsoever the patients are all going downhill no matter what we do you must have some kind of differential diagnosis said marissa of course responded dr navarre weve had a number of infectious disease consults the consensus is that it is a viral problem although leptospirosis is still a weak contender dr navarre searched through his index cards then held one up ah here are the current differential diagnoses leptospirosis as i mentioned yellow fever dengue mononucleosis or just to cover the bases some other enteroviral arboviral or adenoviral infection needless to say weve made about as much progress in the diagnostic realm as the therapeutic how long has dr richter been hospitalized asked marissa this is his fifth day i think you should see the patients to have an idea of what we are dealing with dr navarre stood up without waiting for marissas response she found she had to trot to keep up with him they went through swinging doors and entered the hospital proper nervous as she was marissa could not help being impressed by the luxurious carpeting and almost hotellike decor she got on the elevator behind dr navarre who introduced her to an anesthesiologist marissa returned the mans greeting but her thoughts were elsewhere she was certain that her seeing the patients at that moment was not going to accomplish anything except to make her feel exposed this issue had not occurred to her while taking the introductory course back in atlanta suddenly it seemed like a big problem yet what could she say they arrived at the nurses station on the fifth floor dr navarre took the time to introduce marissa to the night staff who were making their initial preparations to change shifts all seven patients are on this floor said dr navarre it has some of our most experienced personnel the two in critical condition are in separate cubicles in the medical intensivecare unit just across the hall the rest are in private rooms here are the charts with an open palm he thumped a pile stacked on the corner of the counter top i assume youd like to see dr richter first dr navarre handed richters chart to marissa the first thing she looked at was the vitalsign sheet beginning his fifth hospital day she noticed that the doctors blood pressure was falling and his temperature was rising not a good omen rapidly she perused the chart she knew that shed have to go over it carefully later but even a cursory glance convinced her that the workup had been superb better than she could have done herself the laboratory work had been exhaustive again she wondered what in gods name she was doing there pretending to be an authority going back to the beginning of the chart marissa read the section entitled history of the present illness something jumped out at her right away six weeks previous to the onset of symptoms dr richter had attended an ophthalmological convention in nairobi kenya she read on her interest piqued one week prior to his illness dr richter had attended an eyelid surgery conference in san diego two days prior to admission hed been bitten by a cercopitheceus aethiops whatever the hell that was she showed it to dr navarre its a type of monkey said dr navarre dr richter always has a few of them on hand for his ocular herpes research marissa nodded she glanced again at the laboratory values and noted that the patient had a low white count a low esr and low thrombocytes other lab values indicated liver and kidney malfunction even the ekg showed mild abnormalities this guy was virulently sick marissa laid the chart down on the counter ready questioned dr navarre although marissa nodded that she was she would have preferred to put off confronting the patients she had no delusions of grandeur that she would uncover some heretofore missed but significant physical sign and thereby solve the mystery her seeing the patients at that point was pure theater and unfortunately risky business she followed dr navarre reluctantly they entered the intensivecare unit with its familiar backdrop of complicated electronic machinery the patients were immobile victims secured with tangles of wires and plastic tubing there was the smell of alcohol the sound of respirators and cardiac monitors there was also the usual high level of nursing activity weve isolated dr richter in this side room said dr navarre stopping at the closed doorway to the left of the door was a window and inside the room marissa could make out the patient like the others in the unit he was stretched out beneath a canopy of intravenous bottles behind him was a cathoderay tube with a continuous ekg tracing flashing across its screen i think youd better put on a mask and gown said dr navarre were observing isolation precautions on all the patients for obvious reasons by all means said marissa trying not to sound too eager if she had her way shed climb into a plastic bubble she slipped on the gown and helped herself to a hat mask booties and even rubber gloves dr navarre did likewise unaware she was doing it marissa breathed shallowly as she looked down at the patient who in irreverent vernacular looked as if he was about to check out his color was ashen his eyes sunken his skin slack there was a bruise over his right cheekbone his lips were dry and dried blood was caked on his front teeth as marissa stared down at the stricken man she didnt know what to do yet she selfconsciously felt obliged to do something with dr navarre hanging over her watching her every move how do you feel asked marissa she knew it was a stupid selfevident question the moment it escaped from her lips nonetheless richters eyes fluttered open marissa noticed some hemorrhages in the whites not good admitted dr richter his voice a hoarse whisper is it true you were in africa a month ago she asked she had to lean over to hear the man and her heart went out to him six weeks ago said dr richter did you come in contact with any animals asked marissa no managed dr richter after a pause i saw a lot but didnt handle any did you attend anyone who was ill dr richter shook his head speaking was obviously difficult for him marissa straightened up and pointed to the abrasion under the patients right eye any idea what this is she asked dr navarre dr navarre nodded he was mugged two days before he got sick he hit his cheek on the pavement poor guy said marissa wincing at dr richters misfortune then after a moment she added i think ive seen enough for now just inside the door leading back to the icu proper there was a large frame holding a plastic bag both marissa and dr navarre peeled off their isolation apparel and returned to the fifthfloor nurses station compulsively marissa washed her hands in the sink what about the monkey that bit dr richter she asked we have him quarantined said dr navarre weve also cultured him in every way possible he appears to be healthy they seemed to have thought of everything marissa picked up dr richters chart to see if his conjunctival hemorrhages had been noted they had marissa took a deep breath and looked over at dr navarre who was watching her expectantly well she said vaguely ive got a lot of work to do with these charts suddenly she remembered reading about a category of disease called viral hemorrhagic fever they were extremely rare but deadly and a number of them came from africa hoping to add something to the tentative diagnoses already listed by the clinic doctors she mentioned the possibility vhf was already brought up said dr navarre that was one of the reasons we called the cdc so quickly so much for that zebra diagnosis thought marissa referring to a medical maxim that when you hear hoofbeats think of horses not zebras to her great relief dr navarre was paged for an emergency im terribly sorry he said but im needed in the er is there anything i can do before i go well i think it would be better to improve the isolation of the patients youve already moved them to the same general area of the hospital but i think you should place them in a completely isolated wing and begin complete barrier nursing at least until we have some idea as to the communicability of the disease dr navarre stared at marissa for a moment she wondered what he was thinking then he said youre absolutely right marissa took the seven charts into a small room behind the nurses station opening each she learned that besides dr richter there were four women and two men who presumably had the same illness somehow they all had to have had direct contact with each other or been exposed to the same source of contamination marissa kept reminding herself that her method of attack on a field assignment particularly her first was to gather as much information as she could and then relay it to atlanta going back to dr richters chart marissa read everything including the nurses notes on a separate sheet in her notebook she listed every bit of information that could possibly have significance including the fact that the man had presented with an episode of hematemesis vomiting blood that certainly didnt sound like influenza the whole time she was working her mind kept returning to the fact that dr richter had been in africa six weeks previously that had to be significant even though a months incubation was unlikely given the symptomology unless he had malaria which apparently he did not of course there were viral diseases like aids with longer incubation periods but aids was not an acute viral infectious disease the incubation period for such a disease was usually about a week give or take a few days marissa painstakingly went through all the charts amassing diverse data on age sex lifestyle occupation and living environment and recording her findings on a separate page in her notebook for each of the patients rather quickly she realized that she was dealing with a diverse group of people in addition to dr richter there was a secretary a woman who worked in medical records at the richter clinic two housewives a plumber an insurance salesman and a real estate broker opportunity for commonality seemed remote with a group this diverse yet all of them must have been exposed to the same source reading the charts also gave marissa a better clinical picture of the illness she was dealing with apparently it began rather suddenly with severe headaches muscle pain and high fever then the patients experienced some combination of abdominal pain diarrhea vomiting sore throat cough and chest pain a shiver went down marissas spine as she thought about having been exposed to the disease marissa rubbed her eyes they felt gritty from lack of sleep it was time to visit the rest of the patients whether she wanted to or not there were a lot of gaps particularly in activities of each patient in the days directly preceding their illness she started with the medical secretary who was located in a room next to dr richters in the icu and then worked her way through to the last patient to be admitted before seeing each case she carefully dressed in full protective clothing all the patients were seriously ill and none felt much like talking still marissa went through her list of questions concentrating on whether each patient was acquainted with any of the other people who were ill the answer was always no except that each one knew dr richter and all were members of the richter clinic health plan the answer was so obvious she was surprised that no one seemed to have spotted it dr richter might have spread the disease himself since he might even have been in contact with the medical secretary she asked the ward clerk to call for all the patients clinic outpatient records while she was waiting dr navarre called im afraid we have another case he said hes one of the lab techs here at the clinic hes in the emergency room do you want to come down is he isolated asked marissa as well as we can do it down here said dr navarre were preparing an isolation wing upstairs on the fifth floor we will move all the cases there the moment it is ready the sooner the better said marissa for the time being i recommend that all nonessential lab work be postponed thats okay by me said dr navarre what about this boy down here do you want to see him im on my way said marissa en route to the er marissa could not shake the feeling that they were on the brink of a major epidemic concerning the lab tech there were two equally disturbing possibilities the first was that the fellow had contracted the illness in the same fashion as the others ie from some active source of deadly virus in the richter clinic the second more probable in marissas estimation was that the lab tech had been exposed to the agent from handling infected material from the existing cases the er personnel had placed the new patient in one of the psychiatric cubicles there was a do not enter sign on the door marissa read the technicians chart he was a twentyfouryearold male by the name of alan moyers his temperature was after donning protective gown mask hat gloves and booties marissa entered the tiny room the patient stared at her with glazed eyes i understand youre not feeling too well said marissa i feel like ive been run over by a truck said alan ive never felt this bad even when i had the flu last year what was the first thing you noticed the headache said alan he tapped his fingers against the sides of his forehead right here is where i feel the pain its awful can you give me something for it what about chills yeah after the headache began i started to get them has anything abnormal happened to you in the lab in the last week or so like what asked alan closing his eyes i did win the pool on the last lakers game im more interested in something professional were you bitten by any animals nope i never handle any animals whats wrong with me how about dr richter do you know him sure everybody knows dr richter oh i remember something i stuck myself with a vacucontainer needle that never happened to me before do you remember the patients name on the vacucontainer no all i remember is that the guy didnt have aids i was worried about that so i looked up his diagnosis what was it didnt say but it always says aids if it is aids i dont have aids do i no alan you dont have aids said marissa thank god said alan for a moment there i was scared marissa went out to find dr navarre but he was occupied with a cardiac arrest that had just been brought in by ambulance marissa asked the nurse to tell him that she was going back to the fifth floor returning to the elevators marissa began organizing her thoughts to call dr dubchek excuse me marissa felt a tap on her arm and turned to face a stocky man with a beard and wirerimmed glasses are you dr blumenthal from the cdc asked the man nonplussed at being recognized marissa nodded the man stood blocking her entrance to the elevator im clarence herns with the la times my wife works the night shift up in the medical icu she told me that you were here to see dr richter what is it the man has at this point no one knows said marissa is it serious i imagine your wife can answer that as well as i she says the man is dying and that there are six other similar cases including a secretary from medical records sounds to me like the beginnings of an epidemic im not sure that epidemic is the right word there does seem to be one more case today but thats the only one for two days i hope it will be the last but no one knows sounds scary said the reporter i agree said marissa but i cant talk any longer im in a hurry dodging the insistent mr herns marissa boarded the next elevator and returned to the cubicle behind the fifthfloor nurses station and put through a collect call to dr dubchek it was quartertothree in atlanta and she got dubchek immediately so hows your first field assignment he asked its a bit overwhelming said marissa then as succinctly as she could she described the seven cases shed seen admitting that she had not learned anything that the richter clinic doctors didnt already know that shouldnt bother you said dubchek you have to keep in mind that an epidemiologist looks at data differently than a clinician so the same data can mean different things the clinician is looking at each case in particular whereas you are looking at the whole picture tell me about the illness marissa described the clinical syndrome referring frequently to her note pad she sensed that dubchek was particularly interested in the fact that two of the patients had vomited blood that another had passed bloody diarrhea and that three had conjunctival hemorrhages in their eyes when marissa said that dr richter had been to an ophthalmology meeting in africa dubchek exclaimed my god do you know what you are describing not exactly said marissa it was an old medicalschool ploy try to stay on neutral ground rather than make a fool of yourself viral hemorrhagic fever said dubchek and if it came from africa it would be lassa fever unless it was marburg or ebola jesus christ but richters visit was over six weeks ago darn said dubchek almost angrily the longest incubation period for that kind of fulminating illness is about two weeks even for quarantine purposes twenty days is considered adequate the doctor was also bitten by a monkey two days before he became ill offered marissa and thats too short an incubation period it should be five or six days wheres the monkey now quarantined said marissa good dont let anything happen to that animal particularly if it dies weve got to test it for virus if the animal is involved we have to consider the marburg virus in any case the illness certainly sounds like a viral hemorrhagic fever and until proven otherwise wed better consider it as such weve worried about something like this happening for some time the problem is that theres no vaccine and no treatment what about the mortality rate asked marissa high tell me does dr richter have a skin rash marissa couldnt remember ill check the first thing i want you to do is draw bloods obtain urine samples and do throat swabs for viral culture on all seven cases and have them rushed to the cdc use deltas smallpackage service that will be the fastest way i want you personally to draw the blood and for christs sake be careful from the monkey too if you can pack the samples in dry ice before shipping them ive just seen what might be another case said marissa one of the clinics lab techs include him too it sounds increasingly serious make sure that all the patients are totally isolated with complete barrier nursing and tell whoever is in charge not to do any lab work until i get there i have said marissa youre coming yourself you bet i am said dubchek this could be a national emergency but it is going to take some time to prepare the vickers mobile lab meanwhile start setting up a quarantine for contacts and try to get in touch with the people who sponsored that eye meeting in africa and see if any of the other doctors who went are ill and one other thing dont say anything to the press with all the publicity about aids i dont think the public could deal with the threat of another fatal viral disease there could be widespread panic and marissa i want you to wear full protective clothing including goggles when you see the patients the pathology department should have them if no one else does ill be there as soon as possible hanging up marissa experienced a rush of anxiety she wondered if shed already exposed herself to the virus then she worried about having already talked to clarence herns from the la times well what was done was done she was glad that dubchek was coming she knew shed been in over her head from the moment shed arrived in la after putting in a call for dr navarre marissa had one of the nurses help her get the materials ready to draw blood from the patients she needed vacucontainers with anticoagulants plastic bags and sodium hypochlorite to decontaminate the outside of the bags she also needed urine containers and throat swabs then she phoned the micro lab and asked to have containers of viral transport media sent up along with shipment containers and dry ice when dr navarre called she related what dubchek had said about complete barrier nursing and about no lab tests until hed arrived with a special facility she also mentioned that they had better get together to talk about systematically quarantining all contacts dr navarre agreed shocked to hear that dubchek thought they might be dealing with viral hemorrhagic fever following dubcheks advice marissa got goggles from pathology shed never thought about catching an illness through her eyes but she was aware that their surface was a mucous membrane and was obviously as available to viral assault as her nasal mucosa when she was fully attired in hood goggles mask gown gloves and booties she went to dr richters cubicle to begin her sampling before she started she examined him for a skin rash his arms were clear but he did have a curious red area about the size of a quarter on his right thigh lifting up his hospital gown marissa noted a fine but definite maculopapular eruption covering most of his trunk she was impressed that dubchek had anticipated it she drew the blood first then filled the urine container from the catheter bag after each was sealed she washed its exterior with sodium hypochlorite then put it in a second bag after the exterior of the second bag was washed in the disinfectant she allowed it to be removed from the room disposing of the hood mask gown gloves and booties and then donning new ones marissa went on to the next patient the medical secretary whose name was helen townsend marissa repeated the same procedures shed done on dr richter including looking for skin eruptions helen also had a faint rash on her trunk but no red circle on her thigh or elsewhere she seemed less ill than richter but none of the patients appeared well enough to question marissa much as she went about her sampling only alan moyers could muster the strength to offer some objections at first he refused to allow marissa to draw blood unless she told him what his diagnosis was he was terrified when marissa told him the truth that she did not know what he had and that that was why she needed the samples he finally gave in as for the monkey marissa didnt even attempt to get a blood sample the animal keeper was out for the day and she had no intention of trying to handle the animal alone the monkey looked healthy enough but was not friendly he threw feces at marissa through the mesh of his cage once marissa completed the packing making certain that all the screw caps were tightly in place so that carbon dioxide from the dry ice could not penetrate the samples she personally rode out to the airport and sent the boxes on their way to atlanta luckily she got them on a convenient nonstop back at the richter clinic marissa made a detour to the small clinic library there were a few standard texts there that included sections on viral diseases she quickly scanned the entries for lassa fever marburg and ebola virus then she understood dubcheks excited reaction on the telephone these were the most deadly viruses known to man arriving back on the fifth floor marissa found that all eight patients had been isolated in a separate wing she also found that the clinic outpatient records shed ordered had arrived after putting in a call for dr navarre marissa sat down and began to study the charts the first belonged to harold stevens the real estate broker she started from the back and immediately discovered that the last outpatient entry was a visit to dr richter harold stevens had chronic openangle glaucoma and saw dr richter on a regular basis his last checkup had been on january four days before he was admitted to the hospital with a sense of growing certainty marissa looked at the last entry on each chart there it was each patient had seen dr richter on either the fifteenth or the sixteenth of january all except helen townsend the secretary from medical records and alan the lab tech the last entry in ms townsends outpatient file recorded a visit to an obgyn man for cystitis alan had seen an orthopod the previous year for a sprained ankle hed suffered in a hospital basketball league except for the medical secretary and the lab tech there was the strong suggestion that dr richter was the source of the illness the fact that hed seen five of the patients just before he developed symptoms had to be significant marissa could explain the lab tech getting the illness by his sticking himself with a contaminated needle but she couldnt immediately explain helen townsend marissa had to assume that helen had seen dr richter sometime earlier in the week she had come down with the illness just fortyeight hours after the doctor maybe he had spent a lot of time in medical records earlier that week marissas musings were interrupted by the ward clerk who said that dr navarre had called to ask if marissa would kindly come down to the hospital conference room returning to the room where shed started the day reminded marissa of how long shed been working she felt bone weary as dr navarre closed the door and introduced the other person who was present he was william richter dr richters brother i wanted to thank you personally for being here said william although he was impeccably dressed in a pinstriped suit his haggard face was mute testimony to his lack of sleep dr navarre has told me your tentative diagnosis i want to assure you that we will support your effort to contain this illness to the limits of our resources but we are also concerned about the negative impact the situation could have on our clinic i hope that you agree that no publicity would be the best publicity marissa felt mildly outraged when so many lives were at stake but dubchek himself had said essentially the same thing i understand your concern she said uncomfortably aware that she had already spoken to a reporter but i think we have to initiate further quarantine measures marissa went on to explain that they would have to separate the possible contacts into primary and secondary contacts primary contacts would be those people who had spoken with or touched one of the current eight patients secondary contacts would be anyone who had had contact with a primary contact my god said dr navarre were talking about thousands of people im afraid so said marissa were going to need all the manpower the clinic can spare well also tap the resources of the state health department well provide the manpower said mr richter id prefer to keep this inhouse but shouldnt we wait until we actually have a diagnosis if we wait it may be too late said marissa we can always call off the quarantine if it is unnecessary theres no way well keep this from the press moaned mr richter to be truthful said marissa i think the press can play a positive role by helping us reach all the contacts primary contacts must be instructed to stay as isolated as possible for a week and to take their temperatures twice a day if they run a fever of or over theyll have to come to the clinic secondary contacts can go about their business but should still take their temperatures once a day marissa stood up and stretched when dr dubchek arrives he may have some suggestions but i believe what ive outlined is standard cdc procedure ill leave its implementation up to the richter clinic my job is to try to find out where the virus originated leaving two stunned men in her wake marissa left the conference room passing from the hospital to the clinic building she approached the clinic information booth asking directions to dr richters office it was on the second floor and marissa went directly up the door was closed but unlocked marissa knocked and entered dr richters receptionist was dutifully behind her desk apparently she hadnt expected company because she quickly stubbed out a cigarette and put the ashtray in one of the desk drawers can i help you she asked she was fiftyish with silvergray tightly permed hair her name tag said miss cavanagh reading glasses perched on the very end of her nose their temple pieces connected by a gold chain that went around her neck marissa explained who she was adding its important that i try to determine how dr richter contracted his illness to do that i want to reconstruct his schedule for a week or two prior to his getting sick could you do that for me im going to ask his wife to do the same i suppose i could said miss cavanagh did anything out of the ordinary happen that you can recall like what asked miss cavanagh with a blank face like his being bitten by a monkey or getting mugged in the parking garage marissas voice had a sharp edge to it those things did happen said miss cavanagh i realize that said marissa how about anything else odd or different i cant think of anything at the moment wait he did dent his car okay thats the idea encouraged marissa keep thinking and by the way did you make the arrangements for his african medical meeting yes how about the san diego meeting that too i would like to have the phone numbers of the sponsoring organizations if you could look them up for me id appreciate it also id like to have a list of all the patients dr richter saw during the two weeks before his illness and finally do you know helen townsend miss cavanagh took her glasses off her nose and let them hang on their chain she sighed disapprovingly does helen townsend have the same illness as dr richter we believe she does said marissa watching miss cavanaghs face the receptionist knew something about helen townsend but she seemed reluctant to speak toying with the keys of her typewriter was helen townsend a patient of dr richters marissa prodded miss cavanagh looked up no she was his mistress i warned him about her and there she gave him some disease he should have listened to me do you know if he saw her just before he got sick yes the day before marissa stared at the woman helen townsend didnt give dr richter the disease it was the other way around but she didnt say anything it all fit into place she could now relate all the known cases to dr richter epidemiologically that was extremely important it meant that dr richter was an index case and that he and only he had been exposed to the unknown reservoir of the virus now it was even more important for her to reconstruct the mans schedule in minute detail marissa asked miss cavanagh to start working on an outline of dr richters schedule for the last two weeks she told the woman that shed be back but if needed she could be paged through the hospital operator can i ask you a question said miss cavanagh timidly of course said marissa with a hand on the door is there a chance i might get ill marissa had been suppressing the thought because she didnt want to frighten the woman but she could not lie after all the secretary would have to be considered a primary contact its possible said marissa we will be asking you to restrict some of your activities during the next week or so and id advise you to check your temperature twice a day personally however i think you will be fine since you havent experienced any symptoms so far back at the hospital marissa fought off her own fears and her developing fatigue she had too much to do she had to go over the clinic charts in detail she hoped to find a reason why some of dr richters patients had gotten the disease and others hadnt also marissa wanted to call dr richters wife between the wife and the secretary she hoped she could construct a reasonably complete diary of the mans activities during the two weeks before he became ill returning to the fifth floor marissa ran into dr navarre he looked as tired as marissa felt dr richters condition is deteriorating he said hes bleeding from everywhere injection sites gums gi tract hes on the brink of kidney failure and his blood pressure is way down the interferon we gave him had no effect whatsoever and none of us knows what else to try what about helen townsend asked marissa shes worse too said dr navarre shes also starting to bleed he sat down heavily marissa hesitated for a minute and then reached for the phone she placed another collect call to atlanta hoping dubchek was already on his way unfortunately he wasnt he came on the line things are pretty bad here reported marissa two patients are experiencing significant hemorrhagic symptoms clinically it is looking more and more like viral hemorrhagic fever and no one knows what to do for these people theres little that can be done said dubchek they can try heparinization otherwise supportive therapythats about it when we make a specific diagnosis we may be able to use hyperimmune serum if it is available on that track weve already got your samples and tad has begun processing them when will you be coming asked marissa shortly said dubchek weve got the vickers mobile isolation lab all packed marissa woke up with a start thankfully no one had come into the little room behind the nurses station she looked at her watch it was tenfifteen at night shed only been asleep for five or ten minutes getting to her feet she felt dizzy her head ached and she had the beginnings of a sore throat she prayed that her symptoms were a product of exhaustion and not the beginnings of viral hemorrhagic fever it had been a busy evening four more cases had presented themselves in the er all complaining of severe headache high fever and vomiting one already had hemorrhagic signs the patients were all family members of the previous victims underlining the need for strict quarantine the virus was already into the third generation marissa had prepared viral samples and had them shipped to atlanta by an overnight carrier recognizing that she was at the limit of her strength marissa decided to go back to her motel she was just leaving when the floor nurse said dr richters wife was able to see her realizing it would be cruel to put her off marissa met her in the visitors lounge anna richter a welldressed attractive woman in her late thirties did her best to fill in her husbands schedule over the past two weeks but she was desperately upset not just alarmed about her husband but fearful for their two young children as well marissa was reluctant to press her for too much detail mrs richter promised to provide a more complete chronology the next day marissa walked her to the doctors bmw then she found her own car and drove to the tropic motel where she fell directly into bed january arriving at the clinic the next morning marissa was surprised to see a number of tv trucks pulled up to the hospital entrance with their transmission antennae raised against the morning sky when she tried to enter through the parking garage she was stopped by a policeman and had to show her cdc identification quarantine the policeman explained and told her to enter the clinic through the main hospital entrance where the tv trucks were located marissa obeyed wondering what had been happening during the sixplus hours shed been away tv cables snaked their way along the floor to the conference room and she was amazed at the level of activity in the main corridor spotting dr navarre she asked him what was going on your people have scheduled a news conference he explained his face was haggard and unshaven and it seemed obvious he had not been to bed he took a newspaper from under his arm and showed it to marissa a new aids epidemic shouted the headline the article was illustrated with a photo of marissa talking with clarence herns dr dubchek felt that such a misconception could not be allowed to continue said dr navarre marissa groaned the reporter approached me right after id arrived i really didnt tell him anything it doesnt matter said dr navarre patting her gently on the shoulder dr richter died during the night and with the four new cases there was no way this could have been kept from the media when did dr dubchek arrive asked marissa getting out of the way of a camera crew headed into the conference room a little after midnight said dr navarre why the police asked marissa noticing a second uniformed officer standing by the doors leading to the hospital after dr richter died patients started signing themselves out of the hospital until the state commissioner of health issued an order placing the whole building under quarantine marissa excused herself and made her way through a throng of press and tv people outside the conference room she was glad dubchek had arrived to take charge but wondered why he hadnt gotten in touch with her when she entered the room dubchek was just about to start speaking he handled himself well his calm nononsense manner quieted the room immediately he began by introducing himself and the other doctors from the cdc there was dr mark vreeland chief of medical epidemiology dr pierce abbott director of the department of virology dr clark layne director of the hospital infectious disease program and dr paul eckenstein director of the center for infectious disease dubchek then went on to downplay the incident saying that the problem was not a new aids epidemic by any stretch of the imagination he said that the california state epidemiologist had requested help from the cdc to look into a few cases of unexplained illness thought to be of viral origin looking at reporters eager for copy marissa could tell they were not buying dubcheks calm assessment the idea of a new unknown and frightening viral illness made for exciting news dubchek continued by saying that there had only been a total of sixteen cases and that he thought the problem was under control he pointed to dr layne and announced that he would be overseeing the quarantine efforts and added that experience proved this kind of illness could be controlled by strict hospital isolation at this clarence herns jumped up asking did dr richter bring this virus back from his african conference we dont know said dubchek it is a possibility but doubtful the incubation period would be too long since dr richter returned from africa over a month ago the incubation period for this kind of illness is usually about a week another reporter got to her feet if the incubation period for aids can be five years how can you limit it here to less than a month thats exactly the point said dubchek his patience wearing thin the aids virus is totally different from our current problem it is essential that the media understand this point and communicate it to the public have you isolated the new virus asked another reporter not yet admitted dubchek but we do not expect to have any difficulty again thats because it is a very different virus from aids it should only take a week or so to culture it if the virus has not been isolated continued the same reporter how can you say that it is different from the aids virus dubchek stared at the man marissa could sense the doctors frustration calmly he said over the years weve come to realize that totally different clinical syndromes are caused by totally different microorganisms now that is all for today but we will keep you informed thank you for coming at this early hour the conference room erupted as each reporter tried to get one more question answered dubchek ignored them as he and the other doctors made their exit marissa tried to push through the crowd but couldnt outside the conference room the uniformed policeman kept the reporters from entering the hospital proper after showing her cdc identity card marissa was allowed to pass she caught up to dubchek at the elevators there you are said dubchek his dark eyes lighting up his voice was friendly as he introduced marissa to the other men i didnt know so many of you were coming she said as they boarded the elevator we didnt have much choice said dr layne dr abbott nodded despite cyrills comments at the news conference this outbreak is extraordinarily serious an appearance of african viral hemorrhagic fever in the developed world has been a nightmare weve lived with since the illness first surfaced if it proves to be african viral hemorrhagic fever added dr eckenstein im convinced said dr vreeland and i think the monkey will turn out to be the culprit i didnt get samples from the monkey admitted marissa quickly thats okay said dubchek we sacrificed the animal last night and sent specimens back to the center liver and spleen sections will be far better than blood they arrived on the fifth floor where two technicians from the cdc were busy running samples in the vickers mobile isolation lab im sorry about that la times article said marissa when she could speak to dubchek alone the reporter approached me when i first entered the hospital no matter said dubchek just dont let it happen again he smiled and winked marissa had no idea what the wink meant nor the smile for that matter why didnt you call me when you arrived she asked i knew youd be exhausted explained dubchek there really wasnt any need we spent most of the night getting the lab set up autopsying the monkey and just getting oriented we also improved the isolation situation by having fans installed nonetheless you are to be congratulated i think you did a fine job getting this affair underway for the moment im buried in administrative detail continued dubchek but i do want to hear what youve learned maybe you and i could have dinner tonight ive gotten you a room at the hotel where we are staying im sure its better than the tropic motel theres nothing wrong with the tropic said marissa she felt an odd twinge of discomfort as if her intuition were trying to tell her something marissa went back to her small room behind the nurses station and began to catch up on her own paperwork first she phoned the sponsoring organizations for the two medical meetings dr richter had attended she told them that she needed to know if any of the other attendees had become ill with a viral disease then gritting her teeth at the cruelty of her next call she dialed dr richters home number and asked if she could pick up the diary mrs richter had promised her the night before the neighbor who answered the phone seemed appalled by her request but after checking with the widow told marissa to come over in half an hour marissa drove up to the beautifully landscaped house and nervously rang the bell the same neighbor answered and rather angrily directed marissa to the living room anna richter appeared a few minutes later she seemed to have aged ten years overnight her face was pale and her hair which had been so carefully curled the night before hung about her face in lank strands the neighbor helped her to a chair and marissa was amazed to see that she was anxiously folding and unfolding some lined papers that seemed to contain the requested list of her husbands activities over the last weeks knowing what a strain the woman must have been under marissa didnt know what to say but anna simply handed her the sheets saying i couldnt sleep last night anyway and maybe this will help some other poor family her eyes filled with tears he was such a good man a good father my poor children despite knowing of his affair with helen townsend marissa decided that dr richter must have been a pretty good husband annas grief seemed real and marissa left her as soon as she politely could the notes that she read before starting the car were surprisingly detailed put together with a further interview with miss cavanagh and the doctors appointment book marissa felt they would give her as good a picture of richters last few weeks as anyone could get back at the hospital marissa made a separate sheet of paper for each day of january and listed richters activities one fact she discovered was that he had complained to miss cavanagh about an aids patient named meterko who was suffering from an undiagnosed retinal disorder it sounded like something marissa should look into in the afternoon the phone in marissas cubicle rang picking it up she was startled to hear tad schockleys voice the connection was so good that for a moment she thought he was there in la nope said tad responding to her question im still here in atlanta but i need to speak to dubchek the hospital operator seemed to think that you might know where he was if hes not in the cdc room then i guess hes gone to his hotel apparently they were up all last night well ill try the hotel but in case i dont get him could you give him a message of course said marissa its not good news straightening up marissa pressed the phone to her ear is it personal no said tad with a short laugh its about the virus you people are dealing with the samples you sent were great especially dr richters his blood was loaded with virusmore than a billion per milliliter all i had to do was spin it down fix it and look at it with the electron microscope could you tell what it was asked marissa absolutely said tad excitedly there are only two viruses that look like this and it tested positive with indirect fluorescene antibody for ebola dr richter has ebola hemorrhagic fever had said marissa mildly offended by tads callous enthusiasm did the man die asked tad last night said marissa its not surprising the illness has a ninety percent plus fatality rate my god exclaimed marissa that must make it the deadliest virus known some people might give rabies that dubious honor said tad but personally i think it is ebola one of the problems is that almost nothing is known about this illness because there has been so little experience except for a couple of outbreaks in africa its an unknown entity youre going to have your work cut out for you trying to explain how it popped up in los angeles maybe not said marissa dr richter had been bitten just prior to his illness by a monkey that had come from africa dr vreeland is pretty sure the monkey was the source hes probably right agreed tad monkeys were responsible for an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in the virus was named marburg after the town in germany where it occurred the virus looks a lot like ebola well soon know said marissa now its up to you hepatic and splenic sections from the monkey are on the way id appreciate it if youd check them right away and let me know my pleasure said tad meanwhile im going to start work on the ebola virus and see how easily i can culture it i want to figure out what strain it is let dubchek and the others know theyre dealing with ebola if nothing else it will make them super careful ill talk with you soon take care leaving the cubicle marissa stepped across the hall and peered into the cdc room it was deserted going into the neighboring room she asked the technicians where everyone was they told her that some of the doctors were down in pathology since two more of the patients had died and some were in the er admitting several new cases dr dubchek had gone back to the hotel marissa told the technicians that they were dealing with ebola she left it to them to pass the bad news to the others then she went back to her paperwork the beverly hilton was just as dubchek had described it was certainly nicer than the seedy tropic motel and it was closer to the richter clinic but it still seemed like unnecessary effort to marissa as she plodded after the bellman down the eighthfloor corridor to her room the bellman turned on all the lights while she waited at the door she gave him a dollar and he left shed never unpacked at the tropic so the move wasnt difficult yet she wouldnt have made it if dubchek hadnt insisted hed called her that afternoon several hours after shed talked with tad shed been afraid to call him thinking that shed awaken him as soon as he was on the line she told him tads news about the outbreak being ebola hemorrhagic fever but he took it in stride almost as if hed expected it he then had given her directions to the hotel and told her that she merely had to pick up the key for since she was already registered and he had told her that theyd eat at seventhirty if that was all right with her and that she should just come to his room which was conveniently located a few doors from hers he said hed order up so they could go over her notes while they ate as she eyed the bed marissas exhaustion cried for attention but it was already after seven getting her cosmetics bag from her suitcase she went into the bathroom after washing brushing out her hair and touching up her makeup marissa was ready from her briefcase she removed the sheets of information concerning dr richters activities before hed become ill clutching them to her she walked down to dubcheks door and knocked he answered her knock and smiling motioned for her to come in he was on the phone apparently talking to tad marissa sat down and tried to follow the conversation it seemed the samples from the monkey had arrived and they had tested clear you mean the electron microscopy showed no virus at all said dubchek there was a long silence as tad relayed the details of the outcomes of the various tests looking at her watch marissa calculated that it was almost eleven in atlanta tad was certainly putting in overtime she watched dubchek realizing the man had a disturbing effect on her she recalled how unnerved shed been when hed turned up at ralphs dinner party and was upset to find herself inexplicably attracted to him now from time to time he looked up and her glance was trapped by an unexpected glint in his dark eyes hed removed his jacket and tie and a v of tanned skin was visible at the base of his neck finally he hung up the phone and walked over to her gazing down at her youre certainly the bestlooking thing ive seen today and i gather your friend tad would agree he seemed very concerned that you dont put yourself at risk certainly im in no more danger than anyone else involved in this she said vaguely annoyed at the turn the conversation was taking dubchek grinned i guess tad doesnt feel the rest of the staff is as cute trying to turn the talk to professional matters marissa asked about the monkeys liver and spleen sections clean so far said dubchek with a wave of his hand but that was only by electron microscopy tad has also planted the usual viral cultures well know more in a week in the meantime said marissa wed better look elsewhere i suppose so said dubchek he seemed distracted he ran a hand over his eyes as he sat down across from her leaning forward marissa handed over her notes i thought that you might be interested in looking at these dubchek accepted the papers and glanced through them while marissa talked in a chronological fashion marissa described what shed been doing since her arrival in la she made a convincing argument that dr richter was the index case and that he was the source of the ebola spreading the disease to some of his patients she explained his relationship to helen townsend and then described the two medical meetings that dr richter had attended the sponsoring organizations were sending complete lists of the attendees with their addresses and phone numbers she added throughout her monologue dubchek nodded to indicate that he was listening but somehow he seemed distracted concentrating more on her face than on what she was saying with so little feedback marissa trailed off and stopped speaking wondering if she were making some fundamental professional error after a sigh dubchek smiled good job he said simply its hard to believe that this is your first field assignment he stood up at the sound of a knock on the door thank goodness that must be dinner im starved the meal itself was mediocre the meat and vegetables dubchek had ordered were lukewarm marissa wondered why they couldnt have gone down to the dining room shed thought that hed intended to talk business but as they ate the conversation ranged from ralphs dinner party and how she came to know him to the cdc and whether or not she was enjoying her assignment toward the end of the meal dubchek suddenly said i wanted to tell you that i am a widower im sorry to hear that said marissa sincerely wondering why the man was bothering to inform her about his personal life i just thought you should know he added as if reading her mind my wife died two years ago in an auto accident marissa nodded once again uncertain how to reply what about you asked dubchek are you seeing anyone marissa paused toying with the handle of her coffee cup she had no intention of discussing her breakup with roger no not at the moment she managed to tell him she wondered if dubchek knew that she had been dating tad it had not been a secret but it wasnt public knowledge either neither of them had told people at the lab suddenly marissa felt even more uncomfortable her policy of not mixing her personal and professional lives was being violated she felt looking over at dubchek she couldnt help but acknowledge that she found him attractive perhaps that was why he made her feel so uncomfortable but there was no way she was interested in a more personal relationship with him if that was what this was leading up to all at once she wanted to get out of his room and return to her work dubchek pushed back his chair and stood up if were going back to the clinic maybe we should be on our way that sounded good to marissa she stood up and went over to the coffee table to pick up her papers as she straightened up she realized that dubchek had come up behind her before she could react he put his hands on her shoulders and turned her around the action so surprised her that she stood frozen for a brief moment their lips met then she pulled away her papers dropping to the floor im sorry he said i wasnt planning that at all but ever since you arrived at cdc ive been tempted to do that god knows i dont believe in dating anyone i work with but its the first time since my wife died that ive really been interested in a woman you dont look like her at alljane was tall and blondbut you have that same enthusiasm for your work she was a musician and when she played well she had the same excited expression ive seen you get marissa was silent she knew she was being mean that dubchek certainly had not been harassing her but she felt embarrassed and awkward and was unwilling to say something to ease over the incident marissa he said gently im telling you that id like to take you out when we get back to atlanta but if youre involved with ralph or just dont want to his voice trailed off marissa bent down and gathered up her notes if were going back to the hospital wed better go now she said curtly he stiffly followed her out the door to the elevator later sitting silently in her rentacar marissa berated herself cyrill was the most attractive man shed met since roger why had she behaved so unreasonably february almost five weeks later as the taxi bringing her home from the airport turned onto peachtree place marissa was wondering if she would be able to reestablish a pleasant professional relationship with dubchek now that they were both back in atlanta he had left a few days after their exchange at the beverly hilton and the few meetings theyd had at the richter clinic had been curt and awkward watching the lighted windows as the cab drove down her street seeing the warm family scenes inside she was overcome with a wave of loneliness after paying the driver and turning off the alarm marissa hustled over to the judsons and retrieved taffy and five weeks worth of mail the dog was ecstatic to see her and the judsons couldnt have been nicer rather than making marissa feel guilty about being gone for so long they acted truly sad to see taffy leave back in her own house marissa turned up the heat to a comfortable level having a puppy there made all the difference in the world the dog wouldnt leave her side and demanded almost constant attention thinking about supper she opened the refrigerator only to discover that some food had gone bad she shut the door deciding to tackle the job of cleaning it out the next day she dined on fig newtons and coke as she leafed through her mail aside from a card from one of her brothers and a letter from her parents it was mostly pharmaceutical junk marissa was startled when the phone rang but when she picked up the receiver she was pleased to hear tads voice welcoming her home to atlanta how about going out for a drink he asked i can pop over and pick you up marissas first response was to say that she was exhausted after her trip but then she remembered on her last call from la hed told her he had finished his current aids project and was hard at work on what he called marissas ebola virus suddenly feeling less tired she asked how those tests were going fine said tad the stuff grows like wildfire in the vero tissue cultures the morphology portion of the study is already complete and ive started the protein analysis im really interested in seeing what youre doing said marissa ill be happy to show you what i can said tad unfortunately a majority of the work is done inside the maximum containment lab id assumed as much said marissa she knew that the only way such a deadly virus could be handled was in a facility that did just what its name suggestedcontained the microorganisms as far as marissa knew there were only four such facilities in the worldone at the cdc one in england one in belgium and one in the soviet union she didnt know if the pasteur institute in paris had one or not for safety reasons entry was restricted to a few authorized individuals at that time marissa was not one of them yet having witnessed ebolas devastating potential she told tad that she was really eager to see his studies you dont have clearance said tad surprised by what seemed to him her naivet√© i know said marissa but what could be so terrible about showing me what youre doing with the ebola in the lab right now and then going out for a drink after all its late no one will know if you take me now there was a pause but entry is restricted said tad plaintively marissa was fully aware that she was being manipulative but there was certainly no danger to anyone if she were to go in with tad whos to know she asked coaxingly besides i am part of the team i guess so tad agreed reluctantly it was obvious that he was wavering the fact that marissa would only see him if he took her into the lab seemed to force his decision he told her that hed pick her up in half an hour and that she wasnt to breathe a word to anyone else marissa readily agreed im not so sure about this admitted tad as he and marissa drove toward the cdc relax said marissa im an eis officer assigned to special pathogens for goodness sakes purposefully marissa pretended to be a little irritated but we could ask for your clearance tomorrow suggested tad marissa turned toward her friend are you chickening out she demanded it was true that dubchek was due back from a trip to washington the next day and that a formal request could be made but marissa had her doubts about what his response would be she felt that dubchek had been unreasonably cold over the last few weeks even if her own stupidity had been the cause why she hadnt had the nerve to apologize or even say shed like to see him one evening she didnt know but with every day that passed the coolness between them particularly on his side increased tad pulled into the parking lot and they walked in silence to the main entrance marissa mused about mens egos and how much trouble they caused they signed in under the watchful eyes of the security guard and dutifully displayed their cdc identity cards under the heading destination marissa wrote office they waited for the elevator and went up three floors after walking the length of the main building they went through an outside door to a wireenclosed catwalk that connected the main building to the virology labs all the buildings of the center were connected on most floors by similar walkways security is tight for the maximum containment lab said tad as he opened the door to the virology building we store every pathological virus known to man all of them asked marissa obviously awed just about said tad like a proud father what about ebola she asked we have ebola samples from every one of the previous outbreaks weve got marburg smallpox which otherwise is extinct polio yellow fever dengue aids you name it weve got it god exclaimed marissa a menagerie of horrors i guess you could say that how are they stored she asked frozen with liquid nitrogen are they infective asked marissa just have to thaw them out they were walking down an ordinary hall past a myriad of small dark offices marissa had previously been in this portion of the building when shed come to dubcheks office tad stopped in front of a walkin freezer like the kind seen in a butcher shop you might find this interesting he said as he pulled open the heavy door a light was on inside timidly marissa stepped over the threshold into the cold moist air tad was behind her she felt a thrill of fear as the door swung shut and latched with a click the interior of the freezer was lined with shelves holding tiny vials hundreds of thousands of them what is this asked marissa frozen sera said tad picking up one of the vials which had a number and a date written on it samples from patients all over the world with every known viral disease and a lot of unknown ones theyre here for immunological study and obviously are not infective marissa was still glad when they returned to the hallway about fifty feet beyond the walkin freezer the hall turned sharply to the right and as they rounded the corner they were confronted by a massive steel door just above the doorknob was a grid of push buttons similar to marissas alarm system below that was a slot like the opening for a credit card at an automatic bank teller tad showed marissa a card that he had around his neck on a leather thong he inserted it into the slot the computer is recording the entry he said then he tapped out his code number on the push button plate good measurements he quipped thank you said marissa laughing tad joined in since the virology building had been deserted he seemed more relaxed after a short delay there was a mechanical click as the bolt released tad pulled open the door marissa felt as if she had entered another world instead of the drab cluttered hallway in the outer part of the building she found herself surrounded by a recently constructed complex of colorcoded pipes gauges and other futuristic paraphernalia the lighting was dim until tad opened a cabinet door exposing a row of circuit breakers he threw them in order the first turned on the lights in the room in which they were standing it was almost two stories tall and was filled with all sorts of equipment there was a slight odor of phenolic disinfectant a smell that reminded marissa of the autopsy room at her medical school the next circuit breaker lit up a row of portholelike windows that lined the sides of a tenfoothigh cylinder that protruded into the room at the end of the cylinder was an oval door like the watertight hatch on a submarine the final circuit breaker caused a whirring noise as some kind of large electrical machinery went into gear compressors said tad in response to marissas questioning look he didnt elaborate instead with a sweep of his hand he said this is the control and staging area for the maximum containment lab from here we can monitor all the fans and filters even the gammaray generators notice all the green lights that means that everything is working as it is supposed to be at least hopefully what do you mean hopefully asked marissa somewhat alarmed then she saw tads smile and knew he was teasing her still she suddenly wasnt one hundred percent sure she wanted to go through with the visit it had seemed like such a good idea when shed been in the safety of her home now surrounded by all this alien equipment and knowing what kinds of viruses were inside she wasnt so certain but tad didnt give her time to change her mind he opened the airtight door and motioned for marissa to go inside marissa had to duck her head slightly while stepping over the sixinchhigh threshold tad followed her then closed and bolted the door a feeling of claustrophobia almost overwhelmed her especially when she had to swallow to clear her ears due to the pressure change the cylinder was lined with the portholelike windows marissa had seen from the outer room along both sides were benches and upright lockers at the far end were shelves and another oval airtight door surprise said tad as he tossed marissa some cotton suits no street clothes allowed after a moments hesitation during which time marissa vainly glanced around for a modicum of privacy she began unbuttoning her blouse as embarrassed as she was to be stripping down to her underwear in front of tad he seemed more selfconscious than she he made a big production of facing away from her while she changed they then went through a second door each room that we enter as we go into the lab is more negative in terms of pressure than the last that ensures that the only movement of air will be into the lab not out the second room was about the size of the first but with no windows the smell of the phenolic disinfectant was more pronounced a number of large blue plastic suits hung on pegs tad searched until he found one he thought would fit marissa she took it from his outstretched hand it was like a space suit without a backpack or a heavy bubble helmet like a space suit it covered the entire body complete with gloves and booties the part that covered the head was faced with clear plastic the suit sealed with a zipper that ran from the pubic area to the base of the throat issuing from the back like a long tail was an air hose tad pointed out green piping that ran along the sides of the room at chest height saying that the entire lab was laced with such pipes at frequent intervals were rectangular lime green manifolds with adapters to take the air hoses from the suits tad explained that the suits were filled with clean positivepressure air so that the air in the lab itself was never breathed he rehearsed with marissa the process of attaching and detaching the air hose until he was convinced she felt secure okay time to suit up said tad as he showed marissa how to start working her way into the bulky garment the process was complicated particularly getting her head inside the closed hood as she looked out through the clear plastic face mask it fogged immediately tad told her to attach her air hose and instantly marissa felt the fresh air cool her body and clear the face piece tad zipped up the front of her suit and with practiced moves climbed into his own he inflated his suit then detached his air hose and carrying it in his hand moved down to the far door marissa did the same she had to waddle to walk to the right of the door was a panel interior lights for the lab explained tad as he threw the switches his voice was muffled by the suit it was difficult for her to understand especially with the hiss of the incoming air in the background they went through another airtight door which tad closed behind them the next room was half again smaller than the first two with walls and piping all covered with a white chalky substance the floor was covered with a plastic grate they attached their air hoses for a moment then they moved through a final door into the lab itself marissa followed close behind tad moving her air hose and connecting it where he did marissa was confronted by a large rectangular room with a central island of lab benches surmounted by protective exhaust hoods the walls were lined with all sorts of equipmentcentrifuges incubators various microscopes computer terminals and a host of things marissa did not recognize to the left there was also a bolted insulated door tad took marissa directly to one of the incubators and opened up the glass doors the tissue culture tubes were fitted into a slowly revolving tray tad lifted out one and handed it to marissa heres your ebola he said in addition to the small amount of fluid the tube contained it was coated on one side with a thin filma layer of living cells infected with the virus inside the cells the virus was forcing its own replication as innocent as the contents looked marissa understood that there was probably enough infectious virus to kill everyone in atlanta perhaps the united states marissa shuddered gripping the glass tube more tightly taking the tube tad walked over to one of the microscopes he positioned the airtight specimen adjusted the focus then stepped back so marissa could look see those darkened clumps in the cytoplasm he asked marissa nodded even through the plastic face mask it was easy to see the inclusion bodies tad described as well as the irregular cell nuclei thats the first sign of infestation said tad i just planted these cultures that virus is unbelievably potent after marissa straightened up from the microscope tad returned the tube to the incubator then he began to explain his complicated research pointing out some of the sophisticated equipment he was using and detailing his various experiments marissa had trouble concentrating she hadnt come to the lab that night to discuss tads work but she couldnt tell him that finally he led her down a passageway to a maze of animal cages that reached almost to the ceiling there were monkeys rabbits guinea pigs rats and mice marissa could see hundreds of eyes staring at her some listless some with fevered hatred in a far section of the room tad pulled out a tray of what he called swiss ice mice he was going to show them to marissa but he stopped my word he said i just inoculated these guys this afternoon and most have already died he looked at marissa your ebola is really deadlyas bad as the zaire strain marissa reluctantly glanced in at the dead mice is there some way to compare the various strains absolutely said tad removing the dead mice they went back to the main lab where tad searched for a tray for the tiny corpses he spoke while he moved responding to marissas question she found it hard to understand him when he wasnt standing directly in front of her the plastic suit gave his voice a hollow quality like darth vaders now that ive started to characterize your ebola he said it will be easy to compare it with the previous strains in fact ive begun with these mice but the results will have to wait for a statistical evaluation once he had the mice arranged on a dissecting tray tad stopped in front of the bolted insulated door i dont think you want to come in here without waiting for a response he opened the door and went inside with the dead mice a mist drifted out as the door swung back against his air hose marissa eyed the small opening steeling herself to follow but before she could act tad reappeared hastily shutting the door behind him you know im also planning to compare the structural polypeptides and viral rna of your virus against the previous ebola strains he said thats enough laughed marissa youre making me feel dumb ive got to get back to my virology textbook before making sense of all this why dont we call it a night and get that drink you promised me youre on said tad eagerly there was one surprise on the way out when they had returned to the room with chalky walls they were drenched by a shower of phenolic disinfectant looking at marissas shocked face tad grinned now you know what a toilet bowl feels like when they were changing into their street clothes marissa asked what was in the room where hed taken the dead mice just a large freezer he said waving off the question over the next four days marissa readjusted to life in atlanta enjoying her home and her dog on the day after her return shed tackled all the difficult jobs like cleaning out the rotten vegetables from the refrigerator and catching up on her overdue bills at work she threw herself into the study of viral hemorrhagic fever ebola in particular making use of the cdc library she obtained detailed material about the previous outbreaks of ebola zaire sudan zaire and sudan during each outbreak the virus appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared a great deal of effort was expended trying to determine what organism served as the reservoir for the virus over two hundred separate species of animals and insects were studied as potential hosts all were negative the only positive finding was some antibodies in an occasional domestic guinea pig marissa found the description of the first zairean outbreak particularly interesting transmission of the illness had been linked to a healthcare facility called the yambuku mission hospital she wondered what possible points of similarity existed between the yambuku mission and the richter clinic or for that matter between yambuku and los angeles there couldnt be very many she was sitting at a back table in the library reading again from fields virology she was studying up on tissue cultures as an aid to further practical work in the main virology lab tad had been helpful in setting her up with some relatively harmless viruses so that she could familiarize herself with the latest virology equipment marissa checked her watch it was a little after two at threefifteen she had an appointment with dr dubchek the day before shed given his secretary a formal request for permission to use the maximum containment lab outlining the experimental work she wanted to do on the communicability of the ebola virus marissa was not particularly sanguine about dubcheks response hed all but ignored her since her return from los angeles a shadow fell across her page and marissa automatically glanced up well well she is still alive said a familiar voice ralph whispered marissa shocked both by his unexpected presence in the cdc library and the loudness of his voice a number of heads turned toward them there were rumors she was alive but i had to see for myself continued ralph oblivious of mrs campbells glare marissa motioned for ralph to be silent then took his hand and led him into the hallway where they could talk she felt a surge of affection as she looked up at his welcoming smile its good to see you said marissa giving him a hug she felt a twinge of guilt for not having contacted him since returning to atlanta theyd talked on the phone about once a week during her stay in la as if reading her mind ralph said why havent you called me dubchek told me youve been back for four days i was going to call tonight she said lamely upset that ralph was getting information about her from dubchek they went down to the cdc cafeteria for coffee at that time of the afternoon the room was almost deserted and they sat by the window overlooking the courtyard ralph said he was en route between the hospital and his office and that he had wanted to catch her before the evening how about dinner he asked leaning forward and putting a hand on marissas im dying to hear the details of your triumph over ebola in la im not sure that twentyone deaths can be considered a triumph said marissa worse still from an epidemiologic point of view we failed we never found out where the virus came from theres got to be some kind of reservoir just imagine the media reaction if the cdc had been unable to trace the legionnaires bacteria to the airconditioning system i think you are being hard on yourself said ralph but we have no idea if and when ebola will appear again said marissa unfortunately i have a feeling it will and it is so unbelievably deadly marissa could remember too well its devastating course they couldnt figure out where ebola came from in africa either said ralph still trying to make her feel better marissa was impressed that ralph was aware of the fact and told him so tv he explained watching the nightly news these days gives one a medical education he squeezed marissas hand the reason you should consider your time in la successful is because you were able to contain what could have been an epidemic of horrible proportions marissa smiled she realized that ralph was trying to make her feel good and she appreciated the effort thank you she said youre right the outbreak could have been much worse and for a time we thought that it would be thank god it responded to the quarantine its a good thing because it carried better than a ninetyfour percent fatality rate with only two apparent survivors even the richter clinic seems to have become a victim it now has as bad a reputation because of ebola as the san francisco bathhouses have because of aids marissa glanced at the clock over the steam table it was after three i have a meeting in a few minutes she apologized you are a dear for stopping by and dinner tonight sounds wonderful dinner it will be said ralph picking up the tray with their empty cups marissa hurried up three flights of stairs and crossed to the virology building it didnt appear nearly as threatening in the daylight as it had at night turning toward dubcheks office marissa knew that just around the bend in the hallway was the steel door that led to the maximum containment lab it was seventeen after three when she stood in front of dubcheks secretary it was silly for her to have rushed as she sat across from the secretary flipping through virology times with its virusofthemonth centerfold marissa realized that of course dubchek would keep her waiting she glanced at her watch again twenty of four beyond the door she could hear dubchek on the telephone and from the telephone console on the secretarys desk she could see the little lights blink when hed hang up and make another call it was five of four when the door opened and dubchek motioned for marissa to come into his office the room was small and cluttered with reprinted articles stacked on the desk on the file cabinet and on the floor dubchek was in his shirtsleeves his tie tucked out of the way between the second and third button of his shirt there was no apology or explanation of why shed been kept waiting in fact there was a suggestion of a grin on his face that particularly galled marissa i trust that you received my letter she said studiously keeping her voice businesslike i did indeed said dubchek and said marissa after a pause a few days lab experience is not enough to work in the maximum containment lab said dubcheck what do you suggest asked marissa exactly what you are presently doing said dubchek continue working with lesspathogenic viruses until you gain sufficient experience how will i know when ive had enough experience marissa realized that cyrill had a point but she wondered if his answer would have been different had they been dating it bothered her even more that she didnt have the nerve to withdraw her earlier rebuff he was a handsome man one who attracted her far more than ralph whom she was happy enough to see for dinner i believe i will know when you have had adequate experience said dubchek interrupting her thoughts or tad schockley will marissa felt cheered if it were up to tad she was certain that she would eventually get the necessary authorization meanwhile said dubchek stepping around his desk and sitting down ive got something more important to talk with you about ive just been on the phone with a number of people including the missouri state epidemiologist they have a single case of a severe viral illness in st louis that they think might be ebola i want you to leave immediately assess the situation clinically send tad samples and report back heres your flight reservation he handed marissa a sheet of paper on it was written delta flight departure pm arrival pm marissa was stunned with rushhour traffic it was going to be a near thing she knew that as an eis officer she should always have a bag packed but she didnt and there was taffy to think of too well have the mobile lab ready if it is needed cyrill was saying but lets hope its not he extended his hand to wish her good luck but marissa was so preoccupied with the thought of possibly facing the deadly ebola virus in less than four hours that she walked out without noticing she felt dazed shed gone in hoping for permission to use the maximum containment lab and was leaving with orders to fly to st louis glancing at her watch she broke into a run it was going to be close march it was only as the plane taxied onto the runway that marissa remembered her date with ralph well she should touch down in time to catch him as soon as he got home her one small consolation was that she felt more comfortable professionally than she had en route to la at least she had some idea of what would be demanded of her personally however knowing this time how deadly the virus could be if indeed it was ebola marissa was more frightened at the thought of her own exposure although she hadnt mentioned it to anyone she still worried about contracting the disease from the first outbreak each day that passed without the appearance of suspicious symptoms had been a relief but the fear had never completely disappeared the other thought that troubled marissa was the idea of another ebola case appearing so quickly if it was ebola how did it get to st louis was it a separate outbreak from la or merely an extension of that one could a contact have brought it from la or could there be an ebola mary like the infamous typhoid mary there were many questions none of which made marissa cheerful will you want dinner tonight asked a cabin attendant breaking marissas train of thought sure said marissa dropping her tray table shed better eat whether she was hungry or not she knew that once she got to st louis she might not get the time as marissa climbed out of the taxi that had taken her from the st louis airport to the greater st louis community health plan hospital she was thankful for the elaborate concrete porte cochere it was pouring outside even with the overhead protection she pulled up the lapels of her coat to avoid winddriven rain as she ran for the revolving door she was carrying her suitcase as well as her briefcase since shed not taken the time to stop in her hotel the hospital appeared an impressive affair even on a dark rainy night it was constructed in a modern style with travertinemarble facing and fronted by a threestoriestall replica of the gateway arch the interior was mostly blond oak and bright red carpeting a pert receptionist directed marissa to the administration offices located through a pair of swinging doors dr blumenthal cried a diminutive oriental man jumping up from his desk she took a step backward as the man relieved her of her suitcase and enthusiastically pumped her freed hand im dr harold taboso he said im the medical director here and this is dr peter austin the missouri state epidemiologist weve been waiting for you marissa shook hands with dr austin a tall thin man with a ruddy complexion we are thankful that you could come so quickly said dr taboso can we get you something to eat or drink marissa shook her head thanking him for his hospitality i ate on the plane she explained besides id like to get directly to business of course of course said dr taboso for a moment he looked confused dr austin took advantage of his silence to take over were well aware of what happened in la and were concerned that we might be dealing with the same problem here as you know we admitted one suspicious case this morning and two more have arrived while you were en route marissa bit her lip she had been hoping that this would turn out to be a false alarm but with two more potential cases it was difficult to sustain such optimism she sank into the chair that dr taboso proffered and said youd better tell me what you have learned so far not much im afraid said dr austin there has been little time the first case was admitted around am dr taboso deserves credit for sounding the alarm as soon as he did the patient was immediately isolated hopefully minimizing contacts here at the hospital marissa glanced at dr taboso he smiled nervously accepting the compliment that was fortunate said marissa was any lab work done of course said dr taboso that could be a problem said marissa we understand said dr austin but it was ordered immediately on admittance before we had any suspicion of the diagnosis the moment my office was alerted we called the cdc have you been able to make any association with the la outbreak did any of the patients come from la no said dr austin we have inquired about such a possibility but there has been no connection that we could find well said marissa reluctantly getting to her feet lets see the patients i assume that you have full protective gear available of course said dr taboso as they filed out of the room they crossed the hospital lobby to the elevators riding up in the car marissa asked have any of the patients been to africa recently the other two doctors looked at each other dr taboso spoke i dont believe so marissa had not expected a positive answer that would have been too easy she watched the floor indicator the elevator stopped on eight as they walked down the corridor marissa realized that none of the rooms they were passing were occupied when she looked closer she realized that most werent even fully furnished and the walls of the hall had only been primed not painted dr taboso noticed marissas expression sorry he said i should have explained when the hospital was built too many beds were planned consequently the eighth floor was never completed but we decided to use it for this emergency good for isolation dont you agree they arrived at the nurses station which seemed complete except for the cabinetry marissa took the first patients chart she sat down at the desk and opened the metal cover noting the mans name zabriski the vitalsign page showed the familiar complex of high fever and low blood pressure the next page contained the patients history as marissas eyes ran down the sheet she caught the mans full name dr carl m zabriski raising her eyes to dr taboso she asked incredulously is the patient a physician im afraid so answered taboso hes an ophthalmologist here at the hospital turning to dr austin she asked did you know the index case in la was also a doctor in fact he was an ophthalmologist i was aware of the coincidence said dr austin frowning does dr zabriski do any research with monkeys asked marissa not that i know of answered dr taboso certainly not here at the hospital no other physicians were involved in the la outbreak that i can recall said dr austin no said marissa just the index case there were three lab techs and one nurse but no other doctors redirecting her attention to the chart marissa went through it rapidly the history was not nearly as complete as that done on dr richter at the richter clinic there were no references to recent travel or animal contact but the lab workup was impressive and although not all the tests were back those that were suggested severe liver and kidney involvement so far everything was consistent with ebola hemorrhagic fever after marissa finished with the chart she got together the materials necessary for drawing and packing viral samples when all was ready she went down the hall with one of the nurses to the isolation area there she donned hood mask gloves goggles and booties inside zabriskis room two other women were similarly attired one was a nurse the other a doctor how is the patient doing asked marissa as she moved alongside the bed it was a rhetorical question the patients condition was apparent the first thing marissa noticed was the rash over the mans trunk the second thing was signs of hemorrhage a nasogastric tube snaked out of the mans nostril and was filled with bright red blood dr zabriski was conscious but just barely he certainly couldnt answer any questions a short conversation with the attending physician confirmed marissas impressions the patient had been deteriorating throughout the day particularly during the last hour when they began to see a progressive fall in the blood pressure marissa had seen enough clinically the patient resembled dr richter to a horrifying degree until proven otherwise it had to be assumed that dr zabriski and the other two subsequent admissions had ebola hemorrhagic fever the nurse helped marissa obtain a nasal swab as well as blood and urine samples marissa handled them as shed done in la double bagging the material and disinfecting the outsides of the bags with sodium hypochlorite after removing her protective clothing and washing her hands she returned to the nurses station to call dubchek the phone conversation was short and to the point marissa said that it was her clinical impression that they were dealing with another ebola outbreak what about isolation theyve done a good job in that regard reported marissa well be there as soon as possible said dubchek probably tonight meanwhile i want you to stop all further lab work and supervise a thorough disinfection also have them set up the same kind of quarantine of contacts that we used in la marissa was about to reply when she realized that dubchek had hung up she sighed as she replaced the receiver such a wonderful working relationship well said marissa to drs taboso and austin lets get to work they quickly set the quarantine measures in motion arranging for the sterilization of the lab and assuring marissa that her samples would be sent overnight to the cdc as they left to attend to their tasks marissa asked for the charts on the other two patients the nurse whose name was pat handed them to her saying i dont know if dr taboso mentioned this but mrs zabriski is downstairs is she a patient asked marissa with alarm oh no said pat shes just insisting on staying at the hospital she wanted to be up here but dr taboso didnt think it was a good idea he told her to stay in the firstfloor lounge marissa put down the two new charts debating what she should do next she decided to see mrs zabriski since she had very few details with regard to the doctors recent schedule besides she had to stop by the lab to check the sterilization asking directions from pat marissa rode down to the second floor on the elevator en route she looked at the faces of the people next to her and guessed what their responses would be when they heard that there had been an ebola outbreak in the hospital when the doors opened on the second floor she was the only one who got off marissa expected to find the evening shift in the lab and was surprised to see that the director a pathologist by the name of dr arthur rand was still in his office even though it was after pm he was a pompous older man dressed in a plaid vest complete with a gold fob protruding from one of the pockets he was unimpressed that marissa had been sent by the cdc and his facial expression did not change when marissa said it was her clinical opinion that there was an outbreak of ebola in his hospital i was aware that was in the differential diagnosis the cdc has requested that no more lab tests be done on the involved patients marissa could tell that the man was not going to make it easy for her well be bringing in an isolation lab sometime tonight i suggest you communicate this to dr taboso said dr rand i have said marissa its also our opinion that the lab here should be disinfected in the outbreak in la three cases were traced to the lab id be willing to help if youd like i believe that we can handle our own cleanup said dr rand with a look that seemed to say do you think i was born yesterday im available if you need me said marissa as she turned and left shed done what she could on the first floor she made her way to a pleasant lounge with its own connecting chapel she was unsure how she would recognize mrs zabriski but it turned out she was the only person in the room mrs zabriski said marissa softly the woman raised her head she was in her late forties or early fifties with graystreaked hair her eyes were red rimmed it was obvious she had been crying im doctor blumenthal said marissa gently im sorry to bother you but i need to ask you some questions panic clouded the womans eyes is carl dead no said marissa hes going to die isnt he mrs zabriski said marissa wanting to avoid such a sensitive issue especially since she believed the womans intuition was correct marissa sat down next to her im not one of your husbands doctors im here to help find out what kind of illness he has and how he got it has he done any traveling over the last marissa was going to say three weeks but remembering dr richters trip to africa she said instead the last two months yes mrs zabriski said wearily he went to a medical meeting in san diego last month and about a week ago he went to boston san diego made marissa sit up straighter was that an eyelid surgery conference in san diego i believe so said mrs zabriski but judith carls secretary would know for sure marissas mind whirled zabriski had attended the same meeting as dr richter another coincidence the only problem was that the conference in question had been about six weeks previous about the same interval of time as from dr richters african trip to the appearance of his symptoms do you know what hotel your husband stayed in while he was in san diego asked marissa could it have been the coronado hotel i believe it was said mrs zabriski while marissas mind was busy recalling the central role played by a certain hotel in philadelphia during the legionnaires disease outbreak she asked about dr zabriskis trip to boston but his wife did not know why hed gone instead she gave marissa her husbands secretarys phone number saying again that judith would know that kind of thing marissa took the number and asked whether dr zabriski had been bitten by or had been around any monkeys recently no no said mrs zabriski at least none that she knew of marissa thanked the woman and apologized for bothering her armed with the secretarys home phone number she went to call judith marissa had to explain twice who she was and why she was calling so late before the secretary would cooperate judith then confirmed what mrs zabriski had told her namely that the doctor had stayed at the coronado hotel while in san diego that dr zabriski had not been bitten recently by any animal and as far as she knew that hed not been around any monkeys when marissa asked if dr zabriski knew dr richter the answer was that the name had never appeared on any correspondence or on his phone list judith said the reason that dr zabriski had gone to boston was to help plan the massachusetts eye and ear infirmarys upcoming alumni meeting she gave marissa the name and phone number of dr zabriskis colleague there as marissa wrote it down she wondered if zabriski had unknowingly transferred the virus to the boston area she decided that shed have to discuss that possibility with dubchek as she hung up marissa suddenly remembered that she hadnt called ralph from the airport he answered sleepily and marissa apologized both for waking him and for not getting in touch with him before she left atlanta after she explained what had happened ralph said that he would forgive her only if she promised to call him every couple of days to let him know what was going on marissa agreed returning to the isolation ward marissa went back to the charts the two later admissions were a carol montgomery and a dr brian cester both had come down with high fevers splitting headaches and violent abdominal cramps although the symptoms sounded nonspecific their intensity gave sufficient cause for alarm there was no reference to travel or animal contact in either chart after gathering the material necessary for taking viral samples marissa dressed in protective gear and visited carol montgomery the patient was a woman one year older than marissa marissa found it hard not to identify with her she was a lawyer who worked for one of the citys large corporate firms although she was lucid and able to talk it was apparent that she was gravely ill marissa asked if she had done any recent traveling the answer was no marissa asked if she knew dr zabriski carol said that she did dr zabriski was her ophthalmologist had she seen him recently the answer was yes shed gone to him four days ago marissa obtained the viral samples and left the room with a heavy heart she hated making a diagnosis of a disease with no available treatment the fact that shed been able to uncover information that mirrored the earlier outbreak was small compensation yet the information reminded her of a question that had troubled her in la why did some of dr richters patients catch the disease and others not after changing into fresh protective clothing marissa visited dr brian cester she asked the same questions and got the same replies except when she asked if he was one of dr zabriskis patients no said dr cester after a spasm of abdominal pain subsided ive never been to an ophthalmologist do you work with him asked marissa i occasionally give anesthesia for him said dr cester his face contorted again in pain when he recovered he said i play tennis with him more often than i work with him in fact i played with him just four days ago after obtaining her samples marissa left the man more confused than ever she had begun to think that fairly close contactparticularly with a mucous membranewas needed to communicate the disease playing tennis with someone did not seem to fit that mold after sending off the second set of viral samples marissa went back to dr zabriskis chart she read over the history in minute detail and began the same type of diary shed drawn up for dr richter she added what material shed learned from mrs zabriski and the secretary knowing that she would have to go back to both of them although such work had not resulted in determining the reservoir of the virus in the la outbreak marissa had hopes that by following the same procedure with dr zabriski she might find some common element in addition to both doctors having been to the same eye conference in san diego it was after twelve when dubchek vreeland and layne arrived marissa was relieved to see them particularly because dr zabriskis clinical condition had continued to deteriorate the doctor taking care of him had demanded some routine blood work be done to determine the state of the patients hydration and marissa had been caught between the conflicting demands of treating the patient and protecting the hospital she finally allowed those tests that could be done in the patients room after a cursory greeting the cdc doctors all but ignored marissa as they struggled to get the mobile isolation laboratory functioning and improve the isolation of the patients dr layne had some large exhaust fans brought in while dr vreeland immediately went down to the administration area to discuss improving the quarantine marissa went back to her charts but soon exhausted the information they could supply getting up she wandered to the isolation lab dubchek had removed his jacket and had rolled up his sleeves while he labored with the two cdc technicians some kind of electrical bug had developed in the automatic chemistry portion of the apparatus anything i can do called marissa not that i can think of said dubchek without looking up he immediately began conversing with one of the technicians suggesting they change the sensing electrodes i would like a minute to go over my findings with you called marissa eager to discuss the fact that dr zabriski had attended the same san diego medical meeting as dr richter had it will have to wait said dubchek coolly getting this lab functioning takes precedence over epidemiologic theories going back to the nurses station marissa seethed she did not expect or deserve dubcheks sarcasm if hed wanted to minimize her contribution he had succeeded sitting down at the desk marissa considered her options she could stay hoping he might allow her ten minutes at his convenience or she could go and get some sleep sleep won out she put her papers in her briefcase and went down to the first floor to rescue her suitcase the operator woke marissa at seven oclock as she showered and dressed she realized that her anger toward dubchek had dissipated after all he was under a lot of stress if ebola raged out of control it was his neck on the line not hers when she arrived back at the isolation ward one of the cdc lab techs told her that dubchek had gone back to the hotel at am he didnt know where either vreeland or layne was at the nurses station things were a bit chaotic five more patients had been admitted during the night with a presumptive diagnosis of ebola hemorrhagic fever marissa collected the charts but as she stacked them in order she realized that zabriskis was missing she asked the day nurse where it was dr zabriski died just after four this morning although shed expected it marissa was still upset unconsciously she had been hoping for a miracle she sat down and put her face in her hands after a moment she forced herself to go over the new charts it was easier to keep busy without meaning to she caught herself touching her neck for swelling there was an area of tenderness could it be a swollen lymph node she was pleased to be interrupted by dr layne the director of the cdcs hospital infectious disease program it was obvious from the dark circles under his eyes his drawn face and the stubble on his chin that he had pulled an allnighter she smiled liking his slightly heavyset rumpled looks he reminded her of a retired football player he sat down wearily massaging his temples looks like this is going to be just as bad as la he said we have another patient on the way up and another in the er ive just started looking at the new charts said marissa suddenly feeling guilty for having left the night before well i can tell you one thing said dr layne all the new patients seem to have gotten their disease from the hospital thats what bothers me so much are they all patients of dr zabriskis asked marissa those are said dr layne pointing at the charts in front of marissa they all saw zabriski recently he apparently inoculated them during his examinations the new cases are both dr cesters patients hed been the anesthesiologist when they had surgery during the last ten days what about dr cester asked marissa do you think that he contracted the disease the same way that dr zabriski did dr layne shook his head nope i talked at length with the man and i found out that he and zabriski were tennis partners marissa nodded but would such contact count about three days before dr zabriski became ill dr cester borrowed his towel between sets i think thats what did it transmission seems to depend on actual contact with body fluids i think zabriski is another index case just like dr richter marissa felt stupid she had stopped questioning dr cester just one question short of learning a crucial fact she hoped that she wouldnt make the same mistake again if we only knew how the ebola got into the hospital in the first place said dr layne rhetorically dubchek looking tired but cleanshaven and as carefully dressed as always arrived at the nurses station marissa was surprised to see him if hed left at five hed hardly had time to shower and change much less get any sleep before dubchek could get involved in a conversation with layne marissa quickly told both doctors that zabriski had attended the same san diego medical conference as richter had and that they had stayed in the same hotel its too long ago to be significant dubchek said dogmatically that conference was over six weeks ago but it appears to be the only association between the two doctors protested marissa i think i should follow up on it suit yourself said dubchek meanwhile id like you to go down to pathology and make sure they take every precaution when they post zabriski this morning and tell them that we want quickfrozen samples of liver heart brain and spleen for viral isolation what about kidney interjected layne yeah kidney too said dubchek marissa went off feeling like an errand girl she wondered if she would ever regain dubcheks respect then remembering why shed lost it her depression was wiped out by a surge of anger in pathology a busy place at that time of day marissa was directed to the autopsy rooms where she knew shed find dr rand remembering his pompous overbearing manner she was not looking forward to talking with him the autopsy rooms were constructed of white tile and gleaming stainless steel there was a pervading aroma of formalin that made marissas eyes water one of the technicians told her that zabriskis post was scheduled for room three if you intend to go you have to suit up its a dirty case with her general fear of catching ebola marissa was more than happy to comply when she entered the room she found dr rand just about to begin he looked up from the table of horrific tools dr zabriskis body was still enclosed in a large clear plastic bag his body was a pasty white on the top a livid purple on the bottom hi said marissa brightly she decided that she might as well be cheerful receiving no answer she conveyed the cdcs requests to the pathologist who agreed to supply the samples marissa then suggested the use of goggles a number of cases both here and in la were apparently infected through the conjunctival membrane she explained dr rand grunted then disappeared when he returned he was wearing a pair of plastic goggles without saying anything he handed a pair to marissa one other thing marissa added the cdc recommends avoiding power saws on this kind of case because they cause significant aerosol formation i was not planning to use any power tools said dr rand although you may find this surprising i have handled infectious cases during my career then i suppose i dont have to warn you about not cutting your fingers said marissa a pathologist died of viral hemorrhagic fever after doing just that i recall said dr rand lassa fever are you about to favor us with any further suggestions no said marissa the pathologist cut into the plastic bag and exposed zabriskis body to the air marissa debated whether she should go or stay indecision resulted in inaction she stayed speaking into an overhead microphone activated by a foot pedal dr rand began his description of the external markings of the body his voice had assumed that peculiar monotone marissa remembered from her medical school days she was startled back to the present when she heard rand describe a sutured scalp laceration that was something new it hadnt been in the chart nor had the cut on the right elbow or the circular bruise on the right thigh a bruise about the size of a quarter did these abrasions happen before or after death before he answered making no attempt to conceal his irritation at the interruption how old do you think they are said marissa ignoring his tone she bent over to look at them more carefully about a week old id say dr rand replied give or take a couple of days wed be able to tell if we did microscopic sections however in view of the patients condition i hardly think they are important now if you dont mind id like to get back to work forced to step back marissa thought about this evidence of trauma there was probably some simple explanation perhaps dr zabriski had fallen playing tennis what bothered marissa was that the abrasion and the laceration were not mentioned on the mans chart where marissa had trained every physical finding went into the record as soon as rand had finished and marissa had seen that the tissue samples were correctly done she decided to track down the cause of the injuries using the phone in pathology marissa tried zabriskis secretary judith she let the phone ring twenty times no answer reluctant to bother mrs zabriski marissa thought about looking for dr taboso but instead decided to check dr zabriskis office realizing it had to be right there in the hospital she walked over and found judith back at her desk judith was a frail young woman in her midtwenties mascara smudged her cheeks marissa could tell that shed been crying but she was more than sad she was also terrified mrs zabriski is sick she blurted out as soon as marissa introduced herself i talked with her a little while ago shes downstairs in the emergency room but she is going to be admitted to the hospital they think she has the same thing that her husband had my god am i going to get it too what are the symptoms with some difficulty marissa calmed the woman enough to explain that in the la outbreak the doctors secretary had not come down with the illness im still getting out of here said judith opening a side drawer of her desk and taking out a sweater she tossed it into a cardboard box shed obviously been packing and im not the only one who wants to go she added ive talked with a number of the staff and they are leaving too i understand how you feel said marissa she wondered if the entire hospital would have to be quarantined at the richter clinic it had been a logistical nightmare i came here to ask you a question said marissa so ask said judith she continued to empty her desk drawers dr zabriski had some abrasions and a cut on his head as if hed fallen do you know anything about that that was nothing said judith making a gesture of dismissal with her hand he was mugged about a week ago in a local mall while he was shopping for a birthday gift for his wife he lost his wallet and his gold rolex i think they hit him on the head so much for the mysterious question of trauma thought marissa for a few minutes she stood watching judith throw her things into the box trying to think if she had any further questions she couldnt think of any just then so she said goodbye then left heading for the isolation ward in many ways she felt as scared as judith did the isolation ward had lost its previous tranquility with all the new patients it was fully staffed with overworked nurses she found dr layne writing in several of the charts welcome to bedlam he said weve got five more admissions including mrs zabriski so ive heard said marissa sitting down next to dr layne if only dubchek would treat her as he did like a colleague tad schockley called earlier it is ebola a shiver ran down marissas spine were expecting the state commissioner of health to arrive any minute to impose quarantine continued dr layne seems that a number of hospital personnel are abandoning the place nurses technicians even some doctors dr taboso had a hell of a time staffing this ward have you seen the local paper marissa shook her head indicating that she had not she was tempted to say that she didnt want to stay either if it meant being exposed the headline is plague returns dr layne made an expression of disgust the media can be so goddamned irresponsible dubchek doesnt want anyone to talk with the press he wants all questions directed to him the sound of the patientelevator doors opening caught marissas attention she watched as a gurney emerged covered by a clear plastic isolation tent as it went by marissa recognized mrs zabriski she shivered again wondering if the local paper really had been exaggerating in their headline april marissa took another forkful of the kind of dessert that she allowed herself only on rare occasions it was her second night back in atlanta and ralph had taken her to an intimate french restaurant after five weeks with little sleep gulping down meals in a hospital cafeteria the gourmet meal had been a true delight she noticed that not having had a drink since shed left atlanta the wine had gone right to her head she knew she was being very talkative but ralph seemed content to sit back and listen winding down marissa apologized for chattering on about her work pointing to her empty glass as the excuse no need to apologize ralph insisted i could listen all night im fascinated by what you have accomplished both in la and in st louis but ive filled you in while i was away protested marissa referring to their frequent phone conversations while shed been in st louis marissa had gotten into the habit of calling every few days talking with ralph had provided a sounding board for her theories as well as a way to relieve her frustration at dubcheks continued insistence on ignoring her in both cases ralph had been understanding and supportive i wish youd tell me more about the community reaction he said how did the administrators and medical staff of the hospital try to control the panic considering that this time there were thirtyseven deaths taking him at his word marissa tried to describe the turmoil at the st louis hospital the staff and patients were furious at the enforced quarantine and dr taboso had sadly told her he expected the hospital to close when it was lifted you know im still worried abut getting sick myself admitted marissa with a selfconscious laugh every time i get a headache i think this is it and though we still have no idea where the virus came from dubcheks position is that the virus reservoir is somehow associated with medical personnel which doesnt make me any more comfortable do you believe it asked ralph marissa laughed im supposed to she said and if it is true then you should consider yourself particularly at risk both index cases were ophthalmologists dont say that laughed ralph im superstitious marissa leaned back as the waiter served a second round of coffee it tasted wonderful but she suspected shed be sorry later on when she tried to sleep after the waiter left with the dessert dishes marissa continued if dubcheks position is correct then somehow both eye doctors came into contact with the mysterious reservoir ive puzzled over this for weeks without coming up with a single explanation dr richter came in contact with monkeys in fact hed been bitten a week before he became ill and monkeys have been associated with a related virus called marburg but dr zabriski had no contact with any animals at all i thought you told me that dr richter had been to africa said ralph it seems to me that is the crucial fact after all africa is where this virus is endemic true said marissa but the time frame is all wrong his incubation period would have been six weeks when all the other cases averaged only two to five days then consider the problem of relating the two outbreaks dr zabriski hadnt been to africa but the only point of connection was that the two doctors attended the same medical conference in san diego and again that was six weeks before dr zabriski got sick its crazy marissa waved her hand as if she were giving up at least be happy you controlled the outbreaks as well as you did i understand that it was worse when this virus appeared in africa thats true agreed marissa in the zaire outbreak in whose index case may have been an american college student there were three hundred eighteen cases and two hundred eighty deaths there you go said ralph feeling that the statistics should cheer marissa he folded his napkin and put it on the table how about stopping at my house for an afterdinner drink marissa looked at ralph amazed at how comfortable shed become with him the surprising thing was that the relationship had developed on the telephone an afterdinner drink sounds fine she said with a smile on the way out of the restaurant marissa took ralphs arm when they got to his car he opened the door for her she thought that she could get used to such treatment ralph was proud of his car it was obvious in the loving way he touched the instruments and the steering wheel the car was a new sdl mercedes marissa appreciated its luxuriousness as she settled back in the leather seat but cars had never meant much to her she also couldnt understand why people bought diesels since they had an uncomfortable rattle when they started and idled they are economical said ralph marissa looked around at the appointments she marveled that someone could delude himself that an expensive mercedes was economical they didnt speak for a while and marissa wondered if going to ralphs house at that time of night was a good idea but she trusted ralph and was willing to let their relationship develop a little further she turned to look at him in the halflight he had a strong profile with a prominent nose like her fathers after they had settled on the couch in the parlor with brandy snifters in hand marissa mentioned something she had been afraid to point out to dubchek in his current patronizing mood there is one thing about the two index cases that i find curious both men were mugged just a few days before they got sick marissa waited for a response very suspicious said ralph with a wink are you suggesting that there is an ebola mary who robs people and spreads the disease marissa laughed i know it sounds stupid thats why i havent said anything to anyone else but you have to think of everything added ralph the old medicalschool training that taught you to ask everything including what the maternal greatgrandfather did for a living in the old country deliberately marissa switched the conversation to ralphs work and his house his two favorite subjects as the time passed she noted that he did not make any moves toward her she wondered if it were something about herself like the fact that shed been exposed to ebola then to make matters worse he invited her to spend the night in the guest room marissa was insulted perhaps just as insulted as if hed tried to drag her dress over her head the moment they walked in the front door she told him thank you but she did not want to spend the night in his guest room she wanted to spend the night in her own house with her dog the last part was meant to be an affront but it sailed over ralphs head he just kept on talking about redecorating plans he had for the first floor of the house now that hed lived there long enough to know what he wanted in truth marissa did not know what she would have done if ralph had made any physical advances he was a good friend but she still didnt find him romantically attractive in that respect she thought dubcheks looks distinctly more exciting thinking of cyrill reminded her of something how do you and dr dubchek know each other i met him when he addressed the ophthalmology residents at the university hospital said ralph some of the rare viruses like ebola and even the aids virus have been localized in tears and the aqueous humor some of them even cause anterior uveitis oh said marissa nodding as if she understood actually she had no idea what anterior uveitis was but she decided it was as good a point as any to ask ralph to drive her home over the next few days marissa adapted to a more normal life although every time the phone rang she half expected to be called out for another ebola disaster remembering her resolve she did pack a suitcase and kept it open in her closet ready for her to toss in her cosmetics case she could be out of her house in a matter of minutes if the need arose at work things were looking up tad helped her perfect her viral laboratory skills and worked with her to write up a research proposal on ebola unable to come up with a working hypothesis for a possible reservoir for ebola marissa concentrated instead on the issue of transmission from the enormous amount of data that shed amassed in la and st louis she had constructed elaborate case maps to show the spread of the illness from one person to another at the same time shed compiled detailed profiles on the people who had been primary contacts but who had not come down with the disease as dr layne had suggested close personal contact was needed presumably viral contact with a mucous membrane though unlike aids sexual transmission had only been a factor between dr richter and the medical secretary and dr zabriski and his wife given the fact that hemorrhagic fever could spread between strangers who shared a towel or by the most casual close touch ebola made the aids scare seem like a tempest in a teapot what marissa wanted to do was to validate her hypothesis by using guinea pigs of course such work required the use of the maximum containment lab and she still had not obtained permission amazing exclaimed tad one afternoon when marissa demonstrated a technique shed devised to salvage bacteriacontaminated viral cultures i cant imagine dubchek turning down your proposal now i can answered marissa she debated telling tad about what had happened in the la hotel but once again she decided not to do so it wouldnt accomplish anything and might cause problems in tads relationship with cyrill she followed her friend into his office as they relaxed over coffee marissa said tad you told me when we went into the maximum containment lab that there were all sorts of viruses stored in there including ebola we have samples from every outbreak there are even samples frozen and stored from your two outbreaks marissa wasnt at all sure how she felt about people referring to the recent epidemics as hers but she kept that thought to herself saying instead is there any place else that the ebola virus is stored other than here at the cdc tad thought for a moment im not sure do you mean here in the us marissa nodded the army probably has some in ft detrick at the center for biological warfare the fellow that runs the place used to be here at the cdc and he had an interest in viral hemorrhagic fevers does the army have a maximum containment lab tad whistled man theyve got everything and you say the man in charge at ft detrick has an interest in viral hemorrhagic fever he was one of the people along with dubchek who had been sent out to cover the initial ebola outbreak in zaire marissa sipped her coffee thinking that was an interesting coincidence she was also beginning to get a germ of an idea one so unpleasant that she knew she could not consider it a reasonable hypothesis one moment maam said the uniformed sentry with a heavy southern accent marissa was stopped at the main gate to ft detrick despite several days of trying to argue herself out of the suspicion that the army might have somehow been responsible for ebola being loosened on an unsuspecting public she had finally decided to use her day off to investigate for herself those two muggings continued to nag at her it had only been an hourandahalf flight to maryland and a short drive in a rentacar marissa had pleaded her field experience with ebola as an excuse to talk to anyone else familiar with the rare virus and colonel woolbert had responded to her request with enthusiasm the sentry returned to marissas car you are expected at building number eighteen he handed her a pass that she had to wear on the lapel of her blazer then startled her with a crisp salute ahead of her the blackandwhite gate tipped up and she drove onto the base building was a windowless concrete structure with a flat roof a middleaged man in civilian clothes waved as marissa got out of her car it was colonel kenneth woolbert to marissa he looked more like a university professor than an army officer he was friendly even humorous and was unabashedly pleased about marissas visit he told her right off that she was the prettiest and the smallest eis officer hed ever met marissa took the good with the bad the building felt like a bunker entry was obtained through a series of sliding steel doors activated by remote control small tv cameras were mounted above each door the laboratory itself however appeared like any other modern hospital facility complete with the omnipresent coffeepot over the bunsen burner the only difference was the lack of windows after a quick tour during which the presence of a maximum containment lab was not mentioned colonel woolbert took marissa to their snack shop which was nothing more than a series of vending machines he got her a donut and pepsi and they sat down at a small table without any prompting colonel woolbert explained that hed started at the cdc as an eis officer in the late fifties and had become increasingly interested in microbiology and ultimately virology in the seventies hed gone back to school at government expense to get a phd its been a hell of a lot better than looking at sore throats and clogged ears said the colonel dont tell me you were in pediatrics exclaimed marissa they laughed when they realized they had both trained at bostons childrens hospital colonel woolbert went on to explain how hed ended up at ft detrick he told marissa that there had been a history of movement between detrick and the cdc and that the army had come to him with an offer he couldnt refuse he said that the lab and the equipment were superb and best of all he didnt have to grovel for funds doesnt the ultimate goal bother you asked marissa no said colonel woolbert you have to understand that threequarters of the work here involves defending the us against biological attack so most of my efforts are directed at neutralizing viruses like ebola marissa nodded shed not thought of that besides continued colonel woolbert im given complete latitude i can work on whatever i want to and what is that just now asked marissa innocently there was a pause the colonels lightblue eyes twinkled i suppose im not violating the confidentiality of the military by telling you since ive been publishing a string of articles on my results for the last three years my interest has been influenza virus not ebola asked marissa colonel woolbert shook his head no my last research on ebola was years ago is anyone here at the center working on ebola asked marissa colonel woolbert hesitated then he said i guess i can tell you since there was a pentagon policy paper published on it in strategic studies last year the answer is no no one is working on ebola including the soviets mainly because there is no vaccine or treatment for it once started it was generally felt that ebola hemorrhagic fever would spread like wildfire to both friendly and hostile forces but it hasnt said marissa i know said colonel woolbert with a sigh ive read with great interest about the last two outbreaks someday well have to review our assessment of the organism please not on my account said marissa the last thing she wanted to do was encourage the army to work with ebola at the same time she was relieved to learn that the army was not fooling around with the virus just then i understand you were part of the international team that was sent to yambuku in she said which makes me appreciate what youre doing i can tell you when i was in africa i was scared shitless marissa grinned she liked and trusted the man you are the first person to admit being afraid she said ive been struggling with my fear from the first day i was sent to la and for good reason said colonel woolbert ebolas a strange bug even though it seems it can be inactivated quite easily it is extraordinarily infective meaning that only a couple of organisms have to make entry to produce the disease thats in marked contrast to something like aids where billions of the virus have to be introduced and even then there is only a low statistical chance that the individual will be infected what about the reservoir asked marissa i know the official position is that no reservoir was discovered in africa but did you have an opinion i think it is an animal disease said colonel woolbert i think it will eventually be isolated to some equatorial african monkey and is therefore a zoonosis or a disease of vertebrate animals that occasionally gets transmitted to man so you agree with the current cdc official position about these recent us outbreaks asked marissa of course said colonel woolbert what other position is there marissa shrugged do you have any ebola here no said colonel woolbert but i know where we can get it i know too said marissa well that wasnt quite true she thought tad had said that it was in the maximum containment lab but exactly where she did not know when theyd made their covert visit shed forgotten to ask april the phone must have been ringing for some time before marissa finally rolled over to pick up the receiver the cdc operator instantly apologized for waking her from such a deep sleep as marissa struggled to sit up she learned that a call had come through from phoenix arizona and that the operator wanted permission to patch it through marissa agreed immediately while she waited for the phone to ring again she slipped on her robe and glanced at the time it was am that meant it was am in phoenix there was little doubt in her mind that someone had discovered another suspected case of ebola the phone jangled again dr blumenthal said marissa the voice on the other end of the wire was anything but calm the caller introduced himself as dr guy weaver the arizona state epidemiologist im terribly sorry to be phoning at such an hour he said but ive been called in on a severe problem at the medica hospital in phoenix i trust you are familiar with the medica hospital cant say i am its part of a chain of forprofit hospitals which have contracted with the medica medical group to provide prepaid comprehensive care in this part of arizona were terrified that the hospitals been hit with ebola i trust that youve isolated the patient said marissa weve found that dr blumenthal interrupted dr weaver its not one case its eightyfour cases eightyfour she exclaimed in disbelief we have fortytwo doctors thirteen rns eleven lpns four lab techs six of the administrative staff six food service personnel and two maintenance men all at once asked marissa all this evening said the epidemiologist at that time of night there was no convenient service to phoenix though delta promised the most direct flight available as soon as she dressed marissa called the duty officer at the cdc to say that she was leaving for phoenix immediately and to please brief dr dubchek as soon as he came into the center after writing a note to the judsons asking them to please collect taffy and pick up her mail marissa drove to the airport the fact that the new outbreak had started with eightyfour cases overwhelmed her she hoped dubchek and his team would arrive by the afternoon the flight was uneventful despite two stops and was certainly not crowded when it landed marissa was met by a short round man who nervously introduced himself as justin gardiner the assistant director of the medica hospital here let me take your bag he said but his hand was shaking so the bag fell to the floor bending down to retrieve it he apologized saying that he was a bit upset i can understand said marissa have there been any further admissions several and the hospital is in a panic said mr gardiner as they started down the concourse patients started checking outstaff were leaving toountil the state health commissioner declared a quarantine the only reason i could meet you was that i was off yesterday marissas mouth felt dry with fear as she wondered what she was getting herself into pediatrics began to look a lot more attractive than this the hospital was another elaborate modern structure it occurred to marissa that ebola favored such contemporary edifices the clean almost sterile lines of the building hardly seemed the proper setting for such a deadly outbreak despite the early hour the street in front of the hospital was crowded with tv trucks and reporters in front of them stood a line of uniformed police some of whom were actually wearing surgical masks in the early light the whole scene had a surreal look mr gardiner pulled up behind one of the tv trucks youll have to go inside and find the director he said my orders are to stay outside to try to control the panic good luck as she walked toward the entrance marissa got out her identification card she showed it to one of the policemen but he had to call over to his sergeant to ask if it was okay to let her pass a group of the reporters hearing that she was from the cdc crowded around and asked for a statement i have no direct knowledge of the situation protested marissa as she felt herself buffeted by the surging journalists she was grateful for the policeman who shoved the press aside then pulled one of the barricades open and allowed her through unfortunately things on the inside of the hospital were even more chaotic the lobby was jammed with people and as marissa entered she was again mobbed apparently she was the first person to pass either in or out of the building for several hours a number of the people pressing in on her were patients dressed in pajamas and robes they were all simultaneously asking questions and demanding answers please shouted someone to marissas right please let me through a heavyset man with bushy eyebrows pushed his way to marissas side dr blumenthal yes said marissa with relief the heavyset man took her by the arm ignoring the fact that she was carrying both a suitcase and briefcase pushing his way back through the crowd he led her across the lobby to a door that he locked behind them they were in a long narrow hallway im terribly sorry about all this turmoil said the man im lloyd davis director of the hospital and we seem to have a bit of a panic on our hands marissa followed davis to his office they entered through a side door and marissa noticed the main door was barricaded from the inside with a ladderback chair making her believe that the bit of panic had been an understatement the staff is waiting to talk with you said mr davis taking marissas belongings and depositing them next to his desk he breathed heavily as if the effort of bending over had exhausted him what about the patients with suspected ebola asked marissa for the moment theyll have to wait said the director motioning marissa to return to the hallway but our first priority has to be the proper isolation of the patients they are well isolated mr davis assured her dr weaver has taken care of that he pressed his hand against the small of marissas back propelling her toward the door of course well follow any additional suggestions you have but right now i would like you to talk with the staff before im faced with mutiny i hope its not that bad said marissa it was one thing if the inpatients were upset quite another if the professional staff was hysterical as well mr davis closed his office door and led the way along another corridor a lot of people are terrified at being forced to stay in the hospital how many more presumed cases have been diagnosed since you called the cdc sixteen no more staff all the new cases are medica plan subscribers that suggested that the virus was already into its second generation having been spread by the initially infected physicians at least that was what had happened in the two previous outbreaks marissa herself quaked at the idea of being locked up in the same building with such a contagion making her question how much consolation she would be able to extend to the staff with so many people infected she wondered if they would be able to contain the problem as they had in la and st louis the horror of the thought of ebola passing into the general community was almost beyond comprehension do you know if any of the initial cases had been mugged recently asked marissa as much to distract herself as in hope of a positive answer davis just glanced at her and raised his eyebrows as if she were crazy that seemed as much of a response he felt the question merited so much for that observation thought marissa remembering ralphs response they stopped in front of a locked door davis took out his keys unlocked the door and led marissa onto the hospital auditoriums stage it was not a big room there was seating for approximately one hundred and fifty people marissa noticed all the seats were occupied with still more people standing in the back there was the buzz of a dozen simultaneous conversations they trailed off into silence as marissa nervously walked toward the podium all eyes upon her a tall exceptionally thin man stood up from a chair behind the podium and shook her hand mr davis introduced him as dr guy weaver the man shed spoken to on the phone dr blumenthal said dr weaver his deep voice a sharp contrast to his scrawny frame you have no idea how happy i am to see you marissa felt that uncomfortable sense of being an imposter and it got worse after tapping the microphone to make certain it was live dr weaver proceeded to introduce marissa he did so in such glowing terms that she felt progressively more and more uneasy from his comments it was as if she were synonymous with the cdc and that all the triumphs of the cdc were her triumphs then with a sweep of his long arm he turned the microphone over to marissa never feeling comfortable talking to a large group under the best of circumstances marissa was totally nonplussed in the current situation she had no idea of what was expected of her much less of what to say she took the few moments required to bend the microphone down to her level to think glancing out at the audience marissa noted that about half were wearing surgical masks she also noticed that a large portion of the people both men and women were ethnic appearing with distinctive features and coloring there was also a wide range of ages making marissa realize that what mr davis meant by staff was anybody working for the hospital not just physicians they were all watching her expectantly and she wished she had more confidence in her ability to affect what was happening at the hospital the first thing we will do is ascertain the diagnosis began marissa in a hesitant voice several octaves above her normal pitch as she continued speaking not sure of which direction she would go her voice became more normal she introduced herself in reasonable terms explaining her real function at the cdc she also tried to assure the audience even though she wasnt sure herself that the outbreak would be controlled by strict isolation of the patients complete barrier nursing and reasonable quarantine procedures will we all get sick shouted a woman from the back of the room a murmur rippled through the audience this was their major concern i have been involved in two recent outbreaks said marissa and i have not been infected though ive come into contact with patients who had she didnt mention her own continuing fear we have determined that close personal contact is necessary to spread ebola airborne spread is apparently not a factor marissa noticed that a few of the people in the audience removed their masks she glanced around at dr weaver who gave her an encouraging thumbsup sign is it really necessary for us to remain within the hospital demanded a man in the third row he was wearing a physicians long white coat for the time being said marissa diplomatically the quarantine procedure that we followed in the previous outbreaks involved separating the contacts into primary and secondary groups marissa went on to describe in detail what they had done in la and st louis she concluded by saying that no one whod been quarantined had come down with the illness unless they had previously had direct handson contact with someone already ill marissa then fielded a series of questions about the initial symptoms and the clinical course of ebola hemorrhagic fever the latter either terrified the audience into silence or satisfied their curiositymarissa couldnt decide whichbut there were no further questions while mr davis got up to talk to his staff dr weaver led marissa out of the auditorium as soon as they were in the narrow hallway she told him that she wanted to see one of the initial cases before she called the cdc dr weaver said hed assumed as much and offered to take her himself en route he explained that they had placed all the cases on two floors of the hospital moving out the other patients and isolating the ventilation system he had every reason to believe theyd made it a selfcontained area he also explained that the staff employed to man the floors were all specifically trained by his people that laboratory work had been restricted to what could be done in a hastily set up unit on one of the isolated floors and that everything used by the patients was being washed with sodium hypochlorite before being directly incinerated as for the quarantine situation he told marissa that mattresses had been brought in from the outside and the outpatient department had been turned into a huge dormitory separating primary and secondary contacts all food and water was also being brought in it was at that point that marissa learned that dr weaver had been an eis officer at the cdc six years previously why did you introduce me as the expert asked marissa remembering his embarrassing exaggerations obviously he knew as much as or more than she did about quarantine procedures for effect admitted dr weaver the hospital personnel needed something to believe in marissa grunted upset at being misrepresented but impressed with dr weavers efficiency before entering the floor they gowned then before entering one of the rooms they double gowned adding hoods goggles masks gloves and booties the patient dr weaver brought marissa to see was one of the clinics general surgeons he was an indian originally from bombay all marissas fears of exposure came back in a rush as she looked down at the patient the man appeared moribund even though hed been sick for only twentyfour hours the clinical picture mirrored the terminal phase of the cases in la and st louis there was high fever along with low blood pressure and the typical skin rash with signs of hemorrhage from mucous membranes marissa knew the man would not last another twentyfour hours to save time she drew her viral samples immediately and dr weaver arranged to have them properly packed and shipped overnight to tad schockley a glance at the mans chart showed the history to be fairly sketchy but with eightyfour admissions in less than six hours she could hardly have hoped for a textbook writeup she saw no mention of foreign travel monkeys or contact with the la or st louis outbreaks leaving the floor marissa first requested access to a telephone then said she wanted to have as many physician volunteers as she could get to help her interview the patients if many patients were as sick as the indian doctor they would have to work quickly if they were going to get any information at all marissa was given the phone in mr daviss office it was already after eleven in atlanta and marissa reached dubchek immediately the trouble was he was irritated why didnt you call me as soon as the aid request came in i didnt know you had gone until i got into my office marissa held her tongue the truth was that shed told the cdc operators that she should be called directly if a call came in suggestive of an ebola outbreak she assumed dubchek could have done the same if hed wanted to be called immediately but she certainly wasnt going to antagonize him further by pointing out the fact does it look like ebola it does said marissa anticipating dubcheks reaction to her next bomb the chief difference is in number of those infected this outbreak involves one hundred cases at this point i hope that you have instituted the proper isolation was dubcheks only reply marissa felt cheated shed expected dubchek to be overwhelmed arent you surprised by the number of cases she asked ebola is a relatively unknown entity said dubchek at this point nothing would surprise me im more concerned about containment what about the isolation the isolation is fine said marissa good said dubchek the vickers lab is ready and we will be leaving within the hour make sure you have viral samples for tad as soon as possible marissa found herself giving assurances to a dead phone the bastard had hung up she hadnt even had a chance to warn him that the entire hospital was under quarantinethat if he entered hed not be allowed to leave itll serve him right she said aloud as she got up from the desk when she left the office she discovered that dr weaver had assembled eleven doctors to help take histories five women and six men all of them voiced the same motivation as long as they had to be cooped up in the hospital they might as well work marissa sat down and explained what she needed good histories on as many of the initial eightyfour cases as possible she explained that in both the la and the st louis incidents there had been an index case to which all other patients could be traced obviously there in phoenix it was different with so many simultaneous cases there was the suggestion of a food or waterborne disease if it were waterborne wouldnt more people have been infected asked one of the women if the entire hospital supply was involved said marissa but perhaps a certain water fountain her voice trailed off ebola had never been a water or foodborne infection she admitted it is all very mysterious and it just underlines the need for complete histories to try to find some area of commonality were all the patients on the same shifts were they all in the same areas of the hospital did they all drink coffee from the same pot eat the same food come in contact with the same animal pushing back her chair marissa went to a blackboard and began outlining a sequence of questions that each patient should be asked the other doctors rose to the challenge and began giving suggestions when they were done marissa added as an afterthought that they might ask if any of the patients had attended the eyelid surgery conference in san diego that had been held about three months before before the group disbanded marissa reminded everyone to adhere carefully to all the isolation techniques then she thanked them again and went to review the material that was already available as she had done in la marissa commandeered the chart room behind the nurses station on one of the isolation floors as her command post as the other doctors finished their history taking they brought their notes to marissa who had begun the burdensome task of collating them nothing jumped out of the data except the fact that all the patients worked at the medica hospital something that was already well known by midday fourteen more cases had been admitted which made marissa extremely fearful that they had a fullblown epidemic on their hands all the new patients save one were medica subscribers who had been treated by one of the original fortytwo sick physicians before the physicians developed symptoms the other new case was a lab tech who had done studies on the first few cases before ebola was suspected just as the evening shift was coming on duty marissa learned that the other cdc physicians had arrived relieved she went to meet them she found dubchek helping to set up the vickers lab you might have told me the damn hospital was quarantined he snapped when he caught sight of her you didnt give me a chance she said skirting the fact that he had hung up on her she wished there was something she could do to improve their relationship which seemed to be getting worse instead of better well paul and mark are not very happy said dubchek when they learned all three of us would be trapped for the length of the outbreak they turned around and went back to atlanta what about dr layne asked marissa guiltily hes already meeting with weaver and the hospital administration then he will see if the state health commissioner can modify the quarantine for the cdc i suppose i cant talk to you until you get the lab going said marissa at least you have a good memory said dubchek bending over to lift a centrifuge from its wooden container after i finish here and ive seen layne about the isolation procedures ill go over your findings as marissa headed back to her room she mulled over a number of nasty retorts all of which only would have made things worse that was why she had said nothing after a meal of catered airplane food eaten in an area of the outpatient clinic reserved for staff in direct contact with the presumed ebola patients marissa returned to her chart work she now had histories on most of the initial eightyfour cases she found dubchek leafing through her notes he straightened up on seeing her im not sure it was a good idea to use the regular hospital staff to take these histories marissa was caught off guard there were so many cases she said defensively i couldnt possibly interview all of them quickly enough as it is seven people were too sick to speak and three have subsequently died thats still not reason enough to expose doctors who arent trained epidemiologists the arizona state health department has trained staff that should have been utilized if any of these physicians youve drafted become ill the cdc might be held responsible but they protested marissa enough interrupted dubchek im not here to argue what have you learned marissa tried to organize her thoughts and control her emotions it was true that shed not considered the legal implications but she was not convinced there was a problem the quarantined physicians were already considered contacts she sat down at the desk and searched for the summary page of her findings when she found it she began reading in a flat monotone without glancing up at dubchek one of the initial patients is an ophthalmologist who attended the same san diego conference as drs richter and zabriski another of the initial cases an orthopedic surgeon went on safari to east africa two months ago two of the initial cases have used monkeys in their research but have not suffered recent bites as a group all eightyfour cases developed symptoms within a sixhour period suggesting that they all were exposed at the same time the severity of the initial symptoms suggests that they all received an overwhelming dose of the infective agent everyone worked at the medica hospital but not in the same area which suggests the airconditioning system was probably not the source it seems to me we are dealing with a food or waterborne infection and in that regard the only commonality that has appeared in the data is that all eightyfour people used the hospital cafeteria in fact as nearly as can be determined all eightyfour people had lunch there three days ago marissa finally looked up at dubchek who was staring at the ceiling when he realized that she had finished speaking he said what about contact with any of the patients in the la or st louis episodes none said marissa at least none that we can discover have you sent blood samples to tad yes said marissa cyrill headed for the door i think you should redouble your efforts to associate this outbreak with one of the other two there has to be a connection what about the cafeteria asked marissa youre on your own there said dubchek ebola has never been spread by food so i cant see how the cafeteria could be associated he pulled open the door still the coincidence is curious and i suppose youll follow your own instincts no matter what i recommend just be sure you exhaust the possibilities of a connection with la or st louis for a moment marissa stared at the closed door then she looked back at her summary sheet and the huge pile of histories it was depressing almost as if cyrills last words had been a challenge marissa decided to visit the cafeteria which had been built as a separate wing over a garden courtyard the double doors leading to the large room were closed and on the right one a notice had been tacked up stating closed by order of state health commissioner marissa tried the door it was unlocked inside the room was spotlessly clean and furnished in stainless steel and molded plastic directly ahead of marissa was the steam table with stacks of trays at one end and a cash register at the other a second set of double doors with little round windows was located behind the steam table and led to the kitchen just as marissa was deciding whether to go through or not they opened and a stout but attractive middleaged woman appeared and called out to marissa that the cafeteria was closed marissa introduced herself and asked if she could ask the woman a few questions certainly replied the woman who explained with a faint scandinavian accent that her name was jana beronson and that she was the cafeteria manager marissa followed her into her office a windowless cubicle whose walls were filled with schedules and menus after some polite conversation marissa asked to see the lunch menu for three days ago miss beronson got it out of the file and marissa scanned the page it was a usual cafeteria menu with three entr√©es two soups and a selection of desserts is this all the food offered those are all the specials answered miss beronson of course we always offer a selection of sandwiches and salads and beverages marissa asked if she could have a copy of the menu and miss beronson took the paper and left the office to xerox it marissa decided that she would go back to each of the initial cases and ask what they had eaten for lunch three days ago she would also question a control group made up of people who ate from the same menu but who did not become ill miss beronson returned with the copy as she folded the paper marissa said one of your employees was stricken wasnt she maria gonzales said miss beronson what was her job here she worked either the steam table or the salad bar answered miss beronson could you tell me what she did on the day in question asked marissa getting up miss beronson went over to one of the large scheduling boards on her wall desserts and salads she told marissa marissa wondered if they should test the whole cafeteria staff for ebola antibodies although ralph had been joking when hed suggested an ebola mary perhaps it was possible although it had not been the case in africa would you like to see our facility asked miss beronson trying to be helpful for the next thirty minutes marissa was given a grand tour of the cafeteria including both the kitchen and the dining area in the kitchen she saw the walkin cooler the food preparation area and the huge gas ranges in the dining area she walked along the steam table peering into silverware bins and lifting the covers of the saladdressing cannisters would you like to see the stock rooms miss beronson asked when they were done marissa declined deciding it was time to start checking to see what the initial ebola patients had chosen from the menu in her purse marissa rocked back in the swivel chair and rubbed her eyes it was am of her second day in phoenix and shed only managed four hours of sleep the previous night shed been assigned one of the examination alcoves in the obgyn clinic and every time someone went by shed been awakened behind her marissa heard the door open she turned and saw dubchek holding up the front page of a local newspaper the headline read cdc believes hidden source of ebola in usa looking at his expression marissa guessed that he was as usual angry i told you not to talk to the press i havent dubchek smacked the paper it says right here that dr blumenthal of the cdc said that there is a reservoir of ebola in the usa and that the outbreak in phoenix was spread by either contaminated food or water marissa i dont mind telling you that you are in a lot of trouble marissa took the paper and read the article quickly it was true that her name was mentioned but only at second hand the source of the information was a bill freeman one of the doctors whod helped take patient histories she pointed this fact out to dubchek whether you talk directly to the press or to an intermediary who talks to the press is immaterial the effect is the same it suggests that the cdc supports your opinions which is not the case we have no evidence of a foodrelated problem and the last thing we want to do is cause mass hysteria marissa bit her lower lip it seemed that every time the man spoke to her it was to find fault if only shed been able to handle the episode in the hotel room in la in a more diplomatic way perhaps he wouldnt be so angry after all what did he expectthat she wouldnt talk to anyone any team effort meant communication controlling her temper marissa handed dubchek a paper i think you should take a look at this what is it he asked irritably its the result of a second survey of the initially infected patients at least those who were able to respond youll notice that one fact jumps out except for two people who couldnt remember all the patients had eaten custard in the hospital cafeteria four days ago youll remember that in my first survey lunch in the cafeteria on that day was the only point of commonality youll also see that a group of twentyone people who ate in the cafeteria on the same day but did not eat the custard remained healthy dubchek put the paper down on the counter top this is a wonderful exercise for you but you are forgetting one important fact ebola is not a foodborne disease i know that said marissa but you cannot ignore the fact that this outbreak started with an avalanche of cases then slowed to a trickle with isolation dubchek took a deep breath listen he said condescendingly dr layne has confirmed your finding that one of the initial patients had been to the san diego conference with richter and zabriski that fact forms the basis of the official position richter brought the virus back from its endemic habitat in africa and spread it to other doctors in san diego including the unfortunate ophthalmologist here at the medica hospital but that position ignores the known incubation period for hemorrhagic fever i know there are problems admitted dubchek tiredly but at the moment thats our official position i dont mind you following up the foodborne possibility but for gods sake stop talking about it remember that you are here in an official capacity i dont want you conveying your personal opinions to anyone particularly the press understood marissa nodded and there are a few things id like you to do continued dubchek id like you to contact the health commissioners office and ask that they impound the remains of some of the victims well want some gross specimens to be frozen and sent back to atlanta marissa nodded again dubchek started through the door then hesitated looking back he said more kindly you might be interested to know that tad has started to compare the ebola from the la st louis and phoenix outbreaks his preliminary work suggests that they are all the same strain that does support the opinion that it is really one related outbreak he gave marissa a brief selfsatisfied expression then left marissa closed her eyes and thought about what she could do unfortunately no custard had been left over from the fatal lunch that would have made things too easy instead she decided to draw blood on all the food staff to check for ebola antibodies she also decided to send samples of the custard ingredients to tad to check for viral contamination yet something told her that even if the custard were involved she wasnt going to learn anything from the ingredients the virus was known to be extremely sensitive to heat so it could only have been introduced into the custard after it had cooled but how could that be marissa stared at her stacks of papers the missing clue had to be there if shed only had a bit more experience perhaps shed be able to see it may it was nearly a month later and marissa was finally back in atlanta in her little office at the cdc the epidemic in phoenix had finally been contained and she dubchek and the other cdc doctors in the hospital had been allowed to leave still without any final answers as to what caused the outbreak or whether it could be prevented from reoccurring as the outbreak had wound down marissa had become eager to get home and back to work at the center yet now that she was there she was not happy with tearfilled eyes due to a mixture of discouragement and anger she was staring down at the memo which began i regret to inform you once again dubchek had turned down her proposal to work with ebola in the maximum containment lab despite her continued efforts to develop laboratory skills in relation to handling viruses and tissue cultures this time she felt truly discouraged she still felt that the outbreak in phoenix had been connected to the custard dessert and she desperately wanted to vindicate her position by utilizing animal systems she thought that if she could understand the transmission of the virus she might develop an insight into where it came from in the first place marissa glanced at the large sheets of paper that traced the transmission of the ebola virus from one generation to another in all three us outbreaks she had also constructed less complete but similar diagrams concerning the transmission of ebola in the first two outbreaks in both had occurred almost simultaneously one in yambuku zaire and the other in nzara sudan shed gotten the material from raw data stored in the cdc archives one thing that interested her particularly about the african experience was that a reservoir had never been found even the discovery that the virus causing lassa hemorrhagic fever resided in a particular species of domestic mouse had not helped in locating ebolas reservoir mosquitoes bedbugs monkeys mice ratsall sorts of creatures were suspected and ultimately ruled out it was a mystery in africa just as it was in the united states marissa tossed her pencil onto her desk with a sense of frustration she had not been surprised by dubcheks letter especially since he had progressively distanced her from his work in phoenix and had sent her back to atlanta the day the quarantine had been lifted he seemed determined to maintain the position that the ebola virus had been brought back from africa by dr richter who had then passed it on to his fellow ophthalmologists at the eyelid surgery conference in san diego dubchek was convinced that the long incubation period was an aberration impulsively marissa got to her feet and went to find tad hed helped her write up the proposal and she was confident hed allow her to cry on his shoulder now that it had been shot down after some protest marissa managed to drag him away from the virology lab to get an early lunch youll just have to try again tad said when she told him the bad news straight off marissa smiled she felt better already tads naivet√© was so endearing they crossed the catwalk to the main building one benefit of eating early was that the cafeteria line was nonexistent as if to further torment marissa one of the desserts that day was caramel custard when they got to a table and began unloading their trays marissa asked if tad had had a chance to check the custard ingredients that shed sent back from arizona no ebola he said laconically marissa sat down thinking how simple it would have been to find some hospital food supply company was the culprit it would have explained why the virus repeatedly appeared in medical settings what about the blood from the food service personnel no antibodies to ebola tad said but i should warn you dubchek came across the work and he was pissed marissa whats going on between you two did something happen in phoenix marissa was tempted to tell tad the whole story but again she decided it would only make a bad situation worse to answer his question she explained that shed been the inadvertent source of a news story that differed from the official cdc position tad took a bite of his sandwich was that the story that said there was a hidden reservoir of ebola in the us marissa nodded im certain the ebola was in the custard and im convinced that were going to face further outbreaks tad shrugged my work seems to back up dubcheks position ive been isolating the rna and the capsid proteins of the virus from all three outbreaks and astonishingly enough they are all identical it means that the exact same strain of virus is involved which in turn means that what we are experiencing is one outbreak normally ebola mutates to some degree even the two original african outbreaks in yambuku and nzara which were eight hundred fifty kilometers apart involved slightly different strains but what about the incubation period protested marissa during each outbreak the incubation period of new cases was always two to four days there were three months between the conference in san diego and the problem in phoenix okay said tad but that is no bigger a stumbling block than figuring out how the virus could have been introduced into the custard and in such numbers thats why i sent you the ingredients but marissa said tad ebola is inactivated even at sixty degrees centigrade even if it had been in the ingredients the cooking process would have made it noninfective the lady serving the dessert got sick herself perhaps she contaminated the custard fine said tad rolling his pale blue eyes but how did she get a virus that lives only in darkest africa i dont know admitted marissa but im sure she didnt attend the san diego eye meeting they ate in exasperated silence for a few minutes there is only one place i know the dessert server could have gotten the virus said marissa at last and wheres that here at the cdc tad put down the remains of his sandwich and looked at marissa with wide eyes good god do you know what youre suggesting im not suggesting anything said marissa im merely stating a fact the only known reservoir for ebola is in our own maximum containment lab tad shook his head in disbelief tad said marissa in a determined tone id like to ask you for a favor would you get a printout from the office of biosafety of all the people going in and out of the maximum containment lab for the last year i dont like this said tad leaning back in his seat oh come on said marissa asking for a printout wont hurt anyone im sure you can think up a reason to justify such a request the printout is no problem said tad ive done that in the past what i dont like is encouraging your paranoid theory much less getting between you and the administration particularly dubchek fiddlesticks said marissa getting a printout hardly puts you between me and dubchek anyway how will he know how will anybody know true said tad reluctantly provided you dont show it to anybody good said marissa as if the matter had been decided ill stop over at your apartment this evening to pick it up hows that okay i guess marissa smiled at tad he was a wonderful friend and she had the comfortable feeling that hed do almost anything for her which was reassuring because she had yet another favor to ask him she wanted to get back into the maximum containment lab after giving the emergency brake a good yank marissa alighted from her red honda the incline of the street was steep and shed taken the precaution of turning the wheels against the curb although she and tad had gone out any number of times marissa had never been to his apartment she climbed the front steps and struggled to make out the appropriate buzzer it was almost pm and was already dark the moment she saw tad marissa knew that he had gotten what she wanted it was the way he smiled when he opened the door marissa plopped herself into an overstuffed sofa and waited expectantly as tads big tabby rubbed sensuously against her leg with a selfsatisfied grin tad produced the computer printout i told them that we were doing an internal audit of frequency of entry said tad they didnt raise an eyebrow turning back the first page marissa noted that there was an entry for each visit to the maximum containment lab with name time in and time out all duly noted she traced down the list with her index finger recognizing only a few of the names the one that appeared most often was tads everybody knows im the only one who works at the cdc he said with a laugh i never expected the list to be so long complained marissa flipping through the pages does everyone on here still have access tad leaned against marissas shoulder and scanned the pages go back to the beginning that guy said tad pointing to the name gaston dubois no longer has access he was from the world health organization and was in town only for a short visit and this fellowtad pointed to an entry for one harry longfordwas a graduate student from harvard and he had access only for a specific project marissa noticed colonel woolberts name listed a number of times as well as that of a man called heberling who seemed to have visited fairly regularly until september then his name disappeared marissa asked about him heberling used to work here explained tad he took another job six months ago theres been a bit of mobility in academic virology of late because of the huge grants generated by the aids scare whered he go asked marissa going on to the next page tad shrugged darned if i know i think he wanted to go to ft detrick but he and woolbert never hit it off heberlings smart but not the easiest guy in the world to get along with there was a rumor he wanted the job dubchek got im glad he didnt get it he could have made my life miserable marissa flipped through the list to january and pointed at a name that appeared several times over a twoweek period gloria french whos she asked marissa glorias from parasitic diseases she uses the lab on occasion for work on vectorborne viral problems marissa rolled up the list satisfied asked tad its a little more than i expected admitted marissa but i appreciate your effort there is another thing though oh no said tad relax said marissa you told me that the ebola in la st louis and phoenix were all the identical strains id sure like to see exactly how you determined that but all that data is in the maximum containment lab said tad weakly so said marissa but you havent gotten clearance tad reminded her he knew what was coming i dont have clearance to do a study said marissa that means i cant go in by myself but its different if im with you especially if there is no one else there there wasnt any problem after my last visit was there tad had to agree there hadnt been any trouble so why not do it again hed never been specifically told that he could not take other staff members into the lab so he could always plead ignorance although he knew he was being manipulated it was hard to withstand marissas charm besides he was proud of his work and wanted to show it off he was confident shed be impressed all right he said when do you want to go how about right now said marissa tad looked at his watch i suppose its as good a time as any afterwards we can go for a drink said marissa itll be my treat marissa retrieved her purse noting that tads keys and his access card were on the same shelf by the door en route to the lab in marissas car tad began a complicated description of his latest work marissa listened but just barely she had other interests in the lab as before they signed in at the front entrance of the cdc and took the main elevators as if they were going up to marissas office they got off on her floor descended a flight of stairs then crossed the catwalk to the virology building before tad had a chance to open the huge steel door marissa repeated his code number tad looked at her with respect god what a memory you forget said marissa those are my measurements tad snorted when he switched on the lights and the compressors in the outer staging area marissa felt the same disquiet shed felt on her first visit there was something frightening about the lab it was like something out of a sciencefiction movie entering the dressing rooms they changed in silence first donning the cotton scrub suits then the bulky plastic ones following tads lead marissa attached her air hose to the manifold youre acting like an old pro said tad as he turned on the interior lights in the lab then motioned for marissa to detach her air hose and step into the next chamber as marissa waited for tad in the small room where they would get their phenolicdisinfectant shower on the way out she experienced an uncomfortable rush of claustrophobia she fought against it and it lessened as they entered the more spacious main lab her practical work with viruses helped since a lot of the equipment was more familiar she now recognized the tissue culture incubators and even the chromatography units over here called tad after theyd both hooked up to an appropriate manifold he took her to one of the lab benches where there was a complicated setup of exotic glassware and began explaining how he was separating out the rna and the capsid proteins from the ebola virus marissas mind wandered what she really wanted to see was where they stored the ebola she eyed the bolted insulated door if she had to guess shed guess someplace in there as soon as tad paused she asked if he would show her where they kept it he hesitated for a moment over there he said pointing toward the insulated door can i see asked marissa tad shrugged then he motioned for her to follow him he waddled over to the side of the room and pointed out an appliance next to one of the tissueculture incubators he wasnt pointing at the insulated door in there questioned marissa with surprise and disappointment shed expected a more appropriate container one that would be safely locked away behind a bolted door it looks just like my parents freezer it is said tad we just modified it to take liquidnitrogen coolant he pointed to the intake and exhaust hoses we keep the temperature at minus seventy degrees centigrade around the freezer and through the handle was a link chain secured by a combination lock tad lifted the lock and twirled the dial whoever set this had a sense of humor the magic sequence is it doesnt seem very secure said marissa tad shrugged whos going to go in here the cleaning lady im serious said marissa no one can get in the lab without an access card said tad opening the lock and pulling off the chain big deal thought marissa tad lifted the top of the freezer and marissa peered within half expecting something to jump out at her what she saw through a frozen mist were thousands upon thousands of tiny plasticcapped vials in metal trays with his plasticcovered hand tad wiped the frost off the inside of the freezers lid revealing a chart locating the various viruses he found the tray number for ebola then rummaged in the freezer like a shopper looking for frozen fish heres your ebola he said selecting a vial and pretending to toss it at marissa in a panic she threw her hands out to catch the vial she heard tads laughter which sounded hollow and distant coming from within his suit marissa felt a stab of irritation this was hardly the place for such antics holding the vial at arms length tad told marissa to take it but she shook her head no an irrational fear gripped her doesnt look like much he said pointing at the bit of frozen material but theres about a billion viruses in there well now that ive seen it i guess you may as well put it away she didnt talk as he replaced the vial in the metal tray closed the freezer and redid the bicycle lock marissa then glanced around the lab it was an alien environment but the individual pieces of equipment seemed relatively commonplace is there anything here thats not in any regular lab regular labs dont have air locks and a negative pressure system he said no i meant actual scientific equipment tad looked around the room his eyes rested on the protective hoods over the workbenches in the center island those are unique he said pointing theyre called type hepa filter systems is that what you mean are they only used for maximum containment labs asked marissa absolutely they have to be custom constructed marissa walked over to the hood in place over tads setup it was like a giant exhaust fan over a stove who makes them she asked you can look said tad touching a metal label affixed to the side it said lab engineering south bend indiana marissa wondered if anyone had ordered similar hoods lately she knew the idea in the back of her mind was crazy but ever since shed decided that the phoenix episode had been related to the custard she hadnt been able to stop wondering if any of the outbreaks had been deliberately caused or if not whether any physician had been doing some research which had gotten out of control hey i thought you were interested in my work said tad suddenly i am insisted marissa im just a little overwhelmed by this place after a hesitation for tad to remember where he was in his lecture he recommenced marissas mind wandered she made a mental note to write to lab engineering so what do you think asked tad when he finally finished im impressed said marissa and very thirsty now lets go get those drinks on the way out tad took her into his tiny office and showed her how closely all his final results matched each other suggesting that all the outbreaks were really one and the same have you compared the american strain with the african ones she asked him not yet admitted tad do you have the same kind of charts or maps for them sure do said tad he stepped over to his file cabinet and pulled out the lower drawer it was so full that he had trouble extracting several manila folders heres the one for sudan and heres zaire he stacked them on the desk and sat back down marissa opened the first folder the maps looked similar to her but tad pointed out significant differences in almost all of the six ebola proteins then marissa opened the second folder tad leaned forward and picked up one of the zaire maps and placed it next to the ones hed just completed i dont believe this he grabbed several other maps and placed them in a row on his desk what asked marissa im going to have to run all these through a spectrophotometer tomorrow just to be sure sure of what theres almost complete structural homology here said tad please said marissa speak english what are you saying the zaire strain is exactly the same as the strain from your three outbreaks marissa and tad stared at one another for a few moments finally marissa spoke that means theres been just one outbreak from zaire through phoenix thats impossible said tad looking back at the maps but thats what youre saying said marissa i know said tad i guess its just a statistical freak he shook his head his pale blue eyes returning to marissa its amazing thats all i can say after they crossed the catwalk to the main building marissa made tad wait in her office while she sat and typed a short letter whos so important that you have to write him tonight asked tad i just wanted to do it while it was on my mind said marissa she pulled the letter out of the machine and put it in an envelope there it didnt take too long did it she searched her purse for a stamp the addressee was lab engineering in south bend indiana why on earth are you writing to them tad asked i want some information about a type hepa filtration system tad stopped why he asked with a glimmer of concern he knew marissa was impulsive he wondered if taking her back into the maximum containment lab had been a mistake come on laughed marissa if dubchek continues to refuse me authorization to use the maximum containment lab ill just have to build my own tad started to say something but marissa grabbed his arm and pulled him toward the elevators may marissa got up early with a sense of purpose it was a glorious spring morning and she took full advantage of it by going jogging with taffy even the dog seemed to revel in the fine weather running circles about marissa as they crisscrossed the neighborhood back home again marissa showered watched a portion of the today show while she dressed and was on her way to the center by eightthirty entering her office she deposited her purse in her file cabinet and sat down at her desk she wanted to see if there was enough information available on ebola viruses for her to calculate the statistical probability of the us strain being the same as the zairean strain if the chances were as infinitesimally small as she guessed then shed have a scientific basis for her growing suspicions but marissa did not get far centered on her green blotter was an interoffice memo opening it she found a terse message telling her to come to dr dubcheks office immediately she crossed to the virology building at night the enclosed catwalk made marissa feel safe but in the bright sun the wire mesh made her feel imprisoned dubcheks secretary had not come in yet so marissa knocked on the open door the doctor was at his desk hunched over correspondence when he looked up he told her to close the door and sit down marissa did as she was told conscious the whole time of dubcheks onyx eyes following her every move the office was as disorganized as ever with stacks of reprinted scientific articles on every surface clutter was obviously dubcheks style even though he personally was always impeccably dressed dr blumenthal he began his voice low and controlled i understand that you were in the maximum containment lab last night marissa said nothing dubchek wasnt asking her a question he was stating fact i thought i made it clear that you were not allowed in there until youd been given clearance i find your disregard for my orders upsetting to say the least especially after getting tad to do unauthorized studies on food samples from medica hospital im trying to do my job as best i can said marissa her anxiety was fast changing to anger it seemed dubchek never intended to forget that shed snubbed him in la then your best is clearly not good enough snapped dubchek and i dont think you recognize the extent of the responsibility that the cdc has to the public especially given the current hysteria over aids well i think you are wrong said marissa returning dubcheks glare i take our responsibility to the public very seriously and i believe that minimizing the threat of ebola is a disservice there is no scientific reason to believe that weve seen the end of the ebola outbreaks and im doing my best to trace the source before we face another dr blumenthal you are not in charge here im well aware of that fact dr dubchek if i were i surely wouldnt subscribe to the official position that dr richter brought ebola back from africa and then experienced an unheard of sixweek incubation period and if dr richter didnt bring back the virus the only known source of it is here at the cdc it is just this sort of irresponsible conjecture that i will not tolerate you can call it conjecture said marissa rising to her feet i call it fact even ft detrick doesnt have any ebola only the cdc has the virus and it is stored in a freezer closed with an ordinary bicycle lock some security for the deadliest virus known to man and if you think the maximum containment lab is secure just remember that even i was able to get into it marissa was still trembling when she entered the university hospital a few hours later and asked directions to the cafeteria as she walked down the hallway she marveled at herself wondering where shed gotten the strength shed never been able to stand up to any authority as shed just done yet she felt terrible remembering dubcheks face as hed ordered her out of his office uncertain what to do and sure that her eis career had come to an end marissa had left the center and driven aimlessly around until she remembered ralph and decided to ask his advice shed caught him between surgical cases and hed agreed to meet her for lunch the cafeteria at the university hospital was a pleasant affair with yellowtopped tables and white tiled floor marissa saw ralph waving from a corner table in typical style ralph stood as marissa approached and pulled out her chair although close to tears marissa smiled his gallant manners seemed at odds with his scrub clothes thanks for finding time to see me she said i know how busy you are nonsense said ralph i always have time for you tell me whats wrong you sounded really upset on the phone lets get our food first said marissa the interruption helped marissa was in better control of her emotions when they returned with the trays im having some trouble at the cdc she confessed she told ralph about dubcheks behavior in los angeles and the incident in the hotel room from then on things have been difficult maybe i didnt handle things as well as i could have but i dont think it was all my responsibility after all it was a type of sexual harassment that doesnt sound like dubchek said ralph with a frown you do believe me dont you asked marissa absolutely ralph assured her but im still not sure you can blame all your problems on that unfortunate episode you have to remember that the cdc is a government agency even if people try to ignore the fact ralph paused to take a bite of his sandwich then he said let me ask you a question certainly said marissa do you believe that i am your friend and have your best interests at heart marissa nodded wondering what was coming then i can speak frankly said ralph i have heard through the grapevine that certain people at the cdc are not happy with you because youve not been toeing the official line i know youre not asking my advice but im giving it anyway in a bureaucratic system you have to keep your own opinions to yourself until the right time to put it baldly you have to learn to shut up i know because i spent some time in the military obviously you are referring to my stand on ebola said marissa defensively even though she knew ralph was right what hed just said hurt shed thought that in general shed been doing a good job your stand on ebola is only part of the problem you simply havent been acting as a team player who told you this asked marissa challengingly telling you isnt going to solve anything ralph said nor is my staying silent i cannot accept the cdcs position on ebola there are too many inconsistencies and unanswered questions one of which i learned only last night during my unauthorized visit to the maximum containment lab and what was that its known that ebola mutates constantly yet we are faced with the fact that the three us strains are identical and more astounding they are the same as the strain in an outbreak in zaire in to me it doesnt sound as if the disease is spreading naturally you may be right said ralph but you are in a political situation and you have to act accordingly and even if there is another outbreak which i hope there wont be i have full confidence that the cdc will be capable of controlling it that is a big question mark said marissa the statistics from phoenix were not encouraging do you realize there were three hundred fortyseven deaths and only thirteen survivors i know the stats said ralph but with eightyfour initial cases i think you people did a superb job im not sure youd think it was so superb if the outbreak had been in your hospital said marissa i suppose youre right said ralph the idea of further ebola outbreaks terrifies me maybe thats why i want to believe in the official position myself if its correct the threat may be over damn said marissa with sudden vehemence ive been so concerned about myself i completely forgot about tad dubchek must know it was tad who took me into the maximum containment lab id better get back and check on him ill let you go on one condition said ralph tomorrows saturday let me take you to dinner you are a dear dinner tomorrow night would be a treat marissa leaned forward and kissed ralphs forehead he was so kind she wished she found him more attractive as marissa drove back to the cdc she realized her anger at dubchek had been replaced by fear for her job and guilt about her behavior ralph was undoubtedly correct shed not been acting as a team player she found tad in the virology lab back at work on a new aids project aids was still the centers highest priority when he caught sight of marissa he shielded his face with his arms in mock defensiveness was it that bad asked marissa worse said tad im sorry said marissa how did he find out he asked me said tad and you told him sure i wasnt about to lie he also asked if i was dating you and you told him that too asked marissa mortified why not said tad at least it reassured him that i dont take just anybody off the street into the maximum containment lab marissa took a deep breath maybe it was best to have everything out in the open she put her hand on tads shoulder im really sorry ive caused you trouble can i try to make it up to you by fixing supper tonight tads face brightened sounds good to me at six oclock tad came by marissas office and then followed her in his car to the supermarket tad voted for double loin lamb chops for their meal and waited while the butcher cut them leaving marissa to pick up potatoes and salad greens when the groceries were stashed in marissas trunk tad insisted that he stop and pick up some wine he said hed meet her back at her house giving her a chance to get the preparations going it had begun to rain but as marissa listened to the rhythm of the windshield wipers she felt more hopeful than she had all day it was definitely better to have everything out in the open and shed talk to dubchek first thing monday and apologize as two adults they surely could straighten things out she stopped at a local bakery and picked up two napoleons then pulling in behind her house she backed up toward the kitchen door to have the least distance to carry the groceries she was pleased that shed beat tad the sun had not set yet but it was as dark as if it had marissa had to fumble with her keys to put the proper one in the lock she turned on the kitchen light with her elbow before dumping the two large brown bags on the kitchen table as she deactivated the alarm she wondered why taffy hadnt rushed to greet her she called out for the dog wondering if the judsons had taken her for some reason she called again but the house remained unnaturally still walking down the short hall to the living room she snapped on the light next to the couch taaaaffy she called drawing out the dogs name she started for the stairs in case the dog had inadvertently shut herself into one of the upstairs bedrooms as she sometimes did then she saw taffy lying on the floor near the window her head bent at a strange and alarming angle taffy cried marissa desperately as she ran to the dog and sank to her knees but before she could touch the animal she was grabbed from behind her head jerked upright with such force that the room spun instinctively she reached up and gripped the arm noticing that it felt like wood under the cloth of the suit even with all her strength she could not so much as budge the mans grip on her neck there was a ripping sound as her dress tore she tried to twist around to see her attacker but she couldnt the panic button for the alarm system was in her jacket pocket she reached in and juggled it in her fingers desperately trying to depress the plunger just as she succeeded a blow to her head sent her sprawling to the floor listening to the earsplitting noise marissa tried to struggle to her feet then she heard tads voice shouting at the intruder she turned groggily to see him struggling with a tall heavyset man covering her ears against the incessant screech of the alarm she rushed to the front door and threw it open screaming for help from the judsons she ran across the lawn and through the shrubs that divided the properties as she neared the judsons house she saw mr judson opening his front door she yelled for him to call the police but didnt wait to explain she turned on her heel and ran back to her house the sound of the alarm echoed off the trees that lined the street bounding up the front steps two at a time she returned to her living room only to find it empty panicked she rushed down the hall to the kitchen the back door was ajar reaching over to the panel she turned the alarm off tad she shouted going back to the living room and looking into the firstfloor guest room there was no sign of him mr judson came running through the open front door brandishing a poker together they went through the kitchen and out the back door my wife is calling the police said mr judson there was a friend with me gasped marissa her anxiety increasing i dont know where he is here comes someone said mr judson pointing marissa saw a figure approaching through the evergreen trees it was tad relieved she ran to him and threw her arms around his neck asking him what had happened unfortunately i got knocked down he told her touching the side of his head when i got up the guy was outside he had a car waiting marissa took tad into the kitchen and cleaned the side of his head with a wet towel it was only a superficial abrasion his arm felt like a club said tad youre lucky youre not hurt worse you never should have gone after him what if hed had a gun i wasnt planning on being a hero said tad and all he had with him was a briefcase a briefcase what kind of burglar carries a briefcase he was well dressed said tad id have to say that about him did you get a good enough look at him to identify him asked mr judson tad shrugged i doubt it it all happened so quickly in the distance they heard the sound of a police siren approaching mr judson looked at his watch pretty good response time taffy cried marissa suddenly remembering the dog she ran back into the living room with tad and mr judson close behind the dog had not moved and marissa bent down and gingerly lifted the animal taffys head dangled limply her neck had been broken up until that moment marissa had maintained cool control of her emotions but now she began to weep hysterically mr judson finally coaxed her into releasing the dog tad put his arms around her trying to comfort her as best he could the police car pulled up with lights flashing two uniformed policemen came inside to their credit marissa found them sensitive and efficient they found the point of entry the broken living room window and explained to marissa the reason why the alarm hadnt sounded initially the intruder had knocked out the glass and had climbed through without lifting the sash then in a methodical fashion the police took all the relevant information about the incident unfortunately neither marissa nor tad could give much of a description of the man save for his stiff arm when asked if anything was missing marissa had to say that she had not yet checked when she told them about taffy she began to cry again the police asked her if shed like to go to the hospital but she declined then after saying theyd be in touch the police left mr judson also departed telling marissa to call if she needed anything and not to concern herself about taffys remains he also said hed see about getting her window repaired tomorrow suddenly marissa and tad found themselves alone sitting at the kitchen table with the groceries still in their bags im sorry about all this said marissa rubbing her sore head dont be silly protested tad why dont we just go out for dinner i really am not up to a restaurant but i dont want to stay here either would you mind if i fixed the meal at your place absolutely not lets go just give me a moment to change said marissa may it was monday morning and marissa was filled with a sense of dread it had not been a good weekend friday had been the worst day of her life starting with the episode with dubchek then being attacked and losing taffy right after the assault shed minimized the emotional impact only to pay for it later shed made dinner for tad and had stayed at his house but it had been a turbulent evening filled with tears and rage at the intruder whod killed her dog saturday had found her equally upset despite first tads and then the judsons attempts to cheer her up saturday night shed seen ralph as planned and hed suggested she ask for some time off he even offered to take her to the caribbean for a few days he felt that a short vacation might let things at the cdc cool down when marissa insisted that she go back to work he suggested she concentrate on something other than ebola but marissa shook her head to that too well at least dont make more waves ralph counseled in his opinion dubchek was basically a good man who was still recovering from the loss of the wife hed adored marissa should give him another chance on this point at least marissa agreed dreading another confrontation with dubchek but resolved to try her best to make amends marissa went to her office only to find another memorandum already waiting for her on her desk she assumed it was from dubchek but when she picked up the envelope she noticed it was from dr carbonara the administrator of the eis program and hence marissas real boss with her heart pounding she opened the envelope and read the note which said that she should come to see him immediately that didnt sound good dr carbonaras office was on the second floor and marissa used the stairs to get there wondering if she were about to be fired the office was large and comfortable with one wall dominated by a huge map of the world with little red pins indicating where eis officers were currently assigned dr carbonara was a fatherly softspoken man with a shock of unruly gray hair he motioned for marissa to sit while he finished a phone call when he hung up he smiled warmly the smile made marissa relax a little he didnt act as though he were about to terminate her employment then he surprised her by commiserating with her about the assault and the death of her dog except for tad ralph and the judsons she didnt think anyone knew im prepared to offer you some vacation time continued dr carbonara after such a harrowing experience a change of scene might do you some good i appreciate your consideration said marissa but to tell you the truth id rather keep working it will keep my mind occupied and im convinced the outbreaks are not over dr carbonara took up a pipe and went through the ritual of lighting it when it was burning to his satisfaction he said unfortunately there are some difficulties relating to the ebola situation as of today we are transferring you from the department of virology to the department of bacteriology you can keep your same office actually its closer to your new assignment than it was to your old one im certain you will find this new position equally as challenging as your last he puffed vigorously on his pipe sending up clouds of swirling gray smoke marissa was devastated in her mind the transfer was tantamount to being fired i suppose i could tell you all sorts of fibs said dr carbonara but the truth of the matter is that the head of the cdc dr morrison personally asked that you be moved out of virology and away from the ebola problem i dont buy that snapped marissa it was dr dubchek no it wasnt dr dubchek said dr carbonara with emphasis then he added although he was not against the decision marissa laughed sarcastically marissa i am aware that there has been an unfortunate clash of personalities between you and dr dubchek but sexual harassment is more accurate interjected marissa the man has made it difficult for me ever since i stepped on his ego by resisting his advances im sorry to hear you say that said dr carbonara calmly perhaps it would be in everyones best interests if i told you the whole story you see dr morrison received a call from congressman calvin markham who is a senior member of the house appropriations subcommittee for the department of health and human services as you know that subcommittee handles the cdcs annual appropriations it was the congressman who insisted that you be put off the ebola team not dr dubchek marissa was again speechless the idea of a united states congressman calling the head of the cdc to have her removed from the ebola investigation seemed unbelievable congressman markham used my name specifically asked marissa when she found her voice yes said dr carbonara believe me i questioned it too but why asked marissa there was no explanation said dr carbonara and it was more of an order than a request for political reasons we have no choice i think you can understand marissa shook her head thats just it i dont understand but it does make me change my mind about that vacation offer i think i need the time after all splendid said dr carbonara ill arrange iteffective immediately after a rest you can make a fresh start i want to reassure you that we have no quarrel with your work in fact we have been impressed by your performance those ebola outbreaks had us all terrified youll be a significant addition to the staff working on enteric bacteria and im sure you will enjoy the woman who heads the division dr harriet samford marissa headed home her mind in turmoil shed counted on work to distract her from taffys brutal death and while shed thought thered been a chance shed be fired shed never considered shed be given a vacation vaguely she wondered if she should ask ralph if he was serious about that caribbean trip yet such an idea was not without disadvantages while she liked him as a friend she wasnt sure if she were ready for anything more her empty house was quiet without taffys exuberant greeting marissa had an overwhelming urge to go back to bed and pull the covers over her head but she knew that would mean yielding to the depression she was determined to fight off she hadnt really accepted dr carbonaras story as an excuse for shuffling her off the ebola case a casual recommendation from a congressman usually didnt produce such fast results she was sure if she checked she would discover markham was a friend of dubcheks eyeing her bed with its tempting ruffled pillows she resolved not to give in to her usual pattern of withdrawal the last reactive depression after roger left was too fresh in her mind instead of just giving in and accepting the situation which was what shed done then she told herself that she had to do something the question was what sorting her dirty clothes intending to do a therapeutic load of wash she spotted her packed suitcase it was like an omen impulsively she picked up the phone and called delta to make a reservation for the next flight to washington dc theres an information booth just inside the door said the knowledgeable cab driver as he pointed up the stairs of the cannon congressional office building once inside marissa went through a metal detector while a uniformed guard checked the contents of her purse when she asked for congressman markhams office she was told that it was on the fifth floor following the rather complicated directionsit seemed that the main elevators only went to the fourth floormarissa was struck by the general dinginess of the interior of the building the walls of the elevator were actually covered with grafitti despite the circuitous route she had no trouble finding the office the outer door was ajar so she walked in unannounced hoping an element of surprise might work in her favor unfortunately the congressman was not in hes not due back from houston for three days would you like to make an appointment im not sure said marissa feeling a little silly after having flown all the way from atlanta without checking to see if the man would be in town let alone available would you care to talk with mr abrams the congressmans administrative assistant i suppose said marissa in truth she hadnt been certain how to confront markham if she merely asked if he had tried to do dubchek a favor by figuring out a way to remove her from the ebola case obviously he would deny it while she was still deliberating an earnest young man came up to her and introduced himself as michael abrams what can i do for you he asked extending a hand he looked about twentyfive with dark almost black hair and a wide grin that marissa suspected could not be as sincere as it first seemed is there somewhere we can talk privately she asked him they were standing directly in front of the secretarys desk by all means said michael he guided her into the congressmans office a large highceilinged room with a huge mahogany desk flanked by an american flag on one side and a texas state flag on the other the walls were covered with framed photos of the congressman shaking hands with a variety of celebrities including all the recent presidents my name is dr blumenthal began marissa as soon as she was seated does that name mean anything to you michael shook his head should it he asked in a friendly fashion perhaps said marissa unsure of how to proceed are you from houston asked michael im from atlanta said marissa from the cdc she watched to see if there was any unusual response there wasnt the cdc repeated michael are you here in an official capacity no admitted marissa im interested in the congressmans association with the center is it one of his particular concerns im not sure particular is the right word said michael warily hes concerned about all areas of health care in fact congressman markham has introduced more healthcare legislation than any other congressman hes recently sponsored bills limiting the immigration of foreign medical school graduates a bill for compulsory arbitration of malpractice cases a bill establishing a federal ceiling on malpractice awards and a bill limiting federal subsidy of hmohealth maintenance organizationdevelopment michael paused to catch his breath impressive said marissa obviously he takes a real interest in american medicine indeed agreed michael his daddy was a general practitioner and a fine one at that but as far as you know continued marissa he does not concern himself with any specific projects at the cdc not that i know of said michael and i assume that not much happens around here without your knowing about it michael grinned well thank you for your time said marissa getting to her feet intuitively she knew she wasnt going to learn anything more from michael abrams returning to the street marissa felt newly despondent her sense of doing something positive about her situation had faded she had no idea if she should hang around washington for three days waiting for markhams return or if she should just go back to atlanta she wandered aimlessly toward the capitol shed already checked into a hotel in georgetown so why not stay she could visit some museums and art galleries but as she gazed at the capitols impressive white dome she couldnt help wondering why a man in markhams position should bother with her even if he were a friend of dubcheks suddenly she got the glimmer of an idea flagging a cab she hopped in quickly and said federal elections commission do you know where that is the driver was a handsome black who turned to her and said lady if theres some place in this city that i dont know ill take you there for nothin satisfied marissa settled back and let the man do the driving fifteen minutes later they pulled up in front of a drab semimodern office building in a seedy part of downtown washington a uniformed guard paid little heed to marissa other than to indicate she had to sign the register before she went in uncertain which department she wanted marissa ended up going into a firstfloor office four women were typing busily behind gray metal desks as marissa approached one looked up and asked if she could be of assistance maybe said marissa with a smile im interested in a congressmans campaign finances i understand thats part of the public record certainly is agreed the woman getting to her feet are you interested in contributions or disbursements contributions i guess said marissa with a shrug the woman gave her a quizzical look whats the congressmans name markham said marissa calvin markham the woman padded over to a round table covered with black looseleaf books she found the appropriate one and opened it to the ms explaining that the numbers following the congressmans name referred to the appropriate microfilm cassettes she then led marissa to an enormous cassette rack picked out the relevant one and loaded it into the microfilm reader which election are you interested in she asked ready to punch in the document numbers the last one i suppose said marissa she still wasnt sure what she was afterjust some way to link markham either to dubchek or the cdc the machine whirred to life documents flashing past on the screen so quickly that they appeared as a continuous blur then the woman pressed a button and showed marissa how to regulate the speed its five cents a copy if you want any you put the money in here she pointed to a coin slot if you run into trouble just yell marissa was intrigued by the apparatus as well as the information available as she reviewed the names and addresses of all the contributors to markhams considerable reelection coffers marissa noted that he appeared to get fiscal support on a national scale not just from his district in texas she did not think that was typical except perhaps for the speaker of the house or the chairman of the house ways and means committee she also noted that a large percentage of the donors were physicians which made sense in light of markhams record on health legislation the names were alphabetized and though she carefully scanned the ds she failed to find dubcheks name it had been a crazy idea anyway she told herself where would cyrill get the money to influence a powerful congressman he might have some hold on markham but not a financial one marissa laughed to think she considered tad naive still she made a copy of all the contributors deciding to go over the list at her leisure she noticed that one doctor with six children had donated the maximum amount allowable for himself and for each member of his family that was real support at the end of the individual contributors was a list of corporate supporters one called the physicians action congress political action committee had donated more money than any number of texas oil companies going back to the previous election marissa found the same group clearly it was an established organization and it had to be high on markham after thanking the woman for her help marissa went outside and hailed a cab as it inched through rushhour traffic marissa looked again at the list of individual names suddenly she almost dropped the sheets dr ralph hempstons name leapt out from the middle of a page it was a coincidence to be sure and made her feel what a small world it was but thinking it over she was not surprised one of the things that had always troubled her about ralph was his conservatism it would be just like him to support a congressman like markham it was fivethirty when marissa crossed the pleasant lobby of her hotel as she passed the tiny newsstand she saw the washington posts headline ebola strikes again like iron responding to a magnet marissa was pulled across the room she snatched up a paper and read the subhead newest scourge terrifies the city of brotherly love digging up change from the bottom of her purse to buy the paper she continued reading as she walked toward the elevators there were three presumed cases of ebola at the berson clinic hospital in abington pennsylvania just outside of philadelphia the article described widespread panic in the suburban town as she pressed the button for her floor marissa saw that dubchek was quoted as saying that he believed the outbreak would be contained quickly and that there was no need for concern the cdc had learned a lot about controlling the virus from the three previous outbreaks peter carbo one of philadelphias gay rights leaders was quoted as saying that he hoped jerry falwell had noticed that not a single known homosexual had contracted this new and far more dangerous disease that had come from the same area of africa as aids had back in her room marissa turned to an inside photo section the picture of the police barricade at the entrance to the berson hospital reminded her of phoenix she finished the article and put the paper down on the bureau looking at herself in the mirror although she was on vacation and was officially off the ebola team she knew she had to get the details firsthand her commitment to the ebola problem left her with little choice she rationalized her decision to go by telling herself that philadelphia was practically next door to washington she could even go by train turning into the room marissa began collecting her belongings leaving the station in philadelphia marissa took a cab to abington which turned out to be a far more expensive ride than shed anticipated luckily she had some travelers checks tucked in her wallet and the driver was willing to accept them outside the berson hospital she was confronted by the police barricade pictured in the newspaper before she attempted to cross she asked a reporter if the place was quarantined no said the man who had been trying to interview a doctor who had just sauntered past the police were there in case a quarantine was ordered marissa flashed her cdc identity card at one of the guards he admitted her without question the hospital was a handsome new facility much like the sites of the ebola outbreaks in la and phoenix as marissa headed toward the information booth she wondered why the virus seemed to strike these elegant new structures rather than the grubby innercity hospitals in new york or boston there were a lot of people milling about the lobby but nothing like the chaos that shed seen in phoenix people seemed anxious but not terrified the man at the information booth told marissa that the cases were in the hospitals isolation unit on the sixth floor marissa had started toward the elevators when the man called out im sorry but there are no visitors allowed marissa flashed her cdc card again im sorry doctor take the last elevator its the only one that goes to six when marissa got off the elevator a nurse asked her to don protective clothing immediately she didnt question marissa as to why she was there marissa was particularly glad to put on the mask it gave her anonymity as well as protection excuse me are any of the cdc doctors available she asked startling the two women gossiping behind the nurses station im sorry we didnt hear you coming said the older of the two the cdc people left about an hour ago said the other i think they said they were going down to the administrators office you could try there no matter said marissa how are the three patients there are seven now said the first woman then she asked marissa to identify herself im from the cdc she said purposely not giving her name and you unfortunately were the rns who normally run this unit were used to isolating patients with lowered resistance to disease not cases of fatal contagious disease were glad you people are here it is a little frightening at first commiserated marissa as she boldly entered the nurses station but if its any comfort ive been involved with all three previous outbreaks and havent had any problems marissa did not admit to her own fear are the charts here or in the rooms here said the older nurse pointing to a corner shelf how are the patients doing terribly i know that doesnt sound very professional but ive never seen sicker people weve used roundtheclock specialduty nursing but no matter what we try they keep getting worse marissa well understood the nurses frustration terminal patients generally depressed the staff do either of you know which patient was admitted first the older nurse came over to where marissa was sitting and pushed the charts around noisily before pulling out one and handing it to marissa dr alexi was the first im surprised hes lasted the day marissa opened the chart there were all the familiar symptoms but no mention of foreign travel animal experiments or contact with any of the three previous outbreaks but she did learn that alexi was the head of ophthalmology marissa was amazed was dubchek right after all unsure of how long she dared stay in the unit marissa opted to see the patient right away donning an extra layer of protective clothing including disposable goggles she entered the room is dr alexi conscious she asked the specialduty nurse whose name was marie the man was lying silently on his back mouth open staring at the ceiling his skin was already the pasty yellow shade that marissa had learned to associate with neardeath he goes in and out said the nurse one minute hes talking the next hes unresponsive his blood pressure has been falling again ive been told that hes a no code marissa swallowed nervously shed always been uncomfortable with the order not to resuscitate dr alexi called marissa gingerly touching the mans arm slowly he turned his head to face her she noticed a large bruise beneath his right eye can you hear me dr alexi the man nodded have you been to africa recently dr alexi shook his head no did you attend an eyelid surgery conference in san diego a few months back the man mouthed the word yes perhaps dubchek really was right it was too much of a coincidence each outbreaks primary victim was an ophthalmologist whod attended that san diego meeting dr alexi began marissa choosing her words carefully do you have friends in la st louis or phoenix have you seen them recently but before marissa had finished hed slipped back into unconsciousness thats what hes been doing said the nurse moving to the opposite side of the bed to take another bloodpressure reading marissa hesitated perhaps shed wait a few minutes and try to question him again her attention returned to the bruise beneath the mans eye and she asked the nurse if she knew how hed gotten it his wife told me hed been robbed said the nurse then she added his blood pressure is even lower she shook her head in dismay as she put down the stethoscope he was robbed just before he got sick asked marissa she wanted to be sure shed heard correctly yes i think the mugger hit him in the face even though he didnt resist an intercom sputtered to life marie is there a doctor from the cdc in your room the nurse looked from the speaker to marissa then back to the speaker again yes there is over the continued crackle of static indicating that the line was still open marissa could hear a woman saying shes in dr alexis room another voice said dont say anything ill go down and talk with her marissas pulse raced it was dubchek frantically she looked around the room as if to hide she thought of asking the nurse if there were another way out but she knew it would sound ridiculous and it was too late she could already hear footsteps in the hall cyrill walked in adjusting his protective goggles marie he asked yes said the nurse marissa started for the door dubchek grabbed her by the arm marissa froze it was ridiculous to have a confrontation of this sort in the presence of a dying man she was scared of dubcheks reaction knowing how many rules she had probably broken at the same time she was angry at having been forced to break them what the hell do you think youre doing he growled he would not let go of her arm have some respect for the patient if not for anyone else said marissa finally freeing herself and leaving the room dubchek was right behind her she pulled off the goggles the outer hood and gown then the gloves and deposited them all in the proper receptacle dubchek did the same are you making a career out of flouting authority he demanded barely controlling his fury is this all some kind of game to you id rather not talk about it said marissa she could tell that dubchek for the moment was beyond any reasonable discussion she started toward the elevators what do you mean youd rather not talk about it yelled dubchek who do you think you are he grabbed marissas arm again and yanked her around to face him i think we should wait until you are a little less upset marissa managed to say as calmly as she could upset exploded dubchek listen young lady im calling dr morrison first thing in the morning to demand that he make you take a forced leave of absence rather than a vacation if he refuses ill demand a formal hearing thats fine by me said marissa maintaining a fragile control there is something extraordinary about these ebola outbreaks and i think you dont want to face it maybe a formal hearing is what we need get out of here before i have you thrown out snapped dubchek gladly said marissa as she left the hospital marissa realized she was shaking she hated confrontations and once again she was torn between righteous anger and guilty humiliation she was certain she was close to the real cause of the outbreaks but she still could not clearly formulate her suspicionsnot even to her own satisfaction much less someone elses marissa tried to think it through on her way to the airport but all she could think of was her ugly scene with dubchek she couldnt get it out of her head she knew she had taken a risk by going into the berson hospital when she was specifically unauthorized to do so cyrill had every right to be enraged she only wished she had been able to talk to him about the strange fact that each of the index cases had been mugged just before becoming ill waiting for her plane back to atlanta marissa went to a pay phone to call ralph he answered promptly saying hed been so worried about her that hed gone to her house when she had failed to answer the phone he asked her where shed been pretending to be indignant that shed left town without telling him washington and now philadelphia explained marissa but im on my way home did you go to philly because of the new ebola outbreak yes said marissa a lot has happened since we talked last its a long story but the bottom line is that i wasnt supposed to go and when dubchek caught me he went crazy i may be out of a job do you know anybody who could use a pediatrician whos hardly been used no problem said ralph with a chuckle i could get you a job right here at the university hospital whats your flight number ill drive out to the airport and pick you up id like to hear about what was so important that you had to fly off without telling me you were going thanks but its not necessary said marissa my honda is waiting for me then stop over on your way home it might be late said marissa thinking that it might be more pleasant at ralphs than in her own empty house im planning on stopping by the cdc there is something id like to do while dubchek is out of town that doesnt sound like a good idea said ralph what are you up to believe me not much said marissa i just want one more quick visit to the maximum containment lab i thought you didnt have authorization i can manage it i think she told him my advice is to stay away from the cdc said ralph going into that lab is what caused most of your problems in the first place i know admitted marissa but im going to do it anyway this ebola affair is driving me crazy suit yourself but stop over afterwards ill be up late ralph marissa said screwing up her courage to ask the question do you know congressman markham there was a pause i know of him have you ever contributed to his campaign fund what an odd question particularly for a longdistance call have you persisted marissa yes said ralph several times i like the mans position on a lot of medical issues after promising again to see him that night marissa hung up feeling relieved she was pleased shed broached the subject of markham and was even happier that ralph had been so forthright about his contributions once the plane took off though her sense of unease returned the theory still undeveloped in the back of her mind was so terrifying she was afraid to try to flesh it out more horrifying yet she was beginning to wonder if her house being broken into and her dog killed was something more than the random attack shed taken it for may evening marissa left the airport and headed directly for tads house shed not called thinking it would be better just to drop in even though it was almost nine she pulled up in front of his house pleased to see lights blazing in the living room on the second floor marissa said tad opening the front door of the building a medical journal in his hand what are you doing here id like to see the man of the house said marissa im doing a home survey on peanut butter preference youre joking of course im joking said marissa with exasperation are you going to invite me in or are we going to spend the night standing here marissas new assertiveness surprised even herself sorry said tad stepping aside come on in hed left his apartment door open so after climbing the stairs marissa entered ahead of him glancing at the shelf in the foyer she saw that his lab access card was there ive been calling you all day said tad where have you been out said marissa vaguely its been another interesting day i was told youd been transferred from special pathogens said tad then i heard a rumor that you were on vacation whats happening i wish i knew said marissa dropping onto tads lowslung sofa his cat materialized out of nowhere and leaped into her lap what about philadelphia is it ebola im afraid so said tad sitting down next to her the call came in on sunday i got samples this morning and theyre loaded with the virus is it the same strain i wont know that for some time said tad you still think its all coming from that san diego eye meeting she asked him i dont know said tad with a slight edge to his voice im a virologist not an epidemiologist dont be cross said marissa but you dont have to be an epidemiologist to recognize that something strange is happening do you have any idea why ive been transferred id guess that dubchek requested it nope said marissa it was a us congressman from texas named markham he called dr morrison directly he sits on the appropriations committee that decides on the cdc budget so morrison had to comply but thats pretty weird isnt it i mean im only an eis officer i suppose it is agreed tad he was becoming more and more nervous marissa reached out and put her hand on his shoulder whats the matter all this worries me said tad i like you you know that but trouble seems to follow you around and i dont want to be drawn into it i happen to like my job i dont want to involve you but i need your help just one last time thats why i came here so late tad shook off her hand please dont ask me to break any more rules i have to get back into the maximum containment lab said marissa only for a few minutes no said tad decisively i simply cant take the risk im sorry dubchek is out of town said marissa no one will be there at this hour no said tad i wont do it marissa could tell he was adamant okay she said i understand you do said tad surprised that shed given in so easily i really do but if you cant take me into the lab at least you could get me something to drink of course said tad eager to please beer white wine whats your pleasure a beer would be nice said marissa tad disappeared into the kitchen when she heard the sound of the refrigerator opening marissa stood and quickly tiptoed to the front door glancing at the shelf she was pleased to see tad had two access cards maybe he wouldnt even notice that shed borrowed one she thought to herself as she slipped one of the two into her jacket pocket she was back on the couch before tad returned with the beers tad handed marissa a bottle of rolling rock keeping one for himself he also produced a package of potato chips that he popped open and set on the coffee table to humor him marissa asked about his latest research but it was obvious she wasnt paying close attention to his answers you dont like rolling rock asked tad noticing that shed hardly touched hers its fine said marissa yawning i guess im more tired than thirsty i suppose i ought to be going youre welcome to spend the night said tad marissa pushed herself to her feet thanks but i really should go home im sorry about the lab said tad bending to kiss her i understand said marissa she headed out the door before he could get his arms around her tad waited until he heard the outer door close before going back inside his apartment on the one hand he was glad that hed had the sense to resist her manipulations on the other he felt badly that hed disappointed her from where tad was standing he was looking directly at the shelf where hed left his access card and keys still thinking about marissa he realized that one of his cards was gone he carefully looked through all the junk hed removed from his pockets and then searched the shelves above and below his spare card was gone damn said tad he should have expected a trick when shed given up so easily opening the door he ran down the stairs and out into the street hoping to catch her but the street was empty there wasnt even a breath of air in the humid night the leaves on the trees hung limp and still tad went back to his apartment trying to decide what to do he checked the time then went to the phone he liked marissa but shed gone too far he picked up the phone and began dialing driving to the center marissa hoped dubchek hadnt warned the guards she was no longer working in virology but when she flashed her identity card the guard on duty just smiled and said working late again so far so good but as a precaution marissa first went to her own office in case the man decided to follow her she turned her light on and sat behind her desk waiting but there were no footsteps in the hall there were a few letters on her blotter two advertisements from pharmaceutical houses and a third from lab engineering in south bend marissa ripped this third one open a salesman thanked her for her inquiry concerning their type hepa containment hoods and went on to say that such equipment was only built to custom specifications if she was interested she should retain an architectural firm specializing in healthcare construction he ended by answering the question that had prompted her letter lab engineering had built only one system in the last year and that had been for professional labs in grayson georgia marissa looked at a map of the united states that her offices previous occupant had left hanging and which shed never bothered to take down poring over georgia she tried to find grayson it wasnt there she searched through her drawers thinking she had a georgia road map somewhere finally she found it in the file cabinet grayson was a small town a few hours east of atlanta what on earth were they doing with a type hepa containment hood after putting the road map back in the file cabinet and the letter in her blazer pocket marissa checked the hallway it was quiet and the elevator was still at her floor it had not been used she decided that the time was right to make her move taking the stairs to descend one floor marissa left the main building and crossed to the virology building by the catwalk she was pleased that there were no lights on in any of the offices when she passed dubcheks door she stuck out her tongue it was childish but satisfying turning the corner she confronted the airtight security door involuntarily she held her breath as she inserted tads card and tapped out his access number there was a resounding mechanical click and the heavy door swung open marissa caught a whiff of the familiar phenolic disinfectant marissa felt her pulse begin to race as she crossed the threshold she had the uncomfortable feeling she was entering a house of horrors the dimly lit cavernous twostory space filled with its confusion of pipes and their shadows gave the impression of a gigantic spider web as shed seen tad do on her two previous visits marissa opened the small cabinet by the entrance and threw the circuit breakers turning on the lights and activating the compressors and ventilation equipment the sound of the machinery was much louder than shed recalled sending vibrations through the floor alone the futuristic lab was even more intimidating than marissa remembered it took all her courage to proceed knowing in addition that she was breaking rules when she was already on probation every second she feared that someone would discover her with sweaty palms she grasped the releasing wheel on the airtight door to the dressing rooms and tried to turn it the wheel would not budge finally using all her strength she got it to turn the seal broke with a hiss and the door swung outward she climbed through hearing the door close behind her with an ominous thud she felt her ears pop as she scrambled into a set of scrub clothes the second door opened more easily but the fewer problems she encountered the more she worried about the real risks she was taking locating a small plastic isolation suit among the twenty or so hanging in the chamber marissa found it much harder to get into without tads help she was sweaty by the time she zipped it closed at the switch panel she only turned on the lights for the main lab the rest were unnecessary she had no intention of visiting the animal area then carrying her air hose she crossed the disinfecting chamber and climbed through the final airtight door into the main part of the lab her first order of business was to hook up to an appropriately positioned manifold and let the fresh air balloon out her suit and clear her mask she welcomed the hissing sound without it the silence had been oppressive orienting herself in relation to all the hightech hardware she spotted the freezer she was already sorry that shed not turned on all the lights the shadows at the far end of the lab created a sinister backdrop for the deadly viruses heightening marissas fear swinging her legs wide to accommodate the inflated and bulky isolation suit marissa started for the freezer again marveling that with all the other hightech uptotheminute equipment they had settled for an ordinary household appliance its existence in the maximum containment lab was as unlikely as an old adding machine at a computer convention just short of the freezer marissa paused eyeing the insulated bolted door to the left after learning the viruses were not stored behind it she had wondered just what it did protect nervously she reached out and drew the bolt a cloud of vapor rushed out as she opened the door and stepped inside for a moment she felt as if she had stepped into a freezing cloud then the heavy door swung back against her air hose plunging her into darkness when her eyes adjusted she spotted what she hoped was a light switch and turned it on overhead lights flicked on barely revealing a thermometer next to the switch bending over she was able to make out that it registered minus fiftyone degrees centigrade my god exclaimed marissa understanding the source of the vapor as soon as the air at room temperature met such cold the humidity it contained sublimated to ice turning around and facing the dense fog marissa moved deeper into the room fanning the air with her arms almost immediately a ghastly image caught her eye she screamed the sound echoing horribly within her suit at first she thought she was seeing ghosts then she realized that still more horrible she was facing a row of frozen nude corpses only partially visible through the swirling mist at first she thought they were standing on their own in a row but it turned out they were hung like cadavers for an anatomy coursecaliperlike devices thrust into the ear canals as she came closer marissa recognized the first body for a moment she thought she was going to pass out it was the indian doctor whom marissa had seen in phoenix his face frozen into an agonized death mask there were at least a halfdozen bodies marissa didnt count to the right she saw the carcasses of monkeys and rats frozen in equally grotesque positions although marissa could understand that such freezing was probably necessary for the viral study of gross specimens she had been totally unprepared for the sight no wonder tad had discouraged her from entering marissa backed out of the room turning off the light and closing and bolting the door she shivered both from distaste and actual chill chastised for her curiosity marissa turned her attention to the freezer in spite of the clumsiness afforded by the plastic suit and her own tremulousness she worked the combination on the bicycle lock and got it off with relative ease the link chain was another story it was knotted and she had to struggle to get it through the handle it took longer than she would have liked but at last it was free and she lifted the lid rubbing the frost off the inner side of the lid marissa tried to decipher the index code the viruses were in alphabetical order ebola zaire was followed by ee ff marissa guessed that the first number referred to the appropriate tray and that the letters and numbers that followed located the virus within the tray each tray held at least one thousand samples which meant that there were fifty individual vials of the zaire strain as carefully as possible marissa lifted tray free and set it on a nearby counter top while she scanned the slots each was filled with a small blacktopped vial marissa was both relieved and disappointed she located the zaire strain and lifted out sample e the tiny frozen ball inside looked innocuous but marissa knew that it contained millions of tiny viruses any one or two of which when thawed were capable of killing a human being slipping the vial back in its slot marissa lifted the next checking to see if the ice ball appeared intact she continued this process without seeing anything suspicious until finally she reached vial e the vial was empty quickly marissa went through the rest of the samples all were as they should be she held vial e up to the light squinting through her face mask to make sure she wasnt making a mistake but there was no doubt there was definitely nothing in the vial although one of the scientists might have misplaced a sample she could think of no reason a vial might be empty all her inarticulated fears that the outbreaks had stemmed from accidental or even deliberate misuse of a cdc vial filled with an african virus seemed to be confirmed a sudden movement caught marissas attention the wheel to the door leading into the disinfecting chamber was turning someone was coming in marissa was gripped with a paralyzing panic for a moment she just stared helplessly when shed recovered enough to move she put the empty vial back in the tray returned it to the freezer and closed the lid she thought about running but there was no place to go maybe she could hide she looked toward the darkened area by the animal cages but there was no time she heard the seal break on the door and two people entered the lab dressed anonymously in plastic isolation suits the smaller of the two seemed familiar with the lab showing his larger companion where he should plug in his air hose terrified marissa stayed where she was there was always the faint chance that they were cdc scientists checking on some ongoing experiment that hope faded quickly when she realized they were coming directly toward her it was at that point she noticed that the smaller individual was holding a syringe her eyes flicked to his companion who lumbered forward his elbow fixed at an odd angle stirring an unpleasant memory marissa tried to see their faces but the glare off the face plates made it impossible blumenthal asked the smaller of the two in a harsh masculine voice he reached out and rudely angled marissas mask against the light apparently he recognized her because he nodded to his companion who reached for the zipper on her suit no screamed marissa realizing these men were not security they were about to attack her just as shed been attacked in her house desperately she snatched the bicycle lock from the freezer and threw it the confusion gave marissa just enough time to detach her air hose and run toward the animal area the larger man was after her in less than a second but as he was about to grab her he was pulled up short by his air hose like a dog on a leash marissa moved as quickly as she could into the dark corridors between the stacked animal cages hearing the frightened chatter of monkeys rats chickens and god knew what else trapped within the confines of the lab she was desperate hoping to create a diversion she began opening the monkey cages the animals who werent too sick to move immediately fled soon her breathing became labored finding an air manifold which was not easy in the darkness marissa plugged in welcoming the rush of cool dry air it was obvious the larger man was unaccustomed to being in the lab but she didnt really see that it would give her much of an advantage she moved down the line of cages to where she could see into the main area of the room silhouetted against the light he was moving toward her she had no idea if he could see her or not but she stayed still mentally urging the man down a different aisle but he was unswerving he was walking right at her the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end reaching up she detached her air hose and tried to move around the far end of the row of cages before she could the man caught her left arm marissa looked up at her assailant all she could see was the slight gleam of his face plate the strength of his grip made resistance seem useless but over his shoulder she glimpsed a red handle marked emergency use only in desperation marissa reached up with her free hand and pulled the lever down instantly an alarm sounded and a sudden shower of phenolic disinfectant drenched the whole lab sending up clouds of mist and reducing the visibility to zero shocked the man released marissas arm she dropped to the floor discovering that she could slither beneath the row of cages she crawled away from the man hoping she was headed back toward the main lab she got to her feet moving forward by feel the disinfectant shower was apparently going to continue until someone replaced the lever her breathing was becoming painfully labored she needed fresh air something jumped in front of her and she nearly screamed but it was only one of the monkeys tortured by the lethal atmosphere the animal held onto her for a minute then slid off her plasticcovered shoulder and disappeared gasping marissa reached up and ran her hand along the pipes touching an air manifold she connected her line over the sound of the alarm marissa heard a commotion in the next aisle then muffled shouts she guessed that her pursuer could not find a manifold gambling that the second man would go to the aid of his accomplice marissa detached her own air hose and moved toward the light her arms stretched out in front of her like a blind man soon the illumination was uniform and she guessed she had reached the main part of the lab moving toward the wall she banged into the freezer and remembered seeing a manifold just above it she hooked up for several quick breaths then she felt her way to the door the second she found it she released the seal and pulled it open a minute later she was standing in the disinfecting room having already been drenched with phenolic disinfectant she didnt wait through the usual shower in the next room she struggled out of her plastic suit then ran into the room beyond where she tipped the lockers holding the scrub clothes over against the pressure door she didnt think it would stop the door from being opened but it might slow her pursuers down racing into her street clothes she flicked all the circuit breakers throwing even the dressing rooms into darkness and turning off the ventilation system once outside the maximum containment lab marissa ran the length of the virology building across the catwalk and to the stairs to the main floor which she bounded down two at a time taking a deep breath she tried to look relaxed as she went through the front lobby the security guard was sitting at his desk to the left he was on the phone explaining to someone that a biological alarm had gone off not a security door alarm even though she doubted her pursuers would have enlisted securitys help after having tried to kill her shed trembled violently while signing out she heard the guard hang up after he explained to the person he was talking to that the operators were busy searching for the head of the virology department hey yelled the guard as marissa started for the door her heart leapt into her mouth for a moment she thought about fleeing she was only six feet from the front door then she heard the guard say you forgot to put the time marissa marched back and dutifully filled in the blank a second later she was outside running to her car she was halfway to ralphs before she was able to stop shaking and think about her terrible discovery the missing ball of frozen ebola couldnt have been a coincidence it was the same strain as each of the recent outbreaks across the country someone was using the virus and whether intentionally or by accident the deadly disease was infecting doctors and hospitals in disparate areas at disparate times that the missing sample from vial e was the mysterious reservoir for the ebola outbreaks in the united states was the only explanation that answered the questions posed by the apparently long incubation periods and the fact that though the virus tended to mutate all of the outbreaks involved the same strain worse yet someone did not want that information released that was why shed been taken off the ebola team and why she had just been nearly killed the realization that frightened her most was that only someone with maximum containment lab accesspresumably someone on the cdc staffcould have found her there she cursed herself for not having had the presence of mind to look in the log book as she signed out to see whod signed in she had already turned down ralphs street anxious to tell him her fears when she realized that it wasnt fair to involve him shed already taken advantage of tads friendship and by the next day when he saw her name on the log she would be a total pariah her one hope was that her two assailants would not report her presence in the lab since they would then be implicated in the attempt on her life even so she couldnt count on their not devising a plausible lie about what had gone on it would be their word against hers and by tomorrow her word wouldnt mean much at the cdc of that she was sure for all she knew the atlanta police might be looking for her by morning remembering her suitcase was still in the trunk of her car marissa headed for the nearest motel as soon as she reached the room assigned her she put in a call to ralph he answered sleepily on the fifth ring i stayed up as long as i could he explained why didnt you come by its a long story said marissa i cant explain now but im in serious trouble i may even need a good criminal lawyer do you know of one good god said ralph suddenly not sleepy i think youd better tell me whats going on i dont want to drag you into it said marissa all i can say is that the whole situation has become decidedly serious and for the moment im not ready to go to the authorities i guess im a fugitive marissa laughed hollowly why dont you come over here said ralph youd be safe here ralph im serious about not wanting to involve you but i do need a lawyer could you find me one of course said ralph ill help you any way i can where are you ill be in touch said marissa evasively and thanks for being my friend marissa disconnected by pushing the button on top of the phone trying to build up her courage to call tad and apologize before he found out from someone else that shed taken his access card taking a deep breath she dialed when there was no answer after several rings she lost her nerve and decided not to wake him up marissa took the letter from lab engineering from her pocket and smoothed it out grayson was going to be her next stop may although she was exhausted marissa slept poorly tortured by nightmares of being chased through alien landscapes when the early light coming through the window awakened her it was a relief she looked out and saw a man filling the coinoperated newspaper dispenser as soon as he left she ran out and bought the atlanta journal and constitution there was nothing in it about the cdc but halfway through the morning television news the commentator said that there had been a problem at the center there was no mention of the maximum containment lab but it was repeated that a technician had been treated at emory university hospital after inhaling phenolic disinfectant and then released the segment continued with a phone interview with dr cyrill dubchek marissa leaned forward and turned up the volume the injured technician was the only casualty cyrill said his voice sounding metallic marissa wondered if he was in philadelphia or atlanta an emergency safety system was triggered by accident everything is under control and we are searching for a dr marissa blumenthal in relation to the incident the anchorperson capped the segment with the comment that if anyone knew the whereabouts of dr blumenthal they should notify the atlanta police for about ten seconds they showed the photograph that had accompanied her cdc application marissa turned off the tv shed not considered the possibility of seriously hurting her pursuers and she was upset despite the fact that the man had been trying to harm her tad was right when hed said that trouble seemed to follow her although marissa had joked about being a fugitive shed meant it figuratively now having heard the tv announcer request information about her whereabouts she realized the joke had become serious she was a wanted person at least by the atlanta police quickly getting her things together marissa went to check out of the motel the whole time she was in the office she felt nervous since her name was there in black and white for the clerk to see but all he said was have a nice day she grabbed a quick coffee and donut at a howard johnsons and drove to her bank which luckily had early hours that day although she tried to conceal her face at the drivein window in case the teller had seen the morning news the man seemed as uninterested as usual marissa extracted most of her savings amounting to with the cash in her purse she relaxed a little driving up the ramp to interstate she turned on the radio she was on her way to grayson georgia the drive was easy although longer than shed expected and not terribly interesting the only sight of note was that geological curiosity called stone mountain it was a bubble of bare granite sticking out of the wooded georgia hills like a mole on a babys bottom beyond the town of snellville marissa turned northeast on and the landscape became more and more rural finally she passed a sign welcome to grayson unfortunately it was spotted with holes as if someone had been using it for target practice reducing the sincerity of the message the town itself was exactly as marissa had imagined the main street was lined with a handful of brick and woodframe buildings there was a bankrupt movie theater and the largest commercial establishment was the hardware and feed store on one corner a granitefaced bank sported a large clock with roman numerals obviously it was just the kind of town that needed a type hepa containment hood the streets were almost empty as marissa slowly cruised along she saw no new commercial structures and realized that professional labs was probably a little ways from town she would have to inquire but whom could she approach she was not about to go to the local police at the end of the street she made a uturn and drove back there was a general store that also boasted a sign that read us post office professional labs yeah theyre out on bridge road said the proprietor he was in the drygoods section showing bolts of cotton to a customer turn yourself around and take a right at the firehouse then after parsons creek take a left youll find it its the only thing out there cept for cows what do they do asked marissa darned if i know said the storekeeper darned if i care theyre good customers and they pay their bills following the mans directions marissa drove out of the town he was right about there being nothing around but cows after parsons creek the road wasnt even paved and marissa began to wonder if she were on a wildgoose chase but then the road entered a pine forest and up ahead she could see a building with a thump marissas honda hit asphalt as the road widened into a parking area there were two other vehicles a white van with professional labs inc lettered on the side and a creamcolored mercedes marissa pulled up next to the van the building had peaked roofs and lots of mirror glass which reflected the attractive treelined setting the fragrant smell of pine surrounded her as she walked to the entrance she gave the door a pull but it didnt budge she tried to push but it was as if it were bolted shut stepping back she searched for a bell but there was none she knocked a couple of times but realized she wasnt making enough noise for anyone inside to hear giving up on the front door marissa started to walk around the building when she got to the first window she cupped her hands and tried to look through the mirror glass it was impossible do you know you are trespassing said an unfriendly voice marissas hands dropped guiltily to her sides this is private property said a stocky middleaged man dressed in blue coveralls ummm voiced marissa desperately trying to think of an excuse for her presence with his graying crew cut and florid complexion the man looked exactly like a redneck stereotype from the fifties you did see the signs asked the man gesturing to the notice by the parking lot well yes admitted marissa but you see im a doctor she hesitated being a physician didnt give her the right to violate someones privacy quickly she went on since you have a viral lab here i was interested to know if you do viral diagnostic work what makes you think this is a viral lab questioned the man id just heard it was said marissa well you heard wrong we do molecular biology here with the worry of industrial espionage we have to be very careful so i think that youd better leave unless youd like me to call the police that wont be necessary said marissa involving the police was the last thing she wanted i certainly apologize i dont mean to be a bother i would like to see your lab though isnt there some way that could be arranged out of the question the man said flatly he led marissa back to her car their footsteps crunching on the crushedstone path is there someone that i might contact to get a tour asked marissa as she slid behind the wheel im the boss said the man simply i think youd better go he stepped back from the car waiting for marissa to leave having run out of bright ideas marissa started the engine she tried smiling goodbye but the mans face remained grim as she drove off heading back to grayson he stood waiting until the little honda was lost in the trees with an irritated shake of his head he turned and walked back to the building the front door opened automatically the interior was as contemporary as the exterior he went down a short tiled corridor and entered a small lab at one end was a desk at the other was an airtight steel door like the one leading into the cdcs maximum containment lab behind which was a lab bench equipped with a type hepa filtration system another man was sitting at the desk torturing a paper clip into grotesque shapes he looked up why the hell didnt you let me handle her speaking made him cough violently bringing tears to his eyes he raised a handkerchief to his mouth because we dont know who knows she was here said the man in the blue coveralls use a little sense paul sometimes you scare me he picked up the phone and punched the number he wanted with unnecessary force dr jacksons office answered a bright cheerful voice i want to talk to the doctor im sorry but hes with a patient honey i dont care if hes with god just put him on the phone who may i say is calling asked the secretary coolly tell him the chairman of the medical ethics committee i dont care just put him on one moment please turning to the desk he said paul would you get my coffee from the counter paul tossed the paper clip into the wastebasket then heaved himself out of his chair it took a bit of effort because he was a big man and his left arm was frozen at the elbow joint hed been shot by a policeman when he was a boy who is this demanded dr joshua jackson at the other end of the phone heberling said the man in the blue coveralls dr arnold heberling remember me paul gave arnold his coffee then returned to the desk taking another paper clip out of the middle drawer he pounded his chest clearing his throat heberling said dr jackson i told you never to call me at my office the blumenthal girl was here said heberling ignoring jacksons comment she drove up pretty as you please in a red car i caught her looking through the windows how the hell did she find out about the lab i dont know and i dont care said heberling the fact of the matter is that she was here and im coming into town to see you this cant go on something has to be done about her no dont come here said jackson frantically ill come there all right said heberling but it has to be today ill be there around five said jackson slamming down the receiver marissa decided to stop in grayson for lunch she was hungry and maybe someone would tell her something about the lab she stopped in front of the drugstore went in and sat down at the oldfashioned soda fountain she ordered a hamburger which came on a freshly toasted roll with a generous slice of bermuda onion her coke was made from syrup while marissa ate she considered her options they were pretty meager she couldnt go back to the cdc or the berson clinic hospital figuring out what professional labs was doing with a sophisticated hepa filtration system was a last resort but the chances of getting in seemed slim the place was built like a fortress perhaps it was time to call ralph and ask if hed found a lawyer except marissa took a bite of her dill pickle in her minds eye she pictured the two vehicles in the labs parking lot the white van had had professional labs inc printed on its side it was the inc that interested her finishing her meal marissa walked down the street to an office building she remembered passing the door was frosted glass ronald davis attorney and real tor was stenciled on it in gold leaf a bell jangled as she entered there was a cluttered desk but no secretary a man dressed in a white shirt bow tie and red suspenders came out from an inside room although he appeared to be no more than thirty he was wearing wirerimmed glasses that seemed almost grandfatherly can i help you he asked with a heavy southern accent are you mr davis asked marissa yup the man hooked his thumbs through his suspenders i have a couple of simple questions said marissa about corporate law do you think you could answer them maybe said mr davis he motioned for marissa to come in the scene looked like a set for a s movie complete with the desktop fan that slowly rotated back and forth rustling the papers mr davis sat down and leaned back putting his hands behind his head then he said what is it you want to know i want to find out about a certain corporation began marissa if a business is incorporated can someone like myself find out the names of the owners mr davis tipped forward resting his elbows on the desk maybe and maybe not he said smiling marissa groaned it seemed that a conversation with mr davis was going to be like pulling teeth but before she could rephrase her question he continued if the company in question is a public corporation it would be hard to find out all the stockholders especially if a lot of the stock is held in trust with power of attorney delegated to a third party but if the company is a partnership then it would be easy in any case it is always possible to find out the name of the service agent if you have in mind to institute some sort of litigation is that what you have in mind no said marissa just information how would i go about finding out if a company is a partnership or a public corporation easy said mr davis leaning back once more all you have to do is go to the state house in atlanta visit the secretary of states office and ask for the corporate division just tell the clerk the name of the company and he can look it up its a matter of public record and if the company is incorporated in georgia it will be listed there thank you said marissa seeing a glimmer of light at the end of the dark tunnel how much do i owe you mr davis raised his eyebrows studying marissas face twenty dollars might do it unless my pleasure said marissa pulling out a twentydollar bill and handing it over marissa returned to her car and drove back toward atlanta she was pleased to have a goal even if the chances of finding significant information were not terribly good she stayed just under the speed limit the last thing she wanted was to be stopped by the police she made good time and was back in the city by parking in a garage she walked to the state house distinctly uncomfortable in the presence of the capitol police marissa sweated nervously as she started up the front steps certain she would be recognized dr blumenthal called a voice for a split second marissa considered running instead she turned to see one of the cdc secretaries a bright young woman in her early twenties walking toward her alice maccabe doctor carbonaras office remember me marissa did and for the next few nerveracking minutes was forced to engage in small talk luckily miss maccabe was oblivious to the fact that marissa was a wanted person as soon as she could marissa said goodbye and entered the building more than ever she just wanted to get whatever information she could and leave unfortunately there was a long line at the corporate division with dwindling patience marissa waited her turn keeping a hand to her face with the mistaken notion that it might keep her from being recognized what can i do for you asked the whitehaired clerk when it was finally marissas turn id like some information about a corporation called professional labs where is it located asked the clerk he slipped on his bifocals and entered the name at a computer terminal grayson georgia said marissa okay said the clerk here it is incorporated just last year what would you like to know is it a partnership or a public corporation asked marissa trying to remember what mr davis had said limited partnership subchapter s what does that mean asked marissa it has to do with taxes the partners can deduct the corporate losses if there are any on their individual returns are the partners listed asked marissa excitement overcoming her anxiety for the moment yup said the clerk theres joshua jackson rodd becker just a second said marissa let me write this down she got out a pen and began writing lets see said the clerk staring at the computer screen jackson becker you got those yes theres sinclair tieman jack krause gustave swenson duane moody trent goodridge and the physicians action congress what was that last one asked marissa scribbling furiously the clerk repeated it can an organization be a limited partner she had seen the name physicians action congress on markhams contributions list im no lawyer lady but i think so well it must be so or it wouldnt be in here heres something else a law firm by the name of cooper hodges mcquinllin and hanks theyre partners too asked marissa starting to write down the additional names no said the clerk theyre the service agent i dont need that said marissa im not interested in suing the company she erased the names of cooper and hodges thanking the clerk marissa beat a hasty retreat and hurried back to the parking garage once inside her car she opened her briefcase and took out the photocopies of markhams contributors list just as shed remembered the physicians action congress pac was listed on the one hand it was a limited partner in an economic venture on the other a contributor to a conservative politicians reelection campaign curious marissa looked to see if any of the other partners of professional labs were on markhams list to her surprise they all were more astonishing the partners like markhams contributors came from all over the country from markhams list she had all their addresses marissa put her key in the ignition then hesitated looking back at markhams list she noted that the physicians action congress was listed under corporate sponsors much as she hated to tempt fate by passing the capitol police again she forced herself to get out of the car and walk back she waited in line for the second time for the same clerk and asked him what he could tell her about the physicians action congress the clerk punched in the name on his terminal waited for a moment then turned to marissa i cant tell you anything its not in here does that mean its not incorporated not necessarily it means its not incorporated in georgia marissa thanked the man again and again ran out of the building her car felt like a sanctuary she sat for a few minutes trying to decide what to do next she really didnt have all that much information and she was getting rather far afield from the ebola outbreaks but her intuition told her that in some weird way everything she had learned was related and if that were the case then the physicians action congress was the key but how could she investigate an organization shed never heard of her first thought was to visit the emory medical school library perhaps one of the librarians might know where to look but then remembering running into alice maccabe she decided the chance of being recognized was too great she would do much better to go out of town for a few days but where starting the car marissa had an inspiration the ama if she couldnt get information about a physicians organization at the ama then it wasnt available and chicago sounded safe she headed south toward the airport hoping the meager supply of clothing in her suitcase would hold up joshua jacksons heavy sedan thundered over the woodplanked bridge spanning parsons creek then veered sharply to the left the tires squealing the pavement stopped and the car showered the shoulder of the road with pebbles as it sped down the treelined lane inside jacksons fury mounted with each mile he traveled he didnt want to visit the lab but he had no intention of being seen in town with heberling the man was proving increasingly unreliable and even worse unpredictable asked to create minor confusion he resorted to atomic warfare hiring him had been a terrible decision but there wasnt much any of them could do about the fact now pulling up to the lab jackson parked across from heberlings mercedes he knew that heberling had bought it with some of the funds hed been given for technical equipment what a waste jackson walked up to the front of the building it was an impressive affair and jackson perhaps better than anyone knew how much money it had all cost the physicians action congress had built dr arnold heberling a personal monument and for what a hell of a lot of trouble because heberling was a nut there was a click the door opened and jackson stepped inside im in the conference room shouted heberling jackson knew the room heberling meant and it was hardly a conference room jackson paused at the door taking in the high ceiling glass wall and stark furnishings two chippendale couches faced one another on a large chinese rug there was no other furniture heberling was on one of the couches i hope this is important said jackson taking the initiative the two men sat facing each other physically they couldnt have been more different heberling was stocky with a bloated face and coarse features jackson was tall and thin with an almost ascetic face their clothes helped heighten the contrast heberling in coveralls jackson in a bankers pinstripes the blumenthal girl was right here in the yard said heberling pointing over his shoulder for effect obviously she didnt see anything but just the fact that she was here suggests that she knows something shes got to be removed you had your chance snapped jackson twice and each time you and your thugs made a mess of things first at her house and then last night at the cdc so we try again but youve called it off youre darn right i found out you were going to give her ebola why not said heberling shes been exposed thered be no questions i dont want an ebola outbreak in atlanta shouted jackson the stuff terrifies me ive got a family of my own leave the woman to us well take care of her oh sure scoffed heberling thats what you said when you got her transferred off special pathogens well shes still a threat to the whole project and i intend to see that shes eliminated you are not in charge here said jackson menacingly and when it comes to fixing blame none of us would be in this mess if youd stuck to the original plan of using influenza virus weve all been in a state of panic since we learned you took it upon yourself to use ebola oh were back to that complaint said heberling disgustedly you were pretty pleased when you heard the richter clinic was closing if pac wanted to undermine the publics growing confidence in prepaid health clinics they couldnt have done better the only difference from the original plan was that i got to carry out some field research that will save me years of lab research time jackson studied heberlings face hed come to the conclusion the man was a psychopath and loathed him unfortunately the realization was a bit late once the project had started there was no easy way to stop it and to think that the plan had sounded so simple back when the pac executive committee had first suggested it jackson took a deep breath knowing he had to control himself despite his anger ive told you a dozen times the physicians action congress is not pleased and on the contrary is appalled at the loss of life that had never been our intent and you know it dr heberling bullshit shouted heberling there would have been loss of life with influenza given the strains we would have had to use how many would you have tolerated a hundred and what about the loss of life you rich practitioners cause when you turn your backs on unnecessary surgery or allow incompetent doctors to keep their hospital privileges we do not sanction unnecessary surgery or incompetence snapped jackson hed had about as much of this psychopath as he could tolerate you do nothing to stop them said heberling with disgust i havent believed any of this crap you and pac feed me about your concern for the negative drift of american medicine away from its traditional values give me a break its all an attempt to justify your own economic interests all of a sudden there are too many doctors and not enough patients the only reason ive cooperated with you is because you built me this lab heberling made a sweeping gesture with his hand you wanted the image of prepaid health plans tarnished and i delivered the only difference is that i did it my way for my own reasons but we ordered you to stop yelled jackson right after the richter clinic outbreak halfheartedly i might add said heberling you were pleased with the results not only did the richter clinic fold but new subscribers to california health plans have leveled off for the first time in five years the physicians action congress feels an occasional twinge of conscience but basically youre all happy and ive vindicated my beliefs that ebola is a premier biological weapon despite the lack of vaccine or treatment ive shown that it is easily introduced relatively easy to contain and devastatingly contagious to small populations dr jackson we are both getting what we want we just have to deal with this woman before she causes real trouble im telling you once and for all said jackson we want no further use of ebola thats an order heberling laughed dr jackson he said leaning forward i have the distinct impression that you are ignoring the facts pac is no longer in a position to give me orders do you realize what would happen to your careers if the truth gets out and im telling you that it will unless you let me handle blumenthal in my own way for a moment jackson struggled with his conscience he wanted to grab heberling by the neck and choke him but he knew the man was right pacs hands were tied all right he said reluctantly do whatever you think is best about dr blumenthal just dont tell me about it and dont use ebola in atlanta fine heberling smiled if that will make you feel better ill give you my word on both accounts after all im a very reasonable man jackson stood up one other thing i dont want you phoning my office call me at home on my private line if you have to reach me my pleasure said heberling since the atlantachicago run was heavily traveled marissa only had to wait half an hour for the next available flight she bought a dick francis novel but she couldnt concentrate finally she decided to call tad and at least attempt an apology she wasnt sure how much to tell him about her growing suspicions but decided to play it by ear she dialed the lab and as she suspected he was working late this is marissa she said when he answered are you mad at me im furious tad im sorry you took one of my access cards tad im truly sorry when i see you ill explain everything you actually went into the maximum containment lab didnt you tad said his voice uncharacteristically hard well yes marissa do you know that the lab is a shambles all the animals are dead and someone had to be treated at emory emergency two men came into the lab and attacked me attacked you yes said marissa you have to believe me i dont know what to believe why does everything happen to you because of the ebola outbreaks tad do you know who got hurt i assume one of the techs from another department why dont you find out and maybe you could also find out who else went into the lab last night i dont think thats possible no one will tell me anything right now because they know were friends where are you im at the airport said marissa if what you say about being attacked is true then you should come back here and explain you shouldnt be running away im not running away insisted marissa im going to the ama in chicago to research an organization called the physicians action congress ever hear of them i believe they are involved somehow marissa i think you should come directly back to the center youre in real trouble in case you dont know i do but for the time being what im doing is more important cant you please ask the office of biosafety who else went into the maximum containment lab last night marissa im in no mood to be manipulated tad i marissa stopped speaking tad had hung up slowly she replaced the receiver she couldnt really blame him she glanced at the clock five minutes until boarding making up her mind she dialed ralphs home number he picked up on the third ring in contrast to tad he was concerned not angry my god marissa what is going on your name is in the evening paper youre in serious trouble the atlanta police are looking for you i can imagine said marissa thinking that shed been wise to use a false name and pay cash when shed bought her airline ticket ralph have you gotten the name of a good lawyer yet im sorry when you asked i didnt realize it was an emergency its becoming an emergency said marissa but ill be out of town for a day or two so if you could do it tomorrow id really appreciate it whats going on asked ralph the paper gave no details like i said last night i dont want to involve you i dont mind ralph insisted why dont you come over here we can talk and i can get you a lawyer in the morning have you ever heard of an organization called the physicians action congress asked marissa ignoring ralphs offer no said ralph marissa please come over i think it would be better to face this problem whatever it is running away makes you look bad marissa heard her flight called im going to the ama to find out about the organization i just mentioned said marissa quickly ill call tomorrow ive got to run she hung up picked up her briefcase and book and boarded the plane may arriving in chicago marissa decided to treat herself to a nice hotel and was happy to find the palmer house had a room she risked using her credit card and went straight upstairs to bed the next morning she ordered fresh fruit and coffee from room service while waiting she turned on the today show and went into the bathroom to shower she was drying her hair when she heard the anchorman mention ebola she rushed into the bedroom expecting to see the news commentator giving an update on the situation in philadelphia instead he was describing a new outbreak it was at the rosenberg clinic on upper fifth avenue in new york city a doctor by the name of girish mehta had been diagnosed as having the disease word had leaked to the press and a widespread panic had gripped the city marissa shivered the philadelphia outbreak was still in progress and another one had already started she put on her makeup finished fixing her hair and ate her breakfast marissa got the amas address and set out for rush street a year ago if someone had told her shed be visiting the association she never would have believed it but there she was going through the front door the woman at the information booth directed her to the public relations office the director a james frank happened by as marissa was trying to explain her needs to one of the secretaries he invited her to his office mr frank reminded marissa of her highschool guidance counselor he was of indeterminate age slightly overweight and going bald but his face had a livedin look that exuded friendliness and sincerity his eyes were bright and he laughed a lot marissa liked him instantly physicians action congress he repeated when marissa asked about the organization ive never heard of it where did you come across it on a congressmans contributions list said marissa thats funny said mr frank id have sworn that i knew all the active political action committees let me see what my computer says mr frank punched in the name there was a slight delay then the screen blinked to life what do you know youre absolutely right its right here he pointed to the screen physicians action congress political action committee its a registered separate segregated fund what does that mean asked marissa less than it sounds it just means that your physicians action congress is an incorporated membership organization because it has legally set up a committee to dispense funds as campaign contributions lets see who they have been supporting i can tell you one candidate said marissa calvin markham mr frank nodded yup heres markhams name along with a number of other conservative candidates at least we know the political bent right wing said marissa probably very right wing said mr frank id guess they are trying to knock off drgsdiagnosisrelated groupslimit immigration of foreign medical school graduates stop hmo startup subsidies and the like let me call someone i know at the federal elections commission after some chitchat he asked his friend about the physicians action congress he nodded a few times while he listened then hung up and turned to marissa he doesnt know much about pac either except he looked up their statement of organization and told me they are incorporated in delaware why delaware questioned marissa incorporation is cheapest there what are the chances of finding out more about the organization asked marissa like what who the officers are where the home office is that kind of stuff yes said marissa picking up the phone again frank said lets see what we can learn from delaware he was quite successful although initially a clerk in the delaware state house said that hed have to come in person for the information mr frank managed to get a supervisor to bend the rules mr frank was on the line for almost fifteen minutes writing as he listened when he was done he handed marissa a list of the board of directors she looked down president joshua jackson md vicepresident rodd becker md treasurer sinclair tieman md secretary jack krause md directors gustave swenson md duane moody md and trent goodridge md opening her briefcase she took out the list of partners for professional labs they were the same names marissa left the ama with her head spinning the question that loomed in her mind was almost too bizarre to consider what was an ultraconservative physicians organization doing with a lab that owned sophisticated equipment used only for handling deadly viruses purposely marissa did not answer her own question her mind churning marissa began walking in the direction of her hotel other pedestrians jostled her but she paid no heed trying to pick holes in her own theory marissa ticked off the significant facts each of the outbreaks of ebola had occurred in a private group prepaid healthcare facility most of the index patients had foreignsounding names and in each case where there was an index patient the man had been mugged just prior to getting sick the one exception was the phoenix outbreak which she still believed was food borne out of the corner of her eye she saw a display of charles jourdan shoesher one weakness stopping abruptly to glance in the store window she was startled when a man behind her almost knocked her over he gave her an angry look but she ignored him a plan was forming in her mind if her suspicions had any merit and the previous outbreaks had not been the result of chance then the index patient in new york was probably working for a prepaid healthcare clinic and had been mugged a few days previous to becoming ill marissa decided she had to go to new york looking around she tried to figure out where she was in relation to her hotel she could see the el in front of her and remembered that the train traveled the loop near the palmer house she began walking briskly when she was suddenly overwhelmed with fear no wonder shed been attacked in her home no wonder the man whod caught her in the maximum containment lab had tried to kill her no wonder markham had had her transferred if her fears were true then a conspiracy of immense proportions existed and she was in extreme jeopardy up until that moment shed felt safe in chicago now everywhere she looked she saw suspicious characters there was a man pretending to windowshop she was sure was watching her in the reflection she crossed the street expecting the man to follow but he didnt marissa ducked into a coffee shop and ordered a cup of tea to calm down she sat at a window table and stared out at the street the man who had scared her came out of the store with a shopping bag and hailed a cab so much for him it was at that moment that she saw the businessman it was the way he was carrying his briefcase that caught her attention his arm at an awkward angle as though he couldnt flex his elbow in a flash marissa was back in her own home desperately fighting the unseen figure whose arm seemed frozen at the joint and then there was the nightmare in the lab as marissa watched the man took out a cigarette and lit it all with one hand the other never leaving his briefcase marissa remembered that tad had said the intruder had carried a briefcase covering her face with her hands marissa prayed she was imagining things she sat rubbing her eyes for a minute and when she looked again the man was gone marissa finished her tea then asked directions to the palmer house she walked quickly nervously switching her own briefcase from hand to hand at the first corner she looked over her shoulder the same businessman was coming toward her immediately changing directions marissa crossed the street out of the corner of her eye she watched the man continue to the middle of the block and then cross after her with a rising sense of panic she looked for a taxi but the street was clear instead she turned around and ran back to the elevated train hurriedly she climbed the stairs catching up to a large group she wanted to be in a crowd once on the platform she felt better there were lots of people standing about and marissa walked a good distance away from the entrance her heart was still pounding but at least she could think was it really the same man had he been following her as if in answer to her question the man popped into her line of vision he had large features and coarse skin and a heavy fiveoclock shadow his teeth were square and widely spaced he coughed into a closed fist before she could move the train thundered into the station and the crowd surged forward taking marissa along with the rest she lost sight of the man as she was carried into the car fighting to stay near the door marissa hoped she could detrain at the last moment as shed seen people do in spy movies but the crush of people hampered her and the doors closed before she could get to them turning she scanned the faces around her but she did not see the man with the stiff elbow the train lurched forward forcing her to reach for a pole just as she grabbed it she saw him again he was right next to her holding onto the same pole with the hand of his good arm he was so close marissa could smell his cologne he turned and their eyes met a slight smile formed at the corners of his mouth as he let go of the pole he coughed and reached into his jacket pocket losing control marissa screamed frantically she tried to push away from the man but she was again hindered by the crush of people her scream died and no one moved or spoke they just stared at her the wheels of the train shrieked as they hit a sharp bend and marissa and the man had to grab the pole to keep from falling their hands touched marissa let go of the pole as if it were red hot then to her utter relief a transit policeman managed to shove his way over to her are you all right yelled the policeman over the sounds of the train this man has been following me said marissa pointing the policeman looked at the businessman is this true the man shook his head ive never seen her before i dont know what shes talking about the policeman turned back to marissa as the train began to slow would you care to file a complaint no yelled marissa as long as he leaves me alone the screech of the wheels and the hiss of the air brakes made it impossible to hear until the train stopped the doors opened instantly ill be happy to get off if it would make the lady feel better said the businessman a few people got off everyone else just stared the policeman kept the door from closing with his body and looked questioningly at marissa i would feel better said marissa suddenly unsure of her reactions the businessman shrugged his shoulders and got off almost immediately the doors closed and the train lurched forward once again you all right now asked the policeman much better said marissa she was relieved the businessman was gone but afraid the cop might ask for her identification she thanked him then looked away he took the hint and moved on realizing that every eye within sight was still on her marissa was acutely embarrassed as soon as the train pulled into the next station she got off descending to the street and irrationally afraid the man had found a way to follow her she caught the first cab she could to take her to the palmer house within the security of the taxi marissa was able to regain a degree of control she knew she was in over her head but she had no idea to whom in authority she could go she was presupposing a conspiracy but had no idea of its extent and worst of all she had no proof nothingjust a few highly suggestive facts she decided she might as well continue on to new york if her suspicions about that outbreak proved to be correct shed decide there who to contact meanwhile she hoped that ralph had found her a good lawyer maybe he could handle the whole thing as soon as she got back to the hotel marissa went directly to her room with her present paranoia she wanted out as soon as possible criticizing herself for having used a credit card and hence her own name shed used an assumed name and paid cash for the flight from atlanta to chicago and she should have done the same at the hotel going up in the elevator marissa had decided she would pack her few things and go right to the airport she opened her door and headed straight for the bathroom tossing her purse and briefcase onto the desk out of the corner of her eye she saw movement and ducked automatically even so she was struck so hard she was knocked forward over the nearest twin bed ending up on the floor between them looking up she saw the man from the train coming toward her frantically she tried to scramble beneath one of the beds but the man got ahold of her skirt with his good arm and yanked her back marissa rolled over kicking furiously something fell out of the mans hand and hit the floor with a metallic thud a gun thought marissa compounding her terror the man bent to retrieve the gun and marissa slithered beneath the bed closest to the door the man returned checking first under one bed then under the one where marissa was cowering his large hand reached for her when he couldnt grab her he got down on his knees and lunged under the bed catching marissa by an ankle and pulling her toward him for the second time that day marissa screamed she kicked again and loosened the mans grip in a flash she was back under the bed tiring of the tug of war he dropped his gun onto the bed and came after her but marissa rolled out the other side she scrambled to her feet and ran for the door she had just wrenched it open when the man leaped across the bed and caught her hair whipping her around he threw her against the bureau with such force that the mirror fell with a crash the man checked the hall quickly then closed and secured the door marissa ran to the bathroom grabbing what she thought was the gun off the far bed she had almost managed to get the bathroom door closed before the man reached it marissa wedged her back against the sink and tried to keep her attacker from opening the door farther but little by little his greater strength prevailed the door cracked open enabling him to get the arm with the frozen elbow hooked around the jamb marissa eyed the wall phone but couldnt reach it without taking her feet off the door she looked at the weapon in her hand wondering if it would scare the man if she were to fire a bullet at the wall that was when she realized she was holding an airpowered vaccination gun of the kind used for mass inoculations in her old pediatrics clinic the door had opened enough for the man to move his arm more freely he blindly groped until he got a grip on one of marissas ankles feeling she had little choice marissa pressed the vaccination gun against the mans forearm and discharged it the man screamed the arm was withdrawn and the door slammed shut she heard him run across the room open the door to the hall and rush out going back into the bedroom marissa breathed a sigh of relief only to be startled by a strong odor of phenolic disinfectant turning the vaccinator toward herself with a shaky hand she examined the circular business end intuitively she sensed the gun contained ebola virus and she guessed that the disinfectant she smelled was part of a mechanism to prevent exposure to the operator now she was truly terrified not only had she possibly killed a man she might also have triggered a new outbreak forcing herself to remain calm she carefully placed the gun in a plastic bag that she took from the wastebasket and then got another plastic bag from the basket under the desk and placed it over the first knotting it closed for a moment she hesitated wondering if she should call the police then she decided there was nothing they could do the man was far away by now and if the vaccination gun did contain ebola there was no way they could find him quietly if he didnt want to be found marissa looked out into the hall it was clear she put a do not disturb sign on the door then carried her belongings including the plastic bag with the vaccination gun down to housekeeping there were no cleaning people in sight she found a bottle of lysol and disinfected the outside of the plastic bag then she washed and disinfected her hands she couldnt think of anything else to do prophylactically in the lobby where there were enough people to make marissa feel reasonably safe she called the illinois state epidemiologist without identifying herself she explained that room at the palmer house might have been contaminated with ebola virus before the man could gasp out a single question she hung up next she called tad all this activity was enabling her to avoid thinking about what had just happened tads initial coolness thawed when he realized that she was on the verge of hysteria what on earth is going on now he asked marissa are you all right i have to ask two favors after the trouble ive caused you id vowed that i wouldnt bother you again but i have no choice first i need a vial of the convalescent serum from the la outbreak could you send it by overnight carrier to carol bradford at the plaza hotel in new york who the hell is carol bradford please dont ask any questions said marissa struggling to keep from bursting into tears the less you know at this point the better carol bradford had been one of marissas college roommates it was the name shed used on the flight from atlanta to chicago the next favor involves a parcel im sending you by overnight carrier please do not open it take it inside the maximum containment lab and hide it marissa paused is that it asked tad thats it said marissa will you help me tad i guess said tad sounds reasonably innocuous thank you said marissa ill be able to explain everything in a few days she hung up and called the westin hotel tollfree number and reserved a room at the plaza for that night under the name of carol bradford that accomplished she scanned the palmer house lobby no one seemed to be paying her any heed trusting that the hotel would bill her on her credit card she did not bother to check out the first stop was a federal express office the people were extremely nice when she told them it was a special vaccine needed in atlanta by the next day they helped her pack her plastic bags in an unbreakable metal box and even addressed it when they saw how badly her hand was trembling back on the street she flagged a cab to ohare as soon as she was seated she began checking her lymph nodes and testing her throat for soreness shed been close to ebola before but never this close she shuddered to think that the man had intended to infect her with the virus it was a cruel irony that the only way shed escaped was to have infected him she hoped that he realized the convalescent serum had a protective effect if it was given prior to the appearance of symptoms maybe that was why the man had left so precipitously during the long ride to the airport she began to calm down enough to think logically the fact that shed been attacked again gave more credence to her suspicions and if the vaccination gun proved to contain ebola shed have her first real piece of evidence the taxi driver dropped marissa at the american airlines terminal explaining that they had hourly flights to new york once she got her ticket passed through security and hiked the long distance to the gate she found she had nearly half an hour to wait she decided to call ralph she badly needed to hear a friendly voice and she wanted to ask about the lawyer marissa spent several minutes struggling with ralphs secretary who guarded him as if he were the pope pleading with the woman to at least let him know she was on the line finally ralph picked up the phone i hope youre back in atlanta he said before she could say hello soon promised marissa she explained that she was at the american terminal in chicago on her way to new york but that shed probably be back in atlanta the following day particularly if hed found her a good lawyer i made some discreet inquiries said ralph and i think i have just the man his name is mcquinllin hes with a large firm here in atlanta i hope hes smart said marissa hes going to have his hands full supposedly hes one of the best do you think that he will require a lot of money up front chances are hell want a retainer of some sort said ralph will that be a problem could be said marissa depends on how much well dont worry said ralph ill be happy to lend a hand i couldnt ask you to do that said marissa youre not asking im offering said ralph but in return id like you to stop this crazy trip whats so important in new york i hope its not the new ebola outbreak you dont want a repeat of philadelphia why dont you just fly back to atlanta im worried about you soon said marissa i promise after hanging up marissa kept her hand on the receiver it always made her feel good to talk with ralph he cared like most of the businesspeople who comprised ninety percent of the passengers marissa ordered herself a drink she was still a bundle of nerves the vodka tonic calmed her considerably and she actually got into one of those where you from and what do you do conversations with a handsome young bond dealer from chicago named danny it turned out he had a sister who was a doctor in hawaii he chatted so enthusiastically marissa finally had to close her eyes and feign sleep in order to find time to put her thoughts in order the question that loomed in her mind was how had the man with the frozen arm known she was in chicago and assuming it was the same man how had he known when shed been in the maximum containment lab to answer both questions marissas mind reluctantly turned to tad when tad had discovered the missing card he must have known she would use it that night maybe he told dubchek to avoid getting into trouble himself tad had also known she was flying to chicago but she simply couldnt believe he had intentionally set a murderer on her trail and much as she resented dubchek she respected him as a dedicated scientist it was hard to connect him with the financially oriented rightwing physicians action congress thoroughly confused as to what was intelligent deduction and what paranoid delusion marissa wished she hadnt let the vaccination gun out of her hands if tad was somehow involved then shed lost her only hard evidence provided it tested positive for ebola as her plane touched down at la guardia airport marissa decided that if the new york outbreak confirmed her theories about the origin of the ebola outbreaks she would go directly to ralphs lawyer and let him and the police sort things out she just wasnt up to playing nancy drew any longer not against a group of men who thought nothing of risking entire populations when the plane stopped and the seatbelt sign went off indicating that they had arrived at the gate marissa stood and wrestled her suitcase out of the overhead bin danny insisted on helping her down the jetway but when they said goodbye marissa vowed she would be more careful in the future no more conversations with strangers and she would not tell anyone her real name in fact she decided not to check into the plaza as carol bradford instead shed stay overnight at the nearby essex house using the name of her old highschool chum lisa kendrick george valhala stood by the avis rentacar counter and casually scanned the crowds in the baggage area his employers had nicknamed him the toad not because of any physical characteristic but rather because of his unusual patience enabling him to sit still for hours on a stakeout like a toad waiting for an insect but this job was not going to utilize his special talent hed only been at the airport for a short time and his information was that the girl would arrive on the five oclock or the six oclock flight from chicago the five oclock had just landed and a few passengers were beginning to appear around the appropriate carousel the only minor problem that george foresaw was that the description hed been given was vague a cute short thirtyyearold female with brown hair usually he worked with a photo but in this case there hadnt been time to get one then he saw her it had to be her she was almost a foot shorter than everyone else in the army of attach√©casetoting travelers swarming the baggage area and he noticed that she was bypassing the carousel having apparently carried her suitcase off the plane pushing off the avis counter george wandered toward marissa to get a good fix on her appearance he followed her outside where she joined the taxi queue she definitely was cute and she definitely was little george wondered how on earth shed managed to overpower paul in chicago the idea that she was some kind of martialarts expert flitted through his mind one way or another george felt some respect for this little trick he knew al did too otherwise al wouldnt be going through all this trouble having gotten a look at her up close george crossed the street in front of the terminal and climbed into a taxi waiting opposite the taxi stand the driver twisted around looking at george you see her he was a skinny fellow with birdlike features quite a contrast to georges pearshaped obesity jake do i look like an idiot start the car shes in the taxi line jake did as he was told he and george had been working for al for four years and they got along fine except when george started giving orders but that wasnt too often there she is said george pointing marissa was climbing into a cab pull up a little and let her cab pass us hey im driving said jake you watch i drive nonetheless he put the car in gear and started slowly forward george watched out the rear window noticing marissas cab had a dented roof he said that will be easy to follow the taxi passed them on the right and jake pulled out behind he allowed one car to get between them before they entered the long island expressway there was no problem keeping marissas cab in sight even though the driver took the queensborough bridge which was crowded with rushhour traffic after forty minutes they watched her get out in front of the essex house jake pulled over to the curb fifty feet beyond the hotel well now we know where shes staying said jake just to be certain im going in to see that she registers said george ill be right back may marissa did not sleep well after the incident in the room at the palmer house she might never feel comfortable in a hotel again every noise in the hall made her fearful thinking someone would try to break in and there were plenty of noises what with people returning late and ordering from room service she also kept imagining symptoms she could not forget the feel of the vaccination gun in her hand and each time she woke up she was certain she had a fever or was otherwise ill by the next morning she was totally exhausted she ordered fresh fruit and coffee which arrived with a complimentary new york times the front page carried an article about the ebola outbreaks in new york the number of cases had risen to eleven with one death while in philadelphia the count stood at thirtysix with seventeen deaths the single death in new york was the initial case dr girish mehta starting at ten marissa repeatedly called the plaza hotel to inquire after a parcel for carol bradford she intended to keep calling until noon the overnight carriers generally guaranteed delivery by that time if the parcel arrived she would be less wary of tads betraying her and would then go up to the rosenberg clinic just after eleven she was told that the package was there and that it was being held for the guests arrival as marissa prepared to leave the hotel she didnt know whether to be surprised that tad had sent the serum or not of course the package could be empty or its arrival only a ruse to get her to reveal her whereabouts unfortunately there was no way for marissa to be sure and she wanted the serum enough to make her doubts academic she would have to take a chance taking only her purse marissa tried to think of a way of obtaining the package that would involve the least risk unfortunately she didnt have any bright ideas other than to have a cab waiting and to be sure there were plenty of people around george valhala had been in the lobby of the essex house since early that morning this was the kind of situation that he loved hed had coffee read the papers and ogled some handsome broads all in all hed had a great time and none of the house detectives had bothered him dressed as he was in an armani suit and genuine alligator shoes he was considering ducking into the mens room when he saw marissa get off the elevator he dropped his new york post and beat her out the revolving door dodging fiftyninth street traffic he jogged across to the taxi where jake was waiting and climbed into the front seat jake had spotted marissa and had already started the car she looks even cuter in daylight he said preparing to make a uturn you sure thats blumenthal asked the man who had been waiting in the backseat his name was alphonse hicktman but few people teased him about his first name just calling him al as he requested hed grown up in east germany and had fled to the west over the berlin wall his face was deceptively youthful his hair was blond and he wore it short in a julius caesarstyle shag his pale blue eyes were as cold as a winter sky she registered under the name of lisa kendrick but she fits the description said george its her all right shes either awfully good or awfully lucky said al weve got to isolate her without any slipups heberling says she could blow the whole deal they watched as marissa climbed into a taxi and headed east despite the traffic jake made his uturn then worked his way up to a position only two cars behind marissas taxi look lady you got to tell me where you want to go said marissas driver eyeing her in his rearview mirror marissa was twisted around still watching the entrance to the essex house no one had come out who appeared to be following her facing forward she told the driver to go around the block she was still trying to think of a safe way to get the serum the driver muttered something under his breath as he proceeded to turn right at the corner marissa looked at the fifth avenue entrance to the plaza there were loads of cars and the little park in front of the hotel was crowded with people horsedrawn hansom cabs lined the curb waiting for customers there were even several mounted policemen with shiny blue and black helmets marissa felt encouraged there was no way anybody could surprise her in such a setting as they came back down fiftyninth street marissa told the driver that she wanted him to stop at the plaza and wait while she ran inside lady i think ill only be a moment said marissa there are plenty of cabs pointed out the driver why dont you get another ill add five dollars to the metered fare said marissa and i promise i wont be long marissa treated the man to the largest smile she could muster under the circumstances the driver shrugged his reservations seemed adequately covered by the fivedollar tip and the smile he pulled up to the plaza the hotel doorman opened the door and marissa got out she was extremely nervous expecting the worst at any second she watched as her cab pulled up about thirty feet from the entrance satisfied she went inside as shed hoped the ornate lobby was busy without hesitating marissa crossed to a jewelry display window and pretended to be absorbed scanning the reflection in the glass she checked the area for signs anyone was watching her no one seemed to notice her at all crossing the lobby again she approached the concierges desk and waited her heart pounding may i see some identification asked the man when marissa requested the parcel momentarily confused marissa said she didnt have any with her then your room key will be adequate said the man trying to be helpful but i havent checked in yet said marissa the man smiled why dont you check in and then get your parcel i hope you understand we do have a responsibility of course said marissa her confidence shaken she obviously had not thought this out as carefully as she should have recognizing she had little choice she walked to the registration desk even that process was complicated when she said she didnt want to use a credit card the clerk made her go to the cashier to leave a sizable cash deposit before he would give her a room key finally armed with the key she got her federal express package tearing open the parcel as she walked marissa lifted out the vial and glanced at it it seemed authentic she threw the wrapping in a trash can and pocketed the serum so far so good emerging from the revolving door marissa hesitated while her eyes adjusted to the midday glare her cab was still where shed last seen it the doorman asked if she wanted transportation and marissa smiled and shook her head she looked up and down fiftyninth street if anything the traffic had increased on the sidewalk hundreds of people rushed along as if they were all late for some important meeting it was a scene of bright sun and purposeful bustle satisfied marissa descended the few steps to the street and ran the short distance to her cab reaching the car and grasping the rear door handle she cast one last look over her shoulder at the plaza entrance no one was following her her fears about tad had been unfounded she was about to slide inside when she found herself staring into the muzzle of a gun held by a blond man whod apparently been lying on the backseat the man started to speak but marissa didnt give him time she swung herself clear of the cab and slammed the door the weapon discharged with a hiss it was some kind of sophisticated air gun the cab window shattered but marissa was no longer looking she took off running as shed never run before out of the corner of her eye she noticed that the cab driver had bolted out of his car and was running diagonally away from her the next time she looked over her shoulder she saw the blond man headed in her direction pushing his way through the crowds the sidewalk was an obstacle course of people luggage pushcarts baby carriages and dogs the blond man had pocketed his weapon but she no longer was convinced the crowds provided the protection she had hoped for who would even notice the air guns soft hiss shed just fall to the ground and her attacker would escape before anyone realized shed been shot people shouted as she crashed by them but she kept going the confusion she caused hampered the blond man but not dramatically he was gaining on her running across the drive east of the plaza marissa dodged taxis and limos reaching the edge of the small park with its central fountain she was in a full panic with no destination but she knew she had to do something it was at that moment that she saw the mounted policemans horse it was loosely tethered to the link chain fence that bordered the tiny patch of grass in the park as marissa ran toward the horse she searched desperately for the policeman she knew he had to be near but there was so little time she could hear the blond mans heels strike the sidewalk then hesitate hed arrived at the drive separating the park from the hotel reaching the horse marissa grabbed the reins and ducked underneath as the animal nervously tossed its head looking back marissa saw the man was in the street rounding a limo frantically marissas eyes swept the small park there were plenty of people many of them looking in her direction but no policeman giving up she turned and started running across the park there was no chance to hide her pursuer was too close a good crowd was seated by the fountain watching her with studied indifference new yorkers they were accustomed to any form of excess including panicfilled flight as marissa rounded the side of the fountain the blond man was so close she could hear him breathe turning again marissa collided with the people streaming into the park pushing and shoving marissa forced her way through the pedestrians hearing people muttering hey you the nerve and worse breaking into a clear space she thought she was free until she realized she was in the center of a circle of several hundred people three muscular blacks were break dancing to a rap song marissas desperate eyes met those of the youths she saw only anger shed crashed their act before anyone could move the blond man stumbled into the circle coming to an offbalance halt he started to raise his air gun but he didnt get far with a practiced kick one of the infuriated dancers sent the weapon on a low arc into the crowd people began to move away as marissas pursuer countered with a kick of his own the dancer caught the blow on his forearm and fell to the ground three of his friends whod been watching from the sidelines leaped to their feet and rushed the blond man from behind marissa didnt wait she melted into the crowd that had backed away from the sudden brawl most of the people were crossing fifth avenue and she did the same once north of fiftyninth street she hailed another taxi and told the driver she wanted the rosenberg clinic as the cab turned on fiftyninth marissa could see a sizable crowd near the fountain the mounted policeman was finally back on his horse and she hoped he would keep the blond man occupied for several weeks once again marissa looked over at the plaza entrance there was no unusual activity going on as far as she could see marissa sat back and closed her eyes instead of fear she was suddenly consumed with anger she was furious with everyone particularly with tad there could be little doubt now that he was telling her pursuers her whereabouts even the serum that shed gone to so much trouble to obtain was useless with her current suspicions there was no way shed inject herself with it instead shed have to take her chances that the vaccination gun had been designed to adequately protect the user for a short time she considered skipping her visit to the rosenberg clinic but the importance of proving at least to herself that the ebola was being deliberately spread won out she had to be sure besides after the last elaborate attack no one would be expecting her marissa had the cab drop her off a little way from the clinic and went the remaining block on foot the place certainly was not hard to find it was a fancy renovated structure that occupied most of a city block a mobile tv truck and several police cruisers were parked out front a number of officers lounged on the granite steps marissa had to flash her cdc identity card before they let her through the lobby was in the same state of confusion as the other hospitals that had suffered an ebola outbreak as she threaded her way through the crowd she began to lose her resolve the anger shed felt in the taxi waned replaced with the old fear of exposing herself to ebola also her exhilaration at escaping her pursuer faded in its stead was the reality of being caught in a dangerous web of conspiracy and intrigue she stopped eyeing the exit for a moment she debated leaving but decided her only hope was to be absolutely sure she had to remove any of her own doubts before she could possibly convince anyone else she thought she would check the easiest piece of information first she walked down to the business office where she found a desk with a sign new subscribers although it was unoccupied it was loaded with printed literature it only took a moment for her to learn that the rosenberg clinic was an hmo just as shed suspected the next questions she wanted answered would be more difficult since the initial patient had already died retracing her steps back to the main lobby marissa stood watching the stream of people coming and going until she figured out where the doctors coatroom was timing her approach marissa arrived at the door along with a staff doctor who paused to signal the man at the information booth the coatroom door buzzed open and marissa entered behind the doctor inside she was able to obtain a long white coat she put it on and rolled up the sleeves there was a name tag on the lapel that said dr ann elliott marissa took it off and placed it in the coats side pocket going back to the lobby marissa was startled to see dr layne turning away she expected any moment to hear a cry of recognition luckily when she glanced back dr layne was leaving the hospital seeing him had made marissa more nervous than ever she was terrified of running into dubchek as she had in philadelphia but she knew she had to find out more about the dead index case going over to the directory she saw that the department of pathology was on the fourth floor marissa took the next elevator the rosenberg clinic was an impressive place marissa had to walk through the chemistry lab to get to the pathologists offices en route she noticed that they had the latest and most expensive automated equipment going through a pair of double doors marissa found herself surrounded by secretaries busily typing from dictaphones this was the center of the pathology department where all the reports were prepared one of the women removed her ear piece as marissa approached may i help you im one of the doctors from the cdc marissa said warmly do you know if any of my colleagues are here i dont think so said the secretary starting to rise i can ask dr stewart hes in his office im right here said a big burly man with a full beard and to answer your question the cdc people are down on the third floor in our isolation wing well perhaps you can help me said marissa purposely avoiding introducing herself ive been looking into the ebola outbreaks from the beginning but unfortunately i was delayed getting to new york i understand that the first case a dr mehta has already died did you do a post just this morning would you mind if i asked a few questions i didnt do the autopsy said dr stewart then turning to the secretary he asked helen see if you can round up curt he led marissa to a small office furnished with a modern desk and white formica lab bench holding a spanking new doubleheaded zeiss binocular microscope did you know dr mehta asked marissa quite well said stewart shaking his head he was our medical director and his death will be a great loss stewart went on to describe dr mehtas contributions in establishing the rosenberg clinic and his enormous popularity among staff and patients alike do you know where he did his training asked marissa im not certain where he went to medical school said stewart i think it was in bombay but i know he did his residency in london why do you ask i was just curious if he was a foreign medical school graduate said marissa does that make a difference asked stewart frowning it might said marissa vaguely are there a large percentage of foreign medical school graduates on staff here of course said stewart all hmos started by hiring a large proportion of foreign medical graduates american graduates wanted private practice but thats changed these days we can recruit directly from the top residencies the door opened and a young man came in this is curt vandermay said stewart reluctantly marissa gave her own name dr blumenthal has some questions about the autopsy explained dr stewart he pulled a chair away from his microscope bench for dr vandermay who sat down and gracefully crossed his legs we havent processed the sections yet explained dr vandermay so i hope the gross results will do actually im interested in your external exam said marissa were there any abnormalities for sure said dr vandermay the man had extensive hemorrhagic lesions in his skin what about trauma asked marissa how did you guess said dr vandermay surprised he had a broken nose id forgotten about that how old asked marissa a week ten days somewhere in that range did the chart mention a cause to tell the truth i didnt look said dr vandermay knowing the man died of ebola hemorrhagic fever took precedence i didnt give the broken nose a lot of thought i understand said marissa what about the chart i assume its here in pathology can i see it by all means said vandermay he stood up why dont you come down to the autopsy area i have some polaroids of the broken nose if youd like to see them please said marissa stewart excused himself saying he had a meeting to attend and marissa followed vandermay as he explained that the body had been disinfected and then doublebagged in special receptacles to avoid contamination the family had requested that the body be shipped home to india but that permission had been refused marissa could understand why the chart wasnt as complete as marissa would have liked but there was reference to the broken nose it had been set by one of dr mehtas colleagues an ent surgeon marissa also learned that dr mehta was an ent surgeon himself a terrifying fact given the way the epidemic had spread in the previous outbreaks as far as the cause of the broken nose was concerned there was nothing vandermay suggested that they phone the man who set it while he put through the call marissa went through the rest of the chart dr mehta had no history of recent travel exposure to animals or connection to any of the other ebola outbreaks the poor man was robbed said dr vandermay hanging up the phone punched out and robbed in his own driveway can you believe it what a world we live in if you only knew thought marissa now absolutely certain that the ebola outbreaks were deliberately caused a wave of fear swept over her but she forced herself to continue questioning the pathologist did you happen to notice a nummular lesion on dr mehtas thigh i dont recall said dr vandermay but here are all the polaroids he spread a group of photos out as if he were laying out a poker hand marissa looked at the first one they brutally portrayed the naked corpse laid out on the stainlesssteel autopsy table despite the profusion of hemorrhagic lesions marissa was able to pick out the same circular lesion she had seen on dr richters thigh it corresponded in size to the head of a vaccination gun would it be possible for me to take one of these photos asked marissa dr vandermay glanced at them go ahead weve got plenty marissa slipped the photo into her pocket it wasnt as good as the vaccination gun but it was something she thanked dr vandermay and got up to leave arent you going to tell me your suspicions vandermay asked there was a slight smile on his face as if he knew that something was up an intercom system crackled to life informing dr vandermay that he had a phone call on line six he picked up and marissa overheard him say thats a coincidence dr dubchek im talking with dr blumenthal right this moment that was all marissa needed to hear she got up and ran for the elevators vandermay called after her but she didnt stop she passed the secretaries at a halfjog and raced through the double doors clutching the pens in the pocket of the white coat to keep them from falling out facing the elevators and fire stairs she decided to risk the elevator if dubchek had been on the third floor he probably would think it faster to use the stairs she pushed the down button a lab tech was waiting with his tray of vacucontainers he watched marissa frantically push the already illuminated elevator button several more times emergency he asked as their eyes met an elevator stopped and marissa squeezed on the doors seemed to take forever to close and she expected at any moment to see dubchek running to stop them but finally they started down and marissa began to relax only to find herself stopping on three she moved deeper into the car for once appreciating her small stature it would have been difficult to see her from outside the elevator as the elevator began to move again she asked a grayhaired technician where the cafeteria was he told her to turn right when she got off the elevator and follow the main corridor marissa got off and did as she had been told a short distance down the hall she smelled the aroma of food for the rest of the way she followed her nose she had decided it was too dangerous to risk the front entrance to the clinic dubchek could have told the police to stop her instead she ran into the cafeteria which was crowded with people having lunch she headed directly for the kitchen the staff threw her a few questioning looks but no one challenged her as shed imagined there was a loading dock and she exited directly onto it skirting a dairy truck that was making a delivery dropping down to the level of the driveway marissa walked briskly out onto madison avenue after going north for half a block she turned east on a quiet treelined street there were few pedestrians which gave marissa confidence that she was not being trailed when she got to park avenue she hailed a cab to be sure that no one was following her marissa got off at bloomingdales walked through the store to third avenue and hailed a second cab by the time she pulled up at the essex house she was confident that she was safe at least for the time being outside her room with its do not disturb sign still in place marissa hesitated even though no one knew she was registered under an assumed name the memory of chicago haunted her she opened the door carefully scanning the premises before going in then she propped the door open with a chair and warily searched the room she checked under the beds in the closet and in the bathroom everything was as shed left it satisfied marissa closed and locked her door using all the bolts and chains available may continued marissa ate some of the generous portion of fruit shed ordered from room service for her breakfast that morning peeling an apple with the sharp paring knife that had come with it now that her suspicions appeared to be true she wasnt sure what to do next the only thing she could think of was to go to ralphs lawyer and tell him what she believed that a small group of rightwing physicians were introducing ebola into privately owned clinics to erode public trust in hmos she could hand over the meager evidence she had and let him worry about the rest of the proof maybe he could even suggest a safe place for her to hide while things were being sorted out putting down the apple she reached for the phone she felt much better having come to a decision she dialed ralphs office number and was pleasantly surprised to be immediately put through to him i gave my secretary specific instructions explained ralph in case you dont know it im concerned about you youre sweet said marissa suddenly touched by ralphs sympathy it undermined the tight control shed been holding over her emotions for a second she felt like the child who didnt cry after a fall until she saw her mother are you coming home today that depends said marissa biting her lip and taking a deep breath do you think i can talk to that lawyer today her voice wavered no said ralph i called his office this morning they said he had to go out of town but that hes expected back tomorrow too bad said marissa her voice beginning to shake marissa are you all right asked ralph ive been better admitted marissa ive had some awful experiences what happened i cant talk now said marissa knowing if she tried to explain shed burst into tears listen to me said ralph i want you to come here immediately i didnt want you going to new york in the first place did you run into dubchek again worse than that said marissa well that settles it said ralph get the next flight home ill come and pick you up the idea had a lot of appeal and she was about to say as much when there was a knock on her door marissa froze the knock was repeated marissa are you there just a minute said marissa into the phone theres someone at the door stay on the line she put the phone down on the night table and warily approached the door who is it a delivery for miss kendrick marissa opened the door a crack but kept the safety catch on one of the uniformed bellmen was standing there holding a large package covered with white paper flustered she told the bellman to wait while she went back to the phone she told ralph that someone was at her door and that shed call back as soon as she knew what flight she was taking home to atlanta that evening you promise asked ralph yes said marissa returning to the door marissa looked out into the hall again the bellman was leaning against the wall opposite still holding the package who could have sent miss kendrick flowers when as far as marissa knew her friend was living happily on the west coast returning to the phone she called the desk and asked if shed gotten any flowers the concierge said yes they were on their way up marissa felt a little better but not enough to take off the chain instead she called through the crack im terribly sorry but would you mind leaving the flowers ill get them in a few minutes my pleasure madam said the bellman setting down the package then he touched his hat and disappeared down the hall removing the chain marissa quickly picked up the basket and relocked the door she ripped off the paper and found a spectacular arrangement of spring blossoms on a green stake pushed into the styrofoam base was an envelope addressed to lisa kendrick removing it marissa pulled out a folded card addressed to marissa blumenthal her heart skipped a beat as she began to read dear dr blumenthal congratulations on your performance this morning we were all impressed of course we will have to make a return visit unless you are willing to be reasonable obviously we know where you are at all times but we will leave you alone if you return the piece of medical equipment you borrowed terror washed over marissa for a moment she stood transfixed in front of the flowers looking at them in disbelief then in a sudden burst of activity she began to pack her belongings opening the drawers of the bureau pulling out the few things that shed placed there but then she stopped nothing was exactly where shed left it they had been in her room searching through her belongings oh god she had to get away from there rushing into the bathroom she snatched up her cosmetics dumping them haphazardly into her bag then she stopped again the implications of the note finally dawned on her if they did not have the vaccination gun that meant tad was not involved and neither he nor anyone else knew she was staying at the essex house under a second assumed name the only way they could have found her was by following her from the airport in chicago the sooner she was out of the essex house the better after flinging the rest of her things into her suitcase she found she had packed so badly it wouldnt close as she sat on it struggling with the latch her eyes drifted back to the flowers all at once she understood their purpose was to frighten her into leading her assailants to the vaccination gun which was probably just what she would have done she sat on the bed and forced herself to think calmly since her adversaries knew she didnt have the vaccination gun with her and were hoping she would lead them to it she felt she had a little room to maneuver marissa decided not to bother taking the suitcase with her she stuffed a few essentials in her purse and pulled the various papers she needed from her briefcase so she could leave that too the only thing that marissa felt absolutely certain of was that she would be followed undoubtedly her pursuers expected her to leave in a panic making it that much easier for them well thought marissa they were in for a surprise looking again at the magnificent flowers she decided she might well use the same strategy her enemies had thinking along those lines she began to develop a plan that might give the answers that would provide the solution to the whole affair unfolding the list of officers of the physicians action congress marissa reassured herself that the secretary was based in new york his name was jack krause and he lived at east eightyfourth street marissa decided that shed pay the man an unannounced visit maybe all the doctors didnt know what was going on it was hard to think of a group of physicians being willing to spread plague in any case her appearance on his doorstep should spread a lot more panic than any bouquet meanwhile she decided to take some steps to protect her departure going to the phone she called the hotel manager and in an irritated voice complained that the desk had given her room number to her estranged boyfriend and that the man had been bothering her thats impossible said the manager we do not give out room numbers i have no intention of arguing with you snapped marissa the fact of the matter is that it happened since the reason i stopped seeing him was because of his violent nature im terrified what would you like us to do asked the manager sensing that marissa had something specific in mind i think you could at least move me to another room said marissa ill see to it myself said the manager one other thing said marissa my boyfriend is blond athletic looking sharp features perhaps you could alert your people certainly said the manager alphonse hicktman took one last draw on his cigarette and tossed it over the granite wall that separated central park from the sidewalk looking back at the taxi with its offduty light on al could just make out georges features he was hunkered down relaxed as usual waiting never seemed to bother the man looking across the street at the essex house entrance al hoped to god that jake was properly situated in the lobby so that marissa could not leave unseen by a back entrance al had been so sure that the flowers would send the woman flying out of the hotel now he was mystified either she was super smart or super stupid walking over to the taxi he whacked its roof with an open palm making a noise like a kettledrum george was instantly half out of the car on the other side al smiled at him little tense george his patience made als frustration that much harder to bear jesus christ exclaimed george the two men got into the cab what time is it asked al taking out another cigarette hed already gone through most of a pack that afternoon seventhirty al flicked the used match out the open window the job was not going well since the vaccination gun had not been in the womans hotel room his orders were to follow her until she retrieved it but it was all too apparent that dr blumenthal was not about to accommodate them at least not immediately at that moment a group of revelers came stumbling out of the essex house arm in arm swaying laughing and generally making fools of themselves they were obviously conventioneers dressed in dark suits with name tags and wearing plastic sun visors that said sanyo the doorman signaled a group of limousines waiting just up the street one by one they drove to the door to pick up their quota al slapped george on the shoulder frantically pointing toward the largest group to emerge through the revolving door among them two men were supporting a woman wearing a sanyo visor who seemed too drunk to walk is that the mark hanging onto those guys he asked george squinted and before he could answer the woman in question disappeared into one of the limousines he turned back to al i dont think so her hair was different but i couldnt be sure damn said al neither could i after a moments hesitation al jumped out of the taxi if she comes out follow her al then dodged the traffic and raced across to get in another cab from the back of the limousine marissa watched the entrance to the hotel out of the corner of her eye she saw someone alight from a parked taxi and run across the street just as her limousine pulled in front of a bus blocking her view she saw the man climbing into another taxi a vintage checker marissa turned to face forward she was certain she was being followed she had several options but with almost a full blocks head start she decided it would be best to get out as soon as the limousine turned on fifth marissa shocked her companions by shouting at the driver to pull over the driver complied figuring she was about to be sick but before any of the men knew what was happening she had the door open and jumped out telling the driver to go on without her spying a doubleday bookstore which happily was keeping late hours she ducked inside from the store window she saw the checker cab speed by and caught a glimpse of a blond head in the backseat the man was sitting forward staring straight ahead the house looked more like a medieval fortress than a new york luxury townhouse its leaded windows were narrow and covered with twisted wroughtiron grilles the front door was protected by a stout iron gate that was fashioned after a portcullis the fifth floor was set back and the resulting terrace was crenellated like a castle tower marissa eyed the building from across the street it was hardly a hospitable sight and for a moment she had second thoughts about visiting dr krause but safely ensconced in her new room at the essex house that afternoon shed made some calls and learned that he was a prominent park avenue internist she could not imagine that he would be capable of harming her directly perhaps through an organization like pac but not with his own two hands she crossed the street and climbed the front steps casting one last glance up and down the quiet street she rang the bell behind the gate was the heavy wooden door its center decorated with a family crest carved in relief she waited a minute and rang again all at once a bright light went on blinding her so that she could not see who was opening the door yes said a womans voice i would like to see dr krause said marissa trying to sound authoritative do you have an appointment no admitted marissa but tell the doctor that im here on emergency physicians action congress business i think hell see me marissa heard the door close the hard light illuminated most of the street after a couple of minutes the door was reopened the doctor will see you then there was the painful sound of the iron gate opening on hinges that needed oil marissa went inside relieved to get away from the glare she watched the woman who was dressed in a maids black uniform close the gate then come toward her if youll follow me please marissa was led through a marbled and chandeliered entrance down a short corridor to a paneled library if youll wait here said the woman the doctor will be with you shortly marissa glanced around the room which was beautifully furnished with antiques bookcases lined three of the walls sorry to keep you waiting said a mellow voice marissa turned to look at dr krause he had a fleshy face with deep lines and as he gestured for her to sit she noticed his hands were unusually large and square like those of an immigrant laborer when they were sitting she could see him better the eyes were those of an intelligent sympathetic man reminding her of some of her internal medicine professors marissa was amazed that he could have gotten mixed up in something like the physicians action congress im sorry to bother you at such an hour she began no problem said dr krause i was just reading what can i do for you marissa leaned forward to watch the mans face my name is dr marissa blumenthal there was a pause as dr krause waited for marissa to continue his expression did not change either he was a good actor or her name was not familiar im an epidemiology intelligence service officer at the cdc added marissa his eyes narrowed just a tad my maid said that you were here on pac business said dr krause a measure of the hospitality disappearing from his voice i am said marissa perhaps i should ask if you are aware of anything that pac might be doing that could concern the cdc this time krauses jaw visibly tightened he took a deep breath started to speak then changed his mind marissa waited as if she had all the time in the world finally dr krause cleared his throat pac is trying to rescue american medicine from the economic forces that are trying to destroy it thats been its goal from the start a noble goal admitted marissa but how is pac attempting to accomplish this mission by backing responsible and sensible legislation said dr krause he stood up presumably to escape marissas stare pac is providing an opportunity for more conservative elements to exert some influence and its about time the profession of medicine is like a runaway train he moved over to the fireplace his face lost in shadow unfortunately it seems pac is doing more than sponsoring legislation said marissa thats what concerns the cdc i think we have nothing more to discuss said dr krause if youll excuse me i believe pac is responsible for the ebola outbreaks blurted marissa standing up herself you people have some misguided idea that spreading disease in hmos will further your cause thats absurd said dr krause i couldnt agree more said marissa but i have papers linking you and the other officers of pac to professional labs in grayson georgia which has recently purchased equipment to handle the virus i even have the vaccination gun used to infect the index cases get out of here ordered dr krause gladly said marissa but first let me say that i intend to visit all the officers of pac i cant imagine they all agreed to this idiotic scheme in fact its hard for me to imagine that a physician like yourselfany physiciancould have allowed it maintaining a calm she did not feel marissa walked to the door dr krause did not move from the fireplace thank you for seeing me said marissa im sorry if ive upset you but im confident that one of the pac officers i see will want to help stop this horror perhaps by turning states evidence it could be you i hope so good night dr krause marissa forced herself to walk slowly down the short corridor to the foyer what if she misjudged the man and he came after her luckily the maid materialized and let her out as soon as marissa was beyond the cone of light she broke into a run for a few moments dr krause didnt move it was as if his worst nightmare were coming true he had a gun upstairs maybe he should just kill himself or he could call his lawyer and ask for immunity in return for turning states evidence but he had no idea what that really meant panic followed paralysis he rushed to his desk opened his address book and after looking up a number placed a call to atlanta the phone rang almost ten times before it was picked up joshua jacksons smooth accent oiled its way along the wires as he said hello and asked who was calling jack krause said the distraught doctor what the hell is going on you swore that aside from los angeles pac had nothing to do with the outbreaks of ebola that the further outbreaks sprang from accidental contact with the initial patients joshua you gave me your word calm down said jackson get ahold of yourself who is marissa blumenthal asked krause in a quieter voice thats better said jackson why do you ask because the woman just showed up on my doorstep accusing me and pac of starting all the ebola epidemics is she still there no shes gone said krause but who the hell is she an epidemiologist from the cdc who got lucky but dont worry heberling is taking care of her this affair is turning into a nightmare said krause i should remind you that i was against the project even when it only involved influenza what did the blumenthal girl want with you asked jackson she wanted to frighten me said krause and she did a damn good job she said she has the names and addresses of all the pac officers and she implied that she was about to visit each one did she say who was next of course she didnt shes not stupid said krause in fact shes extremely clever she played me like a finely tuned instrument if she sees us all somebodys going to fold remember tieman in san fran he was even more adamantly against the project than i was try to relax urged jackson i understand why youre upset but let me remind you that there is no real evidence to implicate anyone and as a precautionary measure heberling has cleaned out his whole lab except for his bacterial studies ill tell him that the girl plans to visit the other officers im sure that will help in the meantime well take extra precautions to keep her away from tieman krause hung up he felt a little less anxious but as he stood up and turned off the desk lamp he decided hed phone his attorney in the morning it couldnt hurt to inquire about the procedure for turning states evidence as her cab whizzed over the triborough bridge marissa was mesmerized by manhattans nighttime skyline from that distance it was beautiful but it soon dropped behind then out of sight altogether as the car descended into the sunken portion of the long island expressway marissa forced her eyes back to the list of names and addresses of the pac officers which she had taken from her purse they were hard to make out as the taxi shot from one highway light to the next there was no logical way to choose who to visit after krause the closest would be easiest but also probably the most obvious to her pursuers and therefore the most dangerous for safetys sake she decided to visit the man farthest away doctor sinclair tieman in san francisco leaning forward marissa told the driver she wanted kennedy rather than laguardia airport when he asked what terminal she chose at random united if they didnt have space on a night flight she could always go to another terminal at that time in the evening there were few people at the terminal and marissa got rapid service she was pleased to find a convenient flight to san francisco with just one stop in chicago she bought her ticket with cash using yet another false name bought some reading material from a newsstand and went to the gate she decided to use the few moments before takeoff to call ralph as she anticipated he was upset she hadnt called him back sooner but was pleased at first to learn she was at the airport ill forgive you this one last time he said but only because you are on your way home marissa chose her words carefully i wish i could see you tonight but dont tell me you are not coming said ralph feigning anger to conceal his disappointment i made arrangements for you to meet with mr mcquinllin tomorrow at noon you said you wanted to see him as soon as possible it will have to be postponed said marissa something has come up i must go to san francisco for a day or two i just cant explain right now marissa what on earth are you up to said ralph in a tone of desperation just from the little youve told me im absolutely certain you should come home see the lawyer then if mr mcquinllin agrees you can still go to california ralph i know youre worried the fact you care makes me feel so much better but everything is under control what im doing will just make my dealings with mr mcquinllin that much easier trust me i cant pleaded ralph youre not being rational theyre boarding my plane said marissa ill call as soon as i can marissa replaced the receiver with a sigh he might not be the worlds most romantic man but he certainly was sensitive and caring al told jake to shut up he couldnt stand the mans incessant gab if it wasnt about baseball it was about the horses it never stopped it was worse than georges eternal silence al was sitting with jake in the taxi while george still waited in the essex house lobby something told al that things were screwed up hed followed the limo all the way to a restaurant in soho but then the girl hed seen get in didnt get out coming back to the hotel hed had jake check to see if miss kendrick was still registered she was but when al went up and walked past the room hed seen it being cleaned worse hed been spotted by the house detectives who claimed he was the broads boyfriend and that hed better leave her alone you didnt have to be a brain surgeon to know something was wrong his professional intuition told him that the girl had fled and that they were wasting their time staking out the essex house you sure you dont want to put a small bet on the fourth at belmont today said jake al was about to bounce a couple of knuckles off the top of jakes head when his beeper went off reaching under his jacket he turned the thing off cursing he knew who it was wait here he said gruffly he got out of the car and ran across the street to the plaza where he used one of the downstairs pay phones to call heberling heberling did not even try to hide his contempt for chrissake the womans only a hundred pounds or so its not like im asking you to take out rambo why the hell is pac paying you fellows a thousand dollars a day the womans been lucky said al hed be patient but only to a point i dont buy that said heberling now tell me do you have any idea where she is at this moment im not positive admitted al meaning youve lost her snapped heberling well i can tell you where shes been shes seen dr krause and scared him shitless now were afraid shes planning to visit the other pac officers dr tiemans the most vulnerable ill worry about the other physicians i want you and your orangutans to get your asses to san francisco see if shes there and whatever you do dont let her get to tieman may it was just beginning to get light as al followed jake and george down the jetway to san franciscos central terminal theyd taken an american flight that first stopped for an hour and a half at dallas then was delayed in las vegas on what should have been a brief touchdown jake was carrying the suitcase with the vaccination gun theyd used on mehta al wondered if he looked as bad as his colleagues they needed to shave and shower and their previously sharply pressed suits were badly wrinkled the more al thought about the current situation the more frustrated he became the girl could be in any one of at least four cities and it wasnt even a simple hit if they did find her they first had to get her to tell them where shed hidden the vaccination gun leaving jake and george to get the luggage he rented a car using one of the several fake ids he always carried he decided the only thing they could do was stake out tiemans house that way even if they didnt find the girl she wouldnt get to the doctor after making sure he could get a car with a cellular phone he spread out the map the girl at budget had given him tieman lived in some outoftheway place called sausalito at least there wouldnt be much traffic it wasnt even am yet the operator at the fairmont placed marissas wakeup call at as shed requested marissa had been lucky the night before a small convention group had canceled out at the last minute and shed had no trouble getting a room lying in bed waiting for her breakfast she wondered what dr tieman would be like probably not much different from krause a selfish greedy man whose attempt to protect his own wallet had gotten out of control getting up she opened the drapes to a breathtaking scene that included the bay bridge the hills of marin county with alcatraz island looking like a medieval fortress in the foreground marissa only wished that she was visiting under more pleasant circumstances by the time shed showered and wrapped herself in the thick white terry cloth robe supplied by the hotel her breakfast had arrived an enormous selection of fresh fruit and coffee peeling a peach she noticed they had given her an oldfashioned paring knifewood handled and very sharp as she ate she looked at tiemans address and wondered if it wouldnt be better to visit him at his office rather than at home she was sure someone had contacted him after her visit to dr krause so she couldnt count on really surprising the man under such conditions it seemed safer to go to his office the yellow pages was in one of the desk drawers marissa opened it to physicians and surgeons found tiemans name and noted that his practice was limited to obgyn just to be certain the man was in town marissa dialed his office the service operator said that the office didnt open until eightthirty that was about ten minutes away marissa finished dressing and dialed again this time she got the receptionist who told her the doctor wasnt expected until three this was his day for surgery at san francisco general hanging up marissa stared out at the bay bridge while she considered this new information in some ways confronting tieman in the hospital might even be better than at his office it would certainly be safer if the doctor had any idea of trying to stop her himself she looked at herself in the mirror except for her underwear she had been wearing the same clothes for two days and she realized shed have to stop somewhere and get some fresh things she put up the do not disturb sign as she left the room less nervous here than in new york since she was certain she was several jumps ahead of her pursuers the site of san francisco general was gorgeous but once inside the hospital was like any other large city hospital with the same random mixture of old and modern there was also that overwhelming sense of bustle and disorganization characteristic of such institutions it was easy for marissa to walk unnoticed into the doctors locker room as she was selecting a scrub suit an attendant came over and asked can i help you im dr blumenthal said marissa im here to observe dr tieman operate let me give you a locker said the attendant without hesitation and gave her a key after marissa changed her locker key pinned to the front of her scrub dress she walked to the surgical lounge there were about twenty people there drinking coffee chatting and reading newspapers passing through the lounge marissa went directly into the operating area in the vestibule she put on a hood and booties then stopped in front of the big scheduling board tiemans name was listed for room eleven the man was already on his second hysterectomy yes inquired the nurse behind the or desk her voice had that nononsense tone of a woman in charge im here to watch dr tieman said marissa go on in room eleven said the nurse already devoting her attention to another matter thank you said marissa starting down the wide central corridor the operating rooms were on either side sharing scrub and anesthesia space through the oval windows in the doors marissa caught glimpses of gowned figures bent over their patients entering the scrub area between rooms eleven and twelve marissa put on a mask and pushed into tiemans operating room there were five people besides the patient the anesthesiologist was sitting at the patients head two surgeons were standing on either side of the table a scrub nurse perched on a footstool and there was one circulating nurse as marissa entered the circulating nurse was sitting in the corner waiting for orders she got up and asked marissa what she needed how much longer for the case threequarters of an hour shrugged the nurse dr tieman is fast which one is dr tieman asked marissa the nurse gave her a strange look the one on the right she said who are you a doctor friend from atlanta said marissa she didnt elaborate moving around to the head of the table and looking at dr tieman she understood why the nurse had been surprised by her question the man was black how odd thought marissa she would have suspected that all the pac officers were oldguard white and probably racially prejudiced for a while she stood above the ether screen and watched the course of the operation the uterus was already out and they were starting repair tieman was good his hands moved with that special economy of motion that could not be taught it was a talent a gift from god not something to be learned even with practice start the damn car said al hanging up the cellular phone they were parked across from a sprawling redwood house that clung to the hillside above the town of sausalito between the eucalyptus trees they could see blue patches of the bay jake turned the key in the ignition where to he knew al was pissed and when he was in that kind of mood it was better to say as little as possible back to the city what did tiemans office say asked george from the backseat jake wanted to tell george to shut up but he was afraid to speak that the doctor was in surgery at san francisco general said al almost white with anger his first operation was scheduled for seventhirty and hes not expected at the office until three no wonder we missed him said george disgustedly the guy must have left his house an hour before we got here what a waste of time we should have gone to a hotel like i said with blinding speed al twisted around in the front seat and grabbed georges pink dior tie georges eyes bulged and his face turned red if i want your advice ill ask for it understand al released the tie and shoved george back down in his seat jake hunkered down like a turtle into his sports jacket he hazarded a glance in als direction and what are you gawking at demanded al jake didnt say a word and after what had just happened he hoped george had learned the wisdom of silence they were almost at the bridge before anyone spoke i think we should get another car al said his voice as calm as if the outburst had never happened just in case we run into a problem and have to split up then well go to san francisco general the sooner we spot tieman the better with plenty of time to spare and feeling confident that shed have no problem recognizing dr tieman now that shed seen him marissa left the operating room as the assistant was closing she changed back to her street clothes she wanted to be able to leave right after she spoke to the man going into the surgical lounge she found a seat by the window a few people smiled at her but no one spoke a half hour went by before dr tieman appeared coming into the room with the same effortless grace that had characterized his surgical technique marissa walked over to where he was pouring a cup of coffee in his shortsleeved scrub top marissa could see his beautifully muscled arms his color was a rich brown like polished walnut im dr marissa blumenthal she said watching the man for a reaction he had a broad masculine face with a welltrimmed mustache and sad eyes as if hed seen more of life than he cared to know he looked down at marissa with a smile it was obvious from his expression that he had no idea who she was may i speak to you in private asked marissa tieman glanced at his assistant who was just approaching ill see you in the or tieman said leading marissa away he took her to one of the dictation cubicles separated from the lounge by two swinging doors there was one chair and dr tieman turned it around gesturing for marissa to sit he leaned against a counter holding his coffee in his right hand acutely conscious of her short stature and its psychological handicap marissa pushed the chair back to him insisting that he sit since hed been standing in surgery since early that morning okay okay he said with a short laugh im sitting now what can i do for you im surprised you dont recognize my name said marissa watching the mans eyes they were still questioning still friendly im sorry said dr tieman he laughed again but with a tinge of embarrassment he was studying marissas face i do meet a lot of people hasnt dr jack krause called you about me asked marissa im not even sure i know a dr krause said dr tieman directing his attention to his coffee the first lie thought marissa taking a deep breath she told the doctor exactly what shed told krause from the moment she mentioned the la ebola outbreak he never lifted his eyes she could tell that he was nervous the surface of the coffee shook slightly in the cup in his hand and marissa was suddenly glad she was not the mans next patient i havent the slightest idea why you are telling me this said dr tieman starting to rise and unfortunately i have another case with uncharacteristic forwardness marissa gently touched his chest forcing him back in his seat im not finished she said and whether you realize it or not you are intimately involved i have evidence that ebola is being deliberately spread by the physicians action congress you are their treasurer and im shocked that a man of your reputation could be connected to such a sordid affair youre shocked countered dr tieman finally rising to his feet and towering over her im amazed that you have the nerve to make such irresponsible allegations save your breath said marissa its public knowledge that you are an officer of pac as well as a limited partner in one of the only labs in the country equipped to handle viruses like ebola i hope you have plenty of insurance warned dr tieman his voice rising youll be hearing from my lawyer good said marissa ignoring the threat maybe he will persuade you that your best course is to cooperate with the authorities she stepped back and looked directly up at his face having met you i cannot believe you approved the idea of spreading a deadly disease it will be a double tragedy for you to lose everything youve worked for because of someone elses poor judgment think about it dr tieman you dont have a lot of time pushing through the swinging doors marissa left a stunned doctor desperately heading for the phone she realized she had forgotten to tell tieman that she was planning to visit the other pac officers but she decided it didnt matter the man was terrified enough theres the girl yelled al slapping jake on the shoulder they were parked across the street from the main entrance to the hospital george waited behind them in the second car when al turned to look at him george gave a thumbsup sign meaning that hed also seen marissa she wont get away today said al jake started the car and as marissa got into a cab he pulled out into the street heading back into town al watched as marissas cab pulled out behind them followed neatly by george now things were working as they should she must have seen tieman if shes leaving said jake who cares said al we got her now then he added it would make things easier if shed go back to her hotel marissas cab went by them with george in pursuit jake began to speed up ahead he saw george overtake marissa they would continue leapfrogging until marissa reached her destination about fifteen minutes later marissas taxi stopped behind a line of cars waiting to pull up to the fairmont looks like your prayers have been answered said jake stopping across the street from the hotel ill handle the car said al you get your ass in there and find out what room shes in jake got out as al slid behind the wheel dodging the midmorning traffic jake reached the front of the hotel before marissa had even gotten out of her cab in the lobby he picked up a newspaper and folding it commuter style positioned himself so that he could see everyone coming into the hotel marissa walked directly to the front desk he quickly moved behind her expecting her to ask for her room key but she didnt instead she asked to use her safedeposit box while the receptionist opened a gate allowing marissa into the office behind the front desk jake wandered toward the board announcing the various convention meetings presently marissa reappeared busily closing her shoulder purse then to jakes consternation she came directly toward him in a frantic moment of confusion jake thought shed recognized him but she passed right by heading down a hall lined with gift shops jake took off after her passing her in a corridor lined with old photos of the san francisco earthquake guessing she was headed to the elevators he made sure he beat her there mingling with the crowd already waiting an elevator arrived which jake boarded before marissa making certain there was plenty of room he stepped in front of the selfservice buttons holding his newspaper as if he were reading he watched as marissa pressed eleven as more passengers got on marissa was pushed farther back into the car as the elevator rose stopping occasionally jake continued to keep his nose in the newspaper when the car stopped at the eleventh floor he strolled off still absorbed in his paper allowing marissa and another guest to pass him when she stopped in front of room jake kept walking he didnt turn and go back to the elevators until hed heard her door close back on the street jake crossed over to als car well said al momentarily worried something had gone wrong room said jake with a selfsatisfied smile youd better be right said al getting out of the car wait here this shouldnt take long at all he smiled so broadly that jake noticed for the first time als gums had receded almost to the roots of his front teeth al walked over to georges car and leaned on the window i want you to drive around and cover the back entrance just in case feeling better than he had in several days al crossed the street to the posh redandblack lobby he went over to the front desk and eyed the mailbox for there was an extra set of keys but there wasnt enough of a crowd for him to chance the receptionists turning them over without asking questions instead he headed for the elevators on the eleventh floor he searched for the housekeeping cart he found it outside of a suite with its usual complement of clean sheets towels and cleaning materials taking one of the hand towels he carefully folded it on the diagonal creating a stout rope gripping an end in each hand he entered the open suite where the maid presumably was working the living room was empty there was a vacuum cleaner in the middle of the bedroom and a pile of linens on the floor but he still didnt see anyone advancing to the dressing room he heard running water the maid was on her knees in front of the bathtub scrubbing its interior a can of comet was on the floor by her knees without a moments hesitation al stepped behind the woman and using the folded towel as a garrote strangled her she made some muffled noises but they were covered by the sound of the bathwater her face turned red then purple when al let up the tension on the ends of the towel she slumped to the floor like a limp rag doll al found the passkeys in her pocket on a brass ring the size of a bracelet back in the hall he hung a do not disturb sign on the knob and closed the door to the suite then he pushed the housekeeping cart out of sight into the stairwell flexing his fingers like a pianist preparing for a recital he started for room may marissa peeled the last of the breakfast fruit with the woodenhandled paring knife leaving the knife and rinds on her night table she was on the phone to northwest airlines trying to make a reservation to minneapolis she had decided pac and company would figure shed probably go to la next so minneapolis seemed as good a bet as any the agent finally confirmed her on an afternoon flight flopping back on the bed she began to debate how she should spend the next hour or so but while she was thinking exhaustion overtook her and she fell asleep she was awakened by a metallic click it sounded like the door but she knew shed left up the do not disturb sign then she saw the knob silently begin to turn she remembered being caught in the hotel room in chicago by the man with the vaccination gun panic danced through her like an electrical current pulling herself together she reached for the phone before marissa could lift the receiver the door burst open splintering part of the jamb as the screws holding the chain lock plate were yanked out of the molding a man slammed the door shut then hurled himself onto marissa he grabbed her by the neck with both hands and shook her like a mad dog in a frenzy then he pulled her ashen face close to his remember me he snarled furiously marissa remembered him it was the blond man with the julius caesar haircut you have ten seconds to produce the vaccination gun hissed al loosening the death grip he had on marissas throat if you dont ill snap your neck to emphasize his point he gave her head a violent jolt sending a flash of pain down her spine barely able to breathe marissa fruitlessly clawed at the mans powerful wrists he shook her again hitting her head against the wall by reflex marissas hands extended behind her to cushion her body the lamp fell off the bedside table and crashed to the floor the room swam as her brain cried for oxygen this is your last chance shouted al what did you do with that vaccinator marissas hand touched the paring knife her fingers wrapped around the tiny haft holding it in her fist she hammered it up into the mans abdomen as hard as she could she had no idea if shed penetrated anything but al stopped speaking in midsentence let go of marissa and rocked back on his haunches his face registered surprise and disbelief she switched the tiny knife to her right hand keeping it pointed at al who seemed confused when he saw the blood staining his shirt she hoped to back up to the door and run but before she reached it he leaped at her like an enraged animal sending her racing to the bathroom it seemed as if only hours before shed been in the same predicament in chicago al got his hand around the door before it shut marissa hacked blindly feeling the tip of her knife strike bone al screamed and yanked his hand away leaving a smear of blood on the panel the door slammed shut and marissa hastily locked it she was about to dial the bathroom phone when there was a loud crash and the entire bathroom door crashed inward al forced marissa to drop the phone but she hung on to the knife still stabbing at him wildly she hit his abdomen several times but if it had any effect it wasnt apparent ignoring the knife al grabbed marissa by her hair and flung her against the sink she tried to stab him again but he grabbed her wrist and bashed it against the wall until her grip loosened and the weapon clattered to the floor he bent down to pick it up and as he straightened marissa grabbed the phone that was swinging on its cord and hit him as hard as she could with the receiver for a brief instant she wasnt sure who was hurt more the blow had sent a bolt of pain right up to her shoulder for a moment al stood as if he were frozen then his blue eyes rolled upward and he seemed to fall in slow motion into the bathtub striking his head on the faucets as marissa watched half expecting al to get up and come at her again a beeping noise snapped her into action she reached over and hung up the receiver glancing back into the tub she was torn between fear and her medical training the man had a sizable gash over the bridge of his nose and the front of his shirt was covered with blood stains but terror won out and marissa grabbed her purse and ran from the room remembering the man had not been alone in new york she knew she had to get away from the hotel as soon as possible descending to the ground floor marissa avoided the front entrance instead she went down a flight of stairs and followed arrows to a rear exit standing just inside the door she waited until a cable car came into view timing her exit to give herself the least exposure she ran out of the hotel and jumped onto the trolley marissa forced her way through the crowd to the rear she looked back at the hotel as the car began to move no one came out george blinked in disbelief it was the girl quickly he dialed jakes car she just came out of the hotel said george and jumped on a cable car is al with her asked jake no said george shes by herself it looked like she was limping a little something is weird you follow her said george the cable car is just starting ill go into the hotel and check on al right on said jake he was more than happy to let george deal with al when al found out the girl had flown he was going to be madder than shit marissa looked back at the hotel for any sign of being followed no one came out of the door but as the cable car began to move she saw a man get out of an auto and run for the hotels rear entrance the timing was suggestive but as the man didnt even look in her direction she dismissed it as a coincidence she continued to watch until the cable car turned a corner and she could no longer see the fairmont shed made it she relaxed until a loud clang almost made her jump out of her skin she started for the door before she realized it was just the overhead bell that the conductor rang as he collected fares a man got off and marissa quickly took his seat she was shaking and suddenly scared she might have blood stains on her clothes the last thing she wanted was to call attention to herself as her fear abated she became more aware of the pain where her hip had hit the sink and her neck was exquisitely tender and probably turning black and blue fare please said the conductor without lifting her eyes marissa fished around in her purse for some change that was when she saw the blood caked on the back of her right hand quickly she changed the way she was holding her purse and used her left hand to give the money to the man when he moved off marissa tried to figure out how they had found her shed been so careful suddenly it dawned on her they must have been guarding tieman it was the only possible explanation her confidence shattered marissa began to have second thoughts about having fled the hotel perhaps she would have been safer if she had stayed and faced the police yet fleeing had become an instinct of late she felt like a fugitive and it made her act like one and to think shed thought she would be able to outwit her pursuers ralph had been right she never should have gone to new york let alone san francisco he had said she was in serious trouble before shed visited both cities well it was a lot worse nowfor all she knew shed killed two men it was all too much she wasnt going to minneapolis she would go home and turn everything that she knew such as it was and everything that she suspected over to the attorney the cable car slowed again marissa looked around she was someplace in chinatown the car stopped and just as it was starting again marissa stood up and swung off as she ran to the sidewalk she saw the conductor shaking his head in disgust but no one got off after her marissa took a deep breath and rubbed her neck glancing around she was pleased to see that both sides of the street were crowded there were pushcart vendors trucks making deliveries and a variety of stores with much of their merchandise displayed on the sidewalk all the signs were written in chinese she felt as if the short cablecar ride had mysteriously transported her to the orient even the smells were different a mixture of fish and spices she passed a chinese restaurant and after hesitating a second went inside a woman dressed in a mandarincollared red silk dress slit to the knee came out and said the restaurant was not yet open for lunch half hour she added would you mind if i used your restroom and your phone asked marissa the woman studied marissa for a moment decided she meant no harm and led her to the rear of the restaurant she opened a door and stepped aside marissa was in a small room with a sink on one side and a pay phone on the other there were two doors in the back with ladies stenciled on one and gents on the other the walls were covered with years of accumulated graffiti marissa used the phone first she called the fairmont and reported to the operator that there was a man in room who needed an ambulance the operator told her to hold on but marissa hung up then she paused debating whether she should call the police and explain everything to them no she thought it was too complicated besides shed already fled the scene it would be better to go back to atlanta and see the attorney washing her hands marissa glanced at herself in the mirror she was a mess taking out her comb she untangled her hair and braided a few strands to keep it off her face shed lost her barrette when the blond man had yanked her by the hair when she was finished she straightened her blazer and the collar of her blouse that was about all she could do jake dialed georges car for the hundredth time mostly the phone went unanswered but occasionally hed get a recording telling him that the party he was calling was not presently available he could not figure out what was going on al and george should have been back in the car long ago jake had followed the girl practically running her over when shed leaped unexpectedly from the cable car and had watched her go into a restaurant called peking cuisine at least he hadnt lost her he scrunched down in the drivers seat the girl had just come out of the restaurant and was flagging a cab an hour later jake watched helplessly as marissa handed over her ticket and boarded a delta nonstop to atlanta he had thought about buying a ticket himself but scrapped the idea without als okay shed spent the last half hour closeted in the ladies room giving jake ample time to try the mobile phone at least ten more times hoping for some instructions but still no one answered as soon as the plane taxied down the runway jake hurried back to his car there was a parking ticket under the windshield wiper but jake didnt give a shit he was just glad the car hadnt been towed away climbing in he thought hed drive back to the fairmont and see if he could find the others maybe the whole thing had been called off and hed find both of them in the bar laughing their asses off while he ran all over the city back on the freeway he decided to try calling the other mobile phone one last time to his astonishment george answered where the hell have you been jake demanded ive been calling you all goddamn morning theres been a problem said george subdued well i hope to hell theres been something said jake the girl is on a plane to atlanta i was going crazy i didnt know what the hell to do al was knifed i guess by the girl hes at san francisco general having surgery i cant get near him christ said jake incredulously unable to imagine that the pintsized broad could have knifed al and gotten away hes not supposed to be hurt that bad continued george whats worse is that apparently al wasted a maid he had the womans passkeys in his pocket hes being charged with murder shit said jake things were going from bad to worse where are you now asked george just on the freeway leaving the airport said jake go back said george book us on the next flight to atlanta i think we owe al a bit of revenge may reading material asked the smiling cabin attendant marissa nodded she needed something to keep her from thinking about the horrible scene in the hotel magazine or newspaper asked the attendant newspaper i guess said marissa san francisco examiner or new york times marissa was in no mood to make decisions new york times she said finally the big jet leveled off and the seatbelt sign went out marissa glanced through the window at rugged mountains stretching off into dry desert it was a relief to have gotten onto the plane finally at the airport she had been so scared of either being attacked by one of the blond mans friends or being arrested she had simply hidden in a toilet in the ladies room unfolding the newspaper marissa glanced at the table of contents continuing coverage of the ebola outbreaks in philadelphia and new york was listed on page marissa turned to it the article reported that the philadelphia death toll was up to fiftyeight and new york was at fortynine but that many more cases had been reported there marissa was not surprised since the index case was an ear nose and throat specialist she also noted that the rosenberg clinic had already filed for bankruptcy on the same page as the ebola article was a photograph of dr ahmed fakkry head of epidemiology for the world health organization the article next to the picture said that he was visiting the cdc to investigate the ebola outbreaks because world health was fearful that the virus would soon cross the atlantic maybe dr fakkry could help her thought marissa perhaps the lawyer ralph was lining up for her would be able to arrange for her to speak with him ralph was catching up on his journals when the doorbell rang at pm glancing at his watch he wondered who could possibly be visiting at that hour he looked out of the glass panel on the side of the door and was shocked to find himself staring directly into marissas face marissa he said in disbelief pulling open the door behind her he could see a yellow cab descending his long curved driveway marissa saw him hold out his arms and ran into them bursting into tears i thought you were in california said ralph why didnt you call and let me know you were coming i would have met you at the airport marissa just held onto him crying it was so wonderful to feel safe what happened to you he asked but was only greeted by louder sobs at least lets sit down he said helping her to the couch for a few minutes he just let her cry patting her gently on the back its okay he said for lack of anything else he eyed the phone willing it to ring he had to make a call and at this rate she was never going to let him get up perhaps youd like something to drink he asked how about some of that special cognac maybe it will make you feel better marissa shook her head wine i have a nice bottle of chardonnay open in the refrigerator ralph was running out of ideas marissa just held him tighter but her sobs were lessening her breathing becoming more regular five minutes went by ralph sighed where is your luggage marissa didnt answer but did fish a tissue out of her pocket and wipe her face ive got some cold chicken in the kitchen at last marissa sat up maybe in a little bit just stay with me a little longer ive been so scared then why didnt you call me from the airport and what happened to your car didnt you leave it there its a long story said marissa but i was afraid that someone might be watching it i didnt want anybody to know i was back in atlanta ralph raised his eyebrows does that mean youd like to spend the night if you dont mind said marissa nothing like inviting myself but youve been such a good friend would you like me to drive you over to your house to get some things asked ralph thanks but i dont want to show up there for the same reason i was afraid to go to my car if i were to drive anyplace tonight id run over to the cdc and get a package that i hope tad put away for me but to tell you the truth i think it all can wait until morning even that criminal lawyer who i hope will be able to keep me out of jail good grief said ralph i hope youre not serious dont you think its time you told me whats going on marissa picked up ralphs hand i will i promise let me just calm down a little more maybe i should eat something ill fix you some chicken he said thats all right i know where the kitchen is maybe ill just scramble some eggs ill join you in a minute i have to make a call marissa dragged herself through the house in the kitchen she glanced around at all the appliances and space and thought it was a waste just to be making eggs but that was what sounded best she got them out of the refrigerator along with some bread for toast then she realized she hadnt asked ralph if he wanted some too she was about to call out but decided he wouldnt hear her putting the eggs down she went over to the intercom and began pushing the buttons on the console to see if she could figure out how it worked hello hello she said as she held down different combinations stumbling onto the correct sequence she suddenly heard ralphs voice shes not in san francisco he was saying shes here at my house pause jackson i dont know what happened shes hysterical all she said was that she has a package waiting for her at the cdc listen i cant talk now ive got to get back to her pause ill keep her here dont worry but get over here as soon as you can pause no no one knows shes here im sure of that bye marissa clutched the counter top afraid she was going to faint all this time ralphthe one person shed trustedhad been one of them and jackson it had to be the same jackson shed met at ralphs dinner party the head of pac and he was on his way over oh god knowing ralph was on his way to the kitchen marissa forced herself to go on with her cooking but when she tried to break an egg on the side of the skillet she smashed it shell and all into the pan she had the other egg in her hand when ralph appeared with some drinks she broke the second egg a bit more deftly mixing it all together including the first eggs shell smells good he said brightly he put down her glass and touched her lightly on the back marissa jumped wow you really are uptight how are we going to get you to relax marissa didnt say anything although she was no longer the slightest bit hungry she went through the motions of cooking the eggs buttering the toast and putting out jam looking at ralphs expensive silk shirt the heavy gold cuff links the tasseled gucci loafers everything about him suddenly seemed a ridiculous affectation as did the whole elaborately furnished house it all represented the conspicuous consumption of a wealthy doctor now fearful of the new medical competition of changing times of medicine no longer being a sellers market obviously ralph was a member of pac of course he was a supporter of markham and it was ralph not tad who had always known where she was serving the eggs marissa thought that even if she could escape there was no one to go to she certainly couldnt use a lawyer ralph recommended in fact now that she knew ralph was implicated she remembered why the name of the law firm hed suggested had sounded familiar cooper hodges mcquinllin and hanks had been listed as the service agent of pac marissa felt trapped the men pursuing her had powerful connections she had no idea how deeply they had penetrated the cdc certainly the conspiracy involved the congressman who exerted control over the cdc budget marissas mind reeled she was terrified no one would believe her and she was acutely aware that the only piece of hard evidence she hadthe vaccination gunwas resting somewhere in the maximum containment lab to which she knew from painful experience her pursuers had access the only thing that was crystal clear was that she had to get away from ralph before jackson and maybe more thugs arrived picking up her fork she had a sudden vision of the blond man hurling himself through the bathroom door in san francisco she dropped the fork again afraid she was about to faint ralph grabbed her elbow and helped her to the kitchen table he put the food on a plate and placed it in front of her and urged her to eat you were doing so well a minute ago he said youll feel better if you get something in your stomach he picked up the fork shed dropped and tossed it into the sink then got another from the silver drawer marissa dropped her head into her hands she had to get herself under control valuable time was ticking away not hungry after all asked ralph not very admitted marissa the very smell of the eggs was enough to make her sick she shuddered maybe you should take a tranquilizer ive got some upstairs what do you think okay said marissa be right back said ralph squeezing her shoulder this was the chance she had prayed for as soon as he was out of the room marissa was on her feet snatching the phone off its hook but there was no dial tone ralph must have disconnected it somehow so much for the police replacing the phone she rushed around the kitchen searching for ralphs car keys nothing next she tried the adjoining family room there was a tiny marble urn on the room divider with a few keys but none for a car going back through the kitchen marissa went to the small foyer by the back door there was a cork bulletin board an antique school desk and an old bureau there was also a door that led to the bathroom trying the desk first she lifted its cover and rummaged through its contents there were some oddshaped house keys but that was all turning to the small bureau she began opening drawers finding a jumble of gloves scarves and rain gear what do you need asked ralph suddenly appearing behind her guiltily she straightened up searching for an alibi ralph waited looking at her expectantly his right hand was closed his left hand held a glass of water i thought maybe i could find a sweater said marissa ralph eyed her curiously if anything the house was too warm after all it was almost june ill turn the heat on in the kitchen he said guiding her back to her chair he extended his right hand here take this he dropped a capsule into marissas palm it was red and ivory in color dalmane questioned marissa i thought you were getting me a tranquilizer it will relax you and give you a good nights sleep explained ralph shaking her head and handing the capsule back to ralph marissa said id prefer a tranquilizer what about valium fine said marissa as soon as she heard him climbing the back stairs marissa ran to the front foyer there were no keys on the elaborate marble halftable or in the one central drawer opening the closet marissa rapidly patted jacket pockets nothing she was back in the kitchen just in time to hear ralph start down the back stairs there you go he said dropping a blue tablet into marissas hand what dose is this ten milligrams dont you think thats a little much youre so upset it wont affect you as it would normally said ralph handing her a glass of water she took it from him then pretended to take the valium but dropped it into the pocket of her jacket instead now lets try the food again said ralph marissa forced herself to eat a little as she tried to figure out a way to escape before jackson arrived the food tasted awful and she put down her fork after a few bites still not hungry said ralph marissa shook her head well lets go into the living room she was glad to leave the cooking smells but the moment they were seated ralph urged her to have a fresh drink i dont think i should after the valium a little wont hurt are you sure youre not trying to get me drunk said marissa she forced a laugh maybe youd better let me fix the drinks fine by me said ralph lifting his feet to the coffee table make mine scotch marissa went directly to the bar and poured ralph a good four fingers of scotch then checking to see that he was absorbed she took out the valium tablet broke it in half and dropped the pieces into the alcohol unfortunately they did not dissolve fishing the pieces out she pulverized them with the scotch bottle and swept the powder into the drink you need any help called ralph no she said pouring a little brandy into her own glass here you go ralph took his drink and settled back on the couch sitting down beside him marissa racked her brains to figure out where he might have put his car keys she wondered what he would say if she suddenly demanded them but decided it was too great a risk if he realized she knew about him he might forcibly restrain her this way she still had a chance if she could just find the keys a horrible thought occurred to her he probably had just put them in his pants pocket as distasteful as it was marissa forced herself to snuggle against him provocatively she placed her hand on his hip sure enough she could feel the keys through the light gabardine now how on earth was she going to get them gritting her teeth she tilted her face to his encouraging him to kiss her as his arms circled her waist she let her fingers slide into his pocket scarcely breathing she felt the edge of the ring and pulled the keys jangled a little and she began frantically kissing him sensing his response she decided she had to take the chance please god please god she prayed and pulled out the keys and hid them in her own pocket ralph had obviously forgotten jackson was coming or hed decided sex was the best way to keep marissa quiet in any case it was time to stop him darling she said i hate to do this to you but that pill is getting to me i think im going to have to go to sleep just rest here ill hold you id love to but then youd have to carry me upstairs she pulled herself out of his embrace and he solicitously helped her up the stairs to the guest bedroom dont you want me to stay with you he asked im sorry ralph im about to pass out just let me sleep she forced a smile we can always continue when the valium wears off as if to end any further conversation she lay on the bed fully clothed dont you want to borrow pajamas he asked hopefully no no i cant keep my eyes open well call if you need anything ill just be downstairs the moment he closed the door she tiptoed over and listened to him go down the front stairs then she went to the window and opened it the balcony outside was just as she remembered as quietly as possible she slipped out into the warm spring night above was an inverted bowl of stars the trees were just dark silhouettes there was no wind in the distance a dog barked then marissa heard a car quickly she surveyed her position she was about fifteen feet above the asphalt drive there was no possibility of jumping the balcony was surrounded by a low balustrade separating it from the sloped roof of the porch to the left the porch roof abutted the tower and to the right it swept around the corner of the building climbing over the balustrade marissa inched her way to the corner the porch roof ended about twenty feet away the fire escape descended from the third floor but it was out of reach turning she started back for the balcony she was halfway there when the car shed heard earlier turned into ralphs drive marissa lay still on the sloped roof she knew that she was in full view of anybody coming up the driveway if they happened to look up the cars lights played against the trees then swept across the front of the house bathing her in light before it pulled up to the front steps she heard the doors open and several voices they were not excited apparently no one had seen her sprawled on the roof ralph answered the door there was more conversation and then the voices disappeared inside marissa scampered along the roof and climbed back over the balustrade to the balcony she ducked into the guest room and eased open the door to the hallway stepping into the hall she could hear ralphs voice though she could not make out what he was saying as quietly as possible she started toward the back stairs the light from the vestibule did not penetrate beyond the second turn in the hallway and marissa had to make her way by running her hands along the walls she passed a number of dark bedrooms before she rounded a final corner and saw the kitchen light shining below at the head of the stairs she hesitated the sounds in the old house were confusing her she still heard voices but she also heard footsteps the problem was she couldnt tell where they were coming from at that moment she caught sight of a hand on the newel post below changing direction marissa went up the stairs and was halfway to the third floor in seconds one of the treads squeaked under her foot and she hesitated heart pounding listening to the relentless approach of the figure below when he reached the second floor and turned down the hall toward the front of the house she let out her breath marissa continued up the stairs wincing at every sound the door to the servants apartment at the top was closed but not locked as quietly as possible she made her way across the dark living room and into the bedroom that she guessed looked out on the fire escape after struggling to raise the window she climbed out onto the flimsy metal grate never fond of heights it took all her courage to stand upright hesitantly she started down one step at a time leading with her right foot by the time she reached the second story she heard excited voices inside the house and the sound of doors opening and slamming shut lights began going on in the darkened rooms they had already realized that she had fled forcing herself to hurry marissa rounded the secondstory platform and was stopped by what seemed to be a large jumble of metal feeling with her hands she realized that the last flight of stairs had been drawn up to protect the house from burglars desperately she tried to figure out how to lower them there didnt seem to be any release mechanism then she noticed a large counterweight behind her gingerly she put her foot on the first step there was a loud squeak of metal knowing she had no choice marissa shifted her full weight to the step with a nerveshattering crash the stairs shot to the ground and she ran down them as soon as her feet touched the grass she ran for the garage arms swinging wildly there was no way the men inside the house could not have heard the fire escapes descent in seconds they would be looking for her she ran to a side door to the garage praying to heaven that it was not locked it wasnt as she raced inside she heard the back door of the house open desperately she stepped into the dark interior pulling the door shut behind her turning she moved forward colliding almost immediately with ralphs sdl sedan feeling for the car door she opened it and slipped behind the wheel she fumbled with the key until it slid into the ignition and turned it several indicator lights flashed on but the car didnt start then she remembered ralph explaining how you had to wait for the orange light to go out because the engine was a diesel she switched the ignition back off then turned the key part way the orange light went on and marissa waited she heard someone raise the garage door frantically she hit the button locking all four doors of the car come on she urged through clenched teeth the orange light went out she turned the key and the car roared to life as she stomped on the gas there was a series of loud thumps as someone pounded her window she shifted to reverse and floored the accelerator there was a seconds delay before the big car leaped backward with such force that she was flung against the wheel she braced herself as the car shot out the door sending two men diving sideways for safety the car careened wildly down the drive marissa jammed on the brakes as the car screeched around the front of the house but it was too late she rammed jacksons car with the back of hers shifting to forward marissa thought she was free until one of the men taking advantage of her momentary halt flung himself across the hood marissa accelerated the tires spun but the car did not move she was caught on the car behind putting the mercedes into reverse then into drive she rocked the car as if she were stuck in snow there was a scraping sound of metal then she shot forward dislodging her attacker as she careened down the drive forget it said jake crawling out from under jacksons car wiping grease from his hands she busted your radiator he told the doctor theres no coolant so even if it started you couldnt drive it damn said jackson getting out that woman lives a charmed life he looked furiously at heberling this probably wouldnt have happened if id come here directly instead of waiting for your goons to get in from the airport yeah said heberling and what would you have done reasoned with her you needed jake and george you can use my sl offered ralph but its only a twoseater she got too big a head start said george wed never catch her i dont know how she escaped said ralph apologetically id just left her to sleep shes had ten milligrams of valium for chrissake he noticed he felt a little dizzy himself any idea where she might go asked jackson i dont think shell go to the police said ralph shes terrified of everyone especially now she might try the cdc she said something about a package being there jackson looked at heberling they had the same thought the vaccination gun we may as well send jake and george said heberling were pretty sure she wont go home and after what she did to al the boys are most eager for revenge fifteen minutes from the house marissa began to calm down enough to worry about where she was she had made so many random turns in case she was being pursued she had lost all sense of direction for all she knew she could have driven in a full circle ahead she saw street lights and a gas station marissa pulled over lowering her window a young man came out wearing an atlanta braves baseball hat could you tell me where i am asked marissa this heres a shell station said the young man eyeing the damage to ralphs car did you know that both your taillights is busted im not surprised said marissa how about emory university could you tell me how to get there lady you look like youve been in a demolition derby he said shaking his head in dismay marissa repeated her question and finally the man gave her some vague directions ten minutes later marissa cruised past the cdc the building seemed quiet and deserted but she still wasnt sure what she should do or who she could trust she would have preferred going to a good lawyer but she had no idea how to choose one certainly mcquinllin was out of the question the only person she could envision approaching was dr fakkry from the world health organization he certainly was above the conspiracy and conveniently he was staying at the peachtree plaza the problem was would he believe her or would he just call dubchek or someone else at the cdc putting her back into the hands of her pursuers fear forced her to do what she felt was her only logical choice she had to get the vaccination gun it was her only piece of hard evidence without it she doubted anyone would take her seriously she still had tads access card and if he was not involved with pac the card might still be usable of course there was always the chance that security wouldnt allow her into the building boldly marissa turned into the driveway and pulled up just past the entrance to the cdc she wanted the car handy in case anyone tried to stop her looking in the front door she saw the guard sitting at the desk bent over a paperback novel when he heard her come in he looked up his face expressionless rolling her lower lip into her mouth and biting on it marissa walked deliberately trying to hide her fear she picked up the pen and scrawled her name in the signin book then she looked up expecting some comment but the man just stared impassively what are you reading asked marissa nerves making her chatter camus well she wasnt about to ask if it was the plague she started for the main elevators conscious of the mans eyes on her back she pushed the button to her floor turned and looked at him he was still watching her the moment the doors shut he snatched up the phone and dialed as soon as someone answered he said dr blumenthal just signed in she went up in the elevator wonderful jerome said dubchek his voice was hoarse as if he were tired or sick well be right there dont let anyone else in whatever you say dr dubchek marissa got off the elevator and stood for a few minutes watching the floor indicators both elevators stayed where they were the building was silent convinced that she wasnt being followed she went to the stairs and ran down a flight then out into the catwalk inside the virology building she hurried down the long cluttered hall rounded the corner and confronted the steel security door holding her breath she inserted tads access card and tapped out his number there was a pause for a moment she was afraid an alarm might sound but all she heard was the sound of the latch releasing the heavy door opened and she was inside after flipping the circuit breakers she twisted the wheel on the airtight door climbed into the first room and instead of donning a scrub suit went directly into the next chamber as she struggled into a plastic suit she wondered where tad might have hidden the contaminated vaccination gun dubchek drove recklessly braking for curves only when absolutely necessary and running red lights two men had joined him john in the front seat braced himself against the door mark in the back had more trouble avoiding being thrown from side to side the expressions on all three faces were grim they were afraid they would be too late there it is said george pointing at the sign that said centers for disease control and theres ralphs car he added pointing at the mercedes in the semicircular driveway looks like luck is finally on our side making up his mind he pulled into the sheraton motor inn lot across the street george drew his s w magnum checking to see that all the chambers were filled he opened the door and stepped out holding the gun down along his hip light gleamed off the stainlesssteel barrel you sure you want to use that cannon asked jake it makes so goddamn much noise i wish i had had this thing when she was driving around with you on the hood george snapped come on jake shrugged and got out of the car patting the small of his back he felt the butt of his own beretta automatic it was a much neater weapon air line in hand marissa hastily climbed through the final door to the maximum containment lab she plugged into the central manifold and looked around the mess shed helped create on that other fateful night had all been cleared away but the memory of that episode flooded back with horrifying clarity marissa was shaking all she wanted was to find her parcel and get the hell out but that was easier said than done as in any lab there was a profusion of places where a package that size could be hidden marissa started on the right working her way back opening cabinet doors and pulling out drawers she got about halfway down the room when she straightened up there had to be a better way at the central island she went to the containment hood that tad considered his own in the cupboards below she found bottles of reagents paper towels plastic garbage bags boxes of new glassware and an abundance of other supplies but there was no package resembling hers she was about to move on when she looked through the glass of the containment hood itself behind tads equipment she could just barely make out the dark green of a plastic garbage bag turning on the fan over the hood marissa pulled up the glass front then careful not to touch tads setup she lifted out the bag inside was the federal express package to be sure she checked the label it was addressed to tad in her handwriting marissa put the package in a new garbage bag sealing it carefully then she put the used bag back inside the containment hood and pulled the glass front into place at the central manifold she hurriedly detached her air hose then headed for the door it was time to find dr fakkry or someone else in authority she could trust standing under the shower of phenolic disinfectant marissa tried to be patient there was an automated timing device so she had to wait for the process to finish before she could open the door once in the next room she struggled out of her plastic suit pulling frantically each time the zipper stuck when she finally got it off her street clothes were drenched with sweat dubchek came to a screeching halt directly in front of the cdc entrance the three men piled out of the car jerome was already holding open one of the glass doors dubchek didnt wait to ask questions certain that the guard would tell them if marissa had left he ran into the waiting elevator with the other two men on his heels and pressed the button for the third floor marissa had just started across the catwalk when the door to the main building opened and three men burst out spinning around she ran back into virology stop marissa someone yelled it sounded like dubchek oh god was he chasing her too she latched the door behind her and looked about for a place to hide to her right was an elevator to her left a stairwell there was no time to debate by the time dubchek forced open the door all he could see was the elevator light pointing down marissa was already on the lobby level as the three men began pounding down the stairs knowing dubchek was close behind marissa knew she had no time to slow down to avoid alerting the security guard when shed reached the main building his head popped up from his book just in time to catch her streaking past he stood up but that was all and she was already gone when he decided that dr dubchek might have wanted her stopped by force outside she fumbled for the keys to ralphs car switching her parcel to her left hand she heard shouts and then the doors to the cdc crash open wrestling the car door open she started to slide behind the wheel she was so programmed for flight that it took a minute for her to realize that the passenger seat was occupied there was also someone in the back but worse was the sight of an enormous revolver pointing at her marissa tried to reverse her direction but it was as if she were caught in a heavy viscous fluid her body wouldnt respond she saw the gun coming up at her but she could do nothing she saw a face in the halflight and she heard someone start to say goodbye but the gun went off with a fearful concussion and time stopped when marissa regained consciousness she was lying on something soft someone was calling her name slowly opening her eyes she realized that shed been carried back inside to the couch in the cdc lobby flashing red and blue lights washed the room like a tawdry punk discotheque there seemed to be many people coming in and out of the room it was too confusing she closed her eyes again and wondered what had happened to the men with the guns marissa are you all right her lids fluttered open and she saw dubchek bending over her his dark eyes almost black with fear marissa he said again are you all right ive been so worried when you finally made us realize what was going on we were afraid theyd try to kill you but you never stayed still long enough for us to find you marissa was still too shocked to speak please say something dubchek pleaded did they hurt you i thought you were part of it part of the conspiracy was all she could manage to utter i was afraid of that groaned dubchek not that i didnt deserve it i was so busy protecting the cdc i just dismissed your theories but believe me i had nothing to do with any of it marissa reached for his hand i guess i never gave you much chance to explain either i was so busy breaking all the rules an ambulance attendant came up to them does the lady want to go to the hospital do you marissa asked dubchek i guess so but i think im okay as another attendant came up to help lift her onto a stretcher she said when i heard the first bang i thought id been shot no one of the fbi men id alerted shot your wouldbe killer instead marissa shuddered dubchek walked beside the stretcher as they took her to the ambulance she reached out and took his hand epilogue marissa was unpacking from a twoweek vacation taken at dr carbonaras insistence when the doorbell rang she had just returned from virginia where her family had done everything they could to spoil her even giving her a new puppy that shed immediately named taffy two as she walked downstairs she couldnt imagine who might be at the door she hadnt told anyone the exact date of her return when she opened the door she was surprised to see cyrill dubchek and a stranger i hope you dont mind our turning up like this but dr carbonara said you might be home and dr fakkry from world health wanted to meet you this is his last day in america tonight he is flying back to geneva the stranger stepped forward and dipped his head then he looked directly at marissa his eyes reminded her of dubcheks dark and liquid i am deeply honored said dr fakkry with a crisp english accent i wanted to thank you personally for your brilliant detective work and with no help from us admitted dubchek im flattered said marissa at a loss for words dubchek cleared his throat marissa found his new lack of confidence appealing when he wasnt making her furious she could admit that he was actually very handsome we thought youd like to know whats been happening he said the press has been given as little detail as possible but even the police agree you are entitled to the truth id love to hear everything said marissa but please come in and sit down can i get you something to drink when they were settled dr fakkry said thanks to you almost everyone connected to the ebola conspiracy has been arrested the man you stabbed in san francisco implicated dr heberling the minute he recovered from surgery the police think he wanted to be sent to jail so you couldnt find him again said dubchek with a hint of his old sardonic grin marissa shivered remembering the terrible episode of stabbing the man in the bathroom at the fairmont for a moment the image of his iceblue eyes froze her then pulling herself together she asked what had happened to heberling hell be going before a grand jury on multiple counts of murder with intent said dubchek the judge refused to set bail no matter how high saying that he was as dangerous to society as the nazi war criminals and the man i hit with the vaccination gun marissa had been afraid to ask this question she didnt want to be responsible for killing anyone or for spreading ebola hell live to stand trial he did use the serum in time and it proved effective but he came down with a severe case of serum sickness as soon as hes better hell also be off to jail what about the other officers of the physicians action congress asked marissa a number of them have offered to turn states evidence said dubchek its making the investigation inordinately easy we are beginning to believe that the regular members of the organization thought they were supporting just an ordinary lobbying campaign what about tieman he certainly didnt seem the type to be mixed up in such an affair or at least his conscience really seemed to bother him his lawyer has been making arrangements for a lighter sentence in return for his cooperation as for pac itself the groups bankrupt the families of the victims have almost all filed suit theyre also suing the doctors individually most of the officers are being prosecuted as criminals so they should be behind bars a good while particularly jackson he and dr heberling would bei think your word is lynchedif the public got ahold of them added dr fakkry i guess ralph will also be sentenced marissa said slowly she was still trying to come to terms with the fact that the man she considered a protector had tried to kill her he was one of the first to cooperate with the prosecution hell get some breaks but i doubt hell be released for a long time aside from his connection with pac he is directly linked to the attacks on you i know marissa sighed so its really over thanks to your persistence said dubchek and the outbreak in new york is definitely under control thank god she said so when will you be coming back to the cdc asked dubchek weve already gotten you clearance for the maximum containment lab this time there was no doubt about his grin no one relished the thought of your stumbling around in there at night anymore marissa blushed in spite of herself i havent decided yet im actually considering going back into pediatrics back to boston dubcheks face fell it will be a loss to the field said dr fakkry youve become an international epidemiological hero ill give it more thought promised marissa but even if i do go back to pediatrics im planning to stay in atlanta she nuzzled her new puppy there was a pause then she added but ive one request if we can be of any help said dr fakkry marissa shook her head only cyrill can help on this one whether i go back to pediatrics or not i was hoping hed ask me to dinner again dubchek was taken off guard then laughing at fakkrys bemused expression he leaned over and hugged marissa to his side
