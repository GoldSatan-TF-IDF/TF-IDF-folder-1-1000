michael connelly lost light the ninth book in the harry bosch series there is no end of things in the heart somebody once told me that she said it came from a poem she believed in she understood it to mean that if you took something to heart really brought it inside those red velvet folds then it would always be there for you no matter what happened it would be there waiting she said this could mean a person a place a dream a mission anything sacred she told me that it is all connected in those secret folds always it is all part of the same and will always be there carrying the same beat as your heart i am fiftytwo years old and i believe it at night when i try to sleep but cant that is when i know it it is when all the pathways seem to connect and i see the people i have loved and hated and helped and hurt i see the hands that reach for me i hear the beat and see and understand what i must do i know my mission and i know there is no turning away or turning back and it is in those moments that i know there is no end of things in the heart the last thing i expected was for alexander taylor to answer his own door it belied everything i knew about hollywood a man with a billiondollar boxoffice record answered the door for nobody instead he would have a uniformed man posted fulltime at his front door and this doorman would only allow me entrance after carefully checking my identification and appointment he would then hand me off to a butler or the firstfloor maid who would walk me the rest of the way in footsteps falling as silent as snow as we went but there was none of that at the mansion on belair crest road the driveway gate had been left open and after i parked in the front turnaround circle and knocked on the door it was the boxoffice champion himself who opened it and beckoned me into a home whose dimensions could have been copied directly from the international terminal at lax taylor was a large man over six feet and pounds he carried it well though with a full head of curly brown hair and contrasting blue eyes the hair on his chin added the highbrow look of an artist to this image though art had very little to do with the field in which he toiled he was wearing a soft blue running suit that probably cost more than everything i was wearing a white towel was wrapped tightly around his neck and stuffed into the collar his cheeks were pink his breathing heavy and labored i had caught him in the middle of something and he seemed a little put out by it i had come to the door in my best suit the ash gray singlebreasted i had paid twelve hundred dollars for three years before i hadnt worn it in over nine months and that morning i had needed to dust off the shoulders after taking it out of the closet i was cleanshaven and i had purpose the first i had felt since i put the suit on that hanger so many months before come in taylor said everybodys off today and i was just working out lucky the gyms just down the hall or i probably wouldnt have even heard you its a big place yes that was lucky he moved back into the house he didnt shake my hand and i remembered that from the time i first met him four years before he led the way leaving it to me to close the front door do you mind if i finish up on the bike while we talk no thats fine we walked down a marble hallway taylor staying three steps ahead of me as if i were part of his entourage he was probably most comfortable that way and that was all right with me it gave me time to look around the bank of windows on the left gave a view of the opulent groundsa soccerfieldsized rectangle of rolling green that led to what i assumed was a guest house or a pool house or both there was a golf cart parked outside of the distant structure and i could see tracks back and forth across the manicured green leading to the main house i had seen a lot in la from the poorest ghettos to mountaintop mansions but it was the first time i had seen a homestead inside the city limits so large that a golf cart was necessary to get from one side to the other along the wall on the right were framed one sheets from the many films alexander taylor had produced i had seen a few of them when they made it to television and seen commercials for the rest for the most part they were the kind of action films that neatly fit into the confines of a thirtysecond commercial the kind that leave you no pressing need afterward to actually see the movie none would ever be considered art by any meaning of the word but in hollywood they were far more important than art they were profitable and that was the bottom line of all bottom lines taylor made a sweeping right and i followed him into the gym the room brought new meaning to the idea of personal fitness all manner of weight machines were lined against the mirrored walls at center was what appeared to be a fullsize boxing ring taylor smoothly mounted a stationary bike pushed a few buttons on the digital display in front of him and started pedaling mounted side by side and high on the opposite wall were three large flatscreen televisions tuned to competing twentyfourhour news channels and the bloomberg business report the sound on the bloomberg screen was up taylor lifted a remote control and muted it again it was a courtesy i wasnt expecting when i had spoken to his secretary to make the appointment she had made it sound like i would be lucky to get a few questions in while the great man worked his cell phone no partner taylor asked i thought you guys worked in pairs i like to work alone i left it at that for the moment i stood silently as taylor got up to a rhythm on the cycle he was in his late forties but he looked much younger maybe surrounding himself with the equipment and machinery of health and youthfulness did the trick then again maybe it was face peels and botox injections too i can give you three miles he said as he pulled the towel from around his neck and draped it over the handlebars about twenty minutes thatll be fine i reached for the notebook in my inside coat pocket it was a spiral notebook and the wire coil caught on the jackets lining as i pulled i felt like a jackass trying to get it loose and finally just jerked it free i heard the lining tear but smiled away the embarrassment taylor cut me a break by looking away and up at one of the silent television screens i think its the little things i miss most about my former life for more than twenty years i carried a small bound notebook in my coat pocket spiral notebooks werent alloweda smart defense attorney could claim pages of exculpatory notes had been torn out the bound notebooks took care of that problem and were easier on the jacket lining at the same time i was glad to hear from you taylor said it has always bothered me about angie to this day she was a good kid you know and all this time i thought you guys had just given up on it that she didnt matter i nodded i had been careful with my words when i spoke to the secretary on the phone while i had not lied to her i had been guilty of leading her and letting her assume things it was a necessity if i had told her i was an excop working freelance on an old case then i was pretty sure i wouldnt have gotten anywhere near the boxoffice champ for the interview uh before we start i think there might have been a misunderstanding i dont know what your secretary told you but im not a cop not anymore taylor coasted for a moment on the pedals but then quickly worked back into his rhythm his face was red and he was sweating freely he reached to a cup holder on the side of the digital control board and took out a pair of half glasses and a slim card that had his production companys logo at the topa square with a mazelike design of curls inside itand several handwritten notations below it he put on the glasses and squinted anyway as he read the card thats not what i have here he said ive got lapd detective harry bosch at ten audrey wrote this shes been with me for eighteen yearssince i was making straighttovideo dreck in the valley she is very good at what she does and usually very accurate well that was me for a long time but not since last year i retired i might not have been very clear about that on the phone i wouldnt blame audrey if i were you i wont he glanced down at me tilting his head forward to see over the glasses so then what can i do for you detectiveor i guess i should say mrbosch ive got two and a half miles and then were finished here there was a benchpress machine to taylor s right i moved over and sat down i took the pen out of my shirt pocketno snags this timeand got ready to write i dont know if you remember me but we have spoken mr taylor four years ago when the body of angella benton was found in the vestibule of her apartment building the case was assigned to me you and i spoke in your office over at eidolon on the archway lot one of my partners kiz rider was with me i remember the black womanshe had known angie she said from the gym i think it was i remember that at the time you two instilled a lot of confidence in me but then you disappeared i never heard from we were taken off the case we were from hollywood division after the robbery and shooting a few days later the case was taken away robberyhomicide division took it a low chime sounded from the stationary cycle and i thought maybe it meant taylor had covered his first mile i remember those guys taylor said in a derisive voice tweedledumb and tweedledumber they inspired nothing in me i remember one was more interested in securing a position as technical advisor to my films than he was in the real case angie whatever happened to them ones dead and ones retired dorsey and cross i had known them both taylor s description aside both had been capable investigators you didnt get to rhd by coasting what i didnt tell taylor was that jack dorsey and lawton cross became known in detective services as the partners who had the ultimate bad luck while working an investigation they drew several months after the angella benton case they stopped into a bar in hollywood to grab lunch and a booster shot they were sitting in a booth with their ham sandwiches and bushmills when the place was hit by an armed robber it was believed that dorsey who was sitting facing the door made a move from the booth but was too slow the gunman cut him down before he got the safety off his gun and he was dead before he hit the floor a round fired at cross creased his skull and a second hit him in the neck and lodged in his spine the bartender was executed last at pointblank range and then what happened to the case taylor asked rhetorically not an ounce of sympathy in his voice for the fallen cops not a damn thing happened i guarantee its been gathering dust like that cheap suit you pulled out of the closet before coming to see me i took the insult because i had to i just nodded as if i agreed with him i couldnt tell if his anger was for the never avenged murder of angella benton or for what happened after the robbery and the next murder and the shutting down of his film it was worked by those guys fulltime for six months i said after that there were other cases the cases keep coming mr taylor its not like in your movies i wish it was yes there are always other cases taylor said thats always the easy out isnt it blame it on the workload meantime the kid is still dead the moneys still gone and thats too bad next case step right up i waited to make sure he was finished he wasnt but now its four years later and you show up whats your story bosch you con her family into hiring you is that it no all of her family was in ohio i havent contacted them then what is it its unsolved mr taylor and i still care about it i dont think it is being worked with any kind of dedication and thats it i nodded then taylor nodded to himself fifty grand he said excuse me ill pay you fifty grandif you solve the thing theres no movie if you dont solve it mr taylor you somehow have the wrong impression i dont want your money and this is no movie all i want right now is your help listen to me i know a good story when i hear it detective haunted by the one that got away its a universal theme tried and true fifty up front we can talk about the back end i gathered the notebook and pen from the bench and stood up this wasnt going anywhere or at least not in the direction i wanted thanks for your time mr taylor if i cant find my way out ill send up a flare as i took my first step toward the door a second chime came from the exercise bike taylor spoke to my back home stretch bosch come back and ask me your questions and ill keep my fifty grand if you dont want it i turned back to him but kept standing i opened the notebook again lets start with the robbery i said who from your company knew about the two million dollars im talking about who knew the specificswhen it was coming in for the shoot and how it was going to be delivered anything and anybody you can remember im starting this from scratch angella benton died on her twentyfourth birthday her body was found crumpled on the spanish tile in the vestibule of the apartment building where she lived on fountain near la brea her key was in her mailbox inside the mailbox were two birthday cards mailed separately from columbus by her mother and father it turned out they were not divorced they each just wanted to write their own birthday wishes to their only daughter benton had been strangled before or after death but most likely after her blouse had been torn open and her bra jerked up to expose her breasts her killer then apparently masturbated over the corpse producing a small amount of ejaculate that was later collected by forensic technicians for dna typing her purse was taken and never recovered time of death was established as between pm and midnight her body was found by another resident in the apartment building when he left his home at am to take his dog for a walk that was where i came in at the time i was a detective third grade assigned to the hollywood division of the los angeles police department i had two partners we worked in threes instead of pairs back then as part of an experimental configuration designed to close cases quickly kizmin rider and jerry edgar and i were alerted by pager and assigned the case at am we met at hollywood division picked up two crown vics and then drove to the crime scene we saw angella bentons body for the first time approximately two to three hours after she had been killed she lay on her side on brown tile that was the color of dried blood her eyes were open and bugged distorting what i could tell had been a pretty face the corneas were hemorrhaged i noticed that her exposed chest was almost flat it looked almost boyish and i thought maybe this had been a private embarrassment to her in a city where physical attributes seemed often to outweigh those on the inside it made the tearing open of her blouse and lifting of her bra all the more of an attack as if it were not enough to take her life the killer also had to expose her most private vulnerability but it was her hands that i would remember the most somehow when her lifeless body was dropped to the tile her hands fell together off to the left side of her body they were directed upward from her head as if she were reaching out to someone almost beseechingly begging for something they looked like hands from a renaissance painting like the hands of the damned reaching heavenward for forgiveness in my life i have worked almost a thousand homicides and no positioning of a fallen body ever gave me such pause perhaps i saw too much in the vagaries of how she had fallen but every case is a battle in a war that never ends believe me you need something to carry with you every time you go into the fight something to hold on to an edge that drives you or pulls you and it was her hands that did it for me i could not forget her hands i believed they were reaching to me i still do we got an immediate jump on the investigation because kizmin rider recognized the victim they had been acquaintances rider knew her by first name from the gym on el centro where they both worked out because of the irregular hours that came with her job on the homicide table rider could not keep a regular workout schedule she exercised at different times on different days depending on her time and the case she was working often she had encountered benton in the gym and they had struck up a conversational relationship while they worked side by side stairmasters rider knew benton was trying to establish a career in the film business on the production side she worked as a production assistant for eidolon productions the company headed by alexander taylor production schedules used all twentyfour hours on the clock depending on the availability of locations and personnel it meant that benton had a gym schedule similar to riders it also meant that benton had little time for relationships she told rider that shed had only two dates in the past year and that there was no man in her life it was only a surface friendship and rider had never seen benton outside of the gym they were both young black women trying to keep their bodies from betraying them as they went about busy professional lives and attempted to scale steep ladders in different worlds nevertheless the fact kiz knew her gave us a good jump we knew right away who we were dealing witha responsible and confident young woman who cared about both her health and her career it eliminated a variety of lifestyle angles we might have mistakenly pursued the negative from the break was that it was the first time rider had ever come across someone she knew as the victim of a homicide shed been assigned to investigate i noticed right away at the scene that it put a pause in her step she usually was quite vocal when breaking down a crime scene and developing an investigative theory at this scene she was silent until spoken to there were no witnesses to the murder the vestibule was hidden from street view and offered the killer a perfect blind he would have been able to move into the small space and attack without fear of being seen from outside still there had been a risk to the crime at any moment another resident of the building could have come home or left and come upon benton and her killer if the dog walker had taken his pet out an hour earlier he possibly could have ventured into the crime in progress he could have saved her or possibly have become a victim himself anomalies so much of the work entailed study of the anomalies the crime had the appearance of an attack of opportunity the killer had followed benton and waited for the moment she was in the blind yet there were aspects of the sceneits privacy for examplethat suggested that he already knew about the vestibule and may have been waiting there like a hunter watching a bait trap anomalies angella benton was no more than five feet five but she was a strong young woman rider had witnessed her workout regimen and knew firsthand of her strength and stamina yet there was no sign of a struggle fingernail scrapings produced no skin or blood belonging to anyone else had she known her killer why hadnt she fought the masturbation and the tearing open of the blouse suggested a crime of psychosexual motivation a crime perpetrated alone yet the seeming lack of any fight for life suggested benton had been completely and quickly overpowered had there been more than one killer in the first twentyfour hours our purpose had been to collect the evidence make notifications and conduct first interviews of those immediately connected to the crime scene it was in the second twentyfour that the sifting began and we began to work the anomalies trying to crack them open like walnuts and by the end of that second day we had concluded that it was a staged crime scene that is a scene designed by the perpetrator to convey false ideas about the crime we concluded we had a killer who thought he was smarter than us who was sending us down the psychosexualpredator road when the reality of the crime was something altogether different the thing that tilted us in this direction was the semen found on the body in studying the crime scene photographs i noticed that drops of semen stretched across the victims body in a line suggesting a trajectory however the individual drops were round it was common investigative knowledge in regard to blood spatter evidence that round drops are formed when blood drops directly down to a surface ellipticalshaped drops occur when blood is spattered in a trajectory or at an angle to the surface we consulted the departments blood spatter expert to see if the norms of blood evidence extended to other bodily fluids we were told it did and that for us cracked open an anomaly we now theorized that the possibility was high that the killer or killers had planted the semen on the body it had possibly been taken to the crime scene and then dripped onto the body as part of an intended misdirection we refocused the investigation no longer did we view it as a case in which the victim wandered into the kill zone of a predator angella benton was the kill zone it had been something about her life and circumstances that had drawn the killer to her we attacked her life and work looking for that hidden thing that had set the plan to kill her into motion someone had wanted her dead and thought they were clever enough to disguise it as the work of a hitandrun psycho while publicly we pumped the sexslayer angle into the media machine privately we began looking elsewhere on the third day of the investigation edgar took the autopsy and the mounting paperwork duty while rider and i took the field we spent twelve hours in the offices of eidolon productions located at archway pictures on melrose alexander taylor had his moviemaking machine taking up nearly a third of the office space on the archway lot there were more than fifty employees by virtue of her job as a production assistant angella benton had interaction with them all a pa stands at the bottom of the hollywood totem pole benton had been a gofer a runner she had no office she had a desk in the windowless mail room but no matter because she was always on the move running between offices at archway and back and forth from productions in the field at that moment eidolon had two movies and a television show shooting at separate locations in and around los angeles each one of those productions was a small city unto itself a tent city that packed up and moved from location to location almost every night a city with another hundred or more people who could have interacted with angella benton and needed to be interviewed the task we had was daunting we asked for helpadditional bodies to help with the interviews the lieutenant could spare none it took the whole day for rider and me to cover the interviews at the company headquarters at archway and that was the one and only time i spoke to alexander taylor rider and i got a half hour with him and the conversation was perfunctory he knew benton of course but not well while she was at the bottom of the totem pole he was at the very top their interactions were infrequent and short she had been with the company less than six months and he had not been the one who had hired her we got no hits during that first day of interviews that is no interview we conducted resulted in a new direction or focus for the investigation we hit a wall no one we talked to had an inkling of why someone would want to kill angella benton the following day we split up so each detective could visit a production location to conduct interviews edgar took the television production out in valencia it was a familyoriented comedy about a couple with an only child who connives to keep her parents from having more children rider took the movie production nearest her home in santa monica it was a story about a man who takes credit for an anonymous valentine sent to a beautiful coworker and how their subsequent romance is built on a lie that grows inside him like a cancer i had the second movie production which was being shot in hollywood it was a highaction caper about a burglar who steals a suitcase with two million dollars in it not knowing that the money belongs to the mob as a detective three i was the team leader as such i made the decision not to inform taylor or any other administrators of his company that members of my team would be visiting the production locations i didnt want advance notice to precede us we simply split up the locations and the next morning we each arrived unannounced using the power of the badge to force our way in what happened the next morning shortly after i arrived at the set is well documented i sometimes review the moves of the investigation and wish i had gotten to the set one day sooner i think that i would have heard somebody mention the money and that i would have been able to put it all together but the truth is we handled the investigation appropriately we made the right moves at the right time i have no regrets about that but after that fourth morning the investigation was no longer mine the robberyhomicide division came in and bigfooted the case jack dorsey and lawton cross ran with it it had everything rhd likes in a case movies money and murder but they got nowhere with it moved on to other cases and then walked into nats for a ham sandwich and a jolt the case more or less died with dorsey cross lived but never recovered he came out of a sixweek coma with no memory of the shooting and no feeling below the neck a machine did his breathing for him and a lot of people in the department figured his luck was worse than dorseys because he survived but was no longer really living meantime the angella benton case was gathering dust everything dorsey and cross touched was tainted by their luck haunted nobody worked the benton case anymore every six months somebody in rhd would pull out the file and blow off the dust write the date and no new developments on the investigative log then slide it back into its place until the next time in the lapd that is what is called due diligence four years went by and i was now retired i was supposedly comfortable i had a house with no mortgage and a car that id paid cash for i had a pension that covered more than i needed covered it was like being on vacation no work no worries no problems but something was missing and deep down i knew it i was living like a jazz musician waiting for a gig i was staying up late staring at the walls and drinking too much red wine i needed to either pawn my instrument or find a place to play it and then i got the call it was lawton cross on the line word had finally gotten to him that i had pulled the pin he got his wife to call and then she held the phone up so he could speak to me harry do you ever think about angella benton all the time i told him me too harry my memorys come back and i think about that one a lot and thats all it took when i walked out of the hollywood division for the last time i thought id had enough that id walked around my last body conducted my last interview with somebody i knew was a liar but id hedged my bet just the same i walked out carrying a box full of filescopies of my open cases from twelve years in hollywood homicide angella bentons file had been in that box i didnt have to open it to remember the details to remember the way her body looked on the tile floor so exposed and violated it still drove the hook into me it cut me that she had been lost in the fireworks that came after that her life had not become important until after two million dollars was stolen i had never closed the case it had been taken away from me by the big shots before i could that was life in the lapd but that was then and this was now the call from lawton cross changed all of that in me it ended my extended vacation it gave me a job i no longer carried a badge but i still carried a thousand different habits and instincts that came with the badge like a reformed smoker whose hand digs inside his shirt pocket for the fix that is no longer there i constantly found myself reaching in some way for the comfort of my badge for almost thirty years of my life i had been part of an organization that promoted isolation from the outside world that cultivated the us versus them ethic i had been part of the cult of the blue religion and now i was out excommunicated part of the outside world i had no badge i was no longer part of us i was one of them as the months passed there was not a day that i did not alternately regret and revel in my decision to leave the department behind it was a period in which my main work was to separate the badge and what it stood for from my own personal mission for the longest time i believed the two were inextricably entwined i could not have one without the other but over the weeks and months came the realization that one identity was greater that it superseded the other my mission remained intact my job in this world badge or no badge was to stand for the dead when i hung up the phone after talking to lawton cross i knew i was ready and that it was time to stand again i went to the closet in the hallway and pulled out the box that contained the dusty files and all the voices of the dead they spoke to me in memories in crime scene visions of all of them i remembered angella benton the most i remembered her body crumpled on the spanish tile her hands held out in such a way as if reaching to me and i had my mission the morning after i spoke to alexander taylor i sat at the dining room table in my house on woodrow wilson drive i had a pot of hot coffee in the kitchen i had filled my fivedisc changer with cds chronicling some of art peppers late work as a sideman and i had the documents and photographs from the angella benton file spread in front of me the file was incomplete because the case was taken by rhd just as my investigation was beginning to come into focus and before many of the reports were written it was merely a starting point but after almost four years removed from a crime scene it was all i had that and the list of names alexander taylor had given me the day before as i readied myself for a day of chasing down names and setting up interviews my eyes were drawn to the small stack of newspaper clippings that had yellowed at the edges while closed in the file i took these up and began looking through them initially angella bentons murder rated only a short report in the los angeles times i remembered how this had frustrated me we needed witnesses not only to the crime itself but possibly to the killers car or getaway route we needed to know the victims movements before she was attacked it had been her birthday where and with whom had she spent the evening before coming home one of the best ways to stimulate citizen reports is through news stories because the times decided to run only a short that was buried in the back of the b section we got almost no help from the public when i called the reporter to express my frustration i was told that polling showed that customers were tired of stories about death and tragedy the reporter said the news hole for crimes stories was shrinking and there was nothing she could do about it as a consolation she wrote an update for the next days edition which included a line about the police seeking the publics help in the case but the story was even shorter than the first report and was buried deeper inside the paper we got not one call from a citizen that day all of that changed three days later when the story hit the front page and was the lead story for every television station in the city i picked up the first of the stories clipped from the front page and read it once again reallife shootout on film set dead hurt as cops and robbers interrupt celluloid counterparts by keisha russell times staff writer a deadly reality intruded on hollywood fantasy friday morning when los angeles police and security guards exchanged gunfire with armed robbers during a heist of million in cash being used in the filming of a movie about a heist of million in cash two bank employees were shot one of them fatally the armed robbers escaped with the money after opening fire on security officers and a reallife police detective who happened to be on the set police said that blood found later in the abandoned getaway vehicle indicated that at least one of the robbers was also hit by gunfire the films star brenda barstow was inside a nearby trailer at the time of the shooting she was unhurt and did not witness the reallife shootout the incident occurred outside a bungalow on selma avenue shortly before am according to police spokesmen an armored truck arrived at the filming location to deliver million scheduled to be used as a prop in scenes to be shot inside the house the film set was described as being under heavy security at the time though the exact number of armed security guards and police on hand was not disclosed the victim who was fatally shot was identified as raymond vaughn director of security for bankla the bank that was delivering the money to the film set also shot was linus simonson another bankla employee he suffered a bullet wound to the lower torso and was listed late friday in stable condition at cedarssinai medical center lapd detective jack dorsey said that as two guards were moving the cash from the armored truck into the house three heavily armed men jumped from a van parked nearby while a fourth waited behind the wheel the gunmen confronted the guards and took the money as the suspects were retreating to the van with the four satchels containing the cash one of them opened fire that was when all hell broke loose dorsey said it turned into a firefight it was unclear friday why the shooting started witnesses told police that the robbers encountered no resistance from the security people on the scene as far as we can tell they just opened up and started firing said detective lawton cross police said several security guards returned fire along with at least two offduty patrol officers working as onset security and a police detective harry bosch who had been inside a movie set trailer conducting a seemingly unrelated investigation police yesterday estimated that more than a hundred gunshots were fired during the wild shootout even so the crossfire lasted no more than a minute witnesses said the robbers managed to get into the van and speed away the van riddled with bullet holes was later found abandoned near the sunset boulevard entrance to the hollywood freeway it was determined that it had been stolen from a movie studio equipment yard the night before at this time we have no identities of the suspects dorsey said we are following a variety of leads that we think will prove useful to the investigation the shootout brought a sobering dose of reality to the encampment of moviemakers at first i thought it was the prop guys just shooting blanks said sean omalley a production assistant on the film project i thought it was like a joke then i heard people screaming to get down and real bullets started hitting the house i knew it was real i hit the deck man and just prayed it was scary the untitled film is about a thief who steals a suitcase containing million from the las vegas mob and runs to los angeles according to experts it is highly unusual for real money to be used in film productions but the films director wolfgang haus insisted on the use of real money because the scenes being shot in the selma avenue home entailed a variety of closeups of the thief played by barstow and the money haus said the films script called for the thief to dump the money on a bed and roll around in it throwing it into the air and celebrating another scene involved the thief covering herself in a bathtub filled with the money haus said fake money would easily be noticeable in the finished film the german filmmaker also insisted that using real currency helped the actors perform better in scenes containing the money if you are using play money then you are playacting haus said we needed to get beyond that i wanted this woman to feel she had stolen two million dollars it would be impossible to do it any other way my films rely on accuracy and truth if we were to use monopoly money the film would be a lie and everybody who watched it would know it the films producers eidolon productions arranged for a oneday loan of the cash and a phalanx of security guards to go with it police detectives told reporters the armored car was scheduled to remain on the scene during shooting and the money was to be returned immediately after filming was completed the largesse was entirely comprised of onehundreddollar bills wrapped in packets alexander taylor owner of the films production company declined comment on the robbery or the decision to use real money during the filming it was unclear if the money was insured against robbery police also declined to reveal why detective bosch was on the set when the shootout erupted but sources told the times that bosch was investigating the death of angella benton who was found strangled in her hollywood apartment building four days earlier benton was an employee of eidolon productions and police are now investigating the possibility of a connection between her murder and the armed robbery in a statement released by her publicist brenda barstow said i am shocked by what has happened and my heart goes out to the family of the man who was killed a spokesman for bankla said that raymond vaughn had been employed by the bank for seven years formerly he was a police officer who worked for departments in new york and pennsylvania simonson the injured employee is an assistant to bank vice president gordon scaggs who was in charge of the oneday cash loan to the movie set scaggs could not be reached for comment production of the film was temporarily suspended it was unclear friday when the cameras would roll again or if real currency would be used in the filming when it begins again i remembered the surreal scene of that day the screaming the cloud of smoke left after all of the shooting people on the ground and me not knowing if theyd been hit or were just taking cover no one got up for a long time even after the getaway van was long gone i skimmed through a sidebar story that focused on how unusual it was to use real moneyand so much of iton a movie set no matter what precautions had been taken the story reported that the volume of the money took up four delivery satchels and correctly pointed out that it was unlikely that all million would ever be contained in a single camera shot yet the producers of the film acceded to the directors demand that real money be used and that all million be on hand for verisimilitude but the unnamed insiders and hollywood watchers quoted in the story seemed to suggest that it wasnt about the money or verisimilitude or even art it was simply a power play wolfgang haus did it because he could the director was coming off of backtoback films that had grossed more than million each in four short years he had risen from making small independent films to being a powerful hollywood player in demanding that million in real cash be on hand for the filming of the rather routine scenes he was exercising his newfound muscle he had the power to ask for and get the million on the set just another story about hollywood ego only this time it involved murder i moved on to a followup story published two days after the robbery it was a rehash of the first days stories with little new information on the investigation there were no arrests and no suspects the most notable new information was that warner bros the studio backing the film had pulled the plug canceling financing seven days into production after the films star brenda barstow pulled out citing safety concerns the story cited unnamed sources within the production who suggested barstow pulled out for other reasons but was using a personal safety clause in her contract to walk away the other reasons suggested were her realization that a pall had been cast over the production that could shroud the films boxoffice appeal as well and her disappointment with the final script which was finished after she signed on to the production the end of the followup story swung back to the investigation and reported that the investigation of the robbery and shooting had grown to encompass the murder of angella benton and that the robberyhomicide division had taken over the case from hollywood division i noticed that a paragraph had been circled near the bottom of the clip most likely by me four years before sources confirmed to the times that the shipment of money stolen during the robbery was insured and contained marked bills investigators confided that tracing the cash may offer the best chance of identifying and capturing the suspects i didnt remember circling the paragraph four years before and wondered why i hadby the time the followup had been published i was off the case i guessed that at the time i remained interested whether on or off it and was curious as to whether the reporters source had given her accurate information or was simply hoping the robbers would read the story and panic over the possibility of the cash being traceable maybe it would make them hold on to it longer and increase the chance of a full recovery wishful thinking it didnt matter now i folded the clips and put them aside i thought about the trailer i was in that day when it began the newspaper stories were just a blueprint as distant as an aerial view like trying to figure out vietnam in by watching walter cronkite at night the stories carried none of the confusion the smell of blood and fear the searing charge of adrenaline dumping into the pipes like paratroopers going down the ramp of a c over hostile territory go go go the trailer was parked on selma i was talking to haus the director about angella benton i was searching for anything to grab on to i was obsessed with her hands and suddenly in that trailer i thought maybe the hands had been part of the staging of the crime scene staged by a director i was pressing haus pushing him wanting to know his whereabouts on the night in question and then there was a knock and the door opened and everything changed wolfgang a man in a baseball cap said the armored trucks here with the money i looked at haus what money and then i knew instinctively what was about to happen i look back at the memory now and see everything in slow motion i see all the moves all the details i came out of the directors trailer to see the red armored truck in the middle of the street two houses down the back door was open and a man in uniform inside was handing money satchels to two men on the ground two men in suits one much older than the other stood nearby watching as the money carriers turned toward the house the side door of a van parked across the street slid open and three armed men in ski masks emerged through the open door of the van i saw a fourth behind the wheel my hand went inside my coat to the gun on my hip but i held it there the situation was too volatile too many people around and in the possible crossfire i let things go the robbers came up behind the money carriers surprised them and took the satchels without a shot then as they backed into the street toward the van the inexplicable happened the cover man not carrying a satchel stopped spread his stance and leveled his weapon in a twohanded grip i didnt get it what had he seen where was the threat who had made a move the gunman opened fire and the older man in the suit his hands raised and no threat went down backwards on the street in less than a second the full firefight erupted the guard in the truck the security men and the offduty cops on the front lawn all opened up i pulled my gun and moved down the lawn toward the van down everybody down as crew members and technicians dove for ground cover i moved in closer i heard someone start screaming and the vans engine begin revving the smell of spent gunpowder invaded and burned my nostrils by the time i had a clear safe shot the robbers were to the van one threw his satchels through the open door and then turned back drawing two pistols from his belt he never got a shot off i opened up and watched him fly backwards into the van the others then dove in after him and the van took off its tires screaming and the side door still open the wounded mans feet protruding i watched the van round the corner and head toward sunset and the freeway i had no chance of pursuit my crown vic was parked more than a block away instead i opened up my cell phone and called it in i told them to send ambulances and lots of people i gave them the direction of the van and told them to get to the freeway the whole while the background screaming never stopped i closed the phone and walked over to the screaming man it was the younger man in the suit he was on his side his hand clamped over his left hip blood was leaking between his fingers his day and his suit were ruined but i knew he was going to make it im hit he yelled as he squirmed im fucking hit i came out of the memory and back to my dining room table as art pepper started playing youd be so nice to come home to with jack sheldon on trumpet i had at least two or three versions of pepper performing the cole porter standard on disc on each one he always attacked it tore its guts out it was the only way he knew how to play and that relentlessness was what i liked best about him it was the thing that i hoped i shared with him i opened my notebook to a fresh page and was about to write a note about something i had seen in my memory of the shootout when someone knocked on the door i got up and went down the hall and looked through the peephole i then quickly came back to the dining room and got a tablecloth from the cabinet against the wall the tablecloth had never been used it had been bought by my exwife and put in the cabinet for when we entertained but we never entertained i no longer had the wife but now the tablecloth would come in handy there was another knock on the door louder this time i quickly finished covering the photos and documents and went back to the door kiz rider had her back to me and was looking out at the street when i opened the door kiz sorry i was on the back deck and didnt hear the first knock come on in she walked past me and down the short hallway toward the living and dining room areas she probably saw that the sliding door to the deck was closed then how did you know there was a first knock she asked as she went by i uh just thought that the knock i heard was so loud it mustve meant that whoever was out there had okay okay harry i got it i hadnt seen her in almost eight months since my retirement party which she had organized and held at mussos renting out the whole bar and inviting everybody from hollywood division she moved into the dining room and i saw her eyes run over the rumpled tablecloth it was clear that i was covering something and i immediately regretted doing it she was wearing a charcoal gray business suit with the skirt below the knee the outfit took me by surprise ninety percent of the time we worked together as partners she wore black jeans and a blazer over a white blouse it allowed her freedom to move to run if necessary in the suit she looked more like a bank vice president than a homicide detective her eyes still on the table she said oh harry you always set such a nice table whats for lunch sorry i didnt know who was at the door and i just sort of threw that over some stuff i have out she turned to face me what stuff harry just stuff old case stuff so tell me how are things down at rhd better than last time we talked she had been promoted downtown about a year before i split the department shed had trouble with her new partner and others in rhd and had confided in me about it id had a mentoring relationship with her that continued after she transferred to rhd but it ended when i chose retirement over a reassignment that would have put us back together as partners in rhd i knew it hurt her her organizing of the retirement party had been a nice gesture but it was also the big goodbye from her rhd rhd didnt work out what what are you talking about i was genuinely surprised rider had been the most skilled and intuitive partner i had ever worked with she was made for the mission the department needed more like her i had thought for sure that she would be able to adjust to life in the departments highestprofile squad and do good work i transferred out at the beginning of the summer im in the chiefs office now youre kidding oh man i was stunned she had obviously chosen a career path through the department if she was working for the chief as an adjutant or on special projects then she was being groomed for command staff administration there was nothing wrong with that i knew rider was as ambitious as the next cop but homicide was a calling not a career i had always thought she understood and accepted that she had heard the call kiz i dont know what to say i wish what that i had talked to you about it you split the gig harry remember what were you going to tell me to tough it out in rhd when you bailed out yourself it was different for me kiz i had built up too much resistance i was pulling too much baggage you were different you were the star kiz well stars burn out it was too petty and political on the third floor i changed directions i just took the lieutenants exam and the chief is a good man he wants to do good things and i want to be right there with him its funny things are less political on the sixth floor youd think it would be the other way around it sounded as though she was trying to convince herself more than me all i could do was nod as a sense of guilt and loss flooded me if i had stayed and taken the rhd job she would have stayed also i went into the living room and dropped onto the couch she followed me but remained standing i reached over to turn down the music but not too much i liked the song i stared out through the sliding doors and across the deck to the vista of mountains across the valley it was no smoggier out there than most days but the overcast somehow seemed to fit as pepper took up the clarinet to accompany lee konitz on the shadow of your smile there was a sad wistfulness to it that i think even gave rider pause she stood silently listening i had been given the discs by a friend named quentin mckinzie who was an old jazzman who knew pepper and had played with him decades earlier at shelly mannes and dontes and some of the other longgone hollywood jazz clubs spawned by the west coast sound mckinzie had told me to listen and study the discs they were some of peppers last recordings after years spent in jails and prisons because of his addictions the artist was making up for lost time even in his work as a sideman that relentlessness he never stopped it until his heart stopped there was a kind of integrity in that and the music that my friend admired he gave me the discs and told me never to stop making up for lost time soon the song ended and kiz turned to me who was that art pepper lee konitz white guys i nodded damn that was good i nodded again so whats under the tablecloth harry i shrugged first time youve come around in eight months i suppose you know she nodded yeah let me guess alexander taylors tight with the chief or the mayor or both and he called to check me out she nodded i had gotten it right and the chief knew you and i were close at one time so at one time she seemed to stumble while saying that part anyhow he sent me out to tell you that youre barking up the wrong tree she sat down on the chair opposite the couch and looked out across the deck i could tell she wasnt interested in what was out there she just didnt want to look at me so this is what you gave up homicide for to run errands for the chief she looked sharply at me and i saw the injury in her eyes but i didnt regret what i said i was just as angry with her as she was with me its easy for you to say that harry youve already been through the war the war never ends kiz i almost smiled at the coincidence of the song that was now playing while rider was delivering her message the piece was high jingo with pepper still accompanying konitz pepper would be dead six months after laying down the track the coincidence was that when i was young in the department high jingo was a way oldguard detectives would describe a case that had taken on unusual interest from the sixth floor or carried other unseen political or bureaucratic dangers when a case had high jingo on it you had to be careful you were in murky water you had to watch your back because nobody else was watching it for you i got up and went to the window the sun was reflecting off a billion particles that hung in the air it was orange and pink and looked beautiful it didnt seem like it could be poison so whats the word from the chieflay off it bosch youre a citizen now leave it to the professionals more or less the case is gathering dust kiz why does he care that im poking around when nobody in his own department does is he afraid ill embarrass him or something by closing it who says its gathering dust i turned around and looked at her come on dont give me the due diligence dance i know how that goes a signature every six months on the log uh yup nothing new here i mean dont you care about this kiz you knew angella benton dont you want to see this thing cleared of course i do dont think for one moment that i want anything less but things are happening harry i was sent out here as a courtesy to you dont get involved you might wander into something you shouldnt you might hurt rather than help i sat back down and looked at her for a long moment as i tried to read between the lines i wasnt convinced if it is actively being worked who is working it she shook her head i cant tell you that i can only tell you to leave it alone look kiz this is me whatever anger you have because i pulled the pin shouldnt stop you from what doing what i am supposed to do following orders harry you no longer have a badge people with badges are actively working on this actively you understand leave it at that before i could speak she fired another round at me and dont trouble yourself about me okay i have no anger toward you anymore harry you left me high and dry but that was a long time ago yeah i had anger but its a long time gone i didnt even want to be the one who came here today but he made me come he thought i could convince you he being the chief i assumed i sat silently for a moment waiting to see if there was more but that was all she had i spoke quietly then almost as if i was putting a confession through the screen to a priest and what if i cant leave it alone what if for reasons that have nothing to do with this case i need to work this reasons for myself what happens then she shook her head in annoyance then you are going to get hurt these people they dont fuck around find some other case or some other way to work out your demons what people rider stood up kiz what people ive told you enough harry message delivered good luck she headed toward the hallway and the door i got up and followed my mind churning through what i knew who is working the case i asked tell me she glanced back at me but kept moving toward the door tell me kiz who she stopped suddenly and turned to me i saw anger and challenge in her eyes for old times sake harry is that what you want to say i stepped back her anger was a force field around her body that was pushing me back i held my hands out wide in surrender and didnt say anything she waited a moment and then turned back to the door goodbye harry she opened the door and stepped out then pulled it closed behind her goodbye kiz but she was already gone for a long time i stood there thinking about what she had said and not said there had been a message within a message but i couldnt yet read it the water was too murky high jingo baby i said to myself as i locked the door the drive out to woodland hills took almost an hour it used to be in this place that if you waited picked your spots and went against the grain of traffic you could get somewhere in a decent amount of time not anymore it seemed to me that the freeways no matter what time and what location were always a nightmare there was never any respite and having done little longdistance driving in the past months being reimmersed in the routine was an annoying and frustrating exercise when id finally hit my limit i got off the at the topanga canyon exit and worked my way on surface streets the rest of the way i was careful not to try to make up for lost time by speeding through the mostly residential districts in my inside coat pocket was a flask if i got pulled over it could be a problem in fifteen minutes i got to the house on melba avenue i pulled my car in behind the van and got out i walked up the wooden ramp that started next to the vans side door and had been built over the front steps of the house at the door i was met by danielle cross who beckoned me in silently hows he doing today danny same as always yeah i didnt know what else to say i couldnt imagine what her view of the world was how it had changed from one set of hopes and anticipations to something completely different overnight i knew she couldnt be much older than her husband early forties but it was impossible to tell she had old eyes and a mouth that seemed permanently tight and turned down at the corners i knew my way and she let me go through the living room and down the hallway to the last room on the left i walked in and saw lawton cross in his chairthe one bought along with the van after the fundraiser run by the police union he was watching cnn on a television mounted on a bracket hanging from the ceiling in the corner another report on the mideast situation his eyes moved toward me but his face didnt a strap crossed above his eyebrows and held his head to the cushion behind it a network of tubes connected his right arm to a bag of clear fluid that hung from a utility tree attached to the back of his chair his skin was sallow he weighed no more than pounds his collarbones jutted out like shards of broken pottery his lips were dry and cracked his hair was an uncombed nest i had been shocked by his appearance when id come by after his call to me i tried not to show it again hey law how are you doing it was a question i hated to ask but felt i owed it to him to ask about what youd expect harry yeah his voice was a harsh whisper like a college football coachs who has spent forty years screaming from the sidelines listen i said im sorry to come back so soon but there were a few other things did you go see the producer yeah i started with him yesterday he gave me twenty minutes there was a low hissing sound in the room that i had noticed when i came by earlier in the week i think it was the ventilator pumping air through the network of clear tubes that ran under crosss shirt and out of his collar and up either side of his face before plugging into his nose anything he gave me some names everybody from eidolon productions who supposedly knew about the money i havent had a chance to run them down yet did you ever ask him what eidolon means no i never thought to ask what is it like a family name or something no it means phantom thats one of the things thats come back to me just sort of popped into my head while ive been thinking about the case i asked him once he said it came from a poem something about a phantom sitting on a throne in the dark i guess he figures thats him strange yeah hey harry you can turn off the monitor so we dont have to bother danny he had asked me to do the same thing on the first visit i moved around his chair to a nearby bureau on the top of it was a small plastic device with a small green light glowing on its face it was an audio monitor manufactured for parents to listen in on their sleeping babies it helped cross call to his wife when he needed to change the channel or wanted anything else i switched it off so we could speak privately and came back around to the front of the chair good cross said why dont you close the door now i did as instructed i knew what this was leading to did you bring me something this time cross said like i asked uh yeah i did good lets start with that go into the bathroom behind you and see if she left my bottle in there in the bathroom the counter surrounding the sink was crowded with all manner of medicines and small medical equipment sitting on a soap dish was a plastic bottle with an open top it looked like something normally found on a touring bike but a little different the neck was wider and it was slightly curved probably to make the drinking angle a little more comfortable i thought i quickly took the flask out of my jacket and then poured a couple ounces of bushmills into the bottle when i took it out to the bedroom crosss eyes widened in horror no not that thats a piss bottle it goes under the chair ah shit sorry i turned around and went back to the bathroom pouring the booze out into the sink just as cross yelled no dont i looked back out at him i wouldve taken it dont worry ive got more after the piss bottle was rinsed and returned to the soap dish i went back out to the bedroom law theres no drinking bottle in there what do you want me to do goddamn she probably took it she knows what im up to you have the flask yeah right here i tapped it from the outside of my sport coat bring it out let me have a taste i pulled the flask out and opened it i brought the mouth to his and let him take a swallow he coughed loudly and some of it spilled down his cheek and neck ah jesus he gasped what jesus what law you all right ill get danny i made a move toward the door but he stopped me no no im fine im fine i just its been a long time is all give me another law weve got to talk i know that just give me another taste i held the flask to his mouth again and poured in a good jolt he took it down well this time and closed his eyes black bush jesus is that good i smiled and nodded fuck the meds he said give me bushmills anytime harry any fucking time he was a man who couldnt move but i could still see the whiskey work into his eyes and soften them she wont give me anything he said doctors orders only time i get a nip is when one of you guys comes by and visits and that aint often who wants to come and see this sorry sight you gotta keep coming harry i dont care about the case clear it dont clear it but keep comin to see me his eyes moved to the flask and bring your friend there always bring a friend it was beginning to dawn on me cross had held back on me i had come to him the day before i went to taylor cross had been the place to start but he had held back in order to bring me backwith a flask maybe the whole thing his call to reawaken the case in me had all been about one thing the flask i held the walletsize container up you held back on me law so id bring you this no i was going to have danny call you there was something i forgot yeah well i already know it i go talk to taylor and the next thing i know i get a visit from the sixth floor telling me to lay off its being worked by people who dont fuck around crosss eyes were darting back and forth in his frozen face no he said who came to see you before me law no one nobodys come about the case who did you call before you called me nobody harry i promise i must have raised my voice because the door to the bedroom suddenly opened and crosss wife stood there is everything okay everything is fine danny her husband said leave us alone she stood in the doorway for a moment and i saw her eyes go to the flask in my hand for a moment i thought about taking a drink from it myself so she might think it was there for me but in her eyes i could see she knew exactly what was going on she didnt move for a long moment and then her eyes came up to mine and held for a moment she then took a step back and closed the door i looked back at cross if she didnt know she knows now i dont care what time is it harry i cant see the screen too good i looked up at the corner of the television screen where cnn always carried the time its eleveneighteen who came out to see you law i want to know who is working the case im telling you harry nobody came as far as i knew the case was deader than these goddamn legs of mine then what was it you didnt tell me when i was here before his eyes went to the flask and he didnt have to ask i held it to his chapped and peeling lips and he drank deeply from it he closed his eyes ah god he said ive got his eyes opened and they jumped on me like wolves taking down a deer shes keeping me alive he whispered desperately you think this is what i want sitting in my own shit half the time shes getting a full ride while im alivefull pay and medical if im gone she gets the widows pension and i wasnt in that long harry fourteen years its about half of what she gets with me alive i looked at him for a long moment the whole time wondering if she was outside the door listening so what do you want from me law to pull the plug i cant do that i can get you a lawyer if you want but im not and she doesnt treat me right either i paused again i felt a tugging sensation in the pit of my guts if what he was saying was true then his life was more of a hell than i could imagine i lowered my voice when i spoke what does she do to you law she gets mad she does things i dont want to talk about it its not her fault listen you want me to get a lawyer in here i could also get a social services investigator no no lawyers thatll take forever no investigators i dont want that and i dont want you to get in any trouble harry but what am i going to do if i could pull the plug myself i would he blew out a burst of air the only gesture his body would allow him to make i could only imagine his horrible frustration this is no way to live harry it isnt living i nodded none of this had come up on the first visit we had talked about the case what he could remember about it his case memory was coming back in chunks it had been a difficult interview but there was no sense of selfloathing or desperation no more depression than would be expected i wondered if it had been the alcohol that had suddenly brought it out im sorry law it was all i could say his eyes looked away up to the television screen which was over my left shoulder what time is it now harry this time i checked my watch twenty after whats your hurry law you expecting somebody else no no nothing like that theres just a show i like to watch on court tv comes on at twelve rikki klieman i like her then youve still got time to talk to me why dont you get a bigger clock in here she wont give me one she says the doctor says its bad for me to be watching a clock shes probably right it was the wrong thing to say i saw anger flood his eyes and i immediately regretted the words im sorry i shouldnt you know what its like not to be able to raise your own goddamn wrist to look at your fucking watch no law i dont have any idea you know what its like to shit in a bag and have your wife take it to the toilet to have to ask her for every goddamn thing including a taste of whiskey im sorry law yeah youre sorry everybodys fucking sorry but nobodys he didnt finish he seemed to bite off the end of the sentence like a dog getting a hold of raw meat he looked away and was silent and i was silent for a long moment until i thought the anger had drained back down his throat into the seemingly bottomless well of frustration and selfpity that was down there hey law his eyes came back to me what harry he was calm the moment had passed lets go back you said you were going to call me because there was something you forgot you know when we went over the case before what was it you forgot to tell me nobodys come here and talked to me about the case harry youre the only one i mean that i believe you i was wrong about that but what was it that you forgot before why were you going to call me he closed his eyes for a moment but then opened them they were clear and focused i told you that taylor insured the money right right you told me that what i forgot was that the insurance companyoffhand i cant remember the name of global underwriters you remembered the other day right global underwriters as a condition of contract global required that the lenderthat was banklascan all the bills scan the bills what do you mean record the serial numbers i remembered the paragraph i had circled on the newspaper clip it had apparently been true i started doing the math in my head two million divided by a hundred i almost had it and then lost the number that would be a lot of numbers i know the bank balkedsaid it would take four people a week something like that so they negotiated and compromised they sampled they took ten numbers from every one of the stacks i remembered from the times story that the money was delivered in bundles that math i could do eighty bundles made million so they took eight hundred numbers still a lot yeah i remember the printout was like six pages long and what did you do with it let me have another taste of that black bush would you i gave it to him i could tell the flask was just about empty i needed to get what he had and get out of there i was getting sucked into his miserable world and i didnt like it did you put out the numbers yeah we put out the list gave it to the feds and used the robbery guys to get the list out to all the banks in the county i also sent it to vegas metro so they could get it into the casinos i nodded waiting for more but you know how that goes harry a list like that is only good if the people are checking it believe it or not there are a hell of a lot of hundreddollar bills out there and if you use them in the right places people dont raise an eyebrow they arent going to take the time to run the number down a sixpage list they dont have the time or the inclination it was true recorded money was most often used as evidence when it was found in the possession of a suspect in a financial crime such as a bank robbery i could not remember working on or even hearing about a case where marked or recorded money was actually traced by transaction to a suspect you were going to call me back because you forgot to tell me that no not just that theres more anything left in that little flask of yours i shook the flask so he could hear that it was almost empty i gave him what was left and then capped it and put it back in my pocket thats it law until next time finish what you were going to tell me his tongue poked out of his horrible hole of a mouth and licked a drop of whiskey from the corner it was pathetic and i turned away as if to check the time on the television so he didnt have to know i saw it on the tube was a financial news report a graph with a red line trending down was on the screen to the side of the anchormans concerned and puffy face i looked back at cross and waited well he said about i dont know ten months or so into the case close to a yearthis is after me and jack had moved on and were working other thingsjack got a call from westwood about the serial numbers it all came back to me the other day after you left i assumed cross was talking about an fbi agent calling his partner it was not an uncommon practice within the lapd for investigators to never refer to fbi agents as fbi agents as if denying them their title somehow knocked them down a notch or two there had never been any love lost between the two competing organizations but the main federal building in los angeles was on wilshire boulevard in westwood and it housed the whole sandbox of federal law enforcement all jurisdictional biases aside i needed to be sure an fbi agent i asked yeah an agent a woman in fact okay what did she tell you guys she only spoke to jack and then jack told me the agent said that one of the serial numbers was wrong and jack said is that right how so and the agent told him that the list had wound through the building and eventually across her desk and shed taken the time to scan the numbers into her computer and there was a problem with one of them he stopped as if to catch his breath he licked his lips again and it reminded me of some sort of underwater creature poking out of a crevice i sure wish you had more in that flask harry sorry i dont next time what was the problem with the number well as far as i remember this gal she told jack that she collects numbers know what i mean whenever a flier comes across the desk with currency numbers on it she puts them into her computer adds them to the data bank she can run crossmatches things like that it was a new program she was working on shed been doing it for a few years and had a lot of numbers in the box tell you what i need some water my throattoo much talking ill go get danny no no thats nottell you what just go to the sink and put some water in that thing you got and i can drink from that thatll be fine dont bother danny shes been bothered enough in the bathroom i filled the flask halfway with water from the faucet i shook it and brought it out to him he took it all after a few moments he finally continued the story she said one of the numbers on our list was on somebody elses list and that was impossible what do you mean im not tracking this let me see if i remember this right she said that one of the hundreds that was on our list had a serial number that belonged to a hundred that was part of a bait packet taken in a bank robbery about six months before our movie set robbery went down where was the bank robbery marina del rey i think im not sure about that though okay so what was the problem why couldnt the hundred from the earlier bank robbery get recirculated land back in a bank and then become part of the two million sent to the movie set thats what i said and jack told me that it was impossible he said the agent said the guy who took that bill in marina del rey in the first place got caught he had the bait pack on him and he went to the federal clink and the bill was held as evidence i nodded and thought about this trying to get it right youre saying that she was telling you that it would have been impossible for the hundred on your list to have been part of the movie delivery because at that time that hundreddollar bill was in evidence lockup in regard to the marina del rey bank robbery exactly she even went in and checked the evidence to make sure the hundred was still there it was i tried to think about what this could mean if it meant anything at all what did you and jack do well not much there were a lot of numberssix pages worth we figured maybe we just got a bad one you know maybe the guy who recorded it all had messed up transposed a number or whatever we were running on a new case by then jack said hed make some calls to the bank and global underwriters but i dont know if he did then soon after that we walked into the shit in that bar and everything else sort of drifted away until i thought about angella benton and called you things are starting to come back to me now you know i understand do you remember the agents name sorry harry i dont remember the name i mightve never had it i didnt talk to her and i dont think jack even told me i was silent while i considered whether this was a lead worth pursuing i thought about what kiz rider had said about the case being worked maybe this was the angle maybe the people she told me about were fbi agents while i was working it over cross started talking again for what its worth i got the idea from jack that this agent whoever she was sort of came up with this thing on her own it was her own little program she was running almost like a hobby not on the official computer okay do you remember if you ever got any other hits on the numbers before this one there was one but it didnt go anywhere it came up pretty soon in fact what was that it came up in a bank deposit i think it was phoenix my memorys like swiss cheese a lot of holes you remember anything about that one at all just that it was a deposit from a cash business like a restaurant something we werent going to be able to trace any further back but it was pretty soon after the heist yeah i remember we jumped on it jack went out there but it was a dead end how soon after the heist can you remember maybe a few weeks i dont know for sure i nodded his memory was coming back but it still wasnt reliable it served to remind me that without the murder bookthe case documentationi was severely handicapped okay law thanks if you remember or think of anything else have danny call me and whether that happens or not ill be back to see you and youll bring the he didnt finish and didnt need to yeah ill bring it you sure you dont want me to bring somebody else maybe a lawyer that could talk to you about no harry no lawyers not yet you want me to talk to danny no harry dont talk to her you sure im sure i nodded my goodbye and left the room i wanted to get to my car so i could quickly write some notes about the call jack dorsey had gotten from the bureau agent but when i came from the hallway into the living room danielle cross was sitting there waiting for me she was on the couch and looked at me with accusing eyes i threw the look right back at her i think its almost time for a show he wants to watch on court tv ill take care of it okay im leaving now i wish you would not come back well i may have to the man is on a delicate balancementally and physically the alcohol upsets it it takes days for him to recover looked to me like it improved things for him then come back tomorrow and have another look i nodded she was right i spent a half hour with the man not my life i waited i could tell she was working up toward something i assume he told you that he wants to die and that im the one keeping him alive for the money i hesitated but then nodded he said i mistreat him i nodded again he tells that to everybody that comes visit all the cops is it true the part about wanting to die some days some days its not what about the part about being mistreated she looked away from me its frustrating dealing with him hes not happy he takes it out on me one time i took it out on him i turned off the television he started crying like a baby she looked up at me thats all ive ever done but it was enough i hate what i did what i became in the moment everything got the better of me i tried to read her eyes the set of her jaw and mouth she had her hands together in front of her the fingers of one hand working the rings on the other set a nervous gesture i watched her chin start to quiver and then the tears started to come what am i supposed to do i shook my head i didnt know the only thing i knew was that i had to get out of there i dont know danny i dont know what any of us are supposed to do it was all i could think of to say i walked quickly to the front door and left i felt like a coward walking away and leaving them alone together in that house loose lips sink ships the theory of the case pursued by cross and dorsey four years earlier was simple they believed that angella benton had intimate knowledge through her job about the million that was to be delivered to the film location and had set the robbery and her own death in motion by either intentionally or mistakenly talking about the money her loose lips planted the seed of the robbery and consequently her own demise being the inside link to the robbers she had to be eliminated to cover their tracks because she was murdered four days before the robbery it was believed by the two investigators that her involvement was unintentional she had somehow furnished the information that led to the robbery and needed to be eliminated before she realized what she had done she also needed to be eliminated in a way that would not draw suspicion to the impending cash delivery thus the psychosexual aspects of the crime scenethe tearing of the clothes and the evidence of masturbationwere in a way simply window dressing on the misdirection conversely if she had been a willing participant in the robbery scheme it seemed likely to the investigators that her death would have come after the robbery had been successfully accomplished it seemed like a solid theory to me as lawton cross had recounted it during my first visit to his home it was probably the way i would have gone if i had been allowed to stay on the case but ultimately the theory didnt pay off cross told me that he and his partner had worked a full field investigation on benton but never came across the one clue that opened up the case they spent five solid months on her they traced her movements personal habits and dailylife routines they studied her creditcard banking and telephone data they interviewed and reinterviewed all family members and known friends and associates they spent eight days in columbus alone dorsey went to phoenix to chase down a single hundreddollar bill they spent so much time at eidolon productions that for one month they were given their own office at archway pictures in which to conduct interviews and they got nothing as is often the case with a homicide they amassed a wealth of knowledge about the victim but not the key piece of information that led to the identity of her killer they ended up knowing who she had slept with in college but not where she had spent the last evening of her life they knew her last meal had been mexicanthe corn tortillas and beans were still in her digestive tractbut not which one of the citys thousands of such establishments had served her and after six months on the case they found absolutely no link between angella benton and the robbery aside from the surface connection of her job as a production assistant for the company that was making the film in which the cash was to play a starring role six months in and they were at a dead end what they did have in the way of evidence were the fortysix slugs and shell casings collected after the shootout the blood collected from the getaway van and the semen collected from the murder scene it was all good evidence to have ballistics and dna could tie a suspect to a crime with zero doubtunless your lawyer was johnnie cochran but it was the kind of evidence that was icing on a cake the kind that links a suspect and weapon already identified and usually in custody it didnt do much as far as getting you that suspect after half a year on it they had the icing but no cake to put it on when they reached this dead end it was time to evaluate the case at the sixmonth mark this is the point where hard choices are made the probability of clearing the case is weighed against the need for the pair of investigators to work other cases and help shoulder the caseload of the division their supervisor took the case off fulltime status and dorsey and cross went back into rotation at rhd they were free to work the benton case as often and as much as possible but they also drew new investigations as could be expected the benton case suffered for it cross had readily admitted this to me he said it became a parttime investigation with dorsey doing most of the followup while cross concentrated on the new cases they were assigned then it all became academic when the pair got shot up in nats bar in hollywood the benton case went into the ou files openunsolved and it was orphaned no detective likes a handmedown file which the benton case was no one likes the idea of going into a file and proving his colleagues were wrong or misguided or possibly even incompetent or lazy added to this deterrent was the fact that the benton case was now haunted cops are a superstitious species the fate of the two original investigatorsone dead the other in a chair for lifewas somehow inextricably bound to the cases they had worked whether directly related or not nobody and i mean nobody was going to take on the benton case now except me now that i was out of the official game and four years later i had to trust that cross and dorsey had done their job well in the investigation of angella bentons death and its connection to the robbery i had no choice really covering the ground they had already trod to a dead end didnt seem to be the way to go that was why i went to see taylor my plan was to accept their investigation as thorough if not flawless and approach it from a different direction i was operating on the belief that cross and dorsey found nothing linking benton to the robbery because there was nothing to find her death had been part of a plan a carefully planned misdirection within a misdirection i now had a list with nine names on it that had come out of my threemile ride with taylor all the people involved in the planning of the money shoot everyoneas far as he knewwith knowledge that the cash was coming when it was coming and who would bring it i would go from there but now i had been thrown a curveball of sorts what cross had told me about the serial numbers and how at least one of them had been wrong he said he had left it to dorsey to pursue and didnt know what had happened shortly thereafter dorsey was dead and the case died with him but now i was interested it was an anomaly and it had to be dealt with coupled with kiz riders warning and oblique reference to these people i felt something stirring inside that had been absent for a long time a small tug toward the darkness i one time knew so well i drove back into hollywood and ate a late lunch at mussos a ketel one martini for openers followed by chicken pot pie creamed spinach on the side a good combination but not good enough to make me forget about lawton cross and his situation i asked for a second martini to help with that and tried to concentrate on other things i hadnt been back to mussos since my retirement party and i missed the place i had my head down and was reading and writing some notes when i heard a voice in the restaurant that i recognized i looked up and saw captain levalley being led to a table with a man i didnt recognize she was commander of the hollywood division which was only a few blocks away three days after id left my badge in a desk drawer and walked out she called to ask me to reconsider she almost convinced me but i said no i told her to send in my papers and she did she didnt come to my retirement party and we hadnt spoken since she didnt see me and sat with her back to me in a booth far enough away that i could not hear her conversation i left by the back way without finishing the second martini in the lot i paid the attendant and got in my car a mercedes benz ml that id bought used from a guy moving to florida it had been the one big extravagance i allowed myself after retiring in my mind the ml stood for money lost because that was what i paid for it it was one of the fastest sport utility vehicles on the road but that wasnt really why i bought it the low mileage on it wasnt the reason either i bought it because it was black and it blended in every fifth car in la was a mercedes or so it seemed and every fifth one of them was a black mclass suv i think maybe i knew where i was going long before i started the journey eight months before i would need it id bought an automobile that would serve me well as a private investigator it had speed and comfort it had dark smoked windows and if you looked in your mirror and saw one of these behind you in la it wouldnt cause a second thought the mercedes took some getting used to in terms of comfort as well as routine operation and maintenance in fact i had already run out of gas on the road twice it was one of those little things that came with giving up the badge for several years before my retirement i had been a detective third grade a supervisorylevel position that came with a takehome car that car was a ford crown victoria the police interceptor model that rode like a tank had vinyl washoff seats heavyduty suspension and the expanded gas tank i never needed gas when on the job and the car was routinely refueled at the station by the guys from the motor pool as a citizen i had to relearn to watch the needle or else i found myself sitting on the side of the road from the center console i retrieved my cell phone and turned it on id had little need for a cell phone but had kept the one i carried on the job i dont know maybe i thought somebody from the division would call and ask my advice on a case or something for four months i kept it charged and turned it on every day nobody ever called after the second time i ran out of gas i plugged it into the charger in the center console and left it there for the next time i would need roadside assistance now i needed assistance but not of the roadside variety i called information and got the number for the federal bureau of investigation in los angeles i called the number and asked for the supervisory agent in the bank squad i figured the agent that had contacted dorsey might have worked in the unit that handled bank robberies it was the unit that most often dealt with currency numbers my call was transferred and picked up by someone who simply said nunez agent nunez yes what can i help you with i knew that handling a supervising fbi agent would not be the same as handling the secretary of a movie mogul i had to be as upfront as i could with nunez yes my name is harry bosch i just retired from the lapd after about thirty years and i good for you he said curtly what can i do for you well thats what im trying to tell you about four years ago i was working a homicide case that was connected to a large cash robbery involving currency that had been recorded what case well you probably wont recognize it by case name but it was the murder of angella benton the murder preceded the robbery which took place on a movie set in hollywood it made a big splash the bad guys got away with two million dollars eight hundred of the hundreddollar bills had been recorded i remember it but we did not work it we had noth i know that like i told you i worked the case then go on what can i do for you several months into the case an agent from your office contacted the lapd to report an anomaly in the recorded numbers she had received the list of serials because we had sent it all over an anomaly what is that an anomaly is a deviation something that doesnt i know what the word means what anomaly are you talking about oh sorry this agent called and said one of the numbers was a misprint or a couple of the numbers got inverted something like that but thats not what im calling about she said she had a computer program that crossreferenced and crossmatched numbers from these sorts of cases i think it was her own program something that she worked up on her own does any of this ring a bell not the case but the agent an agent who had this program a female agent why well because i have misplaced her name actually i never got it because she spoke to one of the other investigators on the case but i would like to speak to her if i could speak to her about what you said you are retired i knew it would come to this and this is where i was weak i had no station no validity you either had a badge that opened all doors or you didnt i didnt some cases die hard agent nunez im still working it nobody else is so i figured id take the shot you know how it is no actually i dont im not retired a real hardass he was silent after that and i found myself getting angry with this faceless man who was probably trying to balance a burdensome caseload with a lack of manpower and funding la was the bank robbery capital of the world three a day was the norm and the fbi had to respond to every one of them look man i said i dont want to waste your time you can either help me or not you either know who i am talking about or you dont yeah i know who youre talking about but then he was silent i tried one last angle i had held it back because i wasnt sure i wanted it known in some circles what i was doing but the visit from kiz rider sort of shot that down anyway look you want a name somebody you can check me out with call over to hollywood detectives and ask for the lieutenant her name is billets and she can vouch for me she wont know anything about this though as far as she knows im swinging in a hammock all right ill do that why dont you call me back give me ten minutes right i will i closed the phone and checked my watch it was almost three i started the mercedes and drove down to sunset and headed east i turned on the radio but didnt like the fusion that was playing i turned it back off at the tenminute mark i pulled to the curb in front of the splendid age retirement home i picked up the phone to call nunez back and it rang in my hand i thought maybe nunez had caller id on his line and had gotten the number but then i remembered i had been transferred to his line i didnt think an id record could jump with a transfer harry bosch harry its jerry jerry edgar it was turning into old home week first kiz rider and now jerry edgar jed how you doing im fine man hows the retiring life its very restful you dont sound like youre on the beach harry he was right the splendid age was just yards from the hollywood freeway and the din of gascombustion machinery was ever present quentin mckinzie told me that they house the splendid age residents with hearing loss in the rooms on the west side because they are closer to the noise im not a beach guy whats up dont tell me that eight months after im gone you actually want to ask my advice on something nah its not that i just got a call from somebody who was checking you out i was immediately embarrassed my pride had led me to conclude that edgar needed me on a case oh was it a bureau agent named nunez yeah he didnt say what it was about though you starting a new career or something harry thinking about it you ever get your private ticket yeah about six months ago just in case i stuck it in a drawer somewhere what did you tell nunez i hope you said i was a man of high moral standing and courage absolutely not i gave him the straight dope i said you could trust harry bosch about as far as you could throw him i could hear the smile in his voice thanks man youre a pal i just thought you should know you want to tell me whats going on i was silent for a moment as i thought about this i didnt want to tell edgar what i was doing not that i didnt trust him i did but as a rule i operated under the belief that the fewer people who know your business the better not right now jed im late for an appointment and have to get going but ill tell you whatyou want to catch lunch one of these days ill tell you all about my exciting life as a pensioner i sort of laughed as i said the last line and i think it worked he agreed to lunch but said hed have to call me back about it i knew from experience it was difficult to schedule a lunch ahead of time when you were working homicide what would happen was that he would call on the morning he had a lunch free that was the way it worked we said wed stay in touch and ended the call it was nice to know that he apparently wasnt carrying the same anger as kiz rider over my abrupt departure from our partnership and the department i called the bureau back and was put through to nunez you get a chance to make that call yeah but she wasnt there i talked to your old partner rider no his name was edgar oh yeah jerry how is he doing i dont know i didnt ask im sure you did when he just called you excuse me he had nailed me you can skip the bullshit bosch edgar told me he felt obligated to call you and let you know someone was checking you out i said that was fine with me i asked him for your number so that way i would know i was dealing with the real harry bosch he gave it to me and when i tried to call a couple minutes ago it was busy i figure you were talking to edgar so i dont appreciate your little dumbguy dance my embarrassment over being cornered turned to anger maybe it was the vodka in my stomach or the hammering reminder that i was an outsider now but i was tired of dealing with this guy man you are a great investigator i said into the phone a brilliant deductive mind tell me do you ever use it on cases or do you reserve it only for busting the chops of people who are just trying to get something done in the world i have to be careful about who i give information to you understand that yeah i understand that i also understand why law enforcement works about as well as the freeways in this town hey bosch dont go away mad just go away i shook my head in frustration i didnt know if i had blown it or if i was never going to get anything from him in the first place so thats your little dance huh you call me on my act but you were acting the whole time too you never were going to give me the name were you he didnt answer its just a name nunez no harm no foul still nothing from the agent well ill tell you what youve got my name and number and i think you know what agent i am talking about so go to her and let her decide give her my name and number i dont care what you think about me nunez you owe it to your fellow agent to give it to her just like edgar he was obligated so are you that was it that was my pitch i waited in the silence this time deciding not to speak again until nunez did look bosch i would tell her you were calling for her i would have told her before i even talked to edgar but obligations only go so far the agent you were asking about shes not around anymore what do you mean not around where is she nunez said nothing i sat up straight my elbow hitting the wheel drawing a blast from the horn something was in my memory something about a female agent in the news i couldnt quite get to it nunez is she dead bosch i dont like this this talking on the phone with somebody ive never met why dont you come in and maybe we can talk about this maybe dont worry well talk when can you come in the dashboard clock said it was five after three i looked at the front door of the retirement home four oclock well be here i closed the phone and sat there unmoving for a long moment working at the memory it was there just out of reach i reopened the phone i didnt have my phone book with me and numbers i once knew by heart had washed away in the past eight months like they had been written in sand on the beach i called information and got the number for the times newsroom i then was connected to keisha russell she remembered me like i had never left the department wed had a good relationship i fed a number of exclusives to her over the years and she returned the favor by helping me with clip searches and keeping stories in the paper when she could the angella benton case had been one of the times she couldnt harry bosch she said how are you i noticed that her jamaican accent was now almost completely gone i missed it i wondered if that was intentional or just the product of living ten years in the socalled melting pot im fine you still on the beat of course some things never change she had once told me that the cop beat was an entrylevel position in journalism but that she never wanted to leave it she thought moving up to cover city hall or elections or almost anything else would be terminally boring compared with writing stories about life and death and crime and consequences she was good and thorough and accurate so much so she had been invited to my retirement party it was a rarity for an outsider of any ilk especially a journalist to earn such an invitation unlike you harry bosch you i thought would always be there in hollywood division almost a year later now and i still cant believe it you know i called your number out of habit on a story a few months ago and a strange voice answered and i just had to hang up who was it perkins they moved him over from autos i hadnt kept up i didnt know who had taken my slot perkins was good but not good enough but i didnt tell russell that so whats up with you mon every now and then she would turn on the accent and the patter it was her way of making a transition getting to the point sounds like youre busy a bit then i wont bother you no no no no bother what can i do for you harry youre not working a case are you have you gone private nothing like that i was just curious about something thats all it can wait ill check you later keisha harry wait you sure i am not too busy for an old friend you know what are you curious about i was just wondering remember a while back there was an fbi agent a woman who disappeared i think it was in the valley she was last seen driving home from martha gessler the name brought it all back now i remembered yeah thats it whatever happened with her do you know as far as i know shes still missing in action presumed dead probably there hasnt been anything about her lately i mean any stories nope because i wouldve written them and i havent written about her in oh two years at least two years is that when it happened no more like three i think i did a oneyearlater story an update that was the last time i wrote about her but thanks for the reminder it may be time for another look hey if you do that hold off a few days would you so you are working on something harry sort of i dont know if its related to martha gessler or not but give me till next week okay no problem if you come clean and talk to me then okay give me a call meantime could you pull the clips on her id like to read what you wrote back then i knew they still called it pulling clips even though it was all on computer now and actual newspaper clippings were a thing of the past sure i can do that you have a fax or an email i had neither maybe you can just mail them to me regular mail i mean i heard her laugh harry you wont make it as a modern private detective like that i bet all you have is a trench coat ive got a cell phone well thats a start then i smiled and gave her my address she said the clips would go out in the afternoon mail she asked for my cell number so she could call me the following week and i gave her that too then i thanked her and closed the phone i sat there for a moment considering things i had taken an interest in the martha gessler case at the time i didnt know her but my former wife had they had worked together in the bureaus bank robbery unit many years before her disappearance had held in the news for several days then the reports were more sporadic and then they just dropped off completely i had forgotten about her until now i felt a burning in my chest and i knew it wasnt the midday martini backing up i felt like i was closing in on something like when a child cant see something in the dark but is sure it is there just the same i got the instrument case out of the back of the benz and carried it up the sidewalk to the double doors of the retirement home i nodded to the woman behind the counter and walked by she didnt stop me she knew me by now i went down the hallway to the right and opened the door to the music room there was a piano and an organ at the front of the room and a small grouping of chairs lined up for watching performances but i knew that those were few quentin mckinzie was sitting on a seat in the front row he was slouched and his chin was down his eyes closed i gently nudged his shoulder and immediately his face and eyes came up sorry im late sugar ray i think he liked that i called him by his stage name he had been known professionally as sugar ray mck because when he played he would dodge and weave on the stage like sugar ray robinson in the ring i pulled a chair out of the front row and brought it around so it faced him i sat down and put the case on the ground i flipped up the snaps and opened it revealing the shining instrument held snug in its maroon velvet lining this has got to be short today i said ive got an appointment at four in westwood retired guys dont have appointments sugar ray said his voice sounding like he grew up just down the street from louis armstrong retired guys have all the time in the world well ive got something working and i might well im going to try to keep our schedule but the next couple weeks might be tough ill call the desk and get a message to you if i cant make the next lesson we had been meeting two afternoons a week for six months i had first seen sugar ray play on a hospital ship in the south china sea he had been part of the bob hope entourage that came to entertain the wounded during christmastime many years later in fact one of my last cases as a cop i was working a homicide and came across a stolen saxophone with his name engraved inside the mouth i tracked him to splendid age and returned it but he was too old to play it anymore his lungs no longer had the push still i had done the right thing it was like returning a lost child to a parent he invited me to christmas dinner we stayed in touch and after i pulled the pin i came back to him with a plan that would save his instrument from gathering dust sugar ray was a good teacher because he didnt know how to teach he told me stories and told me how to love the instrument how to draw from it the sounds of life any note i could sound could bring out a memory and a story i knew i was never going to be any good at playing the sax but i came twice a week to spend an hour with him and hear his stories about jazz and feel the passion he still carried for his deathless art somehow it got inside me and came out in my own breath when i held the instrument to my mouth i lifted the saxophone out of the case and held it in position ready to play we always began each lesson with me trying to play lullaby a song by george cables that i had first heard on a frank morgan disc it was a slow ballad and easier for me to play but it was also a beautiful composition it was sad and steadfast and uplifting all at the same time the song wasnt even a minute and a half long but to me it said all that ever needed to be said about being alone in the world sometimes i believed that if i could learn to play this one song well then that would be enough for me i would not be wanting today it felt like a funeral dirge i thought about martha gessler the whole time i played i remembered her picture in the paper and on the tv at eleven i remembered my exwife talking about how they had been the only two females on the bank robbery squad at one time they took a constant ration of abuse from the men until they proved themselves by working together and taking down a robber known as the two step bandit because he always did a little dance as he left a bank with the loot as i played sugar ray watched my finger work and nodded approvingly halfway through the ballad he closed his eyes and just listened nodding his head with the beats it was a high compliment when i finished the piece he opened his eyes and smiled gettin there he said i nodded you still got to get the smoke out of your lungs get your capacity up i nodded again i hadnt had a cigarette in more than a year but i had spent most of my life as a twopackaday man and the damage was done sometimes putting air into the instrument was like pushing a boulder up a hill we talked and i played for another fifteen minutes taking a hopeless shot at soul eyes the coltrane standard and then working the bridge of sugar ray s own signature song the sweet spot it was a complicated riff but i had been working on it at home because i wanted to please the old man at the end of the abbreviated lesson i thanked sugar ray and asked if he needed anything just music he said he answered that way every time i asked i put the instrument back into the casehe always insisted i keep it with me for practicingand left him there in the music room as i was heading back down the hallway to the main entrance a woman named melissa royal was approaching from the other way i smiled melissa hi harry how was the lesson she was there to see her mother an alzheimers victim who never knew who she was we had met at the christmas dinner and then had run into each other during our separate visits she started timing her visits to her mother with my three oclock lessons she didnt tell me this but i knew we had coffee a few times and then i asked her out to hear some jazz at the catalina she said she had fun but i knew she didnt know or care much about the music she was just lonely and looking for someone that was okay with me were all that way that was how it stood each of us waiting for the other to make the next move though her showing up when she knew i was scheduled to be there was a move in some way but seeing her now was a problem i had to get rolling if i was going to make it to westwood on time gettin there i said at least thats what my teacher tells me she smiled great someday youre going to have to perform for us here believe me that day is a long way off she nodded goodnaturedly and waited my turn now she was in her early forties divorced like me she had light brown hair with lighter streaks in it that she told me she had added in the beauty shop her smile was the thing though it took over her whole face and was infectious i could tell that being with her would mean working night and day to keep that smile going and i didnt know if i could do it hows your mother doing im about to go find out are you leaving i thought maybe i could check in with her and we could get some coffee in the cafeteria i put a pained look on my face and checked my watch i cant i have to be in westwood at four she nodded like she understood but i could see in her eyes that she was taking it as a rejection well dont let me hold you up youll probably be late as it is yeah i should go but i didnt i stood looking at her what she finally asked i dont know im kind of involved in this case at the moment but i was trying to think of when we could get together suspicion entered her eyes and she gestured toward the saxophone case in my hand you told me you were retired i am im kind of working this on the side freelance you could say thats where i have to go now to go talk to an investigator at the fbi oh well go be careful i will so can we get together maybe one night next week or something sure harry id like that okay good i want to melissa i nodded and she nodded and then she made a move toward me and came up on her toes she put one hand on my shoulder and kissed me on the cheek then she continued down the hallway i turned and watched her go i walked out of that place wondering what i was doing i was holding out hope of something to that woman that i knew deep down i could not deliver it was a mistake that was born of good intentions but that would ultimately hurt her as i got into the mercedes i told myself i had to end it before it started next time i saw her i would have to tell her i was not the man she was looking for i couldnt keep that smile on her face it was by the time i got to the federal building in westwood as i was heading through the parking lot toward the security entrance my cell phone rang it was keisha russell hey harry bosch she said wanted to let you know i printed out everything and put it in the mail but i was wrong about something what was that there was an update on the case it ran a couple months ago i was on vacation you stick around here long enough and they give you four weeks paid vacation i took it all at once and went to london while i was gone it was the third anniversary of martha gesslers disappearance people were poaching on my beat right and left i tell you david ferrell did an update nothing new though shes still in the wind in the wind that suggests youor the bureauthink shes still alive before you said she was presumed dead just an expression mon i dont think anybodys holding their breath for her if you know what i mean yeah did you put that update in the clips youre sending me its all there and you remember who sent it ferrells a nice guy but i dont want you calling him if something youre doing breaks big never happen keisha i know you are up to something i did my homework on you that made me pause as i was halfway across the buildings front plaza if she had called the bureau and spoken to nunez the agent wasnt going to be happy about me involving a nosy reporter what do you mean i asked calmly what did you do i did more than just check the clips i called sacramento the state licensing board i found out that you applied for and received a private investigators license yeah so every cop who retires does that its part of the process of letting go of the badge you think oh well ill just get a pi ticket and keep on catching the bad guys my ticket is in a drawer in my house keisha im not in business and im not working for anybody okay harry okay thanks for the clips ive gotta go bye harry i closed the phone and smiled i liked sparring with her ten years covering cops and she seemed no more cynical than the first day i talked to her that was amazing for a journalist even more so for a black journalist i looked up at the building it was a concrete monolith that eclipsed the sun from the angle i had i was thirty feet from the entrance but i walked over to a row of benches to the right of the entranceway and sat down i checked my watch and saw that i was very late for my appointment with nunez the trouble was i didnt know what i was walking into up there and that made me reluctant to go through the doors the federals always had a way of putting you off balance of making it clear that it was their world and you were only an invited visitor i assumed that now without a badge i would be treated more like an uninvited visitor i opened the phone back up and called the general number for parker center one of the few numbers i still remembered i asked for kiz rider in the chiefs office and was transferred she picked up immediately kiz its me harry hello harry i tried to read something in her tone but she had flatlined her response i couldnt tell how much of the mornings anger and animosity remained how are you doing you feeling any uh better did you get my message harry message no what did it say i called your house a little while ago i apologized i shouldnt have let personal feelings get mixed in with the reason i had come out there im sorry hey its okay kiz i apologize too really for what i dont know for the way i left i guess you and edgar didnt deserve that especially you i should have talked about it with you guys thats what partners do i guess i wasnt a very good partner at that moment dont worry about it thats what i said on the message water under the bridge lets just be friends now id like to but i waited for her to pick up the invitation but what harry well i dont know how friendly youll want to be after this because ive got to ask you a question and youre probably not going to like it she groaned into the phone so loud that i had to hold it away from my ear harry youre killing me what is it im sitting outside the federal building in westwood im supposed to go in and see some guy named nunez a bureau man and somethings not feeling right about this so i was wondering are these the people you warned me were working the angella benton case a guy named nunez is it connected to martha gessler the agent who disappeared a few years ago there was a long silence on the phone too long kiz im here look harry its just like i told you at your house i cant talk to you about the case all i can tell you is what i did tell you it is open and active and you should stay away from it now it was my turn not to respond she was like a complete stranger less than a year earlier i would have gone into combat with her and trusted her to take my back while i took hers now i wasnt sure i could trust her to tell me if the sun was out unless she cleared it first with the sixth floor harry you there yeah im here im just kind of speechless kiz i thought if there was somebody in the department who would always level with me it was going to be you thats all look harry have you done anything illegal while running this little freelance operation of yours no but thanks for asking then you have nothing to worry about with nunez go in and see what they want i dont know anything about martha gessler and thats all i can tell you okay kiz thanks i said putting my voice on a flat line now you take care of yourself up there on the sixth floor and ill talk to you later before she could throw in the last word i closed the phone i got up from the bench and headed to the buildings entrance inside i had to go through a metal detector take off my shoes and spread my arms wide for a search with the magic wand i could barely understand the man with the wand when he told me to raise my arms he looked more like a terrorist than i did but i didnt protest you have to pick your battles finally i got to the elevator and took it to the twelfth floor which was really the thirteenth since the elevator didnt count the lobby i stepped into a waiting area where there was a large glass and presumably bulletproof window separating the public area from the bureaus inner sanctum i said my name and who i wanted to see into a microphone and the woman on the other side of the glass told me to have a seat instead i walked over to the window and looked down at the veterans cemetery across wilshire boulevard i recalled that i was in the exact same position more than twelve years earlier when i first met the woman who would later become my wife exwife and lasting infatuation i turned away from the window and sat down on the plastic couch there was a magazine with brenda barstows photo on its cover on a beatup coffee table under the picture the caption read brenda america s sweetheart i was reaching for the magazine when the door to the interior offices opened and a man with a white shirt and tie stepped out mr bosch i stood up and nodded he reached his right hand forward while he used the left to keep the security door from closing and locking ken nunez thanks for coming in the handshake was quick and then nunez turned and led the way inside he said nothing as he walked he wasnt what i had expected on the phone he had sounded like a tired veteran who had seen it all twice but he was young just a year or two past thirty and he didnt really walk down the hallway he strode he was a young gogetter still out to prove something to himself and others i wasnt sure whichold or new agenti would have preferred he opened a door on the left and stepped back to allow me in when i saw that the door opened outward and that there was a peephole i knew i was going into an interrogation room and i knew then that this was not going to be a polite little meetandgreet more likely i was about to get my ass kickedfederal style as i made the turn into the doorway i saw a square table positioned in the middle of the interrogation room sitting at the table his back to me was a man wearing a black shirt and jeans he had closecropped blond hair as i entered i looked over his heavily muscled shoulder and saw he was reading an open investigative file he closed it and looked up as i moved around the table to the other chair opposite him it was roy lindell he smiled at my reaction harry bosch he said long time no see there podjo i paused for a moment but then pulled the chair out and sat down meantime nunez closed the door leaving me alone with lindell roy lindell was about forty now the heavy muscles i remembered were still in place pressing his shirt to its boundaries he still had the las vegas tan and the bleached teeth to go with it i had first met him on a case that took me to vegas and right into the middle of an undercover fbi operation forced to work together we had managed to put aside jurisdictional and agency animosities to a certain extent and we closed the case the bureau taking all the credit of course that had been six or seven years earlier i ran into him on a case in la once after that but we never stayed in touch not because the bureau had thieved the credit on that first case because cops and feds just dont mix almost didnt recognize you without the ponytail roy he stuck his big hand across the table and i slowly reached out and shook it he had the confident demeanor that big men often have and he had the rascals smile that often comes with it the ponytail line had been a crack when i first met himand before i knew his status as an undercover agenti took the liberty of cutting the tail off the back of his head with a penknife how you been you told nunez youre retired huh i hadnt heard about that i nodded but otherwise didnt respond this was his play i wanted to let him make all the first moves so whats it like being retired from the force im not complaining we ran a check youre a licensed private eye now huh big day in sacramento yeah i got a license for the hell of it i almost gave him the same story i gave keisha russell about it being part of the lettinggo process but decided not to bother must be nice to have a little business make your own hours work for whoever you want to work for that was enough for me as far as preliminaries went tell you what lets not talk about me roy lets get to the point what am i doing here lindell nodded as if to say fair enough well what happened is that you called up and asked about an agent who used to work here and doing that sort of raised a bunch of flags for us martha gessler thats right marty gessler so you knew who you were calling about when you told nunez you didnt know who you were calling about i shook my head no i put it together off his reaction i remembered a female agent who went missing without a trace took me a while then i remembered her name whats the latest with her gone but not forgotten i suppose lindell leaned forward and brought his massive arms together over the closed file his wrists were as thick as the legs of the table i remembered the struggle i had putting cuffs on them back in vegas when he was under and i still didnt know it harry i consider us to be like old friends we havent talked in a while but weve sort of been through a battle or two together so i dont want to jerk you around too bad here but the way this is going to work is that im going to ask you the questions that okay to a point were talking about a missing agent here a female and youre not fucking around paraphrasing the warning from kiz rider lindell didnt seem to appreciate it lets start with the reason you called he said what are you up to i waited for a long moment trying to work out how i should handle this i wasnt working for anybody other than myself there was no confidentiality agreement but i had always been resistant to bending over for the imperialist forces of the fbi it had been part of the inbred lapd culture it wasnt going to change now i respected lindelllike he said we had been in the trenches together and i knew he ultimately would deal fairly with me but the agency he worked for liked to play with a marked deck i had to be careful i had to remember that i told nunez what i was doing when i called im just checking out a case that i worked a few years back and that has always sort of stuck with me there a problem with that whos your client i dont have one i got the private license right after i pulled the pin to keep my options open but i started looking into this thing for myself he didnt believe me i could read it in his eyes but this movie caper thing wasnt even your case it was for about four days then i got pulled but i still remember the girl the victim i didnt think anybody cared anymore so i started poking around so who told you to call the bureau nobody you just thought it up on your own not exactly but you asked me who told me to call nobody told me to call i did it all on my own roy i learned about the call gessler made to one of the detectives on the case this was information that was new to me and im not sure it was ever followed up it may have sort of fallen through the cracks so i made a call to check it out i didnt have a name at the time i talked to nunez and here i am how do you know that gessler called one of the detectives on the case it seemed to me that the answer would be obvious it also would mean nothing to lawton cross if i told lindell about something that he freely had told me and that was probably part of the official investigative file i was told about your agents call by lawton cross he was one of the robberyhomicide guys who took the case from me once it blew up big he told me his partner jack dorsey was the one who got the call from your agent lindell was writing the names down on a piece of paper he had pulled out of the file i continued this was well into the case when gessler called him up months cross and dorsey werent even working it fulltime at that point and it didnt sound like they were too impressed with whatever it was gessler had to say you talk to dorsey about this no roy dorseys dead killed in a robbery in a bar in hollywood cross was hit too hes in a wheelchair with tubes in his arms and up his nose when was this about three years ago it was big news lindells eyes showed his mind working he was doing the math checking dates it reminded me that i had to put together a timeline for the case it was getting too unwieldy whats the prevailing theory on gessler dead or alive lindell looked down at the file on the table and shook his head i cant answer that harry you are not a cop you have no standing youre just some guy who cant let go of his badge and gun out there running around like a loose cannon i cant bring you into this fine answer me one question then and dont worry it wont be giving anything away he shrugged his shoulders his answer would depend on the question was my call today the first connection youve come across between the movie money thing and gessler lindell shrugged again and it seemed he was surprised by the question it was as if he had been expecting something a little tougher im not even saying there is a connection you understand he said but yes this is the first time this came up and thats exactly why i want you to back off and let us check it out just leave it to us harry yeah ive heard that before i think it was the fbi who said it to me too lindell nodded dont put us on a collision course youll regret it before i could come up with an answer he stood up he reached into one of his pockets and pulled out a package of cigarettes and a yellow plastic lighter im going to go down and have a smoke he said that will give you a few minutes to think about things and remember anything else you forgot to tell me i was about to take another verbal shot at him when i noticed that he was turning around and leaving without the file it was left there on the table and i instinctively knew he was doing this on purpose he wanted me to see the file i realized then that we were being taped what he had been saying to me was for a record of some sort or perhaps a supervisor listening in what he was allowing me to do was something different take your time i said its a lot to think about fuckin federal building i have to go all the way downstairs as he opened the door he looked back at me and gave me the wink the moment the door was closed i slid the file across the table and opened it the file was marked with martha gesslers name on the tab i took out my notebook and wrote that down at the top of a fresh page before opening the inchthick file folder and seeing what lindell had left me i figured i had maybe fifteen minutes tops to look through the file on top of the documents stacked in the file was a single page with nothing on it but a phone number i figured this was left specifically for me so i folded it and put it in my pocket the rest of the file was a collection of investigative reports most of which had lindells name and signature on them it listed him as working for the opr i knew that was the office of professional responsibility the bureaus version of internal affairs the file contained the reports detailing the investigation into special agent martha gesslers disappearance without a trace on march this date was immediately significant to me because i knew angella benton was murdered the night of may this put gesslers disappearance roughly ten months later about the same time that cross said the agent had called dorsey about the currency number according to the investigative file gessler was working as a crime analyst not a field agent at the time of her disappearance she had long since transferred from the bank robbery unit where she had known my wife and into a cyber unit she worked internet investigations and was developing computer programs for tracking criminal patterns i assumed the program cross told me about was something that came out of this assignment on the evening of march gessler left work in westwood after a long day fellow agents remembered her being in the office until at least pm but she apparently never made it to her home in sherman oaks she was unmarried her disappearance was not discovered until the next day when she did not show up for work and did not answer phone calls or pages a fellow agent went to her home to check on her and discovered her missing he found her home partially ransacked but later determined her two dogs crazed with hunger and inattention had spent the night tearing the place apart i noticed in the incident report that the fellow agent who made this discovery happened to be roy lindell i wasnt sure if this meant anything possibly as an agent assigned to the opr he would be sent to check on a fellow agents wellbeing nevertheless i wrote his name under hers in my notebook gesslers personal car a ford taurus was not found at the house eight days later it was located in a longterm parking lot at lax the key was left on top of one of the rear tires the rear bumper showed an eighteeninch surface scratch and a broken taillight damages acquaintances of the agent said were new again lindell was listed in the reports as one of these acquaintances the trunk of the car was empty and the interior offered no immediate clues as to where gessler was or what had happened the briefcase containing her laptop computer that she was known to have left the office with was gone as well forensic analysis of the entire car found no evidence of foul play no record of gessler taking any flight from lax was ever found agents checked flights at burbank long beach ontario and orange county airports and also found no flight with her name on the passenger list gessler was known to carry an atm card two gas credit cards as well as american express and visa cards on the night of her disappearance she used the chevron card to buy gas and a diet coke at a station on sepulveda boulevard near the getty museum the receipt indicated she purchased gallons of midgrade unleaded gasoline at pm her cars tank held a maximum of gallons the purchase was significant because it placed gessler in the sepulveda pass her normal route home from westwood to sherman oaksat a time that coordinated with her leaving the bureau offices in westwood the nightshift cashier at the chevron also identified gessler from a photo lineup as a regular customer who had bought gas on the night of march gessler was an attractive woman he knew and remembered her he had told her she didnt need to drink diet coke and she seemed pleased by the compliment this confirmed sighting was important for several reasons first if gessler was going from westwood to lax where her car was later found it was unlikely that she would have traveled north into the sepulveda pass to buy gas the airport was southwest of the bureau office the service station was directly to the north the next significance was that gesslers chevron card was used a second time the same night at a chevron service station off highway in the north county the card was used at point of purchase to buy gallons of gasoline more than gesslers and most other cars could hold highway was the main route to the desert areas of the northeast county it was also a major trucking route last but not least in terms of significance was the fact that none of gesslers credit cards were ever found or used again there was no summary or conclusion in the reports i scanned this would be something the investigatorlindellwould draw for himself and keep to himself you dont write a report concluding that your fellow agent is dead you dont say the obvious and you always speak about the missing agent in the present tense but it was clear to me from what i had read what the conclusion had to be sometime after gessler pumped gas into her car in the sepulveda pass she was stopped and abducted and it didnt look like she was coming back she had probably been rearended she then pulled to the side of the road to check damage and possibly to exchange insurance information with the other driver what happened next was unknown but she was likely abducted by force and her car was dumped at the lax lota move that probably guaranteed it would not be located for several days thereby allowing the trail to go cold and the memories of potential witnesses to fade the second gas purchase was the curiosity was it a mistake a clue pointing to the direction of the agents abductors or was it misdirection an intentional move by the abductors to point the investigation the wrong way and the amount of gasoline purchased raised a whole other question what kind of vehicle were they looking for a tow truck a pickup a moving van bureau agents descended on the station but there were no exterior video cameras and no credible witnesses to the use of the credit card because it had been a payatthepump purchase it was the last blip on the radar screen but nothing more than that nevertheless an agent was still missing there was no choice the file contained the short summaries of three days of aerial searches over the desert of the northeast county it was a needleinthehaystack operation but it had to be done it proved fruitless agents also spent several days on the likely routes that gessler would have taken through the sepulveda pass on her way home the pass cut through the santa monica mountains while the south slope offered few choices besides the freeway and sepulveda boulevard the northern slope offered a network of shortcuts pioneered over fifty years of rush hours agents traveled all of these roads looking for witnesses to an accident involving a blue ford taurus an accident scene that might have seemed routine but was actually the abduction of a federal agent they got nothing the sepulveda pass had been the location of similar crimes in the past the son of popular entertainer bill cosby had been robbed and murdered on the dark side of the road one night just a few years before and over the last decade a handful of women had been abducted and raped one of them stabbed to death after pulling off the road when their vehicles were rearended or became disabled these incidents were not thought to be the work of one person but rather that the pass with its hillsides dark winding roads and anonymity was a place that drew predators like lions keeping watch on a water hole the human predators would not need to wait long in the sepulveda pass the cut through the mountains was one of the busiest traffic corridors in the world it was possible gessler was the victim of a random crime the very thing she sought to categorize and make sense of in her job she could have drawn a predator at the service station maybe opening her purse too wide when she pulled out her credit card maybe drawing a tail for some other unknown reason she was an attractive woman if a service station attendant had noticed it and acted on it in a subtle way a predator could have just as likely seen what he needed in her as well still the team of agents initially assigned to the case had doubts about gessler falling into the profile of prior victims in the pass gesslers car advertised no personal riches and she would have been a formidable opponent she was a highly trained federal agent after all she was also tall standing almost six feet tall and weighing a hundred and forty pounds she worked out regularly at the la fitness club on sepulveda and had been taking taibo training for several years her charts at the club showed she had four percent body fat she was mostly muscle and she knew how to use it gessler was also known to wear her service weapon while off duty on the night she disappeared she had been wearing black slacks and blazer with a white blouse her pistol a smith amp wesson mm was holstered on her right hip the service station attendant recalled seeing the weapon because gessler was not wearing her blazer when she put gas in her car at the selfpump station the blazer was later found on a hanger hooked above the rear drivers side window in the taurus all of this meant that when gesslers car was rearended somewhere in the pass that night she got out of the car with a weapon clearly showing on her hip she got out of that car a woman who was competent and confident in her physical skills it was a combination that would have likely been a high deterrent to attack that would seemingly convince any predator to find another victim so while the bureau never gave an inch on the possibility that gessler was the randomly chosen victim of a crime lindell headed a parallel investigation into the possibility that gessler had been specifically targeted because of her job as an fbi agent the reports on this branch of the investigation accounted for more than half of the documents in the file in front of me though i could tell that i did not have the complete investigative file it was clear that agents on the case left no stone uncovered in seeking a possible link to gesslers disappearance cases ranging back to gesslers first years in the los angeles field office were examined for potential links to the investigation partners and colleagues from all her years in the bureau were questioned about potential enemies and threats she might have received among these reports was a summary of an interview with former agent eleanor wish my former wife conducted in las vegas she had not spoken with gessler in nearly ten years before the disappearance she had no recollection of any threats or anything else that might help in the investigation every criminal gessler ever put in jail or testified against was run down and checked most were cleared through alibis none surfaced as a prime suspect according to the reports gessler had become the goto agent in the la field office for any and all requests for computerrelated searches and investigations it was to be expected in a giant bureaucracy like the fbi most requests by la agents for computerbased expertise would be shipped to bureau offices in washington and quantico sometimes taking days before being approved and then weeks before any results were shipped back but gessler was part of a growing breed of agents with high computer skills who liked to do things for herself the special agent in charge of the la office became aware of this and consequently gessler was taken off the street where she had worked for several years in the bank robbery unit she was placed in a newly formed computer unit where she handled requests from street agents while developing her own computer programs this meant gessler had her finger in a lot of investigative pies at the time she disappeared i checked my watch and quickly skimmed through dozens of reports detailing work she had done on different cases in just the month before her disappearance lindell and other agents working for him backtracked on these jobs looking for anything that was a clue to why gessler had disappeared the closest it appeared they came to finding something was when they reviewed gesslers work on an investigation of an escort service that advertised women for hire on a website gesslers work was part of the organized crime units investigation into the eastern mobs ties to prostitution in los angeles according to what i read gessler was able to find internet connections between websites advertising women in more than a dozen cities women were being moved from city to city and client to client money generated by the escort services flowed to florida and then to new york seven weeks before gessler disappeared a grand jury indicted nine men under the federal racketeering influenced and corrupt organization act exactly one week before her disappearance gessler testified about her part in the investigation during a pretrial hearing in the case her testimony was described as effective and it was assumed she would testify when the case went to trial she was not however a key witness her testimony was seemingly part of the linkage between the websites and the defendants the key witness was one of the members of the ring who had cut a deal with prosecutors to escape a stiff sentence the possibility that gessler was targeted because she was a witness was a long shot but it seemed to be the best thing going lindell worked it hard judging by the number of reports and the details they contained but apparently nothing came of it the last report in the file pertaining to the rico case described this branch of the investigation as open and active but without substantive leads at this time i recognized it as bureauspeak meaning this path of investigation had hit a dead end i closed the file and checked my watch again lindell had been gone seventeen minutes there was nothing in the file about gessler filing a report or notifying a supervisor or colleague that she had run a computer crossreference check on the currency numbers contained on the flier put out by cross and dorsey nothing that said she had gotten a hit and had called the lapd to report that one of the numbers on the currency report was bad after putting away my notebook i stood up and stretched my back and paced a little bit in the small room i checked the door and found it unlocked that was good they werent holding me like a suspect at least not yet after a few more minutes i got tired of waiting and stepped out into the hallway i looked both ways and saw no one not even nunez i went back into the room and picked up the file and then started walking out the way i had come in i got all the way to the front waiting room without anyone stopping me or asking where i was going i nodded to the receptionist through the glass and took the elevator down roy lindell was sitting on the same bench i had used before entering the building there were three cigarettes crushed on the pavement between his feet a fourth was between his fingers you took your sweetass time he said i sat down next to him and put the file between us putting you in the oprisnt that like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse i was thinking about the case i had met him on six years before id had no clue he was law enforcement this was mostly because he was running a strip club in vegas and bedding the strippers two and three at a time his front was so convincing that even after i learned he was an undercover i entertained the idea that he had crossed over eventually and completely i was convinced otherwise once a smartass always a smartass eh bosch something like that i guess so who was listening to our little conversation up there i was told to tape it that the tape would be forwarded to who he didnt say anything it was like he was still deciding something come on roy you want to give me a clue about whats going on i looked through your file its pretty thin not much that helps me thats just the highlightsstuff i kept in a backup file the real file used to fill a whole drawer used to lindell looked around as if realizing for the first time he was sitting outside a building that housed more agents and spooks than anywhere west of chicago he looked down at the file lying there between us for the world to see i dont like sitting out here wheres your car lets take a ride we walked out into the parking lot without talking but seeing lindell acting the way he was unnerved me and made me think again about kiz riders warning about some sort of higher authority being involved in the case once we got inside the benz i put the file on the backseat and keyed the engine i asked him where he wanted to go i dont care just drive i went west on wilshire thinking id cut over to san vicente and cruise through brentwood it would be a nice drive on a street lined with trees and joggers even if the conversation wasnt nice were you being square on the tape lindell asked thats your real story about not working on this for anybody yeah thats the square story well you better watch your ass podjo there are larger forces at work here people that dont fuck around yeah i know ive been told that but nobody wants to tell me who this higher authority is and why this connects to gessler or means anything to the movie money heist four years after it went down well i cant tell you because i dont know all i know is that after you called today i made a few calls myself and the next thing i know the walls came down on me hard man they came down hard this came out of washington no right here who roy theres no use in us driving around and talking if youre not talking what do we have here organized crime i read the report on gesslers rico case it looked like the only thing you had going on it lindell laughed as though i had suggested something absurd organized crime shit i wish this was just an oc deal i pulled to the side of san vicente we were a couple blocks from where marilyn monroe had odd one of the citys lasting scandals and mysteries then what roy im tired of talking to myself lindell nodded and then looked over at me homeland security baby what do you mean somebody thinks theres a terrorist connection to this i dont know what they think i wasnt made privy all i know is that i was told to shut you down tape it and send it down to the ninth floor the ninth floor i said it just to be saying something i was trying to think my mind scanned quickly through the images of the case angella benton on the tile the gunman waving weapons and firing the impact of one of my shots catching one of them in the body and knocking himat least i think it was a himbackward into the van nothing seemed to fit with what lindell was telling me the ninth is where they put the react squad lindell said pulling me out of the reverie theyre heavy hitters bosch you walk out in front of them in the street and they wont stop they wont even tap the brakes whats react i knew it had to be another federal acronym all law enforcement agencies are good for putting together acronyms but the feds are the best at it regional response no its rapid enforcement against something terrorism i forget the whole thingoh i got it rapid response enforcement and counterterrorism thats it that one mustve come straight out of the directors office in dc that took some thought funny basically its a multiagency gang bang youve got us secret service dea everybody i figured that last everybody was a catchall for the agencies that didnt like their initials bandied about nsa cia dia and so on through the federal alphabet a man on a bike rode by the benz and slapped the side view mirror hard making lindell jump the biker kept going keeping his gloved hand up and giving me the finger i realized i had pulled over in the bike lane and pulled the benz back out onto the street these fucking bikers think they own the road lindell said pull up next to him and ill give him a whack ignoring the request i sped past the biker giving him a wide berth i dont get it roy what does the ninth floor have to do with my case first of all its not your case anymore secondly i dont know they ask me the questions i dont get to ask them when did they start asking today you call up and ask about marty gessler and tell nunez it has something to do with the movie money case he comes to me and i tell him to have you come in meantime i start doing some checking turns out weve got the movie money caper listed on our computer with a react flag on it so i call down to the ninth and say whats up fellas and two seconds later i get crapped on pretty good you were told to find out what i know then shut me down and send me on my way oh and to tape it so they could listen and make sure you were a good little agent and did what you were told to do yeah something like that so whyd you let me read the file and take it why are we driving around talking lindell took his time before responding we had made the curve onto ocean boulevard in santa monica i pulled off the road again next to the cliffs that look down to the beach and the pacific the horizon was blurred white by the marine layer the ferris wheel on the pacific park pier stood still and without its neon blazing i did it because marty gessler was a friend of mine yeah i could sort of tell from the file close friends my meaning was obvious close he said wasnt that sort of a conflict you leading the case lets just say my relationship with her was not known until we were down the road a ways on the investigation i then cashed in every chip i had to stay on it not that it did a hell of a lot of good here we are threeplus years later and i still have no idea what happened to her then you call up and tell me something that was brandfuckingnew to me so you were being square there was no record of her talking to dorsey about the currency number nothing we found but she kept a lot of stuff on her computer and thats gone man there had to be stuff she hadnt backed up on the office box you know the rule is back everything up every night before going home but nobody does that nobody has the time i nodded and thought about things i was gathering a lot of information but had little time to process it i tried to think about what else i needed to ask lindell while i was with him im still not tracking something i finally said why was it one way up in the interrogation room and another way out here why are you talking to me roy why let me see the file react is a bam squad bosch by any means there are no rules with these guys the rules went out the window september eleventh two thousand one the world changed so did the bureau the country sat back and let it happen they were watching the war over there in afghanistan when they were changing all the rules here homeland security is what its all about now and everything else can take a backfuckingseat including marty gessler you think the ninth floor took over this case because an agent is missing they couldnt care less there is something else and whether or not they find out what happened to her doesnt matter to them that is its not the same for me lindell stared straight ahead as he spoke i understood a little better what was happening now the bureau told him to cease and desist it could keep him in check but i was a free agent lindell would help me when and if he could so youve got no idea what their interest is in this case not a clue but you want me to keep going if you ever repeat it ill deny it but the answer is yes i want to be your client podjo i put the benz in drive and pulled back onto the roadway i headed back toward westwood i cant pay you of course lindell said and i probably cant contact you after today either tell you what stop calling me podjo and well call it even lindell nodded as though i had been serious and to say that he had agreed to the deal we drove in silence while i dropped down the california incline to the coast highway and took it up to santa monica canyon and then back up to san vicente so what did you think about what you read up there lindell finally asked looked like you made all the right moves to me what about the gas station guy who saw her that night he checked out yeah we came down on him six ways till sunday he was clean the place was busy and he was there till midnight we have him on the security video and he never left the booth after she came and went his alibi for after midnight checked out too anything else from the video i didnt see anything in the file nah the video was worthless other than the fact it shows her and it was the last time she was ever seen he looked out the window three years later and lindell was still hooked in deeply on this one i had to remember that i had to filter everything he said and did through that prism what are the chances of me getting a look at the whole investigative file id say somewhere between zero and none the ninth floor he nodded they came up and popped the drawer out and took it i wont see that stuff again i probably wont even get the goddamn drawer back why didnt they put the freeze on me why you because i knew you but mostly because youre not supposed to even know about them i nodded as i turned onto wilshire the federal building in sight up ahead look roy i dont know if the two things are connected know what i mean im talking about martha gessler and the thing in hollywood angella benton martha made a call on it but it doesnt mean that they are connected ive got other things ill be chasing down this is just one of them okay he looked out the window again and mumbled something i couldnt hear what i said nobody ever called her martha until she disappeared then it was in the papers and on tv that way she hated that name martha i just nodded because there was nothing else to do i turned into the federal parking lot and drove up to the plaza to drop him off that phone number in the file its okay to call you on that yeah anytime make sure your own phones are safe before you do i thought about that until i brought the benz to a stop at the curb in front of the plaza lindell looked out the window and surveyed the plaza as if he was judging whether it was safe to get out you get back to vegas much i asked him he answered without looking back at me he kept his eyes on the plaza and the windows of the building looming above whenever i get the chance have to go in disguise a lot of people over there dont like me i can imagine his undercover work coupled with my teams homicide investigation had toppled a major underworld figure and most of his minions i saw your wife over there about a month ago he said playing cards i think it was at the bellagio she had a nice stack of chips in front of her he knew eleanor wish from that first case in vegas that was when and where i had married her exwife i said but that wasnt why i was asking sure i know seemingly satisfied with the view he opened the door and got out he looked back in at me and waited for me to say something i nodded ill take your case roy he nodded back then call me anytime and watch yourself out there podjo he gave me the rogues gotyoulast smile and closed the door before i could say anything around the detective squad rooms of the lapds numerous stations the state of idaho is called blue heaven its the goal line the final destination for a good number of the detectives who go the distance put in their twentyfive years and then cash out i hear there are whole neighborhoods up there full of excops from la living side by side by side realtors from coeur dalene and sandpoint run businesscardsize ads in the police union newsletter in every issue of course some cops turn in the badge and set out for nevada to bake in the desert and pick up parttime work in the casinos some disappear into northern california there are more retired cops in the backwoods of humboldt county than there are marijuana growers only the growers dont know it and some head south to mexico where there are still spots where an airconditioned ranch house with an ocean view is affordable on an lapd pension the point is few stick around they spend their adult lives trying to make sense of this place trying to bring a small measure of order to it and then cant stand to stay here once their job is done the work does that to you it robs you of the ability to enjoy your accomplishment there is no reward for making it through one of the few men i knew who turned in the badge but not the city was named burnett biggar he gave the city its twentyfive yearsthe last half of it in south bureau homicideand then retired to open up a small business with his son near the airport biggar amp biggar professional security was on sepulveda near la tijera the building was nondescript the offices unpretentious biggars business was primarily geared toward providing security systems and patrols to the warehouse industries around the airport the last time i had spoken to himwhich was probably two years earlierhe had told me he had more than fifty employees and business was going good but out of the other side of his mouth he confided that he missed what he called the real work the vital work the work that made a difference protecting a warehouse full of blue jeans made in taiwan could be profitable but it didnt even begin to touch what you got out of putting a stone killer on the floor and the cuffs on his wrists it wasnt even close and that was what biggar missed it was because of that i thought i could approach him for help with what i wanted to do for lawton cross there was a small waiting room with a coffee machine but i wasnt there that long burnett biggar came down a hallway and invited me back to his office as befitting his name he was a large man i had to follow him down the hallway rather than walk next to him his head was shaved which was a new look for him as far as i knew so big i see you traded the julius for the jordan huh he rubbed a hand over his polished scalp had to do it harry its the style and im getting gray arent we all he led me into his office it wasnt small and it wasnt big it was basic with wood paneling and framed commendations news clips and photos from his days with the department it was probably all very impressive to the clients biggar swung around behind a cluttered desk and pointed me to a chair in front of it as i sat down i noticed a framed slogan on the wall behind him it said biggar amp biggar is getting better amp better biggar leaned forward and folded his arms on his desk so harry bosch i dont think i was expecting to see you maybe ever again its funny seeing you in that chair funny seeing you too i dont think i was expecting it either you come here for a job i heard you quit last year you were the last guy i ever thought about quitting nobody goes the distance big and i appreciate the offer but i already have a job im just looking for a little help biggar smiled the skin pulling tight around his eyes he was intrigued he knew i wasnt ever going to be the corporate or industrial security type i never heard you ask for help on a goddamn thing what do you need i need a setup electronic surveillance one room nobody can know the camera is there how bigs the room like a bedroom maybe fifteen by fifteen ah man harry dont go down that road you start that sort of snooping and youll lose sight of yourself come work for me i can find some no its nothing like that its actually an offshoot of a homicide im working the guys in a wheelchair he sits and watches tv all day i just want to be able to make sure hes okay you know theres something going on with the wife at least i think so you mean like abuse maybe i dont know something does the guy know youre going to do this no but youve got access to the room pretty much think you can help me out well we got cameras but you have to understand most of our work is industrial application heavyduty stuff sounds to me like all you need is a nanny cam something that you can just pick up at radio shack i shook my head i dont want to be too obvious about it the guy was a cop biggar nodded digested it quickly and stood up well come on back to the tech room and take a look at what weve got andres back there and he can fix you up he led me back into the hallway and toward the back of the building we entered the tech room which was about the size of a double garage and was crowded with workbenches and shelves of all manner of electronics equipment there were three men gathered around one of the workbenches they were looking at the screen of a small television a grainy blackandwhite surveillance tape was playing i recognized one of the men the largest as andre biggar burnetts son i had never met him but i knew it was him by his size and resemblance to burnett right down to the shaved scalp introductions were made and andre explained that he was reviewing a tape showing a burglary of a clients warehouse his father explained what i was looking for and the son led me to another workbench where he could display and review equipment he showed me cameras housed in a vase a lamp a picture frame and finally a clock thinking about how lawton cross had complained about not being able to see the time on his television i stopped andre right there this will do how does it work it was a round clock about ten inches across this is a classroom clock you want to put this on the wall of a bedroom it will stick out like tits on a andre his father said its not being used as a bedroom i said its like a tv room and the subject told me he cant see the time on the corner of the screen on cnn so this will make sense when i bring it in andre nodded okay you want sound color sound yes color would be good but not necessary all right are you going to transmit or you want to go selfcontained i looked at him blankly and he knew i didnt understand i build these two ways one is you have a camera in the clock and you transmit picture and sound to a receiver that records it on video you would have to find a secure place for the recorder within about a hundred feet to be sure are you going to be outside the house in a van or something i wasnt planning on it okay the second option is to go digital and put everything in the camera and record internally to a digital tape or memory card the drawback is capacity with a digital tape you get about two hours real time then you have to change it out with a card you get even less that wont work i was only planning to check on it every few days i started thinking of how i would be able to hide the receiver inside the house maybe the garage i could pretend i was going to the garage to throw something away and i could hide the receiver somewhere danny cross wouldnt see it well we can slow the recording down if we need to how a number of different ways first off we put the camera on a clock turn it off say midnight to eight we can also stagger the fps and lengthen fps the recorded frames per second it makes the image jump though what about sound does that jump too no sound is separate youd get full sound i nodded but wasnt sure i wanted to lose any of the visual recording we can also put it on a motion sensor this guy you say is in a wheelchair does he move around a lot no he cant hes paralyzed most of the time i think he just sits there staring at the tv any pets i dont think so so the only time there is real movement in the room is when the caregiver comes in and thats who you want to watch am i right right no problem then this will work we put a motion sensor on it and a twogig memory card and youll probably stretch it out a couple days thatll work i nodded and looked at burnett i was impressed with his son andre looked like he should be out breaking quarterbacks in half but he had found a specialty in life dealing with circuits and microprocessors i could see the pride in burnetts eyes give me fifteen minutes to put it together and then ill come show you how to install it and how to switch out the memory card sounds good i sat with burnett in his office and we talked about the department and a couple of the cases that we had worked together one case had involved a hired killer who had murdered both the intended target in south la and then his employer in hollywood when the employer failed to pay the second half of the agreedupon fee we had worked it together for a month my team and biggar and his partner who was named miles manley we broke it when big and manley as the pair were called came up with a witness in the target victims neighborhood who remembered seeing a white man on the day of the shooting and could describe his car a black corvette with red leather interior the car matched the vehicle used by the second victims nextdoor neighbor he confessed after a lengthy interrogation conducted alternately by biggar and me its always something small like that biggar said while leaning back behind his desk thats what i loved best about it not knowing where that little break was going to come from i know what you mean so you miss it yeah but ill get it back im starting to now you mean the feeling not the job right how about you you still missing it im making more money than i need here but yeah i miss the juice the job gave me the juice and i dont get it shuffling rentacops around and setting up cameras be careful what you do harry you might end up successful like me and then you sit around remembering the old days thinking they were a lot better than they were ill be careful big biggar nodded pleased that he had dispensed his dose of advice for the day you dont have to tell me if you dont want to harry but im guessing this guy in the chair is lawton cross huh i hesitated but decided it didnt matter yeah its him im working something else and it crossed his path i went to see him and he said some stuff i just want to make sure you know good luck with it i remember his wife saw her a couple times at things she was a nice lady i nodded i knew what he was saying that he hoped cross wasnt being victimized by his wife people can change i said im going to find out andre biggar came in a few minutes later carrying a toolbox a laptop computer and the camera clock in a box he took me to school on electronic surveillance the clock was rigged and ready all i needed to do was mount it on a wall and plug it in when i adjusted the time i would activate the surveillance by pushing the dial all the way in to switch out the memory card i just had to remove the backing of the clock and pop the card out of the camera easy okay so once i take the card out how do i look at what ive got andre nodded and showed me how to plug the memory card into the side of the laptop computer he then went through the keyboard commands that would bring up the surveillance recording on the computers screen its simple just take care of the equipment and bring it all back weve got a lot of bread invested in it i didnt want to tell him that it wasnt simple enough for me i seized on the financial side of the equation as a way of avoiding revealing my technical shortcomings tell you what i said i think ill leave your laptop here and just come back with the memory card when i want to look at it i dont want to risk all your equipment i like to travel light anyway whatever suits you but the beauty of this setup is the immediacy you can pull the card and watch it in your car right outside the guys house if you want why come all the way back here i dont think theres that kind of urgency ill leave the laptop and bring you back the card okay whatever andre put the clock back in its cushioned box then shook my hand and left the office taking the laptop with him but leaving me the toolbox along with the clock i looked at burnett it was time to go he looks like hes more than helping you andres the heart of this place he gestured toward the wall of framed memorabilia i bring the clients in impress them sign them up andres the one who gets it done he figures out the needs and gets it done i nodded and stood up you want to charge me something for this i said holding up the box with the clock in it biggar smiled not if you bring it back then his face turned serious its the least i can do for lawton cross yeah i said knowing the feeling we shook hands and i went out carrying the clock and the toolbox hoping the hidden camera would be the piece of equipment that would show me the world wasnt as bad as i thought it could be from biggar amp biggar i drove back to the valley taking the sepulveda pass and catching the first brutal wave of rush hour it took me almost an hour just to get to mulholland drive at that point i jumped off the freeway and drove west along the crest of the mountains i watched the sun drop behind malibu and leave a burning sky in its trail at the low angles the sun often reflected off the smog caught in the bowl of the valley and turned it brilliant shades of orange and pink and purple it was like some sort of reward for putting up with having to breathe the poisoned air every day this evening it was mostly a smooth orange color with wisps of white mixed in it was what my exwife used to call a creamsicle sky when she watched sunsets off the back deck of the house she had a descriptive label for each one and that always made me smile the memory of her on the deck seemed like such a long time ago and such a different part of my life i thought about what roy lindell had said about seeing her in las vegas he knew i had been asking about her even though i told him i hadnt if not a day then at least not a week went by that i didnt think about going out there finding her and asking for another chance a chance of making a go of it on her terms i had no job holding me to la anymore i could go where i wanted this time i could go to her and we could live there together in the city of sin she could still be free to find what she needed on the blue felt poker tables of the citys casinos and at the end of each day she could come home to me i could do whatever came up there would always be something in vegas for a person with my skills one time i had packed a box put it in the back of the benz and had gotten as far as riverside before the familiar fears started rising in my chest and i pulled off the freeway i ate a hamburger at an innout and then headed back home i didnt bother unpacking the box when i got there i put it on the floor in the bedroom and took out the clothes i had packed as i needed them over the next two weeks the empty box was still there on the floor ready for the next time i wanted to pack it and make that drive the fear it was always there fear of rejection fear of unrequited hope and love fear of feelings still below the surface in me it was all mixed in the blender and poured smooth as a milkshake into my cup until it was filled to the very edge so full that if i were to move even a step it would spill over the sides therefore i couldnt move i stood paralyzed i stayed home and lived out of a box im a believer in the singlebullet theory you can fall in love and make love many times but there is only one bullet with your name etched on the side and if you are lucky enough to be shot with that bullet then the wound never heals roy lindell might have had martha gesslers name on a bullet i dont know what i do know is that eleanor wish had been my bullet she had pierced me through and through there were other women before and other women since but the wound she left was always there it would not heal right i was still bleeding and i knew i would always bleed for her that was just the way it had to be there is no end of things in the heart on the way into woodland hills i made a quick stop at a vendome liquors and then headed to the house on melba avenue i didnt call ahead with lawton cross i knew the chances were always good hed be at home danielle cross answered the door after three knocks and her already strained face took on a deeper scowl when she saw it was me hes sleeping she said holding her body tightly in the doors opening hes still recovering from yesterday then wake him up danny because i need to talk to him look you cant just barge in here youre not a cop anymore you have no right do you have the right to decide who he does and doesnt see that seemed to stall her anger a little bit she looked down at the toolbox in one hand and the box i had under my arm what is all of that i got him a gift look danny i need to talk to him people are going to be coming to see him i have to talk to him about it so hell be ready she relented without further word she stepped back and opened the door wide she signaled me in with an outstretched arm and i stepped over the threshold i found my way to the bedroom lawton cross was asleep in his chair his mouth open and a spill of medicinallooking drool curved down his cheek i didnt want to look at him he was too much of a reminder of what could happen i put the toolbox and the clock box down on the bed i went back to the door and closed it making sure it banged in the jamb loud enough to hopefully startle cross awake i didnt want to have to touch him to wake him up when i turned back to the chair i noticed his eyes flutter and then go still at half mast hey law its me harry bosch i noticed the green light on the monitor on the bureau and moved behind the chair to turn it off harry he said where i came back around the chair and looked down on him with a frozen smile on my face right here man you awake now yeah mmm wake good theres some stuff i need to tell you and i got you something i went to the bed and started pulling the clock out of the box andre biggar had packed for me black bush his voice was alert now once again i regretted my choice of words to him i came back into his field of vision holding the clock up i got you this clock for the wall now youll be able to tell the time when you need it he blew a burst of air out through his lips shell just take it down ill tell her not to dont worry i opened the toolbox and pulled out the hammer and a drywall nail from a plastic package that contained a variety of nails for different purposes i surveyed the wall to the left of the television and picked a spot at center there was an electrical outlet directly below i held the nail up high on the wall and drove it halfway in with the hammer i was hanging the clock when the door opened and danny looked in what are you doing he doesnt want a clock in here i finished hanging the clock lowered my hands and looked at her he told me he did want a clock we both looked at law to settle it his eyes flitted from his wife to me and then back again lets try having a clock for a while he said id like to know the time of day so i know when my shows are coming on fine she said in a clipped tone whatever you want she left the room closing the door behind her i leaned over and plugged the clocks line into the outlet then i checked my watch and reached up to set the time and turn on the camera when i was finished i put the hammer back into the toolbox and snapped the latch harry what i asked though i knew what the question would be did you bring me some a little i reopened the toolbox and took out the flask i had filled in the parking lot at the vendome danny said youre hung over you sure course im sure give me a taste harry i need it i went through the same routine as the day before and then waited to see if he could tell i had watered down the whiskey ah thats the good stuff harry give me another would you i did and then i closed the flask feeling somehow guilty about giving this broken man the one joy he seemed to have left in life listen law im here to give you a headsup i think i sort of kicked over a can of worms with this thing what happened i tried to run down that agent you said had called jack dorsey about the currency numbers you know about the problem yeah i know did you find her no law i didnt the agent was martha gessler that ring a bell with you his eyes moved across the ceiling as if that was where he kept his memory banks no should it i dont know shes missing shes been missing for three years since right about the time she called jack holy shit harry yeah so i kind of walked into that when i called up to try to track that call theyre going to come talk to me i dont know but thats the headsup i think they might somehow theyve got this whole thing tied into a terrorism angle its one of these postseptember eleven crews running with it now and i hear they like to kick ass and read the rule book later i dont want them coming here harry what did you start im sorry about that law if they come just let them ask their questions and you answer them the best you can get their names and tell danny to call me after they leave ill try i just want to be left alone i know law i moved closer to his chair and held the flask up into his field of vision you want more does the pope shit in the woods i poured a good slug into his mouth then a chaser i waited for it to go down and then work its way back up into his eyes they seemed to glaze over you okay fine there are a few more questions i have for you they sort of came to me after i talked to the bureau like what like about the phone call jack got the fbi says there was no record of gessler calling about the currency list thats simple maybe it wasnt her like i said i didnt get a name from jack or if i did its gone i dont remember it im pretty sure it was her everything else you described about it fits she had a program like you described on her laptop it went missing with her there you go there probably was a record of her calling it just disappeared with her i guess so what about the time of the call can you remember anything more about that about when it came in ah jeez i dont know harry it was just one of those things it was just a call im sure jack put it on the log he was talking about the chronological log everything was always entered on the log or was supposed to be yeah i know i said but i dont have access to that im on the outside remember yeah you told me you thought it was ten or so months into the case remember you said you were working other cases by then and jack took over lead on angella benton her murder was may sixteenth of ninetynine martha gessler disappeared the following march nineteenth thats almost exactly ten months later so i remembered it right what else you want from me its just that i didnt finish i was trying to figure out what to ask and how to say it something wasnt right about the chronology its just what i dont know it seems to me if jack had recently talked to this agent he would have said something about it when she went missing it was a big story you know in the papers and on the tv every night is there any way the call could have come earlier closer to the beginning of the case that way jack might have forgotten about it and her by the time she hit the news cross didnt say anything for a while as he considered this i considered other possibilities too but kept hitting logic walls give me another shot of that stuff would you harry he tried to suck too much of it down and it backed up and burned his throat when he spoke again his voice was hoarser than usual i dont think so i think it was ten months close your eyes for a second law what are you talking about just close your eyes and concentrate on that memory whatever it is that you have that youre keying on concentrate on that you trying to hypnotize me harry im just trying to focus your thoughts help you remember what jack said it wont work not if you dont let it relax law relax and try to forget everything like your minds a blackboard and youre erasing it think about what jack said about the call his eyes moved under the thin pale eyelids but after a few moments they slowed and stopped i watched his face and waited it was years since i had tried any hypnotic techniques and that had been to draw out visual descriptions of events and suspects what i wanted from cross now was a memory of a time and place and the dialogue that went with it you see the blackboard law yeah i see it okay go to the board and write jacks name on it write it at the top so you have room underneath it harry this is stupid i just humor me law write jacks name at the top of the board okay okay law thats good now look at the board and underneath jacks name write the words phone call okay okay did it good now look at those three words and concentrate on them jack phone call jack phone call the silence that followed my words was punctuated by the barely discernible ticking of the new clock now law i want you to concentrate on the black around those words around those letters go through the letters law into the black go through the letters i waited and watched his eyelids i saw the retinal movement begin again jack is talking to you law hes telling you about the agent he says she has new information on the movie set heist i waited for a long moment wondering if i should have mentioned gessler by name then deciding it was better that i hadnt what is he saying to you law theres something wrong with the numbers they dont match did she call him she called him where are you when he is telling you this law were in the car weve got court is it a trial yes whose trial is it its that little mexican kid the little gangbanger who killed the korean jeweler on western alejandro penjeda its the verdict penjeda is the defendant thats right and jack got the call from the agent before you went to court to hear the verdict thats right okay law i had gotten what i wanted i tried to think what else i could ask him law did jack say what the agents name was no he didnt say did he say he would check out the information she gave him he said hed do some checking but that he thought it was a bullshit call he said he didnt think it meant anything did you believe him yes okay law im going to tell you to open your eyes in a moment and when you open them i want you to feel like you just woke up but i want you to remember what we just talked about okay okay yes and the other thing is i want you to feel better i want you to be okay about things in your life i want you to be as happy as you can be law okay yes okay law open your eyes now the eyelids fluttered once and then they were open they strafed the ceiling and then came to me they seemed brighter than before harry how do you feel law okay you remember what we were talking about yeah that little mex penjeda we called him pinheada he didnt take the deal the da floated life with he took his chances with the jury and got snake eyes life without live and learn what sounded like what might have been a laugh gurgled from deep in his throat yeah that was a good one he said i remember when we were going over to court that day was when jack told me about the call from westwood right you remember when that verdict came in on penjeda end of february beginning of march my last trial harry a month later i took the bullet in that shithole bar and i was history i remember watching pinheadas face when he heard that verdict and knew he was facing life without parole fucker got what he deserved the laugh came up again and then i saw the light go out of his eyes what is it law hes up there at corcoran playing handball in the yard or getting his ass rented out by the mexican mafia on an hourly basis and im here i got life without too i guess his eyes looked into mine i nodded because it was the only thing i could think of to do its not fair harry life isnt fair the downtown library was on flower and figueroa it was one of the oldest buildings in the whole city therefore it was dwarfed by the modern glassandsteel structures that surrounded it inside it was a beauty centered around a domed rotunda with degree mosaics depicting the founding of the city by the padres the place had been twice burned by arsonists and closed for years then restored to its original beauty i had come after the restoration was completed the first time back since i was a child and i continued to come it brought me close to the los angeles i remembered where i felt comfortable i would take my lunch in the book rooms or the upperlevel patios while reading case files and writing notes i got to know the security guards and a few of the librarians i had a library card though i rarely checked out a book i went to the library after leaving lawton cross because i no longer could call on keisha russell to help me with clip searches her call to sacramento to run a check on me when i had asked her to simply run a clip search on martha gessler was the warning her journalistic curiosity would lead her further than my requests to places i didnt want her to go the main reference desk was on the second floor i recognized the woman behind the counter though i had never spoken to her before i could tell she recognized me as i approached i used a library card where a police shield used to do she read it and recognized the name do you know that you have the same name as a famous painter she asked yes i know her face flushed she was midthirties with an unattractive hairstyle she wore a name tag that said mrs molloy of course you do she said you must know that how can i help you i need to look for stories that were in the times from about three years ago you want to do a key word search i guess so what is that she smiled we have the los angeles times on computer going back to nineteen eightyseven if what you are looking for was published after that all you have to do is go online on one of our computers type in a key word or phrase like a name for example that you think is in the story and it will search for it there is a fivedollarperhour fee for accessing the newspaper archives fine thats what i want to do she smiled and reached beneath the counter she handed me a white plastic device that was about a foot long it looked like no computer i had ever seen how do i use this she almost laughed its a pager all our computers are being used at the moment i will page you as soon as one becomes available oh the pager doesnt work outside of the building it also does not emit an audible page it vibrates so keep it on your person i will any idea how long it will be we set onehour use limits which right now would mean one wont be available for another thirty minutes however people often dont require the full hour okay thank you ill be nearby i found an empty table in one of the reading rooms and decided to work on the case chronology i got out my notebook and on a fresh page wrote down the three key dates and events i knew angella bentonmurderedmay movie set heistmay martha gesslermissingmarch i then began adding the things i was missing gesslerdorseyphone call and after a few moments i thought of something else that might help explain something that bothered me dorseycrossmurdershooting i looked around to see if anyone was using a cell phone i wanted to make a call but wasnt sure it would be allowed in a library when i turned and looked behind me i saw a man standing by a magazine rack quickly turn away and take a magazine off the display without seeming to look at what it was first he was dressed in blue jeans and a flannel shirt nothing about him said fbi but it still seemed to me that he had been looking directly at me until i had looked at him his reaction had been too quick almost furtive there had been no eye contact nothing that suggested any sort of overture the man clearly didnt want me to know he was watching me putting my notebook away i got up from the table and headed toward the magazine racks i passed the man and noticed that the magazine he had grabbed was called parenting today it was another strike against him he didnt look like the parenting type to me i was pretty sure i was being watched back at the reference desk i put my hands on the counter and leaned over to whisper to mrs molloy can i ask you a question is it okay to use a cell phone in the library no its not is somebody bothering you by using a phone no i was just wondering what the rule was thank you before i could turn away she said she was just about to page me because a computer was now available i gave her back the pager and she led me to a cubicle where the glowing screen of a computer was waiting good luck she said as she headed back to the desk excuse me i said beckoning her back um i dont know how to get to the times stuff on this theres an icon on the desktop i turned back around and scanned the desk there was nothing on it but the computer and the keyboard and the mouse the librarian started to laugh behind me but then covered her mouth with her hand im sorry she said its just you dont know the first thing about how to do this do you or the second or the third can you just help get me started hold on let me just go check the front desk and make sure there is no one waiting for me fine thank you she was gone thirty seconds and then came back and leaned over me to work the mouse and click through screens until she was inside the times archives and at what she called the key word search template so now you type in the key word for the story you are looking for i nodded that i understood that much and typed in the name alejandro penjeda mrs molloy reached across and hit the enter key and the search began in about five seconds i had the results on the screen there were five hits the first two were from and and the final three were all from i dismissed the first two as being unrelated to the penjeda i was interested in the next three were all from march i moved the mouse to the first onemarch and clicked on the read button the story filled the top half of the screen it was a short report on the opening of the trial of alejandro penjeda who was charged with the murder of a korean jeweler named kyungwon park the second story was also short and it was the one i wanted it was the verdict story in the penjeda case it was dated march and reported events from the day before i took the notebook out of my pocket and completed that part of the chronology putting the new information in the right time slot angella bentonmurderedmay movie set heistmay gesslerdorseyphone callmarch martha gesslermissingmarch i looked at what i had martha gessler disappeared and presumably was murdered six days after talking to jack dorsey about the currency list anomaly if there isnt anything else im going to go back up front i had forgotten that mrs molloy was still standing behind me i stood up and signaled her to the seat actually this might be faster if you could do it i said i need to do a couple more searches we are not supposed to do the searches you are supposed to be proficient with the computer if you are going to use it i understand i am going to learn but at the moment im not that proficient and these searches are very important she seemed to be wavering on whether to continue to help me i wished id had the small walletsize copy of the private investigators license i had gotten from the state maybe that would have impressed her she leaned backwards to look down the row of cubicles to the front desk to see if anyone was waiting for help the parenting today guy was milling about trying to act as though he was either waiting for someone or waiting for help ill come back after i ask this gentleman if he needs help mrs molloy said she walked off without waiting for a response from me i watched as she asked parenting today if he needed something and he shook his head and then glanced back at me before walking off mrs molloy then came back down the aisle to me she took the seat in front of the computer what is the next search she moved the mouse smoothly and quickly and got back to the key word template try john dorsey i said and to narrow it down can you also add nats bar she typed in the information and started the search it came back with thirteen hits and i asked her to bring up the first one it was dated april and reported events from the day before one cop dead one hurt in hollywood bar shooting by keisha russell times staff writer two los angeles police detectives on a lunch break and a bartender were gunned down in a hollywood bar yesterday when a man entered the establishment and attempted to rob it at gunpoint the pm shooting at nats on cherokee avenue left detective john h dorsey dead of multiple gunshot wounds and his partner lawton cross jr in critical condition with head and neck wounds donald rice a bartender working in the lounge was shot multiple times and also died at the scene the suspect who wore a black ski mask escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash from the cash register said lt james macy of the officer involved shooting unit it appears this was about a few hundred dollars at most macy said at a press conference staged outside of the bar where the shooting took place we can find no reason for this guy to have started shooting macy went on to say that it was unclear whether dorsey and cross had attempted to stop the robbery thereby causing the shooting to start he said both detectives were shot while sitting in a booth in the dimly lit bar area neither had drawn his weapon the detectives had been conducting an interview in a business near nats bar when they decided to take a lunch break in the bar according to macy there was no indication that either man had been consuming alcohol in the bar they went there as a matter of convenience macy said it was the unluckiest decision they could have made no other patrons or employees were in the bar at the time of the incident a person who was not in the bar saw the gunman fleeing after the shooting and was able to provide police with a limited description of the suspect as a safety precaution the witness was not identified by police i stopped reading to ask the librarian if i could simply print the story out its fifty cents a page she said cash only okay do it she hit the print command and then leaned backwards in her seat to see if she could see down the aisle to the reference desk standing i could see it better youre still clear can you do one more for me if we hurry what is it i raced through my memory banks trying to come up with a name that would work for what i wanted to do next how about the word terrorism are you kidding me do you know how many stories that words been used in during the last two years right right what am i thinking lets cut it down the search words dont have to be connected like in a sentence right no listen i need to get back to my okay okay how about the words fbi and suspected terrorist plus al qaeda and cell spelled with a c could you try that that will probably break the bank too she typed in the information and we waited and then the computer reported that there were hits all but six of them since september beneath this number the computer printed out the headline of each story the screen displayed the first of fortytwo pages of headline listings youre going to have to look through this yourself mrs molloy said i need to go back to my post now i had started the last search almost as a joke my assumption was that parenting today would either interview mrs molloy after i left or send another agent while he continued the tail i wanted to add a terrorism angle to my search just so they would have something to puzzle over now i realized i might be able to find out about what the bureau was doing okay i said thats fine thanks for all of your help remember we close the library at nine this evening that gives you about twentyfive more minutes okay thanks where did that printout go by the way the printer is at the front desk anything you print will come out there you come to me and pay for it and i give it to you a welloiled machine she didnt answer she walked off and left me alone with the computer i took a look around and didnt see parenting today anywhere i then dropped back down into the cubicle and began scrolling through the story list i clicked on a few and started to read them but stopped each time i discerned that the story had not even a remote connection to los angeles i realized i should have included los angeles in the key word search i stood up to see if mrs molloy was at the front desk but she was not there the front desk was abandoned i went back to the computer and on the third page of the story list a headline caught my eye terrorism money man captured at border crossing i clicked the read button and pulled up the entire story the box above the body of the story said it had been published a month earlier on page a of the newspaper it was accompanied by a mugshot of a man with deeply tanned skin and wavy blond hair by josh meyer times staff writer a suspected money courier for supporters of global terrorism was arrested yesterday as he attempted to cross the mexican border at calexico with a satchel of cash the justice department reported mousouwa aziz who has been on the fbis terrorist watch list for four years was apprehended by border patrol agents as he attempted to cross from the united states into mexico aziz who the fbi claims has ties to a philippine cell of al qaeda terrorists was carrying a large quantity of us currency in a satchel found hidden under the seat of the car he was attempting to drive across the border aziz who was alone in the car was arrested without a struggle he was being held in an unknown location under federal guidelines as an enemy combatant agents said aziz had attempted to disguise himself by dyeing his hair blond and shaving the beard he had been known to wear this is a significant arrest said abraham klein an assistant us attorney in the los angeles antiterrorism unit our efforts around the world have been geared toward cutting off funding for terrorists this suspected terrorist is believed to be a person intimately involved in financing terrorist activities here and abroad klein and other sources said aziz could be a key figure in efforts to stop the movement of moneythe lifeblood of longterm terrorism activityto those targeting american interests not only did we take away a good chunk of cash with this arrest but perhaps more importantly we took a person who was in the business of delivering money to terrorists out of circulation said a justice source who spoke on the condition he would not be identified aziz is a jordanian national who attended high school in cleveland ohio and speaks fluent english the justice source said he had a passport and an alabama drivers license in his possession that both identified him as frank aiello azizs name was placed on an fbi watch list four years ago after information was developed that connected him to money deliveries made to terrorists involved in the bombings of us embassies in africa aziz was nicknamed mouse by federal agents because of his small stature ability to stay hidden from authorities in recent months and the difficulty agents had in pronouncing his first name after the terrorist attacks of september a higher alert status was issued in regard to aziz though sources said there was no evidence directly linking aziz to the terrorists who carried out those suicide attacks this guy is a money man the justice source said his job is to move money from point a to point b the money is then used to buy materials to make bombs and weapons to support the lifestyles of terrorists while they plan and carry out their operations it was unclear why aziz was apparently attempting to take us currency out of the country the us dollar is good anywhere klein said in fact it is stronger than the currency in most of the countries where these terrorist cells exist the us dollar goes a lot further it could be that this suspect was taking the money to the philippines to simply help pay for an operation klein also suggested that money could have been headed for terrorists planning to infiltrate the united states klein refused to say how much money aziz was transporting or where it came from in recent months federal investigators have suggested that a large source of financing of terrorists has come from illegal activities within the united states for example the fbi linked an arizona drug operation last year to a terrorist financing network federal sources also told the times last year that it was believed that desolate areas of mexico might be the location of terrorist training camps linked to al qaeda klein refused to comment yesterday on the possibility that aziz might have been headed to such a camp i sat there staring at the screen for a long moment wondering if i had just stumbled onto something more significant than a way to take a jab at the feds i wondered if what i had just read could in some way be connected to my own investigation could the agents on the ninth floor in westwood have connected the movie money to this terrorist my thoughts were broken by a loudspeaker announcement that the library was closing in fifteen minutes i clicked on the print button for the story and went back to the story list i scrolled through the headlines looking for followups to the aziz arrest i found only one which was published two days after the first story i called it up and found it to be only a short it said that an arraignment for aziz was postponed indefinitely while he was continuing to be debriefed by federal agents the tone of the article indicated that aziz was cooperating with investigators though it did not specifically or clearly say that the story said that changes in federal laws enacted after the september attacks gave federal authorities wide leeway in holding suspected terrorists as enemy combatants the rest of the story was background information already contained in the first story i went back to the list and continued to scroll through the headlines it took nearly ten minutes but i never found another story about mousouwa aziz the loudspeaker announced that the library was closing i looked around and saw mrs molloy back at the front desk she was putting things away in the drawers getting ready to go home i decided that i now didnt want parenting today to know what i had been looking up on the computer at least not right away so i stayed in the cubicle until after the next announcement that the library was closed i stayed until mrs molloy came to the cubicle and told me i had to leave she had my printouts i paid her then folded the printouts and put them in my coat pocket with my notebook i thanked her and left the reference room on my way out i pretended that i was studying the mosaics and architecture of the building turning several times in complete circles in the rotunda as i watched for the tail man i never saw him and began to wonder if i was being overly paranoid it looked like i was the last to leave through the public exit i thought about finding the employee exit and waiting for mrs molloy to come out so i could ask her if she had been questioned about me and my research requests but i thought maybe i would only end up scaring her and let it go alone as i walked through the third level of the garage toward my car i felt the faint chill of fear move down my spine whether i was being tailed or not i had successfully spooked myself i picked up my pace and was almost trotting by the time i got to the door of the mercedes paranoia is not always a bad thing it can help you keep an edge and sometimes an edge is the difference from the library i headed over to broadway and then toward the civic center it might seem normal enough an excop heading toward the police department nothing unusual about that but as i got to the los angeles times complex i yanked the wheel hard left without using the brakes or a turn signal and sliced through oncoming traffic into the third street tunnel i pinned the accelerator and the mercedes responded the front end rising like a boat as it picked up speed and roared through the threeblock tunnel as often as i could i checked the rearview mirror for a follower the tiles on the rounded walls of the tunnel carried headlights like halos filmmakers rent it from the city all the time for that reason any car trying to keep pace with me would be advertising unless the lights were turned off and that would be just as obvious in the mirror i was smiling im not sure why having a possible fbi tail isnt necessarily something to be happy about and the fbi is generally humorless about it as well but i felt all at once that i had made the right move with the mercedes the car was flying i was up highhigher than in any police car i had ever been inso i had a good view in the mirror it was as if i had planned for this and the plan was working and that brought the smile as i came out of the tunnel i hit the brakes and took a hard right the thick tires held the pavement and when i was clear of the mouth of the tunnel i stopped completely i waited my eyes on the mirror of the cars that came out of the tunnel none turned right behind me and none even braked as they went through the intersection if i had a tail i had either lost it or the follower was proficient enough at the game to be willing to lose the target in order to avoid obvious exposure the latter didnt fit with the way parenting today had been so obvious in the library the third possibility i had to now consider was electronic surveillance the bureau could have easily tricked my car at almost any point during the day in the garage at the library a tech could have slid under and wired it the same tech could have been waiting for me to show up at the federal building as well this of course would mean that they already knew of my ride about town with roy lindell i was tempted to call the agent and warn him but decided that i shouldnt use my cell phone to contact him i shook my head maybe paranoia was not such a good thing after all it can help you keep an edge but it can also paralyze you i pulled back into traffic and worked my way over to the hollywood freeway i kept my eyes off the rear view as much as possible the freeway is elevated as it cuts through hollywood and into the cahuenga pass it offers a good view of the place where i spent the most significant part of my time as a cop with just glancing looks i could pick out some of the buildings where i had worked cases the capitol records building designed to resemble a stack of records the usher hotel now being renovated as luxury apartments as part of the hollywood corearea redesign and development i could see the lighted homes rising up on the dark hillsides in beechwood canyon and whitley heights i could see the tenstory image of a local basketball legend on the side of an otherwise nondescript office building smaller in stature but still covering the side of a building was a marlboro man with a drooping cigarette in his mouth his steely coolness replaced by a symbol of impotence hollywood was always best viewed at night it could only hold its mystique in darkness in sunlight the curtain comes up and the intrigue is gone replaced by a sense of hidden danger it was a place of takers and users of broken sidewalks and dreams you build a city in the desert water it with false hopes and false idols and eventually this is what happens the desert reclaims it turns it arid leaves it barren human tumbleweeds drift across its streets predators hide in the rocks i took the mulholland exit and crossed over the freeway then at the split took woodrow wilson on up the side of the mountain my house was dark the only light i saw when i came through the carport door was the red glow from the answering machine on the kitchen counter i hit a light switch and then pushed the playback button on the phone there were two messages the first was from kiz rider and she had already told me about that the second was from lawton cross he had held back on me once again he said he had something his voice croaking into the phone like static i pictured his wife holding the phone to his mouth the message had been left two hours before it was getting late but i called back the man lived in a chair what was late to him i had no idea danny cross answered she must have had caller id on the phone because her hello was clipped and carried an edge of malice in it or was i reading too much into it danny its harry im returning your husbands call hes asleep can you wake him please it sounded important i can tell you what he wanted to tell you okay he wanted to tell you that when he was working he used to keep copies of his active files he kept them here in the home office i didnt recall seeing an office in the house full copies i dont know he had a filing cabinet and it was full had his sitting room is where the office was i had to move everything out its all in the garage now i realized i needed to stop the flow of information from her too much had already been said on the phone paranoia was raising its ugly head again im coming out tonight i said no its too late im going to bed soon ill be there in half an hour danny wait up for me i hung the phone up before she could further dispute my intentions without having gone further into the house than the kitchen i turned and left this time leaving the light on a light rain had begun to fall in the valley oil beaded on the freeway and slowed everybody down i used all of the half hour and more to get to the house on melba and shortly after i pulled into the driveway the garage door started to go up danny cross had been watching for me i got out of the mercedes and entered the garage it was a twocar garage and it was cluttered with stacked boxes and furniture there was an old chevy malibu with its hood sprung like somebody had been working on the engine and had just lowered the lid without latching it while taking a break i think i remembered something about lawton cross driving a s muscle car as a private vehicle but there was a thick layer of dust on the car and boxes stacked on its roof one thing for sure was that he was never going to work on it or drive it again a door that connected to the house opened and danny stood there in a long bathrobe with a belt knotted tightly around her thin waist she had the same look of disapproval she always had on her face and that i had become quite used to it was too bad she was a beautiful woman or had been at least danny i said nodding i wont be long if you can just point me in its all over there next to the washing machine the file cabinets she pointed to a spot in front of the malibu where there was a laundry alcove i walked around the car and found two doubledrawer file cabinets standing next to the stacked washer and dryer they were keylock cabinets but the locks had been punched out on each lawton had probably picked them up used at a yard sale there was no exterior labeling on the four drawers that could help me with my search so i bent down and opened the first drawer on the left it contained no files rather it held what looked like the contents of a top of a desk there was a rolodex file its phone cards yellowed a standup photo frame featuring danny and lawton cross at some happier moment and doubledecked in and out trays the only thing in the tray marked in was a folded map of griffith park the next drawer contained crosss files i thumbed through the tabs looking at the names and hoping for connections to what i was working nothing i went to the top drawer of the second cabinet and found more files finally i found a file marked eidolon productions i pulled it and put it on top of the cabinet i went back to thumbing through the files knowing that often cases expanded into many folders i came across a file marked antonio markwell and remembered the case because it had played hotly in the media about five or six years earlier markwell was a nineyearold boy who disappeared from his backyard in chatsworth rhd worked the case with the fbi it lasted a week until they found a suspecta pedophile with a motor home he led lawton cross and his partner jack dorsey to the boys body in griffith park it had been buried up near the caves in bronson canyon they would have never found it if they hadnt turned the killer there were too many places to hide a body in those hills it had been a big case the kind that made your name in the department i imagined that both cross and dorsey thought that they were golden after that they had no idea what the future was holding for them i closed the drawer there were no other files that seemed connected to my investigation the bottom drawer the last one was empty i took the file i had pulled over to the malibu i put the file down on the hood and opened it i should have just put it under my arm and left with it but i was excited i was anticipating something a new lead maybe a break i wanted to see what lawton cross had kept in the file as soon as i opened it i knew the file was incomplete cross had copied some of the working documents of the case for use at home or on the road the basic case reports were missing there were no reports that specifically related to the investigation of the murder of angella benton the file mostly contained reports relating to the movie set robbery and shootout there were witness reportsincluding my ownand forensic reports there was a dna comparison between the blood found in the stolen movie van and the semen found on angella bentons body no match there were interview summaries and a time and location spread sheeta document on which the locations of various players in the case are charted at different times important to the case these t ampl reports were also known as alibi sheets it was a way of sifting through multiple players in a case and possibly coming up with a suspect i quickly went through the pages of this report and determined that cross and dorsey had been charting eleven different people and not all of the names were familiar to me the t ampl report was a good find i put the document to the side because i would put it at the top of the stack in the file when i was finished my review i moved on and had just picked up a copy of the currency report which contained the serial numbers taken at random from the stolen money when i heard dannys voice behind me she had remained in the doorway to the house watching me and i hadnt realized it find what you were looking for i turned and looked back at her the first thing i noticed was that the belt of her robe was untied and the robe had fallen open to reveal the light blue nightgown beneath uh yes its here i was just taking a quick look i can go now if you want whats your hurry lawton is still asleep he wont wake up until the morning she held my eyes as she said the last line i was trying to read what was said and what was meant before i could respond the moment was broken by the sound and the lights of a car pulling quickly into the driveway i turned and saw a standard government cara crown victoriapulling into the light from the open garage two men were in the car and i recognized the one in the passenger seat with as little noticeable movement as i could manage i lowered the currency report onto the t ampl report i then picked them both up and slid them into the crack between the malibu s hood and fender i heard the pages fall through the slot into the engine compartment i then stepped back from the car leaving the rest of the file open on the hood and around into the open bay of the garage a second crown vic pulled into the driveway the two men from the first car were already out and entering the garage fbi said the man i recognized as parenting today he held up an id case with a badge affixed to it he just as quickly closed it and put it away how are the kids i asked he seemed confused for a moment and it put a pause in his step but then he pressed on and took a position in front of me while his partner who had not shown a badge stood a few feet to my right mr bosch we are going to need you to come with us said parenting today well im kind of busy at the moment im trying to get this garage in shape the agent looked over my shoulder at danny cross maam could you return inside and close the door well be out of your hair in a few moments this is my garage my house danny responded i knew her protest was useless but i liked that shed made it just the same maam this is fbi business it does not concern you please step inside if it is in my garage it concerns me maam i wont ask you again there was a pause i kept my eyes on the agent i heard the door close behind me and knew my witness was gone in the same moment the agent to my right made his move he raised both hands and charged me pushing me into the side of the malibu my elbow slid across the roof and hit a box sending it over the other side of the car and crashing to the floor it sounded like it had glassware in it the agent was well practiced and i offered no resistance i knew that would be a mistake that would be what he wanted he roughly pushed my chest against the car and pulled my arms behind my back i felt the handcuffs cinch tightly around my wrists then his hands patted me down for weapons and invaded my pockets in a routine search what are you doing what is going on it was danny she had heard the crash maam parenting today said sternly go back inside and close the door the other agent twirled me away from the car and pushed me out of the garage toward the second car i looked back at danny cross just as she was closing the door the look of disapproval i was so used to was gone there was a look of concern on her face now i also saw that her bathrobe had been retied the silent agent opened the back door of the second car and started pushing me in watch your head he said just as he put his hand on my neck and pushed my head sharply into the door frame i went sprawling across the backseat he slammed the door narrowly missing my ankle with it i could almost hear a groan of disappointment from him through the glass he knocked his fist on the roof of the car and the driver dropped the transmission into reverse and hit the gas the car jerked backwards and the sudden motion threw me off the seat onto the floor i was unable to break my fall and the side of my face hit hard on the sticky floor with my hands behind me i struggled to push myself back onto the seat but i did it quickly my struggle fueled by my anger and embarrassment i sat up as the car jerked forward and i was thrown back into the seat the car sped away from the house and through the rear window i saw parenting today standing in the garage and staring back at me he held lawton crosss file down at his side i breathed heavily and watched the agent grow small in the window i could feel crud from the floor mat on my face and could do nothing about it my face burned not with pain and no longer with anger and embarrassment it was pure helplessness that burned me now halfway to westwood i stopped talking to them it was useless and i knew it but i had spent twenty minutes hitting them with questions then veiled threats and no matter what i said there was no response when we finally got to the federal building the bureau car was driven down into a subterranean garage and i was pulled out and shoved into an elevator marked security transport only one of the agents put a card key into a slot on the control panel and punched the button as the stainless steel cube rose i thought about how far i had fallen from the badge i had no juice with these men they were agents and i was nothing they could do with me what they wanted and we all knew it i cant feel my fingers i said the cuffs are too tight thats nice one of the agents said his first words of the evening to me the doors opened and each one of them took an arm and pushed me into the hallway we came to a door one of them opened with the card key then we went down a hallway to another door this one with a combination lock turn away an agent said what turn away from the door i followed instructions and was turned away when the other agent tapped in the combination we then went through and i was led into a dimly lit hallway of doors with small square windows head high at first i thought they were interview rooms but then i realized there were too many these were cells i turned my head to look through some of the windows as we passed and through two of them i saw men looking back out at me they were dark skinned and of middle eastern descent they wore unkempt beards through a third window i saw a short man looking out his eyes barely at the bottom level of the small window he had bleached blond hair that had a quarter inch of black at its roots i recognized him from the photo i had seen on the computer at the library mousouwa aziz we stopped in front of a door marked and it was popped open electronically by some unseen hand one of the agents stepped behind me and i heard him working a key into the handcuffs i was beyond being able to feel it soon my wrists were free and i brought my hands around so that i could rub them and get the circulation going again they were as white as soap and a deep red welt ran around the circumference of each wrist i had always believed that cuffing a suspect too tightly was a bullshit thing to do same with hitting a custodys head on the frame of the car door easy to do easy to get away with but always a bullshit move a bullys move the kind of thing a boy who enjoyed teasing the younger kids in the schoolyard would grow up to do as the tingling feeling started to work its way into my hands a burning sense of anger started building behind my eyes edging my vision with a velvet blackness in that darkness was a voice urging me to retaliate i managed to ignore it its all about power and when to use it these guys didnt know that yet a hand pushed me toward the cell and i involuntarily braced myself i didnt want to go in there then a sharp kick hit me behind my left knee and my leg buckled and i was hurled forward with a stiffarm shove from behind i crossed the small square cell to the opposite wall and put my hands up to stop my forward momentum make yourself at home asshole the agent said to my back the door was slammed before i could get back to it i stood there looking at the square of glass realizing that the other prisoners i had seen in the hallway had been looking at themselves the glass was mirrored instinctively i knew the agent that had kicked and shoved me was on the other side looking at me i nodded to him sending the message that i would not forget him he was probably on the other side laughing back at me the light in the room stayed on i eventually stepped away from the door and looked around there was a oneinchthick mattress on a shelflike outcropping from the wall built into the opposite wall was a sinkandtoilet combination there was nothing else except a steel box in one of the upper corners with a twoinchsquare window behind which i could see a camera lens i was being watched even if i used the toilet i was being watched i checked my watch but there was no watch they had somehow taken it probably when they took off the cuffs and my wrists were so numb i could not feel the theft i spent what i thought was the first hour of my incarceration pacing in the small space and trying to keep my anger sharp but controlled i walked without pattern other than that i used the entire space and when i came to the corner where the camera was located i raised the middle finger of my left hand to the lens every time in the second hour i sat on the mattress determined not to exhaust myself with the pacing and trying to keep track of time on occasion i still gave the camera my finger usually without even bothering to look up while i delivered it i started thinking about interview room stories to pass the time i remembered one about a guy we had brought in as a suspect in a double bagger involving a drug ripoff our plan was to sweat him a little before we went into the room and tried to break him down but soon after being placed in the room he took his pants off tied the legs around his neck and tried to hang himself from the overhead light fixture they got to him in time and the man was saved he protested that he would rather kill himself than spend another hour in the room he had only been in there twenty minutes i started laughing to myself and then remembered another story one that wasnt so funny a man who was a peripheral witness to a strongarm robbery was brought into the box and questioned about what he saw it was late on a friday he was an illegal and he was scared shitless but he wasnt a suspect and it would mean too many phone calls and too much paperwork to send him back to mexico all that the detective wanted was his information but before he got it the detective was called out of the interview room he told the man to sit tight that hed be back only he never came back breaking events on the case took him out into the field and soon he forgot about the witness on sunday morning another detective who had come in to try to catch up on his paperwork heard a knocking sound and opened the interview room door to find the witness still there he had taken empty coffee cups out of the trash can and filled them with urine during the weekend but as instructed he had never left the unlocked interview room remembering that one made me feel morose after a while i took off my jacket and lay back on the mattress i put the jacket over my face to try to block out the light i tried to give the impression i was sleeping that i didnt care what they were doing to me but i wasnt sleeping and they probably knew it id seen it all before when i had been on the other side of the glass finally i tried to concentrate on the case running all of the latest occurrences through my head trying to see how they fit why had the bureau stepped in because i was getting a copy of lawton crosss file it seemed unlikely i decided that i had struck the nerve in the library when i had looked up the reports on mousouwa aziz they had talked to the librarian or checked the computernew laws allowed them to that was what brought them out that was what they wanted to know about after what i estimated to be about four hours in the cube the door snapped open with an electronic release i pulled the jacket off my face and sat up just as an agent i had not seen before stepped in he was carrying a file and a cup of coffee the agent i knew as parenting today stood behind him with a steel chair dont get up the first agent said i stood up anyway what the hell is i said dont get up you sit back down or im out of here and well try again tomorrow i hesitated a moment holding my pose as an angry man and then sat down on the mattress parenting today put the chair down just inside the door and then stepped out of the cell and closed the door the remaining agent sat down and lowered his steaming coffee to the floor the smell of it filled the room im special agent john peoples with the federal bureau of investigation good for you what am i doing here you are here because you do not listen he brought his eyes to mine to make sure i was doing what he just said i do not do he was my age maybe a little older he had all of his hair and it was a little too long for the bureau i guessed that it wasnt a style choice he was just too busy to get it properly cut his eyes were the thing every face has a magnetic feature the thing that draws you in a nose a scar a cleft chin with peoples everything was drawn to the eyes they were deeply set and dark they were worried they carried a secret burden you were told to stand down mr bosch he said you were told rather explicitly to leave things alone and yet here we are can you answer a question i can try if its not classified is my watch classified wheres my watch it was given to me when i retired and i want it back mr bosch forget about your watch for now i am trying to get something through that thick skull of yours but you dont want it to get through do you he reached down for his coffee and took a sip he grimaced as he burned his mouth he put the cup back down on the floor more important things are at work here than your private investigation and your hundreddollar retirement watch i put a look of surprise on my face you really think thats all they spent on me after all those years peoples frowned and shook his head you are not helping yourself here mr bosch you are compromising an investigation that is vitally significant to this country and here all you want to do is show how clever you are this is the national security rap right it is isnt it well special agent peoples you can hang on to it for next time i dont consider a murder investigation to be unimportant there are no compromises when it comes to murder peoples stood up and stepped toward me until he was looking directly down at me he leaned over the bed putting his hand against the wall for support hieronymus bosch he yelled actually pronouncing it correctly you are trespassing you are driving the wrong way down a oneway street do you understand he then turned and went back to his chair i almost laughed at the theatrics and for a moment thought that he did not realize that i had spent twentyfive years working in rooms like these am i getting through to you at all peoples said his voice calm once again you are not a cop you carry no badge you have no provenance no case you have no standing it used to be a free country that used to be enough standing its not the same country it used to be things have changed he proffered the file held in his hand the murder of this woman is important of course it is but there are other things at play here more important matters you must step back from it mr bosch this is the final warning stand down or we will stand you down and you wont like it i bet ill end up back here right with mouse and the others the other enemy combatants isnt that what you call them does anyone even know about this place agent peoples anyone outside your own little bam squad he seemed momentarily taken aback by my knowledge and use of the term i recognized mouse when they brought me in i was window shopping and from that you think you know what goes on here youre working the guy its obvious and thats fine but what if hes the one who killed angella benton what if he killed the bank security man and what if he killed an fbi agent too dont you care about what happened to martha gessler she was one of your own has the world changed that much is a special agent no longer special under these new rules of yours or does the line change according to convenience am i an enemy combatant agent peoples i could see it hurt my words opened an old wound if not an old debate but then a resolve came across his face he opened the file in his hands and took out the printout i had made at the library i could see the mugshot of aziz how did you know about this how did you make this connection you people what are you talking about no one here would tell you they didnt have to i saw your man tailing me in the library make a note of thathes not that good tell him to try sports illustrated next time i knew something was up so i ran a search through the newspaper files and came up with that i printed it out because i knew it might flush you people out and it did your kind are very predictable anyway then i saw mouse when they were walking me down the hall and i sort of put things together money from my robbery was under the seat of his car when you arrested him but you dont care about that or the two and maybe three murders attached to it you just want to know where that money was going and you dont want a little thing like justice for the dead to get in the way of that peoples slowly slid the printout back into the file i could see his face changing growing darker around the eyes i had stuck my words directly into a nerve you have no idea what the world is like out there or what we are doing about it in here he said you can sit here and be smug and talk about your ideas of justice but you have no fucking idea what is out there my response to that was a smile my words came readily you can save that speech for the politicians who change the rules for you until there are no rules anymore until something like justice for a murdered and violated woman adds up to nothing in the equation thats whats going on out there peoples leaned forward he was about to spill and he wanted to make damn sure i got it do you know where aziz was going with that money we dont know but i can tell you where i think he was going with it to a training camp a terrorist training camp and im not talking about in afghanistan im talking about within a hundred miles of our border a place where they train people to kill us in our buildings in our planes in our sleep to come across that line and kill us with blind disregard for who we are and what we believe are you going to tell me that im wrong that we should not do everything we can to find such a place if it exists that we should not take whatever measures are necessary with that man to get the information we need from him i leaned back across the mattress until my back was against the wall if id had a cup of coffee i wouldnt have ignored it the way he was ignoring his im not telling you anything i said everybodys got to do what theyve got to do wonderful he said sarcastically words of wisdom im going to get a wall plaque for my office and put that right on it you know i was in a trial once and the lawyer on the other side said something i always try to remember she quoted a philosopher whose name i dont recall offhandive got it written down at the house but this guy said that whoever is out there fighting the monsters of our society should make damn sure that they dont become monsters themselves see because then all is lost then we dont have a society i always thought that was a good line nietzsche and you almost got the quote right getting the quote right isnt what matters its remembering what it means peoples reached into the pocket of his coat he pulled out my watch he threw it to me and i started putting it on i looked at the face the hands of the clock were set against a gold detectives badge with the city hall on it i noted the time and saw that i had been in the cube longer than i had thought it was almost dawn get out of here bosch he said if you cross our field of vision on this again you will find yourself back here faster than youd think was possible and no one will know you are here the threat was obvious ill be among the disappeared then huh whatever you want to call it peoples raised his hand over his head so the camera would see it he twirled a finger in the air and the electronic lock on the door clacked and the door opened a few inches i stood up go peoples said somebody will see you out im cutting you a break here bosch remember that i headed toward the door but hesitated when i was passing him i looked down at him and the file he still clutched i assume you cleaned me out took my files lawton crosss too you wont be getting it back right i understand national security what i was going to say is look through the photos find one of the photos of angella on the tile look at her hands man i headed toward the open door what about her hands he called after me just look at her hands the way we found them youll know what im talking about then in the hallway parenting today was waiting for me this way he said curtly and i could tell he was disappointed that i was being cut loose on the way up the hallway i looked for mousouwa aziz in one of the square windows but didnt see him i wondered if by chance i had looked into the face of the killer i was looking for and that it would be my only glimpse that i would get no closer i knew that as long as he was in here i would never get to him literally or legally he was gone from me he was among the disappeared the ultimate dead end we went out through two electronic doors and then i was delivered to an elevator alcove there was no button for me to push parenting today looked up at a camera in the corner of the ceiling and rolled an extended finger in the air i heard the elevator start coming when the doors opened he escorted me on we went down to the basement but not to a car he walked me up the ramp after yelling to a garage man to open the rollup door as the door went up i was hit with sunlight and had to squint i take it you arent giving me a ride back to my car you can take it any way you want to have a good day he left me there at the top of the ramp and turned around to get under the door before it reclosed on him i watched him disappear as the steel curtain dropped i tried to think of a clever line to throw at him but i was too damn tired and let it go the bureau had been in my house that was expected but the agents had been subtle about it the place hadnt been torn apart and left for me to put back together it had been methodically searched and most things had been left exactly in place the dining room table where i had left the spread of files relating to angella bentons murder had been cleared it looked like they might have even polished the empty surface with pledge when they were through i had been left nothing my notes my files my reports were all gone and so it seemed was the case i didnt dwell on it i looked at my murky reflection in the polished surface of the table for a few moments and decided i needed to sleep before making my next move i grabbed a bottle of water out of the refrigerator and went out through the slider to the back deck to watch the sun come up over the hills the cushion on the lounge chair had morning dew on it so i flipped it over and sat down i put my legs up and leaned back into the soft comfort there was a slight chill in the air but i still had my jacket on i put the water bottle on the arm of the chair and tucked my hands into the pockets of the jacket it felt good to be home after the night in the cube the sun was just cresting the hills on the other side of the cahuenga pass the sky was filled with diffused light as its rays refracted off the billions of microscopic particles that hung in the air soon i would need sunglasses but i was too dug in to get up to get them i closed my eyes instead and soon fell asleep i dreamt of angella benton of her hands of a woman i never knew in life but who came alive in my dreams and reached out to me i woke up a couple hours later with the sun burning through my eyelids soon i realized that the pounding i had thought was in my head was actually coming from the front door i got up knocking the unopened water bottle off the arm of the lounge chair i made a grab for it but missed it rolled off the deck and down into the brush below i walked to the rail and looked down steel pylons held my house cantilevered over the canyon i could not see the bottle down there whoever it was out front knocked again and then i heard a muffled version of my name i went in off the deck and crossed the living room to the front hallway he was pounding on the door again when i finally opened it it was roy lindell and he wasnt smiling rise and shine bosch he started to push by me into the house but i put my hand on his chest and pushed him backwards i shook my head and he picked up the vibe he pointed in the house and put a question mark in his eyes i nodded and stepped out through the door pulling it closed behind me lets take my car he said in a low voice good cause mines in woodland hills his bureau car was parked illegally at the front curb we got in and headed up woodrow wilson to the curve that took it around toward mulholland i didnt think he was taking me anywhere we were just driving what happened to you he asked i heard through the grapevine you got picked up last night thats right by your bam squad they put the bam on me you could say lindell looked over at me and then back at the road you dont look the worse for wear you even got some color in your cheeks thanks for noticing roy now what do you want you think theyve got your house bugged probly i havent had time to check what do you want where are we going though i guessed i knew mulholland wound around the hill to an overlook with views depending on the smog ratio from the santa monica bay to the spires of downtown as expected lindell pulled into the small parking lot and stopped next to a volkswagen van three decades out of place the smog was heavy for the most part the view dropped off just past the capital records building get to the point huh lindell said turning in his seat toward me okay ill get to it whats going on with the investigation i looked at him for a long moment trying to gauge whether he had turned up because of marty gessler or as a followup from special agent peoples as a test to determine if i was out of it sure lindell and peoples were different animals from different floors of the federal building but they both carried the same badge and there was no telling what kind of pressure had been brought to bear on lindell whats going on is that there is no investigation what are you fucking me no im not fucking you you could say i see the light i was made to see it then what are you going to do just drop it thats right im going to get my car and go on vacation vegas i think i got a start on the sunburn this morning i might as well go lose my money too lindell smiled like he was clever fuck you he said i know what youre doing you think ive been sent out to test you huh well fuck you thats nice roy can you take me back now i need to pack a bag not until you tell me what is really going on i cracked the door okay i can walk i need the exercise i got out and started walking toward mulholland lindell threw open his door hitting the side of the old van he came hurrying after me listen bosch listen to me he caught up to me and stood in front of me very close forcing me to stop he put his hands into fists and held them up in front of his chest as if he was trying to break apart a chain that was binding him harry im here for me nobody sent me okay do not drop this those guys down there they were probably just throwing you a scare thats all tell that to the people theyve been holding in there i dont feel like disappearing roy you know what i mean bullshit youve never been the kind of guy who would hey asshole i turned around at the sound of the voice and saw two men piling out of the sliding door of the volkswagen van they were bearded longhairs who looked like they belonged on harleys not in a hippie van you dented the shit out of the door the second one yelled how the fuck can you tell lindell shot back here we go i thought i looked past the approaching behemoths and could see a fourinch crease in the front passenger door of the volkswagen lindells door was still open and in contact with it the obvious culprit you think its a joke said the first heavy how about if we put a dent in your face lindell reached behind his back and in one swift move his hand came out from under his jacket with a pistol with his free hand he reached forward and grabbed the first heavy by the front of his shirt and pulled him forward taking a handful of beard in the process the gun came up and the barrel was pressed into the taller mans throat how bout you and david crosby get back in that piece of shit and flower power your way the fuck out of here roy i said easy the smell of marijuana was just now reaching us from the van there was a long moment of silence while lindell held eyes with the first heavy the second stood nearby watching but unable to make a move because of the gun okay man the first one finally said everythings cool well just back on out of here lindell shoved him away and dropped the gun down to his side yeah you do that tiny back on out go smoke the peace pipe somewhere else we watched silently while they went back to the van the second man angrily slamming lindells door so he could get into the front passenger seat of the van the engine started and the van backed out and pulled out onto mulholland the requisite hand gestures were offered from both driver and passenger and then they were gone i thought about myself just a few hours earlier giving the same salute to the camera in the cube i knew how helpless the two men in the van felt lindell turned his attention back to me that was good roy i said to him with skills like that im surprised they didnt tap you for a ninthfloor gig fuck those guys yeah thats the way i was feeling a few hours ago so then whats it going to be bosch he had just pulled a gun on two strangers in a nearviolent collision of hightestosterone levels and already the tide had subsided the surface was calm the incident was off his radar screen after only one sweep it was a trait that in the past i had most often seen in psychopaths i wanted to give lindell the benefit of the doubt so i chalked it up to the sort of federal arrogance i had also seen before as a genetic trait in bureau men you staying or running he asked that made me angry but i tried not to show it i cracked a smile neither i said im walking i turned and left him there i started walking up mulholland toward woodrow wilson and home he threw a barrage of curses at my back but that didnt slow me down the garage door was open at lawton crosss house and it looked as though it might have been left that way through the night i had the cab drop me off in the street next to my mercedes it didnt look like the car had been moved though i had to assume it had been searched i had left it unlocked and it still was i put the small bag i had packed and brought with me into the backseat i then got behind the wheel started the engine and pulled the car into the open bay of the garage after i got out i went to the houses door and pushed a button that would either ring a bell inside or close the garage door it closed the door i went over to the chevy slid my hands beneath the hood and felt for the release latch the steel springs yawned loudly as i raised the hood i looked down at a dusty but clean engine with a chrome air filter cowling and fan highlighting a painted red block lawton had obviously babied the car and had appreciated its internal as well as exterior beauty the documents from the investigative file that i had slipped beneath the hood the night before had survived the fbi search they had fallen and been cradled by the web of spark plug wires on the left side of the block as i gathered them i noticed that the cars battery had been disconnected and i wondered when this had been done it was a smart thing to do with a car that was not going to be used for a while lawton probably would have thought of doing it but would not have been able to actually do it maybe he had talked danny through the procedure whats going on what are you doing harry i turned danny cross was in the doorway to the house hello danny i just came back for some things i forgot i also need to use some of laws tools i think somethings wrong with my car i gestured toward the workbench and pegboard that lined the wall next to the malibu an array of tools and automotive equipment was on display she shook her head like i had forgotten to explain the obvious what about last night they took you i saw the handcuffs the agents who stayed said you wouldnt be coming back scare tactics danny thats all that was as you can see im back i closed the hood with one hand leaving it partially sprung in the way i had found it i walked to the mercedes and reached the documents in through the open window to the passenger seat i then thought better about that and opened the door raised the floor mat and put them under it it wasnt a great hiding place but it would do for the moment i closed the door and looked at danny how is law not good whats wrong they were in there with him last night they wouldnt let me in and then they turned off the monitor so i couldnt exactly hear everything but they scared him and they scared me i want you to go harry i want you to go and not come back howd they scare you what did they say she hesitated and i knew that was part of the scare they told you not to talk about it right not to talk to me thats right okay danny i dont want to get you in trouble what about law can i talk to him he said he doesnt want to see you anymore that its caused too much trouble i nodded and looked over at the workbench then let me just get to my car and ill get out of here did they hurt you harry i looked at her i think she really cared about the answer no im all right okay uh danny i need to get something from laws sitting room should i go in or can you get it for me what would be better what is it the clock the clock why you gave it to him i know but i need it back a look of annoyance came across her face i thought maybe the clock had been a point of argument between them and now i was taking it back ill get it but im telling him youre the one taking it off the wall i nodded she went inside the house and i went around the malibu and found a dolly leaning against the workbench i took a pair of pliers and a screwdriver off the pegboard and went back to the mercedes after throwing my jacket into the car i got down on the dolly and slid under the car it took me less than a minute to find the black box a satellite tracker about the size of a hardback book was held to the gas tank with two industrialsize strip magnets there was a twist to the setup i hadnt seen before a wire extended from the box to the exhaust pipe where it was connected to a heat sensor when the pipe heated up the sensor switched on the tracker conserving the units battery when the vehicle wasnt moving the boys on the ninth floor got the good stuff i decided then to leave the box in place and slid out from underneath the car danny was standing there holding the clock she had taken the back off exposing the camera i thought it was too heavy for just a wall clock she said i started getting up look danny you were spying on us you didnt believe me did you danny thats not what i want it for those men that came here last but it is what you put it on that wall for wheres the tape what the tape where did you watch this i didnt its digital its all right there in the clock that was a mistake as i reached for the clock she raised it up over her head and then threw it down to the concrete floor the glass shattered and the camera broke loose from the clock shell and skittered under the mercedes goddamnit danny it isnt mine i dont care whose it is you had no right to do that look law told me you werent treating him right what was i supposed to do just take your word for it i got down on the floor and looked under the car the camera was within reach and i pulled it out the casing was badly scratched but i could not make any judgment about its interior mechanisms i ejected the memory card the way andre biggar had taught me and it looked okay to me i stood up and held it up for danny to see this might be the only thing that keeps those men from coming back you better hope its not damaged i dont care and i hope you really enjoy what you see on it i hope youre very proud of yourself when you watch it i had no response for that dont come back here ever again she turned and went into the house her hand slapping the wall button which brought the garage door up behind me she closed the houses door without looking back at me i waited a moment to see if she would reappear and throw another verbal attack at me but she didnt i pocketed the memory card and then squatted down to gather the pieces of the broken clock at burbank airport i parked in the longterm lot got my bag out and took the tram to the terminal at the southwest counter i used a credit card to buy a roundtrip ticket to las vegas on a flight leaving in less than an hour i kept the return open i then proceeded through the security checkpoint waiting in line like everybody else i put my bag on the conveyor and dropped my watch car keys and the cameras memory card into a plastic bowl so i would not set off the metal detector i realized i had left my cell in the mercedes and then thought just as well they might use it to triangulate my location near the departure gate i stopped and bought a tendollar phone card and took it to a nearby bank of pay phones i read the instructions on the phone card twice not because they were complicated but because i was hesitant finally i picked up the receiver and called long distance it was a number i knew by heart but had not called in almost a year she answered after only two rings but i could tell i had woken her up i almost hung up knowing that even if she had caller id she would not be able to tell it had been me but after her second hello i finally spoke eleanor its me harry did i wake you up its okay are you all right yeah im fine were you playing late till about five and then we went for breakfast i feel like i just got to bed what time is it i told her it was after ten and she groaned i felt the confidence go out of my plan i also got stuck wondering who the we she referred to was but didnt ask i was supposed to be long past that harry what is it she said into the silence are you sure youre all right yeah im fine i didnt get to sleep till about the same time too more silence slipped into the wire i noticed that they were boarding my flight is that why you called me to tell me your sleeping habits no i uh well i sort of need some help over there in vegas help what do you mean you mean like on a case you told me you retired i did i am but theres this thing im working on anyway i was wondering if you could meet me at the airport in about an hour im flying in there was silence while she registered this request and all that it might mean as i waited my chest felt heavy and tight i was thinking about the singlebullet theory when she finally spoke i can be there where am i taking you i realized i had been holding my breath i exhaled deep down in the velvet folds i knew that would be her answer but hearing it spoken out loud the confirmation of it filled me immediately with my own confirmation of the feelings i still carried i tried to picture her on the other end of the line she was in bed the phone on the bed table her hair messy in a way i always found to be a turnon that made me want to stay in bed with her then i remembered that this was a cell number she didnt have a landline at least one that i had the number for and then that we thing came up again intruding like a telephone solicitor whose bed was she in harry you still there yeah im here uh just to a carrental place avis i guess they try harder supposedly harry they have buses that come by the airport every five minutes for that what do you need me for whats going on look ill explain when i get there my flights boarding can you be there eleanor i said ill be there she said in a tone i was too familiar with as if she was relenting and reluctant at the same time i didnt dwell on it i had what i needed i left it at that thank you how about right outside southwest is it still the taurus you had before no harry its a silver lexus now fourdoor and ill have my lights on ill flick them if i see you first okay ill see you then thanks eleanor i hung up and headed for the gate a lexus i thought as i moved i had priced them before buying the used mercedes they werent outrageous but they werent cheap things must be changing for her i was pretty sure i was happy about that by the time i got on the plane there was no room in the overhead compartments for my bag and only middle seats left for me i squeezed in between a man in a hawaiian shirt and thick gold neck chain and a woman so pale i thought she might detonate like a match the moment she was hit by the nevada sun i zoned out kept my elbows to myself though the hawaiian shirt guy didnt and managed to close my eyes and almost sleep for most of the short flight i knew there was a lot to think about and the memory card was almost burning a hole in my pocket as i wondered about its contents but i also instinctively knew that i needed to grab rest while i could i wasnt expecting to get too much of it once i got back to la less than an hour after takeoff i walked out through the terminals automatic doors at mccarran and was hit with the ovendry blast of heat that signaled arrival in las vegas it didnt faze me my eyes intently searched the vehicles stacked in the pickup lanes until they held on a silver car with its lights on the sunroof was open and the drivers hand was reaching through it and waving she was flicking the brights at me too it was eleanor i waved and trotted to the car i opened the door threw my bag over the seat into the back and got in hi i said thanks after a moments hesitation we both leaned to the middle and kissed it was brief but good i had not seen her in a long time and i was suddenly shocked by the realization of how fast time could slip between two people though we talked every year on birthdays and christmas it had been almost three years since i had actually seen her touched her been with her and immediately it was intoxicating and depressing at the same time for i had to go this would be quicker than any of those birthday calls we made each year your hairs different i said it looks good it was the shortest i had ever seen it cut cleanly at the midpoint of her neck but it wasnt a false compliment she looked good but then again she would have looked good to me with hair to her ankles or even shorter than mine she turned from me to check traffic over her left shoulder i could see the nape of her neck she pulled into the through lane and we headed out as she drove she reached up and held her finger on the button that closed the sunroof thank you harry you dont look that different but you still look good i thanked her and tried not to smile too much as i got my wallet out so she said whats this big mystery that you couldnt tell me about on the phone no mystery i just want some people to think im in las vegas you are in las vegas but not for long as soon as i pick up the car im heading back eleanor nodded like she understood i pulled my atm and american express cards out of my wallet i kept my visa card for the car rental and anything else that might come up i want you to take these cards and use them over the next couple of days the atm code is ohsixthirteen should be easy enough to remember it had been our wedding day funny she said you know this year it falls on a friday i checked thats bad luck harry friday the thirteenth somehow seemed appropriate for a moment i wondered what it meant that she was checking on when future anniversaries of a failed marriage landed on the calendar i dropped it and came back to the present so just use them over the next few days you know go have dinner or something if i were here id probably buy you a present for letting me stay with you so go to the atm and get some money and buy something you like the amex still has my full name on it you shouldnt have a problem most people dont know what gender my given name hieronymus is when we had been married eleanor regularly used my credit cards without a problem the only difficulty that would arise now would occur if an id was requested at point of purchase this rarely happens in restaurants anywhere and especially not in las vegas a place that takes your money first and asks questions later i handed her the cards but she didnt take them harry what is this whats going on with you i told you i want some people to think i am over here in vegas and these are people who can monitor creditcard purchases and atm usage if they want to i dont know if they will this is just a pre then youre talking about the cops or the bureau which is it i laughed quietly well it might be both but as far as i know its the bureau thats most interested oh harry she said it with a herewegoagain tone in her voice i thought about telling her that it involved marty gessler but decided i shouldnt involve her any further than i already had look its no big deal im just working on one of my old cases and its got an agents nose out of joint i want him to think he scared me off for just a few days okay eleanor can you do this please i held the cards out again after a long moment she reached up and took them without a word we were on an airport road where all the rentacar complexes were lined up in a row i wanted to say something else something about us and about how i wanted to come back over when all of this nastiness was finished if she wanted me to but she pulled into the avis lot and put her window down to tell a security man that she was just there to drop me off the interruption ruined the flow of the conversation if it even was a conversation i lost my momentum and dropped any thought of saying anything further about us she pulled up to the avis pickup office and it was time for me to get out but i didnt i sat there and looked at her until she finally turned and looked at me thank you for doing this eleanor its not a problem youll get the bill i smiled do you ever go back to la you know to the card rooms or anything she shook her head not in a long time i dont like to travel anymore i nodded there didnt seem like there was anything else to say i leaned over and kissed her this time just on the cheek ill call you tomorrow or the next day okay okay harry be careful goodbye i will goodbye eleanor i got out and watched her drive off i wished i had been able to spend more time with her and wondered if she would have let me if id had the time i then put those thoughts away and went inside i showed my drivers license and credit card and picked up the key to my rental it was a ford taurus and i had to get used to being low to the ground again on my way out of rentacar row i saw a sign with an arrow pointing the way to paradise road i thought that everybody needed a sign like that i wished that it was that easy four hours and a nonstop drive across the desert later i was in the tech lab at biggar amp biggar i took the memory card from my pocket and handed it to andre he held it up and looked at it and then looked at me as though i had just put used gum in his hand wheres the case the case you mean the clock its still on the wall i hadnt figured out yet how to tell him that the clock was broken and probably the camera as well no the plastic case for the card you put the spare card i gave you into the clock when you took this one out right i nodded right well you should have put this one into the spare cards case this is a delicate instrument carrying it around with your pocket change and lint is not the proper way of andre burnett biggar interrupted lets just see if its going to work it was my mistake for not schooling harry on the finer points of care and maintenance i forgot hes such a throwback andre shook his head and walked over to a workbench with a computer set up on it i looked at burnett and nodded my thanks for the rescue he winked at me and we followed andre the son used a pneumatic air gun that looked like it was from a dentists office to blast dust and debris off the memory card i had mishandled and then plugged it into a receptacle that was attached to the computer he typed in a few commands and soon the images from lawton crosss sitting room were playing on the computer screen remember andre said we were using the motion sensor so its going to be a bit jerky watch the clock in the corner and youll be able to keep track the first image on the screen was my own face i was staring right at the camera as i adjusted the time on the clock i then backed away revealing lawton cross in his chair behind me oh man burnett said seeing his former colleagues condition and situation i dont know if i want to see this it gets worse i said confident in what i thought was ahead on the surveillance crosss voice croaked from the computers speakers harry what i heard myself ask did you bring me some a little on the screen i flipped open the toolbox to get the flask in the lab i said can you fastforward this andre nodded and used the computers mouse to click a fastforward button on the screen the screen blinked black for a moment indicating the camera had gone off for lack of movement it then came back on as danny cross entered the room andre switched the playback to real time i checked the time and saw this was just a few minutes after i had left the room danny stood with her arms crossed in front of her and stared at her invalid husband as though he was a misbehaving child she started speaking and it was hard to hear because of the television noise this is amateur hour here andre said whyd you put it next to the tv he was right i hadnt thought about that the cameras microphone was picking up the voices from the television better than those in the room andre burnett said quieting his sons complaint just see if you can clean it up some andre used the mouse again to manipulate the sound he backed the image up and played it again the television noise was still intrusive but at least the conversation in the room was audible danny cross spoke with a sharp tone in her voice i dont want him coming back here she said hes not good for you yes he is hes fine he cares hes using you he pours booze into you so he gets the information he needs so whats wrong with that i think its a good trade yes until the morning when the pain comes danny if one of my friends comes here you let him in what did you tell him this time that im starving you that i abandon you at night which lie this time i dont want to talk now fine dont talk i want to dream be my guest at least one of us still can she turned and left the room and the picture held on lawtons motionless body soon his eyes closed theres a sixtysecond cutoff andre explained the camera stays on for a minute after motion ceases fastforward i said we spent the next ten minutes fastforwarding and then stopping to watch mundane yet heartripping scenes of lawton being fed and cleaned by danny at the end of the first night he was wheeled out by his wife and the camera went dark for nearly eight hours before he was wheeled back into the room a new round of feedings and cleanings began it was horrible to look at made more so because the clock was positioned just to the left of the television lawton cross spent his time looking at the tv but the angle was so close it almost looked like he was staring up at the camera looking right at us this is pathetic andre finally said and theres nothing here she treats him fine better than i would you want to see it through harry burnett asked i nodded i think youre right shes clean but theres something coming up he had visitors last night i want to see that you can fastforward if you want it was near midnight andre worked the toggle and sure enough at am on the surveillance clock two men entered the room i recognized parenting today and his partner the first thing parenting today did was walk behind lawton to turn off the baby monitor on the bureau he then signaled his partner to close the door lawtons eyes were open and alert hed been awake before they had come into the room and the camera had activated his eyes moved about in their sunken sockets as he tried to track the agent moving behind him mr cross we need to have a little talk parenting today said he moved forward past crosss chair and reached up and turned off the television thank god for that andre said who are you people cross rasped from the screen parenting today turned and looked at him were the fbi mr cross who the fuck are you what do you mean i dont i mean who the fuck do you think you are compromising our investigation i dontwhat is this what did you tell bosch that put the fire under his ass i dont know what youre talking about he came to me i didnt go to him doesnt look like you can go anywhere now does it there was a short silence and i could see lawtons eyes working the man couldnt move a single limb but his eyes showed all the body language necessary youre not fbi he said gallantly let me see badges and ids parenting today moved two steps toward cross his back blocking our view of the man in the chair badges he said in his best mexican accent we dont need no steenking badges get out of here cross said his voice the clearest and strongest i had heard since i first visited him when i tell harry bosch about this you better watch your ass parenting today turned in profile to smile at his partner harry bosch dont worry about harry bosch were taking care of him worry about yourself mr cross he leaned down now putting his face close to crosss we now could see lawtons eyes as they looked into the agents because you are in harms way you are trespassing on a federal case that is federal with a capital f you understand fuck you and that is fuck you with a capital f you understand i had to smile lawton was doing his best to stand up to him the bullet had taken away his body but not his spine and not his balls on the screen parenting today moved away from the chair and to the left the camera caught his face and i could see the anger in his eyes he leaned against the bureau just out of the reach of crosss view your hero harry bosch is gone and he might not be coming back he said the question is do you want to go where hes gone a guy like you in your condition i dont know you know what they do to guys like you in lockup they wheel them into the corner and make them give blow jobs all day nothing they can do about it but sit there and take it you into that cross that what you want cross closed his eyes for a moment but then came back strong you think you can pull that off then take your best shot big man yeah parenting today came off the bureau and up behind cross he leaned over his right shoulder as if to whisper in his ear but he didnt what if i take my shot here huh how would that be the agent brought his hands up on both sides of crosss face he took hold of the plastic breathing tubes that were attached to crosss nostrils with his fingers he crimped the tubes closed cutting off the air supply hey milton the other agent said shut up carney this guy thinks hes smart thinks he doesnt have to cooperate with the federal government crosss eyes grew wide and he opened his mouth to gulp for air he wasnt getting any motherfucker burnett biggar said who is this guy i said nothing i watched silently the anger rising in me biggar had it right though in the lexicon of cop talk motherfucker was the ultimate expletive the one reserved for the worst offender the worst enemy i felt like saying it but my voice wouldnt come i was too consumed by what i saw on the screen what they had done to me was nothing compared to the humiliation and scarring they were putting on lawton cross on the screen cross was trying to speak but couldnt get the words out with no air in his lungs there was a sneer on the face of the agent i now knew was named milton what he asked whats that you want to talk to me cross tried again to talk but couldnt nod your head if you want to tell me something oh thats right you cant nod your head can you he finally let go of the tubes and cross began to pull in air like a man coming up out of the water from fifty feet down his chest heaved and his nostrils flared as he tried to recover milton came around in front of the chair he looked down upon his victim and nodded you see thats how easy it is you want to cooperate now what do you want what did you tell bosch crosss eyes flicked up toward the camera for a moment and then back to milton in that moment i didnt think he was checking the time i suddenly thought that maybe lawton knew about the camera hed been a good cop maybe he knew what i had been doing all along i told him about the case thats all he came to me and i told him what i knew i dont remember it all i got hurt you know i got hurt and my memory isnt so good things are just starting to come back to me i why did he come here tonight because i forgot i had some files my wife called for me and i left him a message he came for the files what else nothing else what do you want what do you know about the money that was taken nothing we never got that far milton reached forward and held the breathing tubes again he didnt crimp them this time the threat was enough im telling you the truth cross protested you better be the agent let go of the tubes you are finished talking to bosch is that understood yes yes what yes im finished talking to bosch thank you for your cooperation when milton moved away from the chair i saw crosss eyes were downcast as the agents were leaving one of themprobably miltonhit the wall switch and the room and screen dropped into darkness we stood there staring at the screen and in the minute before the camera cut off we could hear but not see lawton cross crying they were the deep sobs of a wounded and helpless animal i did not look at the two men with me and they didnt look at me we just watched the dark screen and listened the camera finallythankfullycut off at the end of the minute but then the screen came alive again when the rooms light was flicked back on and danny entered the room i checked the time on the screen and saw this was only three minutes after the agents had left the room her husbands face was streaked with tears tears he could do nothing to hide she crossed the room to him without a word she climbed onto the chair in front of him her knees alongside his thin thighs she lowered her hips onto his lap she opened her bathrobe and pulled his face forward to her breasts she held him there and he cried again no words were spoken at first she quietly and tenderly shushed him and then she started to sing to him the song i knew and she sang it well her voice was as soft as a breeze whereas the songs original voice carried the rasp of all the worlds anguish in it i didnt think anybody could ever touch louis armstrong but danny cross certainly did i see skies of blue and clouds of white the bright blessed day the dark sacred night and i think to myself what a wonderful world and that was the hardest part of the surveillance to watch that was the part that made me feel the most like an intruder as if i had crossed some line of decency within myself turn it off now i finally said the defining moment for me as a police officer did not occur on the street or while i worked a case it occurred on march it was during the afternoon and i was in the squad room in hollywood division ostensibly doing paperwork but like everybody else in the squad i was waiting when everybody started leaving their desks to gather at the televisions i got up too there was one in the lieutenants office and one was mounted overhead on the wall by the burglary table i didnt get along with the lieutenant at the time so i moved to the burglary pen to watch we had already heard about it but few of us had actually seen the tape yet and there it was grainy blackandwhite but still clear enough to see and to know that things would change four uniform cops gathered around a man flopping on the ground rodney king excon and now speeding scofflaw two of the cops were wailing on him with batons a third kicked him while the fourth controlled the juice for the taser gun a second larger ring of uniforms stood around and watched a lot of jaws dropped in the squad room as we looked up at the screen a lot of hearts fell we felt betrayed in some way to a man and woman we all knew that the department would not withstand the tape it would change police work in los angeles would change of course we didnt know how or whether it would be for better or for worse we didnt know then that political motives and racial emotions would rise up over the department like a tidal wave that there would later be a deadly riot and complete tearing of the citys social fabric but as we watched that grainy video we all knew something was coming all because of that one moment of anger and frustration acted out under a streetlight in the san fernando valley as i sat in the waiting room of a downtown law office i thought about that moment i remembered the anger i felt and i realized it had come back to me across time the recording i had of lawton cross being abused was no rodney king tape it would not set back law enforcement and community relations decades it would not change the way people viewed police and decided whether to back them or cooperate with them but it had a clear kinship in its sickeningly pure depiction of the abuse of power it didnt have the juice to change a city but it could change a bureaucracy like the federal bureau of investigation if i wanted it to but i didnt what i wanted was something else and i was going to use the recording to get it in the short run at least i wasnt thinking yet about what might happen with it or with me further down the road the law library i sat in an hour after leaving biggar amp biggar was lined with cherry wood paneling and bookshelves full of leatherbound volumes of law books in the few open spaces on the walls there were lighted oil paintings depicting the law firms partners i stood in front of one of the paintings studying the fine brushwork it showed a handsome man standing tall with brown hair and piercing green eyes set off by a deep tan the gold plate on the top of the mahogany frame said his name was james foreman he looked like everything a successful man should be mr bosch i turned the matronly woman who had escorted me to the library now beckoned to me at the door i went to her and she led me down a hall thickly carpeted in a soft green that whispered money with every step i took she led me to an office where a woman i didnt recognize was waiting behind a desk she stood up and offered her hand hello mr bosch im roxanne ms langwisers assistant would you like a bottle of water or coffee or anything uh no im fine you can go on in then shes waiting she pointed me toward a closed door to the side of her desk and i walked to it knocked once on it and went in i was carrying a briefcase i had borrowed from burnett biggar janis langwiser was sitting behind a desk that reminded me of a twocar garage she also had the twelvefoot ceiling and the cherry wood paneling and shelves she wasnt a small woman rather she was tall and slim but the office made her look diminutive she smiled when she saw me and i did likewise they never asked me if i wanted bottled water or coffee when i came to see you at the das office i know harry times have certainly changed she stood up and reached her hand across the desk she had to lean forward to make it we shook hands i met her when she was a rookie filing deputy in downtown criminal courts i watched her grow up and handle some of the biggest and toughest cases she was a good prosecutor now she was trying to be a good criminal defense attorney rare was the prosecutor who made a whole career of it the money was too good at the other table judging by the office i was in janis langwiser was sitting pretty at that other table have a seat she said you know ive been meaning to track you down and call you you just turning up like this today is great i was confused track me down for what youre not repping anybody i put in the clink are you no no nothing like that i wanted to talk to you about a job i raised my eyebrows she smiled like she was offering me the keys to the city i dont know what you know about us harry i know you were pretty hard to find youre not listed in the phone book i had to call a friend of mine at the das office and he got me the number she nodded thats right were not listed we dont need to be we have very few clients and we handle every legal detail that crops up in their lives and you handle the criminal details she hesitated she was trying to judge where i was coming from thats right im the firms criminal expert thats why i was meaning to call you when i heard you retired i thought this would be perfect not fulltime but sometimesdepending on the caseit gets hot and heavy we could really use somebody with your skills harry i took a moment to compose my answer i didnt want to offend her i wanted to hire her so i decided not to tell her that what she was suggesting was impossible that i could never move to the other table no matter what the money was it wasnt in me retired or not i had a mission in life working for a defense attorney wasnt part of it janis i said im not looking for a job i sort of already have one the reason im here is because i want to hire you she giggled youre kidding she said are you in trouble probably but thats not why i want to hire you i need a lawyer i can trust to hold something for me and take the appropriate actions with it if necessary she leaned forward in her desk she still was at least six feet away from me harry this is getting mysterious what is going on first off what is your normal retainer lets get the client thing out of the way first harry our minimum retainer is twentyfive thousand dollars so forget about that i owe you for all of those airtight cases you brought me consider yourself a client i pushed the surprise off my face really twentyfive grand just to open a file thats right well they got the right person for it thank you harry now what is this thing you want me to do i opened the briefcase burnett biggar had given me to carry the second round of equipment i borrowed from him along with the memory card and the three cds containing copies of the clock surveillance andre had made the copies i put the card and the cds on her desk this is a surveillance i took i want you to hold the originalthe memory cardin a safe place i want you to hold an envelope with one of the cds and a letter from me i want your private office number im going to call it every night by midnight and tell you i am okay in the morning you come in and if the message is there then everything is all right if you come in and there is no message from me then you deliver the envelope to a reporter at the times named josh meyer josh meyer that name is familiar is he on courts i think he used to cover local crime stuff now hes on terrorism i think he works out of dc now terrorism harry its a long story she checked her watch ive got time ive also got a computer i first took fifteen minutes to tell her about my private investigation and everything that had happened since lawton cross had called me out of the blue and i had pulled down the box of old cases off the closet shelf then i let her put the cd in her computer and watch the surveillance video she didnt recognize lawton cross until i told her who he was she reacted with appropriate outrage when she viewed the section with agents milton and carney i had her turn it off before danny cross came into the room and comforted her husband first question were they real agents she asked after the computer kicked the disk out yeah theyre part of the antiterrorism squad working out of westwood she shook her head in disgust if this ever gets to the times and then onto tv then i dont want it to get there right now that is the worstcase scenario why not harry those are rogue agents at least that one milton is and the other is just as guilty for standing there and letting him do it she gestured toward her computer where the surveillance video had been replaced by a screensaver that showed a bucolic scene of a house on a cliff overlooking the ocean the waves rolling endlessly to shore do you think this is what the attorney general and the congress of the united states wanted when they enacted legislation that changed and streamlined the bureaus rules and tools after september eleventh no i dont i answered but they should have known what could happen whats the saying absolute power corrupts absolutely something like that anyway its a given that this sort of thing would happen they should have known the difference here is that that isnt some middle eastern bag man on there thats an american citizen hes a former cop and hes a goddamn quadriplegic because he took a bullet in the line of duty langwiser nodded somberly that is exactly why you should get this out it has to be see janis are you working for me or should i gather all this up and just find somebody else she threw her hands up in surrender yes im working for you harry im just saying that this should not be allowed to just go by im not talking about letting it go by i just dont want it out yet i need to use it as leverage first i need to get what i want out of it first which is what i was going to get to that but you started in like ralph nader okay im sorry im all calmed down now tell me your plan harry and so i did kate mantilinis on wilshire boulevard had a row of highbacked booths that afforded their inhabitants more interior privacy than the lap dance cubicles in the back rooms of any of the strip clubs in town that was why i chose the restaurant for the meeting it was very private yet very public i was there fifteen minutes before the appointed time got a booth with a window fronting wilshire and waited special agent peoples got there a little early too he had to walk along the row of booths and look into each one to find me he then slipped silently and morosely into the space across from me agent peoples glad you could make it i didnt feel like i had much choice i guess you didnt he flipped open one of the menus that were on the table never been here before food any good its not bad good chicken pot pie on thursdays its not thursday and youre not here to eat he looked up from the menu and gave me his best deadeye stare but he didnt have the juice this time we both knew i was holding the high card this time i looked out the window and glanced up and down wilshire you have your people out there agent peoples are they waiting for me i came alone as instructed by your attorney well just so youre clear if your people grab me again or make any move against my attorney then the consequences are that the surveillance recording you were emailed will go to the media and out across the internet there are people who will know if i disappear theyll put it out no hesitation peoples shook his head you keep saying that disappear this isnt south america bosch and were not nazis i nodded in agreement sitting in this nice restaurant it sure doesnt seem so but when i was sitting in that cube on the ninth floor and nobody knew i was there that was a different story mouse aziz and those other guys youve got up there probably dont know the difference between california and chile right now either and you are defending them now is that it the men who would like to see this country burn to the ground im not de i stopped when the waitress came to the booth she said her name was kathy and asked if we were ready to order peoples ordered coffee and i ordered coffee and an ice cream sundae with no whipped cream after kathy left peoples looked at me funny im retired i can have a sundae some retirement they make good sundaes here and theyre open late thats a good combination ill remember that did you ever see the movie heat this is the place where pacino the cop meets de niro the burglar its where they both tell each other they wont hesitate to put the other down if it comes to that peoples nodded and we held each others eyes for a long moment message delivered i decided to get down to the business at hand so what did you think of my clock camera the façade dropped and peoples suddenly looked wounded he looked as though he had been thrown to the lions he knew what the future held for him if that recording got out milton worked for him therefore hed take the fall too the rodney king tape cut a swath through the lapd that went all the way to the top peoples was smart enough to know he would get trampled if he didnt contain this problem i was disgusted by what i saw first off i apologize to you and my plan is to go out to see that man lawton cross and apologize as well thats nice of you dont think for a moment that that is how we operate that it is the status quo that i condone it agent milton is gone hes out i knew that the moment i saw the recording im not promising you he will be prosecuted but he wont be carrying a badge for very long not an fbi badge ill see to that i nodded right youll see to that i said it with highoctane sarcasm and i could see it put some color in his cheeks the color of anger you called the meeting bosch what do you want there it was the question i was waiting for you know what i want i want you people off my back i want my files and my notes back i want lawton crosss file back i want a copy of the lapd murder bookwhich i know you must haveand i want access to aziz and what you have on him what we have on him is classified its a national security matter we cant declassify it i want to know how strong the connection is to my movie heist i want to know what you have on his whereabouts on two nights all that federal intelligence has got to be good for something and i want it and then i want to talk to him who aziz thats not going to happen i leaned across the table yes it is because the alternative to that is that everybody who has a tv or america online is going to see what your boy milton did to a helpless man in a wheelchair make that a highly decorated retired cop who had the use of his limbs and fucking life taken from him while in the line of duty you think the rodney king tape did some damage to the lapd you wait and see what happens with this one i guarantee you that milton and you and your whole little ninthfloor bam squad will be cut loose by the bureau and the attorney general and everybody else faster than you can say civil rights indictment you understand special agent peoples i gave him a moment to respond but he didnt his eyes were fixed and staring out through the window to wilshire and if you think for one minute i wont pull the trigger on this then you havent done your homework on me this time i waited him out and eventually his eyes came back through the window and to me the waitress came and put down our coffees and told me my sundae was on the way neither peoples nor i said thank you believe me peoples said i know you will pull the trigger you are that kind of guy bosch i know your kind you will put yourself and your own interests ahead of the greater good dont give me that greater good bullshit this isnt about that you give me what i want and you get rid of milton then you get to cruise along like nothing ever happened the recording is never seen hows that for greater good peoples leaned forward to sip his coffee as he had done in the cube on the ninth floor he burned his mouth and grimaced he pushed the cup and saucer away on the table and then slid to the edge of the booth before looking back at me ill be in touch twentyfour hours i hear from you by this time tomorrow night or all bets are off i go public with it he stood up and remained next to the booth looking at me and still holding a napkin he nodded his agreement let me ask you something he said if youre here who used your credit card tonight to buy dinner at commanders palace in vegas i smiled they had been tracking me a friend is that a nice place commanders palace he nodded one of the best ive been there the shrimp in the gumbo is as soft as marshmallow thats great i guess expensive too your friend put over a hundred bucks on your amex dinner for two it looked like he tossed his napkin onto the table ill be in touch a moment after he was gone the waitress brought my sundae i asked her for the check and she said shed bring it right away i poked a spoon into the fudge and ice cream but i didnt taste it i sat there thinking about what peoples had just said i wasnt sure if there was an implied threat in his telling me he knew somebody was using my credit card maybe he even knew who but the thing i thought about the most was what he had said about it being dinner for two at commanders palace that we thing again just as with eleanor i couldnt let it go since the las vegas ruse was no longer in play i drove out to burbank airport turned in my rental and took the tram out to the longterm lot to collect my car i had borrowed lawton crosss dolly and it was in the back of the mercedes before driving off i got it out and slid underneath the car i detached the satellite tracker and the heat sensor and slid under the pickup truck parked in the next space i attached the equipment to the pickups underside and then got into the mercedes as i backed out i saw that the pickup had an arizona plate i figured if peoples didnt dispatch somebody soon to collect the bureaus equipment then theyd have to chase it to the next state that left me smiling to myself when i pulled up to the parking booth to pay you must have had a nice flight said the woman who took my ticket yeah i guess you could say that i made it back alive i went home and called janis langwiser on her cell phone as soon as i got in the door she had changed my plan a little bit she didnt want me leaving a message on her office line every night she insisted i call her directly on her cell how did it go well it went now i just have to wait i gave him until tomorrow night i guess well know by then and how did he take it about what we expected not well but i think by the end he saw the light i think hell call tomorrow i hope so everything set on your end i think so the memory cards in the office safe and ill wait to hear from you if i dont then ill know what to do good janis thanks good night harry i hung up and thought about things everything seemed to be in place it was peoples who would have to make the next move i lifted the phone again and called eleanor she answered immediately no sleep in her voice sorry its harry are you playing yes and no im playing but im not doing well so i took a break im standing outside the bellagio watching the fountains i nodded i could picture her there at the railing the dancing fountains lit up in front of her i could hear the music and the splash of water over the phone how was commanders palace how did you know about that had a visit from the bureau tonight that was quick yeah i heard thats a good restaurant shrimp like marshmallow did you like it its nice i like the one in new orleans better the foods the same but the original is the original you know yeah plus its probably not so great eating by yourself i almost cursed out loud at how lame and transparent that was i wasnt alone i took a friend that i play with one of the girls you didnt tell me there was a spending limit harry no i know there wasnt i needed to steer away from this we both knew what i had been asking about and it was getting embarrassing especially considering there might be other ears listening you didnt notice anybody watching you did you there was a pause no and i hope you didnt get me into any kind of trouble harry no youre fine im just calling to let you know the scam is over the bureau knows im still here damn i never got the chance to go shopping and get myself that present you promised i smiled she was kidding and i could tell thats okay you can still do that is everything okay harry yeah fine you want to talk about it not on this line i thought but didnt say maybe when i see you next time im too tired right now okay then ill let you go what should i do with your cards and you know you left your bag on my backseat she said it like she knew i had done it on purpose um why dont you just hold on to that stuff for now and maybe when i get past this thing im working on ill come back out and get it from you it was a long time before she answered just give me a little more notice than you did today she finally said so im ready sure no problem i will okay harry im going to go back in maybe talking to you will have changed my luck i hope so eleanor thanks for doing this for me no problem good night good night she disconnected and good luck i said into the dead line i hung the phone up again and tried to think about the conversation and what she had meant just give me a little more notice than you did today so im ready it was like she wanted a warning before i came out so she could do what what did she have to get ready for i realized that i could drive myself nuts thinking and worrying about it i put eleanor and all of that aside and grabbed a beer out of the refrigerator and took it out to the back deck it was a cool and clear night and the lights of the freeway far below seemed to sparkle like a diamond necklace i could hear a womans laughter carrying up the hillside from somewhere down below i started thinking about danny cross and the song she had gently sung to her husband in love and in loss the night is always sacred its only a wonderful world if you can make it that way there are no street signs pointing to paradise road i decided that when all of this was over i would go to vegas and not turn back i would throw the dice i would go see eleanor and take my chances the next morning i spread the documents i had rescued from the engine compartment of lawton crosss muscle car across the table i went into the kitchen to brew a pot of coffee but found out i was out of coffee i could go down the hill to the store but i didnt want to leave the phone i was expecting janis langwiser to call early so i sat down at the table with a bottle of water and started in on the reports cross had copied and taken home almost four years before what i had was a copy of the currency report prepared by the bank which had loaned the cash to the movie company and the time and location sheets that lawton cross and jack dorsey had been working on before their schedule became crowded with other cases the currency report was four pages of typed serial numbers taken from randomly selected onehundreddollar bills contained in the shipment to the movie set the report was prepared by two people listed as linus simonson and jocelyn jones it was then signed off on by a bank vice president named gordon scaggs simonson was a name i knew he had been one of the bank employees at the movie set on the day of the heist he had been wounded during the shootout now i knew why he was there he had helped prepare the money shipment and was most likely there to babysit it through the day of filming scaggs was also a name that was familiar to me it was among the names given to me by alexander taylor when i had asked the film producer who specifically knew about the cash delivery to the movie set i no longer had the list of nine names i had collected from taylor the fbi had taken that during the search of my home but i remembered the name scaggs committed to studying everything about the case i could get my hands on i scanned the listings of currency numbers thinking maybe something would stick out but nothing grabbed me the numbers were like an unbreakable code locking away the secret to the case it was simply four pages of numbers in no particular sequence finally i put the currency report aside and took up the alibi sheets i first checked for the names scaggs simonson and jones and saw that dorsey and cross had indeed run out t ampl checks on all three of the bank employees cross had taken scaggs and jones while dorsey ran down simonson their locations were checked against key times in the murder of angella benton and the subsequent movie set heist all three were cleared by alibi of physical involvement in the crimes simonson of course was at the scene of the heist but he was there as a representative of the bank his being shot by one of the robbers also tended to add weight to his clearance this did not of course clear them of ancillary involvement any one of them could have been the mastermind behind the heist who had stayed in the background as the plan was carried out or at the very least any one of them could have simply been the source of information on the delivery of money to the movie set the same went for the other eight names in the t ampl report all were cleared by alibi of active involvement in the crimes but i had no other files or reports to indicate what had been done to determine if they had a background connection to the crime i realized i was spinning my wheels i was trying to play solitaire without a full deck the aces were gone and there was no way i could win i had to get all the cards i took a swig of water and wished it was coffee i started thinking about how important the play with peoples was if it didnt work i was done angella bentons outstretched hands might haunt me for the rest of my life but there wasnt anything i was going to be able to do about it as if on cue the telephone rang i went into the kitchen and picked up it was janis langwiser though she didnt identify herself its me she said we have to talk okay im in the middle of something ill call you right back good she hung up without a protest i took that as a sign that she now believed what i had told her about my house and phone being bugged i also took it as a sign that peoples was acting in the way i had hoped he would i grabbed my keys off the counter and went out the door i drove down the hill at the place where mulholland wraps around the other side of the hill and meets woodrow wilson at cahuenga i saw a vintage yellow corvette waiting at the light across from me i knew the driver sort of every now and then id see him jogging or driving the vette past my house and id seen and spoken to him in the police station on occasion too he was a private eye who lived on the other side of the ridge from me i put my arm out the window and gave him the sweeping palmdown salute he did likewise back to me smooth sailing my brother i was going to need it the light changed and he went south on cahuenga while i went north i bought a cup of coffee in a convenience store and used a pay phone next to the poquito mas to call langwiser back on her cell she answered right away they came in last night she said just like you predicted did you get it on the camera yes its perfect clear as day it was the same guy in the first surveillance milton i nodded to myself the call to my house the night before in which janis said shed locked the memory card in her office safe had been the bait and milton had taken it before leaving her office i had set up another one of biggar amp biggars camerasthe radioon her desk and trained it toward the bookcase which hid the safe he stumbled around looking for a while but then he found it he took the whole safe out of the wall its gone she had emptied everything from the safe the night before i had put in a folded piece of paper it said fuck you with a capital f i imagined milton unfolding it and reading itif he had managed to get the safe open anything else hit in the offices a couple drawers pulled out here and there the quarter jar in the coffee room all just cover to make it look like a regular burglary anybody call the police to report it yes but nobodys shown up yet typical keep the surveillance out of it for now i know like we said what should i do now you still have peopless email address sure do the night before she had gotten the email address rather easily from a former colleague who worked at the us attorneys office okay send peoples another email attach the latest surveillance and tell him ive changed the deadline to noon today i hear from him by then or he can start watching cnn for the results send it as soon as you can im online now good i sipped coffee while listening to her type andre biggar had included in the briefcase i borrowed the computer attachment langwiser would need to view the memory card taken from the radio camera she could now attach a file containing the surveillance recording to an email its away she finally said good luck harry ill probably need it remember call me tonight by midnight or ill follow the instructions gotcha i hung up and went back to the convenience store for a second cup of coffee i was already wired from langwisers report but i figured i might be needing the spare caffeine before the day was finished when i got back to the house the phone was ringing i got the door unlocked and got inside just in time to grab the phone off the kitchen counter yeah mr bosch john peoples here good morning not really when can you come in im on my way special agent peoples was waiting for me in the firstfloor lobby of the federal building in westwood he was standing when i got there maybe hed been standing there the whole time since hed made the call follow me he said were going to make this quick whatever works after giving a uniformed guard the nod he led me through a security door using a card key and then he used it again to access the elevator i was already familiar with you guys got your own elevator and everything i said pretty cool peoples wasnt impressed he turned so he was looking right at me im doing this because i have no choice ive decided to agree to this extortion because i believe in the greater good of what im trying to accomplish here is that why you sent milton into my lawyers office last night was that all part of the greater good youre talking about he didnt answer look you can hate me and thats fine thats your option but lets not bullshit each other dont hide behind that stuff because we both know whats going on here your guy crossed the line and got caught now its just time to pay the price thats what this is about its that simple and meantime an investigation is compromised and lives may be at stake well see about that wont we the elevator opened on the ninth floor he led me out without answering the ever handy card key got us through another door and into a squad room where several agents were working at desks as we passed through most of them stopped what they were doing to look at me i assumed that they had either been briefed on who i was and what i was doing or just the occurrence of a nonagent in the inner sanctum was worth noting when i was halfway across the room i spotted milton sitting at a desk near the back he was leaning back in his chair giving me his best show of being relaxed but i could sense the anger pulsing beneath the façade i winked at him and turned my attention away peoples led me into a small room with a desk and two chairs on the desk was a cardboard box i looked into it and recognized my own notebook and the file i had kept on angella benton there was also the file from lawton crosss garage and a black binder full of documents two inches thick i assumed it was the copy of the lapds murder book i got excited just looking at it it was the full deck of cards i had been looking for wheres the rest i asked peoples walked around behind the desk and opened the middle drawer he removed a file and dropped it on the top of the desk in there you will find subject location reports covering the two dates you requested i dont think they will help you but its what you wanted you can look at them here but you cannot take them with you they will not leave this office do you understand that i nodded deciding not to push it what about aziz when you are ready i will put you in a room with him but he wont talk to you youll be wasting your time well its mine to waste then before you leave here you will call your attorney and instruct her to turn over to me the original and all copies of the surveillance recordings you have from last night and the night before i shook my head sorry thats not the deal it certainly is no i never said i would turn over the recordings what i said was that i would not go public with them theres a difference im not going to turn over the only leverage ive got im not stupid john we had a deal he said his cheeks beginning to quiver with anger and im keeping the deal exactly as offered i reached into my pocket and pulled out a cassette tape i held it out to him if you dont believe me you can listen for yourself i was wearing a wire last night in the booth i watched his eyes register that i now even had him directly tied in take it john call it a goodwill gesture its the original no copies were made he slowly reached up and took the tape i moved around behind the desk why dont i take a look at what youve got in the file while you go do whatever you have to do to get aziz ready peoples pocketed the tape and nodded ill be back in ten minutes he said if anyone comes in here and asks what you are doing close that file and tell them to see me one last thing what about the money what about it how much money from the movie set heist did aziz have under his car seat i thought i saw a small smile start to play on peopless face but then it went away he had a hundred bucks one bill traced to the heist he stayed long enough to see the disappointment on my face then turned to the door after he left the room i sat down at the desk and opened the file it contained two pages that had security stamps on them and had words in the middle of paragraphs and then whole paragraphs blocked out with black ink peoples clearly wasnt going to let me see anything i had not bargained foror extorted from him as he had put it the pages were taken from what i assumed was a larger file there was a coding in small print at the top left corner i reached into the cardboard box and opened my file i took out one of the loose sheets of note paper and wrote the code number from each page down i then read what peoples was allowing me to read the first page had two dated paragraphs subject confirmed in hamburg at in company with and subject seen in restaurant by approximately until hours no further detail subject passport scan at heathrow at hours follow up determination arrival on lufthansa flight from frankfurt no further detail the paragraphs before and after these two were completely blacked out what i was looking at was the log in which tabs on aziz had been kept over the years by the feds he was on the watch list this is what it amounted to sightings by informants or agents and airport passport checks the two dates on the page were on either side of the murder of angella benton and the movie set heist it by no means cleared aziz of active or background involvement in the crimes yet if i believed the document in front of me he was in europe both before and after the occurrence of the crimes i was investigating but it was no alibi aziz was known according to the times article i had read to travel with false identification it was possible he had slipped into this country to commit the crimes and then slipped out i went on to the next page this one had only one paragraph that was not blacked out but the date was a direct hit subject passport scan at laxca arrival on qantas flight from manilla at hrs security check and search questioned by los angeles field office see transcript released at hrs aziz had what appeared to be a perfect alibi for the night agent martha gessler disappeared he was being questioned by an fbi agent at los angeles international airport until pm which put him in federal custody at the same time gessler disappeared while on her way home from work i put the two sheets back in the file and put it back in the drawer i wrote no further notesthere was nothing to writeon the page from my file i put it back inside the file and lifted out the murder book i was just about to start into it when the door to the room opened and there was milton i said nothing i waited for him to make the first move he stepped in and looked around the room as though it was the size of a warehouse he finally spoke without looking at me you have some balls on you bosch doing what youre doing and thinking youre going to just walk away from it away from me i guess i could say the same thing about you if it was me i would have called your bluff then you would have called it wrong he leaned down and put both hands on the table and looked right at me you are a hasbeen bosch the worlds passed you by but here you are grabbing at straws fucking with people who are trying to protect the future i was unimpressed and hoped i showed it i leaned back and looked up at him why dont you relax man youve got nothing to worry about as far as i can tell youve got a boss whos more interested in a coverup than a cleanup youll do okay on this milton i think hes mad because you got caught not because of what you did he pointed a finger at me dont fucking go there dont the day i want career advice from you is the day i turn in my badge fine then what do you want i want to give you a warning watch out for me bosch cause im coming then ill be ready he turned and walked out leaving the door open a few seconds later peoples was back you ready been ready wheres the file i gave you its back in the drawer he leaned over the desk and slid open the drawer to make sure he even opened the file to make sure i hadnt pulled a fast one okay lets go bring your box i followed him through a couple security doors and i was once again in the hallway of cells but before we got close to the doors with the mirrored windows he used his card key to open a door and he ushered me into an interview room there was a table and two chairs mousouwa aziz was already sitting in one of them an agent i had not seen before was leaning against the corner to the left of the door peoples moved into the other corner have a seat he said youve got fifteen minutes i put the box i carried down on the floor pulled out the remaining chair and sat down across the table from aziz he looked weak and thin a line of dark hair had grown in below the blond dye job his hooded eyes were bloodshot and i wondered if they ever turned the light out in his cell things had certainly changed in his world two years ago his arrival and identification at lax had brought a custody hold for a few hours while an agent attempted to interview him now a border stop got him an interminable hold in the fbis inner sanctum i wasnt expecting much from the interview but felt i needed the facetoface before proceeding or disposing of aziz as a suspect after viewing the intelligence reports a few minutes earlier i was leaning toward the latter all i had that connected the diminutive wouldbe terrorist to angella benton was the money at the time of his arrest at the border hed had in his possession one of the hundreddollar bills that had come from the movie set heist only one there were probably a lot of explanations for this and i was beginning to think that his involvement in the murder and heist was not one of them reaching down to the cardboard box i pulled up my file on angella benton and opened it on my lap where aziz could not see it i took out the photo of angella that had been provided by her family it showed her in a studio portrait taken at the time of her graduation from ohio state less than two years before her death i looked up at aziz my name is harry bosch i am investigating the death of angella benton four years ago does she look familiar to you i slid the photo across the table and studied his face and eyes for any tell any giveaway his eyes moved over the photograph but i saw nothing in the way of a reaction he said nothing did you know her he didnt answer she worked for a movie company that was robbed you ended up with some of the money how nothing where did the money come from he raised his eyes from the photo to mine he said nothing did these agents tell you not to talk to me nothing did they look if you didnt know her then tell me aziz dropped his sad eyes to the table again he appeared to be looking at the photo again but i could tell he wasnt he was looking at something far away i knew it was useless just as i had probably known before sitting down i got up and turned to peoples you can keep the rest of the fifteen minutes he pushed off the wall and looked up at an overhead camera he made the little swirling motion with a finger and the doors electronic lock snapped open without thinking i moved toward the door and pushed it open almost immediately i heard a banshee cry from behind me and aziz was up and over the table he hit me in the upper back with all his weightmaybe pounds topsand i went through the door and into the hallway aziz was still on me and as i started to go down i felt his arms and legs flailing for purchase he then jumped off and started running down the hall peoples and the other agent were quickly down the hall after him as i got up i saw them corner aziz at a dead end peoples held back while the other agent moved in and roughly wrestled the smaller man to the ground once aziz was controlled peoples turned and came back to me bosch are you all right im fine i stood up and made a show of straightening my clothes i was embarrassed i had been taken by surprise by aziz and i knew it would probably be the talk of the squad room at the other end of the hall i wasnt ready for that i guess being out of the life so long i got rusty yes you never can turn your back on them my box i forgot it i went back into the interview room and got the photo off the table and the box just as i came back out aziz was being walked by his wrists cuffed behind his back i watched him go by and then peoples and i followed at a safe distance and so peoples said all of this was for naught probably and it all could have been avoided if he didnt finish so i did your agent hadnt committed those crimes on camera yeah peoples stopped in the hallway and i did too he waited for the other agent and aziz to go through the door im not comfortable with this arrangement he said i have no guarantees you could walk out of here and get hit by a truck does that mean those recordings will end up on the news i thought for a moment then nodded yeah it does you better hope that truck misses me i dont want to live and work under the weight of that i dont blame you what are you going to do about milton what i told you hes out he just doesnt know it yet well let me know when that happens then we can talk about the weight again he looked like he was about to say something more but then thought better of it and started walking again he led me through the security doors to the elevator he used his card key to summon it and then to push the button for the lobby he held his hand on the doors bumper im not going down with you he said i think weve said enough i nodded and he stepped back through the door he stood there and watched maybe to make sure i didnt sneak off the elevator and try to spring the incarcerated terrorists just as the door started closing i hit the bumper with the side of my hand and it slowly reopened remember agent peoples my lawyer has taken steps to secure herself and the recordings if something happens to her its the same as it happening to me dont worry mr bosch i will make no move against her or you its not you im worried about the door closed as we were holding each others eyes in a pointed stare i understand i heard him say through the doors my dance with the federales was not totally for naught as i had led peoples to believe yes my chasing down of the tiny terrorist may have been a false lead but in any case there are always false leads it is part of the mission at the end of the day what i had was the full record of the investigation and i was happy with that i was playing with a full deckthe murder bookand it allowed me to write off in my mind all that had occurred in the two days leading up to the point i got it including my hours in lockdown for i knew that if i was to find angella bentons killer the answer or at least the key that would turn the case would likely be sitting somewhere in the middle of that black plastic binder i got home from the federal building and came into the house like a man who thinks he may have won the lottery but needs to check the numbers in the newspaper to be sure i went directly to the dining room table with my cardboard box and spread out everything i carried in it front and center was the murder book the holy grail i sat down and started reading from page one i didnt get up for coffee water or beer i didnt turn on music i concentrated fully on the pages i was turning on occasion i jotted notes down on my notepad but for the most part i just read and absorbed i got in the car with lawton cross and jack dorsey and i rode through their investigation four hours later i turned the last page in the binder i had carefully read and studied every document nothing struck me as the key the obvious strand to pursue but i wasnt discouraged i still believed it was in there it always was i would just have to sift it from a different angle the one thing that struck me from the intense immersion into the documented part of the case was the difference in personalities of cross and dorsey dorsey was a good ten years older than cross and had been the mentor in the relationship but in their writing and handling of reports i sensed strong differences in their personalities cross was more descriptive and interpretive in his reports dorsey was the opposite if three words summed up an interview or a lab report then he went with the three words cross was more likely to put down the three words and then add another ten sentences of interpretation of what the lab report or the witnesss demeanor meant i preferred crosss method it had always been my philosophy to put everything in the book because sometimes cases go months and even years long and nuances can be lost in time if not set down as part of the record it also made me conclude that maybe the two partners had not been close they were close now inextricably linked in department mythology as keepers of the ultimate bad luck but maybe if they had been close that moment in the bar things would have been different thinking about what could have been made me remember danny cross singing to her husband i finally got up and went to the cd player and put in a disc of the collected works of louis armstrong it had been put out in unison with the ken burns documentary on jazz most of it was the very early stuff but i knew it ended with what a wonderful world his last hit back at the table i looked at my notepad i had written down only three things during my first readthrough k sandor szatmari the money stupid the company that had insured the money on the movie set global underwriters had put up a reward for an arrest and conviction in the case i hadnt known about the reward and was surprised that lawton cross hadnt told me i guessed that it was just another detail that had escaped from his mind due to trauma and the passage of time the fact that there was a reward was of little personal consequence to me i assumed that since i was a former cop who at one time was involved in the case albeit before the heist that spawned the reward i would not be eligible for it if my efforts resulted in an arrest and conviction i also knew that it was likely that the small print on the reward proclamation said that full recovery of the million was required for collection of the hundred thousand with the amount prorated according to the amount of recovery and four years after the crime the chances of there being anything left to recover were small still the reward was good to know about it might be useful as a tool of leverage or coercion i might not be eligible but i might encounter someone useful who would be i was glad i found out about it next on the notepad was the name sandor szatmari he or shei didnt know whichwas listed as the case investigator for global underwriters he or she was someone i needed to talk to i opened the murder book to the first page where investigators usually kept a page of most often called phone numbers there was no listing for szatmari but there was for global i went into the kitchen to get the phone turned down louis armstrong on the cd player and made the call i was transferred twice before i finally got a woman who answered with investigations i had trouble with szatmaris name and she corrected me and then told me to hold in less than a minute szatmari picked up the name belonged to a he i explained my situation and asked if we could meet he seemed skeptical but that might have just been because he had an accent from eastern europe that made him hard to read he declined to discuss the case over the phone with a stranger but ultimately agreed to meet me in person at ten oclock the next morning at his office in santa monica i told him id be there and hung up i looked at the last line i had written on the notepad it was just a reminder of an old adage good for almost any investigation follow the money stupid it always leads to the truth in this case the money was gone and the trailother than blips on the radar in phoenix and involving mousouwa aziz and martha gesslerhad gone cold i knew that left me one alternative to go backwards trace the money backwards and see what came up to do that i needed to start at the bank i checked the phone number page in the murder book again and called gordon scaggs the vice president at bankla who had arranged the oneday loan of million to alexander taylors film company scaggs was a busy man he told me he wanted to put off meeting with me until the following week but i was persistent and got him to squeeze me in for fifteen minutes the next afternoon at three he asked me for a callback number so his secretary could confirm in the morning i made up a number and gave it to him i wasnt going to give him the opportunity to have the secretary call me back and tell me the meeting had been canceled i hung up and weighed my options it was late afternoon and at the moment i was clear until ten the following morning i wanted to take another run at the murder book but knew i didnt need to be sitting in the house to do that i could just as easily be sitting on a plane i called southwest airlines and reserved a flight from burbank to las vegas arriving at and a return flight leaving early the next morning and arriving at back at burbank eleanor answered her cell phone on the second ring and seemed to be whispering its harry is something wrong no why are you whispering she spoke up sorry i didnt realize i was whats going on im thinking about coming over there tonight to get my bag and my credit cards when she did not respond right away i asked are you going to be around well i was going to play tonight later my plane gets in at sevenfifteen i could come by around eight maybe we could have dinner before you go to play i waited and again it seemed like she was taking too long to respond dinner would be nice are you staying overnight yeah ive got an early flight out i have some things to do over here in the morning where are you going to stay there was as clear a signal as any i dont know i didnt reserve anything yet harry i dont think it would be good for you to stay here right the line was as silent as the three hundred miles of desert between us i know i can get you comped at the bellagio theyll do it for me you sure yes thanks eleanor you want me to come to your place after i get in no ill come pick you up are you checking luggage no you already have my bag then ill be parked out in front of the terminal at sevenfifteen ill see you then i noticed she was whispering again but i didnt say anything about it this time thanks eleanor okay harry i need to juggle some things to get free tonight so im going to go ill see you at the airport sevenfifteen bye i said goodbye but she had already hung up it sounded as though there was another voice in the background just as she disconnected the call as i thought about this louis armstrong started singing what a wonderful world and i turned it up at that night eleanor and i repeated the same airport scene right down to the kiss when i got into the car afterward i turned awkwardly and lifted the heavy murder book id been carrying over the front seats to the back i dropped it on the backseat next to my suitcase which was on the seat behind eleanor that looks like a murder book harry it is i thought i might be able to go through it on the flight and i had a screaming baby in the seat behind me couldnt concentrate why would anybody bring a kid to vegas anyway its actually not a bad place to raise a kid supposedly im not talking about raising i mean why take a little kid like that on a vacation to sin city take him to disneyland or something i think you need a drink and some food where do you want to eat well remember when we were still in la and wed go to valentino on special occasions dont tell me she laughed and just being able to look at her again thrilled me i really liked the way her hair accented her lovely neck yep they have one here i made a reservation they must have one of everything in las vegas except you theres absolutely no duplicating harry bosch the smile stayed on her face as she said it and i liked that too we soon dropped into a silence probably as comfortable as it can get with two formerly married people she expertly maneuvered through traffic that looked like it could easily rival anything found on los angeles clogged streets and freeways it had been about three years since id been on the strip but vegas was a place that taught that time was relative in three years it had all seemed to change again i saw new resorts and attractions taxicabs with electronic ad placards on their roofs monorails connecting the casinos the las vegas version of valentino was in the venetian one of the newest jewels in the crown of highend casinos on the strip it was a place that didnt even exist the last time i had been in town when eleanor pulled into the valet parking circle i told her to pop the trunk so i could put my suitcase and the murder book in it i cant its full i dont want to leave this stuff out especially the murder book well put it in the bag and put it on the floor it will be all right dont you have room back there for just the book no everything is jampacked in there and if i open it then it will all spill out i dont want that to happen here what is in it just clothes and things stuff i want to take to the salvation army but havent had the time two valets opened our doors simultaneously and welcomed us to the resort i got out opened the back door and leaned in to open the carryon bag and put the murder book inside it after closing the bag i slid it down to the floor behind eleanors seat you coming harry eleanor asked from behind me yeah im coming as the valet was driving the car away i looked at the trunk and back end it didnt seem particularly heavy i looked at the license plate and silently read it three times to myself valentino was valentino as far as i could tell the la restaurant had been perfectly cloned it was like trying to tell the difference between one mcdonalds and anotheron a much different culinary level i didnt force the conversation while we ate i was comfortable and happy just being with her at first the conversation though spare was focused on me and my retirement or lack thereof i told her about the case i was working including the connection to her old friend and colleague marty gessler in another lifetime eleanor had been an fbi agent and she still had the analytical mind of an investigator when we were together in la she had often been a sounding board for me and on more than one occasion had helped with a suggestion or idea this time she had only one piece of advice and that was to stay clear of peoples and milton and even lindell not that she knew them personally she just knew the fbi culture and knew their kind of course her advice came too late for me im doing my best to do just that i told her it would be fine with me if i never see any of them ever again but not very likely i suddenly thought of something you dont have your cell phone on you do you yes but i dont think they like you using cells in a place like this i know ill go outside i just remembered i have to make a call or the shits going to hit the fan she got her phone out of her purse and gave it to me i left the restaurant and stood in an indoor shopping mall that had been built to look like a venetian canal complete with gondolas the concrete sky was painted blue with wisps of white clouds it was phony but at least it was airconditioned i called janis langwisers cell number and told her the coast was clear i was beginning to worry because i hadnt heard from you ive called your house twice everythings fine im in vegas and will be back tomorrow how do i know youre not under duress you know being held and forced to say that you got caller id oh thats right i saw it was a sevenohtwo number all right harry dont forget call me tomorrow and dont lose too much money over there i wont when i got back to the table eleanor wasnt there i sat down and was anxious about it but she came back from the rest room in a few minutes as i watched her approach i felt she was different but i couldnt place how it was more than the hair and the deeper tan it was like she carried more confidence than i remembered maybe she had found what she needed on the bluefelt poker tables on the strip i gave her back the phone and she dropped it into her purse so how has it been here i asked weve been talking about my case lets talk about your case for a while i dont have a case you know what i mean she shrugged things are going well this year i won a satellite and took a button i get to play in the series i knew she was talking about winning a qualifying tournament for the world series of poker the last time we talked about poker she had told me that her secret goal was to be the first woman to ever win the series the winner of a qualifying tournament can take the cash prize or a socalled button which is an entry into the series this will be your first time in the series right she nodded and smiled and i could tell she was proud and excited it starts pretty soon well good luck maybe ill come over and watch bring me luck it still must be hard eleanor making a living on the turn of the cards im good at it harry besides ive got backers now it spreads the risks what do you mean thats how it works these days i have backers i use their money when i play they get seventyfive percent of what i win if i lose they take the loss but i dont lose too often harry i nodded who are these people are they you know legitimate yes harry very theyre businessmen microsoft men from seattle i met them when they were out here playing so far ive made them money with the way the stock markets been theyd rather invest in me theyre happy and so am i good i thought about the money alex taylor had offered me and then there was the reward offered on the heist case if i solved it got back some of the money and somehow qualified for the reward i could be her backer it was a pipe dream i wondered if she would even take my money what are you thinking about she asked you look so concerned nothing i was just thinking about the case for a second something i want to ask the insurance investigator tomorrow the waiter brought the check and i paid after getting my amex card back from eleanor we left and got the car and i checked to make sure the suitcase was still in the back we drove over to the bellagio a short distance that took a long time because of the traffic i grew nervous as we got closer because i didnt know what was going to happen when we got there i checked my watch it was almost ten what time do you play i like to start around midnight why do you like to play through the night whats wrong with the day the real players come out at night the tourists go to bed theres more money on the table we rode in silence for a little bit and she eventually continued as though there had been no pause plus i like coming out at the end of the night and seeing the sun coming up something about it like youre just happy you survived another day or something inside the bellagio we went to the vip desk and picked up a card key that had been left under eleanors name it was that simple she led me to the elevator like she had been in it a hundred times and we went up to a suite on the twelfth floor it was the nicest hotel room i had ever seen with a living room and a bedroom and a view that looked down on the signature lighted fountains in the front pond this is nice you must know some people im getting a rep i play here three or four nights a week and its starting to draw people high rollers who want to play me they know that here and they dont want me to play anywhere else i nodded and turned to her i guess things are really going well for you im not complaining i guess i didnt finish she walked over to me and stood in front of me you guess what i dont know what i was going to ask i guess i wanted to know what was missing are you with somebody now eleanor she drew closer i could feel her breath you mean am i in love with somebody no harry im not i nodded and she spoke again before i could do you still believe in that thing you told me about the singlebullet theory i nodded without hesitation and looked into her eyes she leaned forward her head against my chin what about you i asked do you still believe what that poet said that there is no end of things in the heart yes i believe it always i raised her chin with my hand and kissed her soon our arms were around each other and her hand was on the back of my neck pulling me toward her i knew we were going to make love and i knew for a moment what it meant to be the luckiest man in las vegas i pulled away from her lips and just hugged her to my chest all i want in this world is you i whispered i know she whispered back on the flight back to los angeles i tried to refocus on the case but it was a fruitless effort i had spent a good part of the night watching eleanor win several thousand dollars from five men at a table down in the bellagio poker room i had never watched her play at any length before it is fair to say she embarrassed the other players cleaning out all but one of them and even he was left with only a single stack of chips by the time she cashed out five racks of her own she was a cold hard player who was as impressive as she was mysterious and beautiful i spent my life learning to read people but i never read anything off of her while she was playing there was not a tell anywhere in her game as far as i could see but when she was finished with those men she was also finished with me outside the poker room she told me she was tired and had to go she said i couldnt go with her she didnt even offer me a ride to the airport it was a short goodbye we parted with a kiss as lacking in passion as our moments in the suite above had seemingly been full of it we parted without promises of rejoining or of even calling each other again we just said goodbye and i watched her walk away through the casino i got to the airport on my own but once on the plane i couldnt let it go i tried opening the murder book but it did me no good i kept thinking about the mysteries not the good moments the smiles and the memories and the making love i thought about our abrupt departure and how she had skillfully avoided the question when id asked if she was with somebody shed said she wasnt in love but that didnt really answer the question i thought about why she had wanted me to stay in a hotel room and why she wouldnt open her cars trunk on the front page of the murder book i wrote down her license plate number from memory after doing it i felt like i had in some way betrayed her and i then crossed it out but even as i did this i knew i could not cross it out in my memory the investigative offices of global underwriters were in a sixstory black box on colorado about six blocks from the ocean when i got there the secretary who guarded entrance to the office of sandor szatmari looked at me as though i had just ridden the elevator down from the moon didnt you get the message what message i left a message for you after getting your number from mr scaggss office mr szatmari had to cancel your appointment this morning what happened somebody die she looked slightly insulted by my brashness her voice took on a tone of impatience no in reviewing his schedule for the day he decided he did not have the time to fit you in so hes here he cannot see you im sorry you didnt get the message i thought there was something wrong with the number i got but i did leave a message please tell him im here tell him i didnt get the message because i was out of town i flew in for this meeting id still like to see him its important now she looked annoyed she lifted the phone to make the call but then thought better of it and hung up she got up and walked down a hallway off to the side of the waiting room so she could deliver the message in person a few minutes later she came back and sat down she took her time in delivering the news to me i talked to mr szatmari she said hell try to get you in as soon as he can thank you thats nice of him and nice of you there was a couch and a coffee table with a spread of outdated magazines on it i had brought the murder book with me mostly as a prop so i could impress szatmari with it and the access it showed i had i sat down on the couch and spent the time waiting by leafing through it and rereading some of the reports nothing new hit me but i was becoming well versed in the facts of the case this was important because i knew it would help when i sifted through new information to not have to check the murder book every time a half hour went by and then the secretarys phone buzzed and she got the word to send me in szatmari was a solidly built man in his midfifties he looked more like a salesman than an investigator but the walls of his office were hung with commendations and handshake photos testifying to his success as one he pointed me to a chair in front of his cluttered desk and spoke as he wrote something down on a report im busy mr bosch what can i do for you well like i told you yesterday on the phone im working one of your cases i thought maybe we could share some information see if one of us has gone down a road the other hasnt why should i share with you something was wrong he was predisposed not to like me before i had even set foot in his office i wondered if somehow peoples had talked to him about me maybe szatmari had called the lapd or the bureau to check me out and got the word not to cooperate maybe that was why the appointment had been canceled i dont get this i said is something wrong its called solving the case thats why maybe we should share information and how about you would you share with me how much of the reward do you give to me i nodded now i got it the reward mr szatmari you have it wrong you have me wrong sure have reward will travel i see your kind all the time come in here wanting information maybe make some big bucks his accent became more pronounced as he got worked up i flipped open the murder book and found the blackandwhite photocopies of the murder scene photos i tore the page with angella bentons hands on it out of the book and slapped it down on his desk thats why im doing this not the money her i was there that day i was a cop im retired now but i was on this case until they took me off it that probably cuts me out of any reward okay szatmari studied the grainy copy of the photo he then looked at the binder on my lap he then finally looked at me i remember you now your name you were the one who hit one of the robbers with a round i nodded i was there that day but since we never found the robbers its not known for sure who hit who come on eight rentacops and an lapd veteran it was you i think so you know i tried to talk to you back then interview you but the department stonewalled me how come theyd do anything they could to keep other investigations and investigators out of the picture theyre like that over there i know i remember he smiled and leaned back in his seat and now here you are wanting cooperation from me ironic eh very is that the investigative file let me see it please i handed the heavy binder across his desk he put it down and flipped back to the front section and started leafing through the reports until he came to the original offense report the homicide he worked a finger down the page until he came to my name in the block marked io for investigating officer he then closed the murder book but didnt hand it back why now why do you investigate this because i just retired and its one of the ones that wont let go he nodded that he understood our investigation you understand was in regard to the money not the woman its all the same thing you ask me our investigation is no longer active the money is gone by now split up spent without the possibility of recovery there are other cases the moneys been written off i said but she hasnt been not by me not by those who knew her did you know her i met her that day he nodded again seeming to understand what that meant he straightened the corners on a stack of files on his desk did it ever go anywhere i asked did you get close to anything he took a long time answering no not really only dead ends on this one when did you put it aside i dont remember it was a long time ago wheres your file on it i cannot give you my file it is against company policy because of the reward thing right the company doesnt allow you to cooperate with unofficial investigations if theres a reward it can lead to collusion he said nodding also there is the legal jeopardy i dont have the luxury of the protections the police have if my investigative notes and summaries were to become public id be left open to possible lawsuits i tried to think for a minute about how to play this szatmari seemed to be holding something back and whatever it was might be in the file i think he wanted to give it to me but wasnt sure how take a look at the photocopy again i said look at her hands are you a religious man mr szatmari szatmari looked at the photo of angella bentons hands again sometimes i am religious he said are you not really i mean what is religion i dont go to church if thats what it is but i think about religion and i think i have something like it inside a code is like religion you have to believe it you have to practice it the thing is look at her hands mr szatmari i remember when i saw her down on the tile and saw how her hands were i sort of took it as a sign a sign of what i dont know a sign of something like religion thats why this is one of the cases that didnt go away i understand then pull out the file and put it on your desk i said as if giving instruction to someone in a hypnotic trance then go get a cup of coffee or have a smoke and take your time ill wait for you right here szatmari looked at me for a long moment and then reached down to what i guess was a file drawer in the desk he finally took his eyes off me so he could pull the right file he brought it upit was a thick oneand put it down on the desk he then pushed back his chair and got up im going to grab a cup of coffee he said you want something i think ill be fine but thanks he nodded and went out closing the door behind him the moment it clicked i was up out of my seat and moving behind the desk i sat down and dove into the file for the most part szatmaris file was filled with documents i had already seen before there were also copies of contracts and directives between global and its client bankla that were new as well as summaries of interviews with several bank and film company employees szatmari had conducted interviews with every one of the security transport men who had been on the scene the day of the shootout and heist but there was no interview with me as usual the lapd had put up a wall szatmaris request to interview me never even got to me not that i would have accepted the request if i had seen it i had an arrogance then that i hoped i had now lost i scanned the interviews and summaries as fast as i could paying particular attention to the reports pertaining to the three bank employees i hoped to talk to later in the day gordon scaggs linus simonson and jocelyn jones the subjects did not give szatmari much scaggs was the one who handled everything and he was very specific as to the steps he had taken and the planning of the oneday loan of million in cash the interviews with simonson and jones depicted them as worker bees who did what they were told they could have just as easily been putting labels on cans as counting twenty thousand hundreddollar bills and writing down eight hundred serial numbers while they were at it my curiosity meter jumped when i came across documents pertaining to the financial backgrounds of jack dorsey lawton cross and myself szatmari had pulled trw reports on all of us he had apparently called our banks and creditcard companies he wrote short summaries on each of us my record coming out cleanest while cross and dorsey did not fare as well according to szatmari both men carried huge creditcard debt with dorsey in the most difficult financial position because he was divorced but still supporting four children two of whom were in college the door to the office opened and the secretary looked in just about to say something to szatmari when she saw it was me behind his desk what are you doing waiting for mr szatmari he went to get a coffee she put her hands on her ample hips the international sign of indignation did he tell you to go behind his desk and start reading that file it was incumbent upon me not to leave szatmari in a potential jam he told me to wait im waiting well you get right back around to the other side of that desk ill be informing mr szatmari about what i saw i closed the file got up and came around the desk as instructed you know id really appreciate it if you didnt do that i said i dont care what youd appreciate im telling him she then disappeared leaving the door open in her wake a few minutes went by and szatmari stormed in and closed the door sharply he then lost his anger as he turned to face me he was carrying a coffee mug with steam rising out of it thanks for playing it that way he said i just hope you got whatever you needed because now to make good on the little fit i had out there i have to throw you out no problem i said standing up ive got one question though go ahead was that just routine to do the background financials on the cops on the case me jack dorsey and lawton cross szatmari folded his brow as he tried to remember the reason for the financial checks then he shrugged i forgot about that i think i just thought that with the money that was at stake i should check everybody out especially you bosch with the coincidence of you being there at the set at the right moment i nodded it sounded like a solid investigative move are you angry about it me no not mad i was just curious about where it came from thats all anything else helpful maybe you never know good luck then if you dont mind keep me informed of any progress i will ill let you know we shook hands on my way out i passed by the indignant secretary and told her to have a nice day she didnt respond the interview with gordon scaggs went quickly and smoothly he met me at the agreedupon time at the bankla tower in downtown his fortysecondfloor office faced east and had one of the best views of the citys smog i had ever seen his recounting of his involvement in the illfated million loan to eidolon productions deviated in no noticeable way from his statement in the murder book he negotiated a fee for the bank the costs of security included the money was to go out in the morning on the day of filming and come back before pm closing time i knew there was a risk scaggs told me but i saw a nice quick profit for the bank i guess you could say that clouded my vision scaggs turned the money transport issues over to ray vaughn head of bank security while he turned his attention to the chores of insuring the oneday operation through global underwriters and then gathering together the million in cash it would have been highly unusual for a single bankeven the downtown flagshipto have that much money in cash available on one day so in the days before the loan took place scaggs had to arrange for cash shipments from various bankla branches to the downtown location on the day of the loan the money was loaded into an armored vehicle and driven from downtown to the movie set in hollywood ray vaughn rode in a lead car he was in constant radio contact with the driver of the armored truck and led him on a meandering course through hollywood in an effort to determine if they were being followed when they arrived at the set location they were met by more armed security and linus simonson one of the assistants who had helped scaggs pull the cash together and had created the list of serial numbers the insurance company had demanded and of course the bank entourage was met by the hooded and heavily armed robbers as well one thing new i got from scaggs during the initial part of the interview was that bank policy had changed since the heist bankla no longer engaged in what he called boutique cash loans to the movie industry what is that saying he asked once burned is an education twice burned is just plain stupidity well were not stupid here mr bosch were not going to get burned by those people again i nodded in agreement so you feel confident it was those people where this came from the heist originated over there and not here within the bank scaggs looked indignant at the very thought of anything else i should say so look at the poor girl who was murdered she worked for them not me true but her murder could have been part of the plan to throw suspicion on the movie production instead of the bank impossible the police have been over this place with a finetooth comb same with the insurance company we received a clean bill of health from everyone involved we are absolutely onehundredpercent clean on this i nodded again then i guess you wont mind if i talk to your employees too id like to speak to linus simonson and jocelyn jones scaggs realized hed been cornered how could he not let me speak to employees after that ringing endorsement of honesty and innocence on the banks behalf the answer is yes and no he said jocelyn is still with us shes an assistant branch manager now in west hollywood i dont think there will be a problem talking to her and linus simonson linus never came back to us after that awful day i guess you know he got shot up by those bastards him and ray ray didnt make it but linus did he was in the hospital and then he was on sick leave and then he didnt want to come back at all and i cant see as i blame him he quit thats right i had not seen mention of this in the murder book or even in szatmaris records i knew the investigation was most intense in the days and weeks after the heist this was probably when simonson was still recovering and still technically an employee the investigative records generated at this time would have no reason to mention his leaving employment at the bank do you know where he went from here i used to i dont now but to lay it all out there for you linus went and got himself a lawyer who started making liability claims you know that the bank put linus in harms way and all of this nonsense none of the claims mentioned that he volunteered to be out there that day he wanted to be there sure he was a young guy he grew up in town and probably had hollywood aspirations at one time or another everybody does he thought spending the day on the set being the guy in charge of the money would be a good deal he volunteered and i said fine go i wanted somebody from my office there anyway besides ray vaughn i mean so did simonson actually sue the bank or just make noise with his lawyer he made noise but he made enough noise that legal settled him out they gave him a chunk of cash and he went away i heard he used it to buy a nightclub how much they give him i dont know one time i asked our attorney jim foreman what the kid got and he wouldnt tell me he said terms of the settlement were confidential but from what i understand this club he bought it was a nice one one of those hollywoodtype places i thought of the portrait i had looked at in the legal library while waiting to see janis langwiser your lawyer is james foreman not my lawyer the banks lawyer outside counsel they decided not to keep it inhouse because of the possible conflict i nodded do you know the name of the club he bought no i dont i sat there looking past scaggs at the smog through the window behind him i was seeing but not seeing i had gone inside where i was feeling the first stirrings of instinct and excitement of the state of grace that comes with my religion mr bosch scaggs said dont disappear on me ive got an officers meeting in five minutes i came out of it and looked at him sorry sir im done here for now but before your meeting can you call jocelyn jones and tell her im coming out to see her i need to know where the branch is too that will be no problem on the way to the west hollywood branch of bankla to see jocelyn jones i had some time to kill so i drove west on hollywood boulevard i had not been down there much since my retirement and i wanted to see the old beat according to the newspaper it was changing and i wanted to see this for myself the asphalt on the boulevard still glittered in the sunlight but the storefronts and office buildings near vine still slumbered beneath the patina of a half century of smog no difference there but once past cahuenga and onto highland i saw where the new hollywood was springing to life new hotelsand im not talking about the type with hourly ratesand theaters people centers with popular upstyle restaurant franchises anchoring them the streets and sidewalks were crowded the brass stars imbedded in the sidewalks were polished it was safer and cleaner but less genuine still the word that popped into my head was hope there was a sense of hope and vigor there was a definite vibe coming off the street and i guess i liked it the idea i knew was that the vibe would spread from this core area and move down the boulevard like an earthquake wave leaving renovation and reinvention in its wake a few years ago i would have been first to say the plan had no chance but maybe i was wrong still feeling lucky from vegas i decided to let the vibe ride and dropped down fairfax to third and pulled into the farmers market to grab something to eat the market was another remake job i had stayed away from there was a new parking garage and openair people center built next to the old clapboard market with its comforting combination of good cheap food and kitsch i think i liked it better when you could just pull into a parking space next to the newsstand but i had to admit they had done it right it was the old and new sitting side by side and getting along i walked through the new section past the department stores and the biggest bookstore i had ever seen and into the old bobs donuts was still there and every other place that i remembered it was crowded people were happy it was too late in the day for a doughnut so i picked up a blt and change for a dollar at the kokomo café and ate the sandwich in one of the oldtime phone booths that they had left in place next to the dupars i called roy lindell first and caught him eating at his desk what do you have tuna on rye with pickles thats sick yeah what do you have blt doublesmoked bacon from kokomos well that beats me all to hell what do you want bosch last time i saw you you wanted nothing to do with me in fact i thought you went to vegas i did go but im back and things are smoothing out now you could say ive come to an understanding with your pals on the ninth floor you want back in on this thing or you want to pout about it you got something maybe not much more than a feeling at the moment what do you want from me i shoved my sandwich wrapper off the murder book and opened it to get the information i needed see what you can come up with on a guy named linus simonson thirtyoneyearold white male he owns a club in town whats it called i dont know yet thats great you want me to pick up your dry cleaning while im at it just run the name youll get a hit or you wont i gave him simonsons birthdate and the address listed in the murder book although i had a feeling it was old who is he i told him about simonsons former work at bankla and about him being shot during the movie set heist the guy was a victim you think he set it up and told his guys to shoot him in the ass i dont know and whats he got to do with marty gessler i dont know maybe nothing probably nothing but i just want to check him out something doesnt seem right to me okay you keep having the hunches and ill do the legwork bosch anything else look if you dont want to do it just say so ill get somebody else to look i said ill do it and i will anything else i hesitated but not for too long yeah one other thing can you run a plate for me give it to me i gave him the number i had gotten off the car eleanor had been driving it was still in my memory and i figured it would stay there until i checked it out nevada lindell asked suspicion obvious in his voice this have to do with your trip to vegas or this thing over here i should have known lindell was a lot of things but stupid wasnt one of them i had already opened the door i had to step inside i dont know i lied but could you just get me the registration on it if the car as i suspected was registered in someone other than eleanors name i could make up a story about thinking i had been followed and lindell would never know the difference all right the fbi agent said i gotta go call me later i hung up and that was that guilt washed around me like the waves hitting the pylons under the pier i might be able to fool lindell with the request but not myself i was running a check on my former wife i wondered if i was capable of doing anything lower trying not to dwell on it i picked up the receiver and dumped more change into the phone i called janis langwiser and realized as i waited for her to answer that i might be about to answer the question i had just posed to myself langwisers secretary said she was on a phone call and she would have to call me back i said i wasnt reachable but would call back in fifteen minutes i hung up and walked around the market spending the most time in a small store that sold only hot sauce hundreds of different brands of it i wasnt sure when i would use it because i rarely cooked at home anymore but i bought a bottle of gator squeezins because i liked the place and i needed more change for the call back next stop was the bakery not to buy just to look when i was a kid and my mother was still around she used to take me to the farmers market on saturday mornings what i remember most was watching through the bakery window when the cakemaker would dress the cakes people ordered for birthdays and holidays and weddings he would make grand designs on the top of each cake squeezing the icing through a funnel his thick forearms covered in flour and sugar my mother usually had to hold me up at the window so i could see the top of the cake being decorated sometimes she would think i was watching the cakemaker but i was really watching her in the reflection of the window trying to figure out what was wrong when she would grow tired of holding me up shed go grab a chair from the nearby restaurant seating areawhat they now call a food court in the mallsand i would stand on that i used to look at the cakes and imagine what parties they would go to and how many people were going to be there it seemed like those cakes could only go to happy places but i could tell that when the baker was icing a wedding cake it made my mother sad the bakery and the cakemakers window were still there i stood in front of the glass with my bag of hot sauce but there was no baker there i knew it was too late in the day the cakes were made early each day so they would be ready for pickup or delivery for birthday parties and weddings and anniversaries and things like that on the rack next to the window i looked at the selection of stainless steel funnel tips the baker could use to make various designs and flowers out of icing no use waiting hes done for the day i didnt need to turn in the reflection of the window i saw an old lady walking by behind me it made me think of my mother again yeah i said i think you are right the second time i went into the phone booth and called langwiser she was available and picked up right away is everything okay yeah fine good you scared me what are you talking about you told roxanne that you couldnt be reached i thought maybe you were in a cell or something oh sorry i didnt think about that im just not using the cell phone still you think they are still listening i dont know just precautions so is this just your daily checkin sort of ive got a question too im listening maybe it was because of the way i hadnt told lindell the whole truth or because of the way checking out eleanor made me feel but i decided not to run a play on langwiser i decided to simply play the cards i had a few years ago your firm handled a case the attorney was james foreman and the client was bankla yes the banks a client what was the case i wasnt here a few years ago i closed the door to the phone booth even though i knew it would quickly get hot in the tiny cubicle i dont know what it was called but the other partys name was linus simonson he worked for the bank as an assistant to the vice president he took a bullet in the shootout during the movie set heist okay i remember somebody was wounded and somebody was killed but i dont remember the names he was the wounded the dead guy was ray vaughn chief of security for the bank simonson lived in fact he only took a round in the ass probably a ricochet if i remember the way the shooting team worked it out so he then sued the bank im not sure if it went that far the point is he was out on medical for a while and then decided he didnt want to come back he got a lawyer and started making noise about the bank being liable for putting him in a position where he was in harms way sounds reasonable even though he volunteered to be there he had helped put the money together and then volunteered to babysit it during the movie shoot well it still was probably actionable he could make a case for volunteering under duress or yeah i know all of that im not worried about whether he had a case or not he apparently did because the bank settled and james foreman handled it okay so where is this going what is your question i reopened the door of the booth so i could get some fresh air i want to know what he settled for how much did he get ill call jim foreman right now you want to hold uh its not that simple i think there was a confidentiality agreement there was silence from her and i actually smiled while i waited it had felt good to just come out with what i wanted i see langwiser finally said so you want me to violate that by finding out what he got well when you put it that way what other way is there to put it im working this thing and hes come up simonson and it would just help me a lot if i knew how big a chunk of cash the bank gave him it would help me a lot janis again my words were met with a long silence im not going to go snooping through files in my own firm she finally said im not going to do anything that could get me in the shit the best thing i can do is just go to jim and ask him and see what he says okay it was better than i thought i would get the wedge i have is that bankla remains a client if you are saying that this guy simonson might have been part of this heist which lost the bank two million and its chief of security then he might be inclined hey thats good i had thought of that angle but wanted her to come to it i started to get jazzed i thought maybe shed be able to get what i needed from foreman dont get excited harry not yet okay ill see what i can do and then ill call you and dont worry if i have to leave a message on your home number it will be in code okay janis thanks i hung up and left the booth on the way back through the market in the direction of the parking garage i passed the cake window and was surprised to see that the baker was there i stopped for a minute and watched it must have been a lastminute order because it looked like the cake had been taken out of one of the inside display cabinets it was already iced the man behind the window was just putting on flowers and lettering i waited until he wrote the message it was pink writing on a field of chocolate it said happy birthday callie i hoped it was another cake going to a happy place jocelyn jones worked in a branch bank on santa monica at san vicente in a county for decades known as the bank robbery capital of the world she was in about as safe a location as was possible her branch was right across the street from the sheriffs departments west hollywood station the branch was a twostory art deco job with a curving façade with large round windows along its second level inside the tellers counter and newaccounts desks were on the first floor and the executive offices upstairs i found jones up there in an office with a porthole that looked over the sheriffs compound to the pacific design center known locally as the blue whale because from some angles its bluesheathed façade looked like the tail of a humpback protruding from the ocean jones smiled and invited me to sit down mr scaggs told me you would be coming by and that it was all right to talk to you he said you were working on the robbery thats right im glad it hasnt been forgotten about well im glad to hear you say that what can i do for you im not sure im sort of retracing a lot of steps that were taken before so it might be repetitive but id just like to hear you talk about your part in it ill ask questions if i come up with any well there isnt a whole lot for me to tell i mean i wasnt there like linus and poor mr vaughn were i was mostly around the money before it was transported i was an assistant at that time to mr scaggs hes been my mentor with the company i nodded and smiled like i thought it was all nice i was moving slowly the plan being to gradually steer her in the direction i wanted to go so you worked on the money you counted it packaged it got it ready where was that at the downtown center we were in a vault the whole time the money came in to us from the branches and we did everything right there without ever leaving except you know at the end of the day it took about three three and a half days to get everything ready mostly waiting for it to come in from the branches when you say us you mean linus i opened the murder book on my lap as if to check a name i didnt recall simonson she said for me right linus simonson you worked on this together correct thats right was mr scaggs his mentor too she shook her head and slightly blushed i think but it was hard to tell because she was very darkskinned no the mentoring program is a minority program i should say was they suspended it a year ago anyway linus is white he grew up in beverly hills his father owned a bunch of restaurants and i dont think he needed a mentor i nodded okay so you and linus were in there for three days putting all of this money together you also had to record serial numbers off the bills right yes we did that too how was that done she didnt answer for a moment as she tried to remember she swiveled slowly back and forth in her chair i watched a sheriffs helicopter land on the roof of the station across santa monica what i remember is that it was supposed to be random she said so we just took bills out of the bricks at random i think we had to get about a thousand numbers and record them that took a long time too i leafed through the murder book until i found a copy of the currency report she and simonson had put together i unsnapped the binders rings and removed the report according to this you recorded eight hundred of the bills oh okay eight hundred then is this the report i handed it to her and she studied it looking at each page and her signature at the bottom of the last page it looks like it but its been four years yes i know that was the last time you saw itwhen you signed it no after the robbery i saw it when i was questioned by the detectives they asked if that was the report and you said it was yes okay going back to when you and linus made this report how did that go she shrugged linus and i just took turns typing the numbers into his laptop isnt there some sort of computer scanner or copier that could have recorded the serial numbers much more easily there is but it wouldnt work for what we had to do we had to randomly select and record bills from every pack but keep each recorded bill in its original pack that way if the money was stolen and split up there would be a chance of tracing every pack i nodded who told you to do it that way well i guess it came down from mr skaggs or maybe mr vaughn mr vaughn was the one who dealt with security and the instructions from the insurance company okay so you are in the vault with linus how exactly did you record the money oh linus thought it would take forever if we wrote down the numbers and then had to type them into a computer so he brought his laptop in and we entered them directly one of us would read off the number while the other typed which one of you did which we both did we switched you might think sitting at a table with two million dollars in cash on it is a real thrill but it actually was boring so we switched around sometimes i read and he typed and then id type while he read out the numbers i thought about this trying to see how it could have worked it might appear that having two employees put the list together would provide a doublechecking system but it didnt whether simonson was reading off numbers or entering them on the laptop computer he was controlling the data he could have made up numbers in either position and jones would not have known it unless she looked at either the bill or the computer screen okay i said then when you were finished you printed out the computer file and signed the report right right i mean i think so it was a while back is that your signature on there she flipped to the last page of the document and checked she nodded thats it i held out my hand and she gave me the document back who took the report to mr scaggs probably linus he printed it out why are all of these details so important her first suspicion of where i was going i didnt answer i flipped the report she had been studying to the back page and looked at the signatures myself her signature was below simonsons and above scaggss scrawl it had been the order of signing simonson then her then it was taken to scaggs for final signoff as i held the report up to the light from the porthole i thought i saw something i hadnt noticed before it was only a photocopy of the original or maybe even a copy of a copy but even still there were gradations in the ink in jocelyn joness signature it was something i had seen before on another case what is it jones asked i looked at her while putting the document back into the murder book excuse me you looked like you saw something important oh nothing im just looking at everything i have just a few more questions good i should get downstairs were closing soon ill get out of your hair then mr vaughn was he part of this process in which the money was prepared and the serial numbers documented she shook her head once not really he sort of supervised us and came in a lot especially when the money came in from the branches or the federal reserve he was in charge of that i guess did he come in when you guys were dictating the numbers and typing them into the computer i dont remember i think he did like i said he came in a lot i think he liked linus so he came in a lot what do you mean he liked linus well you know you mean mr vaughn was gay she shrugged i think he was but not in an open way it was a secret i guess it was no big deal what about linus no hes not gay thats why i dont think he liked mr vaughn coming in so much did he say that to you or was that just your take on it no he sort of said something about it one day like he joked saying he was going to have a sexual harassment suit if this keeps up something like that i nodded i didnt know if this meant anything to the case or not you didnt answer my question before what was that about why you are focusing so much on all of this the currency numbers i mean and linus and mr vaughn im not really it just seems that way to you because that is the part of this you are familiar with but im trying to be thorough about all aspects of this do you ever hear from linus anymore she seemed surprised by the question me no i visited him in the hospital once right after the shooting he never came back to work so i never saw him again we worked together but we werent really friends different sides of the tracks i guess i always thought that was why mr scaggs picked us what do you mean well we werent really friends and linus was you know linus i think mr scaggs picked two people that were different and werent friends so we wouldnt get any ideas about the money i nodded and didnt say anything she seemed to go off into a thought and then she shook her head in a selfdeprecating way what nothing its just that i was thinking about going to see him at one of the clubs but thought they probably wouldnt even let me in and if i said i knew him it might be embarrassing you know if they called him and he acted like he didnt remember or something clubs there is more than one she closed her eyes to suspicious slits you told me you were being thorough but you really dont even know who he is now do you i shrugged who is he now hes linus like he only uses his first name now hes famous he and his partners own the top clubs in hollywood now its like where all the celebrities go to see and be seen lines out the door and velvet ropes how many clubs i think at least four or five now i dont really keep track they started with the one and then they kept adding how many partners are there i dont know there was a magazine storywait a second i think i saved it she bent down and opened a drawer at the bottom of her desk i heard her shuffling its contents around and then she came out with a copy of los angeles magazine the coffeetable monthly she started turning its pages it was a glossy magazine that listed restaurants in the back and usually ran two or three long feature articles on living and dying in la behind the gloss was a bite though twice over the years writers from the magazine had done stories on my cases i always thought they had come closest of any media reports to the truth of a crime in terms of its effects on a family or neighborhood the ripple effect i dont know why i was holding on to this jones said a bit embarrassed after just saying she didnt keep track of her former coworker i guess because i knew him yeah here she turned the magazine around there was a twopage opening spread on the story under a headline that said the night kings there was an accompanying photo of four young men posed side by side behind a dark mahogany bar behind them were shelves of colored bottles lit from beneath can i see that she closed it and handed it across the desk to me you can have it like i said i dont think ill ever be seeing linus again he has no time for me he did what he said he was going to do and thats that i looked up from the magazine to her what do you mean what did he tell you he was going to do when i saw him in the hospital he told me the bank owed him a lot of money for getting shot in the uh you know he said he was going to get it quit his job and open up a bar he said he wouldnt make the mistakes his dad made his dad i didnt know what that meant i didnt ask but for some reason opening that bar was linuss life ambition to be king of the night i guess well he got there her voice had a mixture of longing and jealousy in it it didnt work well with her and i wished i could tell her what i thought of her hero but i didnt i didnt have everything i needed yet thinking i had taken the interview about as far as i could i stood up and held up the magazine thanks for your time are you sure you dont mind me taking this she waved me off no go ahead ive looked at it enough one of these nights i ought to just put on my black jeans and black tshirt and go on down and see if i can catch linus for a minute we could talk about the good old days but he probably doesnt want to hear about them nobody does jocelyn because the old days werent that good i got up i wanted to offer her some words of encouragement i wanted to tell her not to be jealous that what she had and what shed accomplished were things to be proud of but the sheriffs helicopter took off and banked across the street and over the bank the place shook like an earthquake and took my words with it i left jocelyn jones sitting there thinking about the other side of the tracks the magazine had been published seven months earlier the story on linus simonson and his partners was not a cover story but it was hyped on the cover with a line that said hollywoods after hours entrepreneurs the story was hooked to the impending opening of a sixth club in the foursomes lineup of allstar latenight establishments the article referred to simonson as the king of the night crawlers the one who parlayed the whole empire out of one holeinthewall bar he had bought with a legal settlement he had taken that first club in an alley off of hollywood and cahuenga renovated it cut the lighting in half and brought in female bartenders who were prized more for their looks and tattoos than their skills at mixing drinks and adding bar tabs he played the music loud charged a cover and didnt let anyone in wearing a tie or a white shirt the club had no name on the wall outside and no listing in the phone book a flashing neon blue arrow over the front door was the only indication of a commercial venture but soon the arrow was no longer needed and was removed because there was always a line of clubbers stretching from the door down the alley the article stated that linushe was referred to by first name through most of the articlethen partnered up with three buddies from his days at beverly hills high school and started opening new clubs at a rate of one every six months the entrepreneurs primarily followed the pattern that worked with the first club buy a rundown establishment renovate and reopen put the word into the pipeline and wait for it to spread through the ranks of the hollywood cool after the nameless bar the lounges the group opened tended in style and name to follow a literary or musical theme the second bar the group bought closed and then reopened was nats day of the locusts a nod to nathanael west and his classic hollywood novel it wasnt their name the place had been known as simply nats for decades and most patrons probably believed it was named for nat king cole either way the name was cool and the group kept it nats was also the same place dorsey and cross had gotten shot up in the article reported that the murder had acted to depress the sales price of the place in fact it was a steal but once the bar was reopenedwithout a name changeand marketed to the night crawlers the places history only added to its mystique it was another immediate and huge success for the high school pals who called their burgeoning company four kings incorporated for a long time in my life i did not believe in coincidence i now know better but there are coincidences and there are coincidences kiz rider coming to my house and laying the high jingo on me as art pepper was playing itthat was coincidence but as i sat in the mercedes and read the magazine article i wasnt accepting the happenstance of linus simonson buying the bar in which two detectives who investigated the heist of million he counted and prepared for shipment were shot i didnt think it was coincidence for a moment i thought it was pure arrogance besides the nameless bar and nats the foursome also opened places called kings crossing chets and cozys last stand named according to the article after a friend who had disappeared the place which had occasioned the magazine story and was due to open was to be called doghouse reillys after an alias used by private eye philip marlowe in a raymond chandler novel the story didnt delve deeply into the financing behind the fourman operation it was more interested in the glitz than the underpinnings of the supposed success story it was taken and reported as a given that the first establishments supported the groups expansion in a continuing cycle profits from the first bar financed the second and so on but the picture wasnt purely positive the articles writer ended the story with a suggestion that the four kings might become victims of their own success the theory espoused was that the population of blackclad night crawlers was finite in hollywood and that opening and operating six lounges did not convincingly expand the client base it only spread it out the article noted that there were also many pretenders to the throne a raft of inferior uncool bars and lounges that had opened in recent years the story ended by noting that on a recent friday night at midnight there was no line of night crawlers waiting to get into the nameless club it cynically suggested that it might be time to put up the blue arrow again i dropped the magazine into the binder and sat there thinking about things i had the sense that things were coming together i felt anxious because i knew instinctively i was close i didnt have all the answers but experience told me that they would come what i had was the direction it had been more than four years since i had looked down on angella bentons body and i finally had a solid suspect i opened the center console and got out the cell phone i figured there would be no harm in calling my own home number i checked messages and found i had two the first was from janis langwiser it was short and sweet its me call me but use all precautions i knew that meant a pay phone the next message was from roy lindell he also followed the standard of brevity all right asshole ive got something for you call me i looked around i was parked in front of a post office on san vicente my meter was up and i was out of change for both the parking and the calls i needed to make but i figured there would be a phone inside the post office and a machine for getting change to buy stamps from other machines i got out and went in the main post office was closed but in an outer room that was open after hours i found the machine and pay phone i was looking for i called langwiser first because i figured that i had already moved the investigation past the information i had asked lindell to get for me i got langwiser on her cell but she was still in her office what did you get from foreman i asked getting right to the point this has to remain highly confidential harry i did talk to jim and when i explained the circumstances he didnt mind talking to me about it the caveat being that this information goes into no reports and you never reveal its source no problem i dont write reports anymore anyway dont be so quick and cavalier about it youre not a cop anymore and youre no lawyer you have no legal shield i have a private eye ticket like i said you have no shield if a judge ever ordered you to reveal your source you would have to do it or face contempt that would mean possibly going to jail excops in jail dont do so well tell me about it i just did okay i understand its still no problem the truth was i couldnt see how this would ever come up in a court and with a judge i wasnt worried about the possibility of jail okay as long as were clear jim told me that simonson settled for fifty thousand dollars thats all thats it and it really isnt that much he was represented by a thirtyfive percenter he also had to pay filing costs hed had a lawyer who took a percent cut of any settlement in exchange for working the case without hourly billing it meant that simonson probably cleared a little over thirty grand it wasnt a lot when it came to quitting your day job and starting a latenight lounge empire the sense of anxiety i had been feeling ticked into a higher gear i had suspected that the settlement would be low but not that low i was beginning to convince myself did foreman say anything else about the case just one other thing he said that it was simonson who insisted on the confidentiality agreement and that the agreement itself was unusual it required that there be not only no public announcement about the settlement but no public record of it well it never went to court anyway i know but bankla is a publicly held corporation so what the confidentiality agreement entailed was that simonson be carried under a pseudonym on all financial records related to the payout hes carried again at his request as mr king i didnt respond as i thought about this so how did i do harry you did real good janis which reminds me youve been doing a hell of a lot of work on this are you sure you dont want to bill me yes im sure i still owe you well now ill owe you i want you to do one last thing for me i just decided that tomorrow im going to give what ive got to the powers that be it might be good if you were there you know to sort of make sure i dont step across any lines with these people im there where you want to check your calendar first i already know i have the morning free you want to do it here or are you going into the police station no ive got butting jurisdictions id like to do it at your place you have a room we can put about six or seven people in ill book the conference room what time how about nine oclock fine ill be here early if you want to come in and talk first and go over everything that would be good ill see you about eightthirty ill be here do you think you have it i knew what she meant did i have the story if not the actual evidence that would push the lapd and fbi into running with the case again its coming together theres maybe one more thing i can do and then ive got to give it to somebody who can get warrants and knock down doors i get it ill see you tomorrow and im glad you made it through on this i really am yeah me too thanks janis after hanging up i realized i had forgotten about the parking meter i went out to feed it but it was too late west hollywood parking enforcement had beat me there i left the ticket on the windshield and went back inside i got lindell in his office just before he was leaving for the day what do you got herpes simplex five what do you got come on man youre an asshole bosch asking me to wash your dirty laundry i realized what he was mad about the plate number yeah the plate number as if you didnt know it belongs to your exwife man and i really dont appreciate being pulled into your bullshit i mean either kill her or get over her you know what i mean i agreed that i knew what he meant but not what he had suggested i could tell that i had seriously put him out with the plate check roy all i can tell you is that i didnt know im sorry youre right i shouldnt drag you in and i am sorry i did there was silence and i thought that i had placated him roy what did you write down the address from the registration you fucking asshole he vented for another minute but eventually grudgingly gave me the address eleanors car was registered to there was no apartment number with it it looked like she had not only come up a level in wheels she was living in a house now thanks roy its the last time on that i promise anything come up on the other thing i asked about nothing good nothing useful the guys record is pretty clean there is some juvenile stuff but its all sealed i didnt go any further with it okay i wondered if the juvenile stuff involved his former beverly hills high classmates and now partners the only other thing is that hes a junior there is another linus simonson on the computer going by the age it looks like daddy whats he on there for hes got an irs rap and a bankruptcy its all old stuff how old the irs came first like they usually do that was in ninetyfour the old man went bankrupt two years later who is this guy linus and why did you want me to check him for a tail i didnt answer as i found myself looking into a most wanted picture on the post office wall a serial rapist but i wasnt really looking at him i was looking at linus i was working the interior circuits as another piece fell into place linus said he wasnt going to make the same mistakes as his father who had gone bellyup and broke an irs collar around his neck the question that poked through all of that was how does a guy with no job and no backing from daddy parlay the thirty grand hes got in his pocket into the purchase and major renovation of a bar and then another and then another loans maybeif he qualified or maybe with a million bank withdrawal bosch you there i came out of it yeah im here i asked you a question who is this guy is he on the movie deal its looking like it roy what are you doing tomorrow morning im doing what im always doing why if you want a piece of this be at my lawyers office at nine and dont be late is this guy connected to marty if hes the guy i dont want a piece i want all of it i dont know yet but hell get us closer thats for sure lindell wanted to ask more questions but i cut him off i had more calls to make i gave him langwisers name and address and he finally said he would be at the law office at nine i hung up and then called sandor szatmari and left a message inviting him to the same meeting lastly i called kiz rider in the administration office at parker center and extended the invitation to her as well she went from zero to sixty on the anger speedometer in about five seconds harry i warned you about this you are going to find yourself in a lot of trouble you cant just work a case and then call in a gang bang when you think its time we were made privy to your private investigations kiz i already did you just have to decide if you want to be there or not there will be a nice piece of this for somebody at the lapd as far as im thinking it might as well be you but if youre not interested ill call rhd goddamnit harry in or out there was a long pause im in but harry im not going to protect you i wouldnt expect it who is your lawyer i gave her the information and was ready to hang up i felt a sense of dread about the damage to our relationship it seemed permanent to me okay see you then i finally said yes you will she replied sternly i remembered something i needed oh and kiz see if you can find the original of the currency report it should be in the murder book what currency report i explained and she said she would look for it i thanked her and hung up i went out to my car and grabbed the parking ticket off the windshield i got in and threw it over my shoulder into the backseat for good luck it was almost seven on the dashboard clock i knew things didnt get going in the hollywood club scene until ten or later but i had forward momentum and didnt want it to ebb away while i just went home and waited i sat there thinking with my hand over the top of the wheel ticking my fingertips on the dashboard soon they were going through the phrasing that quentin mckinzie had taught me and when i realized this i knew how i could spend the next few hours i opened up the cell phone again sugar ray mck was waiting for me in his chair in his room at the splendid age the only indication that he knew he was going out was the porkpie hat he was wearing he once told me he only wore it when he went out to hear music which meant he rarely wore it anymore under the brim his eyes were sharper than i had seen them in a long while this is going to be fun dog he said and i wondered if hed been watching too much mtv i hope theyve got a decent crew for the first set i didnt even check dont worry itll be fine he drew out the last word before we go can i borrow that magnifying glass you use to read the tv guide sure can what do you need he dug the glass out of a pocket on the arm of his chair while i took the last page of the currency report out of my shirt pocket and unfolded it sugar ray handed me the glass and i went over to the bed table and turned on the lamp i held the page over the top of the shade and then studied jocelyn joness signature with the magnifier i got a confirmation of something i had seen earlier while in her office what is it harry sugar ray asked i handed him the glass back and started refolding the paper just something ive been working on something called forgers tremor hmmm man i got tremors all over i smiled at him weve all got em one way or the other come on lets go lets hear some music im going you turn that lamp off that costs money we headed out as we went down the hallway i thought of melissa royal and wondered if she might be visiting her mother i doubted it a moment of dread spiked me because i knew the day was coming when i would have to sit down with melissa and tell her i was the wrong guy a porter from the center helped me get sugar ray into the car the mercedes suv was probably too high for him to climb into i realized i would have to think about that if i took him out on any more field trips we went over to the baked potato and had dinner and watched the first set of the first act a quartet of journeymen called four squared they were decent but maybe a little tired they were partial to billy strayhorns stuff and so am i so it didnt matter it didnt matter to sugar ray either his face lit up and he kept the beat in his shoulders as he listened he never spoke while they played and he clapped with enthusiasm after every song reverence is what i saw in his eyes reverence for the sound and the form the players didnt recognize him few people would now that he was down to just skin and bones but that didnt bother sugar ray it didnt diminish our evening by one note after the first set i could see him starting to flag it was after nine and time for him to sleep and dream hed told me once that he still could play in his dreams i thought we should all be so lucky it was also time for me to look into the face of the man who had taken angella benton from this world i had no badge and no official standing but i knew things and believed that i still stood for her i spoke for her in the morning they could take it all away from me make me sit down and watch from the sidelines but i still had until then and i knew i was not going home just yet i was going to confront linus simonson and take his measure i was going to let him know who put the bead on him and i was going to give him the chance to answer for angella benton when we got back to the splendid age i left sugar ray dozing in the front seat while i went in to get the porter getting him into the mercedes outside the baked potato by myself had been a chore i gently shook him awake and then we got him down onto the sidewalk we walked him in and then down the hall to his room sitting on his bed trying to shake off the sleep he asked me where id been ive been right here with you sugar ray youve been practicing every chance i get i realized that he may have already forgotten our evenings outing he may have thought i was there for a lesson i felt bad about him being robbed of the memory so soon sugar ray ive gotta go ive got some work to do okay henry its harry thats what i said oh you want me to turn on the box or are you going to go to sleep nah put the box on for me if you dont mind thatd be good i turned on the television that was mounted on the wall it was on cnn and sugar ray said to leave it there i went over and squeezed his shoulder and then headed for the door lush life he said to my back i turned around to look at him he was smiling lush life was the last song of the set we had heard he did remember i love that song he said yeah me too i left him to his memories of a lush life while i headed out into the night to see a king about a stolen life i was unarmed but unafraid i was in a state of grace i carried the last prayer of angella benton with me shortly after ten oclock i approached the doorway to nats on cherokee a half block south of hollywood boulevard it was still early but there was no line of people waiting to get in there was no velvet rope there was no doorman selecting who got in and who didnt there was no collector of a cover charge when i got inside there also were almost no customers i had been in nats on numerous occasions in its former incarnation as a dive bar populated by a clientele as devoted to alcohol as any other aspect of life it wasnt a pickup spotunless you counted the prostitutes who cooled their heels at the bar it wasnt a celebritywatching spot it was a drinking spot and that was the sum of its entire purpose and as such it had an honest character as i walked in and saw all the polished brass and rich woods i realized that what it had now was glamour and that was never the same or as longlasting as character it didnt matter how many people lined up on opening night the place wasnt going to go the distance i knew that within fifteen seconds the place was doomed before the first citron martini was poured shaken not stirred into its frosted glass and placed on a black napkin i went right to the bar where there were three patrons who looked like tourists in from florida after a dose of much needed california cool the bartender was tall and thin and wore the requisite black jeans and tight body shirt that allowed her nipples to introduce themselves to the customers she had a blackink snake wrapped around one bicep its forked red tongue licking the crook of her elbow where the needle scars were evident her hair was shorter than mine and on the nape of her neck a bar code was tattooed it made me think of how much i enjoyed discovering eleanor wishs neck the night before theres a tendollar cover the bartender said what can i get you i remembered from the magazine article that it used to be what does it cover this place is dead stick around thats ten dollars i made no move to give her the money i leaned on the bar and spoke quietly wheres linus hes not here tonight then where is he i need to talk to him hes probably at chets thats where he keeps his office he doesnt usually start bopping around to the places until after midnight are you going to pay the ten i dont think so im leaving she frowned youre a cop arent you i smiled proudly going on twentyeight years i left off the part about the twentyeight years coming before i retired i figured shed get on the phone and send the word a cop was coming that might work in my favor i reached in my pocket and pulled out a ten i tossed it onto the bar thats not the cover thats for you get a haircut she put an exaggerated smile on her face one that showed she had a nice set of dimples she snatched the ten thanks dad i smiled as i walked out it took me fifteen minutes to get over to chets on santa monica near labrea i had the address thanks to los angeles magazine which had conveniently put a listing of all of the four kings establishments in a box on the last page of the story again there was no line and few customers i was beginning to think that once you are declared cool in the tourist books and magazines then youre dead in the water chets was almost a carbon copy of nats right down to the sullen bartender with the notsosubtle nipples and tattoos the one thing i liked about the place was the music chet bakers cool burnin was playing when i walked in and i thought maybe the kings might have some taste after all the bartender was déjà vu all over againtall thin and in black except her bicep tattoo was marilyn monroes face circa happy birthday mr president you the cop she asked before i said a word youve been talking to your sister i guess she told you i dont pay cover she said something about that wheres linus hes in his office i told him you were coming that was nice of you i stepped away from the bar but pointed at her tattoo your mom hey come here take a look i leaned back over the bar she bent her elbow and flexed her muscles repeatedly marilyns cheeks puffed up and then down as the bicep beneath expanded and contracted kind of looks like shes giving a blow job doesnt it the bartender said thats real cute i said i bet you show that to all the boys is it worth ten bucks i almost told her i knew places where i could get the real thing for a ten but let it go i left her there and found my way to a hallway behind the bar there were doors for the rest rooms and then a door marked management only i didnt knock i just went through and it only led to a continuation of the hallway and more doors the third door down said linus on it i opened that one without knocking too linus simonson was sitting behind a cluttered desk i recognized him from the magazine photo he had a bottle of scotch whiskey and a snifter on the desk there was a black leather couch in the office and on it sat a man i also recognized from the magazine as one of the partners his name was james oliphant he had his feet up on a coffee table and looked like he wasnt the least bit concerned by a visit from a man hed been told was a cop hey man you the cop simonson said as he waved me in close the door i stepped in and introduced myself i didnt say i was a cop well im linus and that theres jim whats up what can we do for you i held my hands out as though i had nothing to hide im not sure what you can do for me i just wanted to drop by and sort of introduce myself im working on the angella benton case and of course that includes the bankla case so here i am oh man bankla thats some serious ancient history there he looked at his partner and laughed that was like another lifetime ago i dont want to go there man thats a bad memory yeah well not as bad for you as it was for angella benton simonson suddenly got serious and leaned forward on his desk i dont get this man what are you doing here youre not a cop cops come in twos if you are a cop then you arent legit what do you want let me see a badge i didnt tell anybody i had a badge i was a cop but not now in fact i thought maybe youd recognize me from that other lifetime you were talking about simonson looked at oliphant and smirked recognize you from what i was there that day you took it in the ass im talking about the bullet but then again you were rolling around and screaming so much you probably didnt have time to look at me but simonsons eyes widened in recognition maybe not physical recognition but recognition of who i was and what i had done shit youre the guy youre the cop that was there youre the one who shot he stopped himself from saying a name he looked at oliphant hes the one who hit one of the robbers i looked at oliphant and i saw recognitionphysical recognitionand maybe something like hate or anger in his eyes thats not known for sure because we never got the robber but yeah i think i hit him that was me i said it with a smile of pride i kept it on my face as i turned back to simonson who are you working for simonson asked me im working for somebody who isnt going to stop who isnt going to let up not for a minute hes going to find out who put angella benton down on the tile and hell go at it until he either dies or he knows simonson smirked again arrogantly well good luck to you and him mr bosch i think you ought to go now were kind of busy here i nodded to him and then looked at oliphant giving him the best deadeye in my repertoire then i guess ill see you boys around i went through the door and down the hallway back to the bar chet baker was now singing my funny valentine as i headed for the main door i noticed the bartender flexing her bicep for two men sitting at the bar where i had stood they were laughing i recognized them as the remaining two kings from the magazine photo they stopped laughing when they saw me and i felt their eyes on me all the way out the door on the way home i stopped at the twentyfourhour ralphs on sunset and bought a bag of coffee i didnt expect that id be getting much sleep between the night and the multiagency confab the following morning on the drive up the hill to my house there are too many curves to use the rearview mirror to check for a tail but there is one sweeping curve halfway up that allows you to look to your right out the passenger window and across the dropoff to the road you just covered its always been my habit to slow at this spot and check for a trailer this night i slowed more than usual and watched a little longer i didnt expect my visit to chets to be taken as anything other than a threat and i wasnt wrong as i looked across the dropoff i saw a car with no lights on round the hill and move into the sweeping curve i eased the gas pedal down and slowly picked up speed again after the next curve i punched it and put a little more distance between us i pulled all the way into the carport next to my house and quickly got out with the bag from the store i moved into the darkest corner of the carport and waited i heard the trail car before i saw it then i watched it glide by a long jaguar someone was lighting a cigarette in the backseat and in the glow from the flame i saw the car was full the four kings were coming for me after the jag had gone by i saw the bushes across the street glow red and i knew they were stopping just past my house i moved to the door that led into the kitchen and went inside making sure to lock the door afterward this was the moment when people without badges called the police for help its when they desperately whispered hurry please they are coming but badge or no badge i knew that was not an option for me now this was my play and i didnt care in that moment about what authority i had or didnt have i had not carried a gun since the night i left my badge and service pistol in a drawer at hollywood division and walked out but i had a weapon id bought a glock p for personal protection it was wrapped in an oil rag and in a box on the shelf of the walkin closet in the bedroom i put the bag from ralphs down on the counter and moved into the hallway and down to the bedroom without turning on any lights when i opened the closet door i was suddenly shoved backwards with great force by a man who had been waiting in there for me i hit the opposite wall and slid to the floor he was on me immediately straddling and pushing the barrel of a pistol up under my jaw i managed to look up and in the pale light coming in through the french door leading to the deck i could see who it was milton what the shut up asshole you surprised to see me did you think i was going to let them wash me down the toilet without doing something about it i dont know what youre talking about listen there are people i said shut the fuck up i want the disks you understand i want the original data chip listen to me there are people about to come in here for me they want he shoved the barrel in so deep under my jaw that i had to stop talking the pain sent shards of red glass across my vision milton held the gun there and leaned down his breath in my face as he spoke ive got your gun right here bosch and im going to turn you into another suicide statistic if you dont there was a sudden crashing sound from the hallway and i knew it was the front door coming in off its hinges then there were footsteps milton jumped up off of me and stepped through the bedroom door into the hallway almost immediately there was the booming thunder of a shotgun blast and milton was slammed back against the wall his eyes wide with the terror of knowing he was dying he then slid down the wall his heels pushing back the hallway rug to reveal the handle of the trapdoor that led beneath the house i knew they had mistaken him for me it was a break worth a few seconds at the most i rolled over and quickly moved to the french door as i opened it i heard someones panicked voice call out from the hallway its not him the door squealed when i opened it its hinges protesting from lack of use i quickly crossed the deck and went over the railing like a cowboy mounting a stolen horse i went down the railing until i was hanging from the deck twenty feet above the sharply sloping ground below in the dim moonlight i looked for one of the iron support beams that held the deck and house to the side of the hill i was intimately familiar with the design of the house from having supervised its reconstruction from the ground up after the ninetyfour earthquake i had to move six feet along the edge of the deck before i could reach in and grab hold of one of the support beams i wrapped my arms and legs around it and slid down to the ground as i went down i heard their footsteps on the deck above me he went down there he went down there where i dont see he went down there you two go well take the street i was on the ground beneath the shelter of the deck i knew if i stepped out and tried to make my way down the steep slope to one of the streets or houses in the canyon below i would be exposed to my armed pursuers instead i turned and climbed up the hill under the house and further into the shelter of the structure i knew there was a trench dug into the ground up there where the sewer main had to be replaced after the quake above me there would also be the trapdoor that opened in the hallway but i had designed it during the rebuilding of the house as an escape route not a means of ingress it was locked from inside and no use to me at the moment i moved up the hill found the trench and rolled into it i blindly moved my hands around at the bottom looking for a weapon all i found were cracked pieces of the old sewer main i found one shard that was triangular and might work as a weapon it would have to do two men moved like shadows down the support beams to the ground below the deck the moonlight reflected off the steel of their pistols the reflections also showed me that one had on eyeglasses and i remembered him from the magazine story and photo his name was bernard banks known as bb king among the night crawlers he had been at the bar at chets when i had left the two shadows exchanged whispers and then split up one moving down the hill and to the left the otherbanksmaintaining his position it was some kind of tactical strategy in which one would hopefully chase me into the waiting pistol of the other from my angle above him banks was a hard target silhouetted by the lights from the canyon below he was fifteen feet from me but i had nothing to use as a weapon except a shard of old iron pipe still it was enough i had survived more missions into the tunnels of vietnam than i could remember id once spent a whole night in the elephant grass with the enemy moving all around me and i had lived and worked for twentyfiveplus years on the streets of this city with a badge this kid was going to be no match for me i knew none of them would be when banks turned to look down the canyon slope i rose up in the trench and threw the pipe shard into the brush out to his right it made a sound like an animal moving through high grass as he turned tensed and raised his weapon i slid over the top of the trench and started moving down the slope toward him all the while keeping one of the iron beams between us as a sound and visual blind i got to the beam and he still had not turned from the direction of the sounds in the brush he was just putting the misdirection together and finally turning back when i got to him my left fist hit him squarely between the eyes while my right closed over the gun and i put a finger through the trigger guard i had actually been aiming for his mouth but the punch broke his glasses in half at the bridge and staggered him just the same i pivoted and swung him in a degree arc gathering momentum and putting him headfirst into one of the support beams his skull made a sound like a water balloon breaking and the iron beam hummed like a tuning fork he dropped to the ground like a bag of wet laundry i put his gun into the waistband of my pants and then turned him over the blood on his face looked black in the moonlight i quickly propped his back against the beam brought his knees up and folded his arms on top of them i leaned his face down on his arms soon i heard the other one call for him from further down the hillside bb you got him hey beeb i backed away from banks and crouched in the bushes ten feet away i pulled the gun from my pants in the moonlight i could not tell the make it was a black steel pistol with no safety probably a glock i then realized it was probably my own gun it must have been the one milton had shoved into my neck banks had taken it from his body i heard the other one approaching in the brush he was coming from my left and would cross within five feet of me when he approached banks i waited until i heard him and knew he was close banks what are you doing you pussy get up and he shut up when he felt the barrel of the gun against his neck drop the gun or you die right here i heard it hit the ground with my free hand i reached up and grabbed the back of his collar and pulled him around and then back underneath the shelter of the deck where we couldnt be seen from above we were both facing the lights of the canyon and the freeway below he was the fourth king the one in the magazine picture who had the bar towel over his shoulder i couldnt remember his name in all of the excitement hed been sitting at the bar at chets with banks whats your name asshole jimmy fazio look i shut up he was quiet i leaned forward and whispered into his ear look at the lights you are going to die here jimmy fazio the lights are the last thing youll ever see please please is that what angella benton said did she say please to you no please no i mean i wasnt even there convince me he didnt say anything or die okay it wasnt me please believe me it was linus and vaughn it was their idea and they did it without even telling the rest of us we couldnt stop it because we didnt know about it yeah what else youre only alive because youre talking thats why we shot vaughn linus said we had to because he was going to take the money and pin the girl on linus what about linus getting shot was that part of the plan he shook his head that wasnt supposed to happen but we figured out how to make it work like a cover for us buying the clubs yeah it worked all right what about marty gessler and jack dorsey who i jammed the guns muzzle hard into his neck dont give me that shit i want the whole goddamn story i dont faz you fucking coward the voice came from above us i looked up and saw the upper body of a man hanging down over the edge of the deck his arms were extended two hands on a gun i let go of my captive and dove left just as the gunfire erupted the shooter was oliphant he screamed as he fired just blindly screamed the whole shelter area beneath the house lit up with the flashes slugs ricocheted off the iron beams i came up on the side of one of the beams and fired three times in a quick burst at him his shout cut off and i knew id hit him i watched as he dropped his gun lost his balance and fell the twenty feet down making a heavy thud in the bushes i looked around for fazio and found him on the ground near banks hed been hit in the upper chest but was still alive it was too dark to see his eyes but i knew they were open and panicked looking at me for help i grabbed his jaw and turned his face to mine can you talk uh it hurts yeah it does doesnt it tell me about the fbi agent where is she what happened to her uh who killed the cop was that linus too linus is that a yes did linus do it he didnt answer i was losing him i lightly patted his cheeks and then shook him by the collar come on man stay with me was that a yes fazio did linus simonson kill the cop nothing he was gone then a voice came from behind me i think that would be a yes i turned it was simonson he had found the trapdoor and come down out of the house behind me he was holding a sawedoff shotgun i slowly stood up leaving my gun on the ground next to fazios body and raising my hands i backed away from simonson stepping further down the hill cops on the payroll are always a pain in the ass he said i had to put an end to that pronto i took another step backwards but for every step i took simonson did likewise the shotgun was only three feet away i knew id be unable to escape its kill range if i tried to make a move all i could do was play for time somebody in the neighborhood had to have heard the shots and made a call simonson aimed the weapon at my heart im going to enjoy this this ones for cozy cozy i asked though i had already put it together who the hell is cozy you hit him that day with your bullets and he didnt make it what happened to him what do you think happened he died in the back of the van you buried him where not me i was sort of busy that day remember they buried him cozy liked boats they gave him a burial at sea you could say i took another step back simonson followed i was walking out from beneath the deck if the cops ever showed up they could put a bead on him from above what about the fbi agent what happened to marty gessler see thats the thing when dorsey told me about her and what the plan was that was when i knew he had to go i mean he was the shotgun suddenly pointed skyward as the foot simonson had put his weight down on went out from under him he took a classic pratfall landing on his back i was on him then like a wild man we rolled and fought for control of the shotgun he was younger and stronger and quickly was able to hold the top position but he was an inexperienced fighter his focus was on controlling the struggle rather than on simply overpowering his opponent i had my left hand wrapped around the snubbed barrel while the other was gripped at the trigger guard i managed to squeeze my thumb into the guard behind his finger i closed my eyes and an image came to me angella bentons hands the image from memory and dreams i channeled all my strength into my left arm and pushed the angle of the gun shifted i closed my eyes and depressed the trigger with my thumb the loudest sound i have ever heard in my life roared through my head as the shotgun discharged my face felt like it had caught on fire i opened my eyes and looked up at simonson and saw that he no longer had a face he rolled off of me and an inhuman sound gurgled from the pulp that had been his face his legs kicked like he was riding an invisible bicycle he rolled back and forth as his hands balled into fists as tight as stones and then he stopped and went still slowly i sat up registering what had happened i touched my own face and found it intact i was burned from the discharge gases but otherwise i was okay my ears were ringing and for once i couldnt hear the ever present sound of the freeway below i saw a glint in the brush and reached for the object it was a water bottle it was full unopened i realized that simonson had slipped on the water bottle i had knocked off the deck a few days before and it had saved my life i twisted the cap off the bottle and poured water over my face washing away the blood and the sting of the burn dont move i looked up from my position and saw a man leaning over the deck railing pointing another gun at me the moon reflected off the badge on his uniform the cops had finally arrived i dropped the bottle and spread my hands wide dont worry i said im not moving i leaned back my arms still spread my head rested on the ground and i pulled great gulps of air into my lungs the ringing in my ears was still there but i could now also hear my heart as it slowed its cadence to the normal beat of life i looked up into the dark sacred night to the place where those not saved on earth wait for the rest of us above not yet i thought no not yet while the cop on the deck above kept his gun on me his partner dropped through the trapdoor and made his way down the slope to me he had a flashlight in one hand and a gun in the other and the wild eyes of a man who has no idea what he has stepped into roll over and put your hands behind your back he ordered adrenaline drawing his voice high and tight i did as i was instructed and he put his flashlight down on the ground as he cuffed my wrists thankfully not in the style of the fbi i tried to calmly talk to him just so you know i i dont want to know anything from you im lapd retired out of hollywood pulled the pin last year after twentyfiveplus good for you why dont you save it for the suits my house was in north hollywood division i knew there was no reason why they should know me or care hey said the one from above whats his name put the light on him the man on the ground put the light in my face from a foot away it was blinding whats your name harry bosch i worked homicide har i know who he is swanny hes all right get the light out of his face swanny took the light away yeah fine but the cuffs stay on the suits can sort it allah jesus he had put his light on the faceless body in the brush to my left linus simonson or what was left of him dont puke swanny came the voice from above its a crime scene fuck you hurwitz im not gonna puke i heard him moving around i tried to lift my head to watch him but the brush was too tall i could only listen it sounded like he was moving from body to body i was right hey we got a live one down here call it in that would be banks i assumed i was glad to hear it i had the feeling i was going to need a survivor to back up my account i figured that with banks facing the fall by himself for the whole thing he would cut a deal to save his ass and tell the story i rolled over and sat up the cop was kneeling next to banks on the dirt below the deck he looked over at me i didnt tell you to move i couldnt breathe with my face in the dirt dont fucking move again hey swanny hurwitz called down the stiff in the house hes got a badge fbi holy shit yeah holy shit and they were right it was a holy shit case within the hour the place was swarmed by the lapd by the lafd by the fbi by the media by my count there were six helicopters circling in the sky through most of the night the cacophony so loud i found myself preferring the shotgun blast ringing in my ears the lafd used a chopper to bring banks up out of the canyon on a stretcher when they were done with him i called the paramedics over and they put a clear aloebased gel over the gas burns on my face they gave me an aspirin and told me the injuries were minor and that there would be no scarring it felt to me like id had my face laserpeeled by a blind surgeon i was uncuffed long enough to climb up the slope and then up through the trapdoor in my house i was recuffed and made to sit on a couch in the living room from there i could see miltons legs extending from the hallway as a crime scene team hovered over him once all of the suits started showing up it started getting serious most of them followed the same pattern they came in somberly studied miltons body then walked through the living room without looking at me and out onto the deck where they looked down at the other three bodies then they came back in looked at me without saying a word and went into the kitchen where somebody had taken it upon himself to open up my new bag of coffee and put the percolator into heavy rotation this went on for at least two hours at first i didnt know any of them because they were north hollywood detectives but then the command decision was made to shift the investigationlapds part of itto robberyhomicide division when the rhd dicks started showing up it started getting like oldhome week i knew many of them and had even worked side by side with some it wasnt until kiz rider showed up from the chiefs office that anybody thought to take the cuffs off my wrists she angrily demanded that i be released from the bindings and when nobody made a move to do it she did it herself you okay harry i think i am now your face is red and kind of puffy you want me to call paramedics they already checked me out minor burns from getting too close to the wrong end of a shotgun how do you want to do this you know the score you want to get a lawyer or can we talk ill talk to you kiz ill tell you the whole story otherwise ill take the lawyer im not in rhd anymore harry you know that you should be and you know that but im not well thats the deal kiz take it or leave it ive got a good lawyer she thought about it for a few moments all right wait here for a minute and ill be right back she went out the front door to consult with the powers that be about my offer while she was gone and i was waiting i saw special agent john peoples come in and crouch next to miltons body he then looked over at me and held my eyes if he was trying to send me a message i wasnt sure exactly what it was but he knew i held something of his in the balance his future rider came back inside and over to me this is the deal its turning into a major gang bang weve got fbi all over this the guy on the floor is apparently from a terrorism squad and that trumps all theyre not going to let you and me waltz off into the sunset okay this is what ill do ill talk to you and one agent i want it to be roy lindell wake him up and bring him in and ill lay it all out for everybody its got to be you and roy or i lawyer up and everybody can figure it out for themselves she nodded and turned and went back out i noticed that peoples was no longer in the hallway but i hadnt seen him leave this time rider was gone for a half hour but when she came back she strode in with a command presence i knew before she told me that the deal had been made the case was hers at least on the lapd side of the ledger okay were going to go down the hill to north hollywood division well use a room there and theyll tape it for us lindell is on his way there this way everybodys happy and everybodys got a piece that was always the way you had to walk the gauntlet of departmental and intraagency politics just to get the job done i was glad i no longer had a part of it you can stand up now harry rider said ill drive i stood up i want to go out on the deck first i want to look down there she let me go i walked across the deck and looked down over the railing below large crime scene lights had been erected the slope was like an anthill with crime scene techs working all over the place crews from the medical examiners office were huddled over the bodies above it all the helicopters moved in a loud multilevel choreography i knew that whatever relationships id previously had with my neighbors were surely gone now know what kiz what harry i think its time to sell this place yeah good luck with that harry she took me by the arm and pulled me away from the railing the north hollywood station was the newest in the city it was built postearthquake and rodney king riots on the outside it was a brick fortress designed to withstand both tectonic and social upheavals on the inside it was stateoftheart electronics and comfort i was sat in the center seat of a table in a large interview room i could not see the microphones and the camera but i knew they were there i also knew i had to be careful i had made a bad deal if a quarter century in the cops had taught me anything it was not to talk to cops without a lawyers advice and here i was about to do just that i was about to open up to two people predisposed to believe me and to want to help me but that wouldnt matter what would matter was the tape i had to step carefully and make sure i said nothing that could come back on me when the tape was reviewed by those who were not my friends kizmin rider started things off by entering all three of our names into the record reporting the date time and location and then reading me my constitutionally guaranteed right to a lawyer and to hold my tongue if i wished she then asked me to acknowledge both orally and in writing that i understood these rights and was willingly waiving them i did so i had taught her well she then got right to it okay harry you have four people including a federal agent dead at your house not to mention a fifth man in a coma you want to tell us all about it i killed two of themin selfdefense and the guy in the coma i did that too okay tell us what happened i began the story at the baked potato and took it from there i mentioned sugar ray the quartet the porter the bartenders and their tattoos i even described the cashier i had bought the coffee from at ralphs i used as much detail as i could remember because i knew that the details would convince them once they checked it all out i knew from experience that conversation was hearsay it wasnt provable one way or the other so if you were going to tell a story about what people said and how they said itespecially people who were no longer alivethen youd best salt the story with the things that could be checked and proven the details safety and salvation were in the details so i put everything i could remember on the tape right down to the marilyn monroe tattoo that one made roy lindell laugh but rider didnt see the humor in it i walked them through the story describing things as they had happened i offered no background story because i knew that would come out in the questioning that would follow i wanted them to have a momentbymoment and detailbydetail account of what had happened i did not lie in what i told them but i didnt tell them everything i still wasnt sure how to play the milton angle i would wait for a signal from lindell on that i was sure he had been given his orders long before he got to the station i held the milton details out for lindell the detail i held out for myself was what i had seen when i closed my eyes before pressing the shotguns trigger i kept the image of angella bentons hands to myself and thats it i said when i was done then the uniforms showed up and here we are rider had been jotting down notes occasionally on a legal pad she put her pad down and looked at me she seemed stunned by the story she probably believed i was very lucky to have survived it thank you harry that was certainly a close call for you it was about five close calls um i think were going to take a break for a few minutes agent lindell and i are going to step out and talk about this and then im sure we will come back with some questions i smiled im sure you will can we get you anything coffee would be nice ive been up all night and at the house they wouldnt give me any from my own machine coffee coming up she and lindell got up and left the room a few minutes later a north hollywood detective i didnt know came in with a cup of black coffee he told me to hang in there and left when rider and lindell came back in i noticed that there were more notes on her pad she kept the lead and started out doing the talking again we need to clear up a couple things first she said okay you said that agent milton was already in your house when you came in thats right i looked at lindell and then back at rider you said you were in the process of informing him that you believed you had been followed home when the front door was kicked in by the intruders correct he stepped into the hall to investigate and was immediately hit with a blast from a shotgun presumably fired by linus simonson right again what was agent milton doing in your house if you werent there before i could speak lindell blurted out a question he did have permission to be there didnt he hey how about we take one question at a time i said i looked at lindell again and his eyes turned down to the table he couldnt look at me judging by his question which was really a statement disguised as a question lindell was revealing to me what he wanted me to say i believed at that point that he was making an offer of trade he was almost certainly in trouble with the bureau for his aid to me during my investigation and as such he now had his orders keep the bureaus nose clean on this or there would be consequences for him and possibly for me so what lindell was saying to me was that if i told the story in a way that helped him accomplish that objectivewithout legally compromising myselfthen we would both be better off the truth was i didnt mind sparing milton posthumous controversy and shame as far as i was concerned hed already gotten what he deserved and then some going after him now would be vindictive and i didnt need to be vindictive to a dead man i had other things to do and wanted to preserve my ability to do them there was special agent peoples and his bam squad but there was too much gray between them and miltons actions i had milton on tape not peoples using one to try to get to the other was a tough road to drive i decided in that moment to let the dead man sleep and to live to drive another day what was agent milton doing in your house if you werent there rider repeated i looked back at her he was waiting for me to do what i had told him to meet me there but i got delayed because i went and bought the coffee on my way home why was he meeting you so late at night because i had information that would clear some things up for him what was that information it was about how a terrorist involved in a case he was working ended up with a hundreddollar bill that supposedly came from the movie set heist i was investigating and had been warned off of i told him i had put things together and found that the two cases were actually unrelated i invited him to come to my lawyers office in the morning when you two were going to come and id explain it all to everybody but he didnt want to wait so i told him to meet me at the house and what you left him a key no i didnt but i mustve left the door unlocked because he was inside when i got home i guess you could say he had permission because i invited him to the house but i didnt exactly tell him to go inside he just sort of did that on his own when he beat me to the house agent milton had a number of miniaturized listening devices in the pocket of his coat do you know anything about that or why he had them my guess was that he had removed them from my house but i didnt say this no idea i said you wouldve had to ask him i guess what about his car it was found parked about a block north of your house on woodrow wilson in fact it was further away from your house than the car the four assailants used any idea why milton would park so far from your house if he was invited to be there no not really like i said i guess hes the only one who knew that exactly i could see her getting heated her eyes grew sharper and she seemed to be trying to read the looks i was giving lindell she knew there was a play on but she was smart enough not to mention anything on camera i had taught her well okay ill tell you what harry you told us every detail about what happened last night but not how it fits into anything before all the shit hit the fan you called the big meeting for this morning in order to lay it all out for us so go ahead and do it now tell us what youve got you mean from the beginning from the beginning i nodded okay well i guess you could say it all started with ray vaughn and linus simonson deciding to rip off the cash shipment to the movie set there was some sort of connection between them one of their former colleagues at the bank said she thought vaughn was gay and simonson had said he was making a move on him anyway whether simonson drew vaughn in or it was the other way around they decided to take the money they planned it out and then simonson recruited his four pals for the heavy work it went from there what about angella benton rider asked im getting to that without telling the others vaughn and linus decided they needed a device something that would make the cops think the heist came from inside the movie company not the bank so they picked her shed come to the bank as a liaison once with documents pertaining to the loan so they knew a case could be made that she knew about the money they picked her and probably watched her for a couple days and then figured out when she was most vulnerable and when to do it they killed her and one of them put the semen on her so it would look like a sex case at first and it wouldnt immediately reflect on the movie company or the plan to shoot scenes with real money that would come later after the heist so she was just a device is what you are saying rider said dejectedly her life taken simply because she fit into the plan i nodded somberly what a wonderful world right okay go on did they both do it i dont know maybe simonson had an alibi for that night but it was cleared by jack dorsey and well get to him in a minute but my guess is that they did it together it would take two to completely overpower her without a struggle the jizz rider said we can see if it matches one of them since vaughn was killed during the robbery and simonson was shot it was never thought to type them against the semen collected at the murder scene i shook my head i have a feeling that it wont match either one of them then who did it come from we may never know remember the spatter evidence we decided the semen was brought to the scene and dripped onto the body who knows where they got it maybe from one of themselves but if they were smart they wouldnt have left their own why leave a direct tie to the crime so what they just go up to a stranger and ask him to jerk off in a cup for them lindell asked incredulously it wouldnt be that hard to get rider said go into any alley in hollywood and youll find a loaded condom and if vaughn was gay then it could have come from one of his partners and the partner might not have ever known it i nodded i had been thinking the same thing exactly and thats probably why he was killed simonson doublecrossed him he told his guys to make sure they took him out during the robbery it would mean more money for them and a link to the benton case eliminated jesus these are coldblooded fucks lindell said i could tell he was thinking about marty gessler and her unknown fate simonson further secured the operation and the future use of the money by switching the currency report he and another bankla employee had put together you could say he unmarked the bills how rider asked i thought at first that he probably just put wrong currency numbers into the report he and another bank employee made in the vault but i guess that would have been too risky because she wasnt in on it and she might have decided to doublecheck the numbers so i think what he did was create a second phony report on his computer it listed currency numbers he just made up he then printed it out and forged his coworkers signature on it and turned it in to the vice president for his signature from there it went to the insurance company and then to the cops after the heist and eventually to the fbi you told me to bring the original to the meeting we were supposed to have this morning rider said why you know what forgers tremor is its something you can see in a signature that has been forged by tracing he traced his coworkers signature off the original or real currency report in the photocopy of the one he turned in i could see hesitation marks her signature would have been one smooth uninterrupted scrawl but it looks like whoever signed that page never lifted the pen but stopped and started after almost every letter its a tell and i think the original will show it beyond a doubt how was that missed i shrugged maybe it wasnt dorsey and cross i think dorsey i dont know about cross cross helped me with this in fact he called me and gave me the jump start on it lindell leaned forward we were getting to the part about marty gessler and he wanted to get it right so simonson turns in a report with madeup numbers and then his buddies go and rip off the delivery and kill vaughn in the process intentionally thats right what about simonson he got shot too were they trying to cut him out too no that wasnt supposed to happen not according to fazio at least that was what he was saying to me before he got nailed last night it sounded like simonson getting shot was just dumb luck a ricochet if banks comes out of his sleep with his brain intact maybe he can tell you about that i have a feeling hell want to talk hell want to spread the blame around dont worry if he comes out of it well be there but the early word from the hospital is that thats a big if the thing about that ricochet is that it actually helped them it gave simonson a valid out from the bank no suspicion there then he hid the purchase and renovation of the bars behind a settlement from the bank the truth was he didnt make enough off the settlement to put in a new beer cooler how do you know that i just know all right lets get back to the heist for a minute lindell said so other than simonson taking a slug in the ass the heist goes off as planned all the cops not exactly rider said harry was there he nailed one of the robbers i nodded and he apparently died in the van during the getaway simonson told me the others took him out on a boat or something and buried him at sea his name was cozy they named one of the bars after him okay lindell said but when the dust settles from this thing all the cops have is angella benton dead and a phony list of numbers that nobody knows is phony then nine months sail by and lo and behold one of those numbers scores a hit when marty gessler puts it into her computer i nodded lindell knew where it was going wait a minute rider said im not tracking this part lindell and i took five minutes to fill her in on marty gesslers computer program that tracked currency numbers and what her discovery meant got it rider said she came up with the first inference that something was wrong she came up with a hit that didnt work because the hundreddollar bill in question was already in evidence lockup it could not have been taken during the movie set heist exactly i said one of the numbers simonson made up just happened to be on a bill already accounted for the same thing would later happen when they arrested mousouwa aziz at the border one of the hundreds he was carrying matched simonsons phony list that brought milton and the homeland security heavies into it and it was all bullshit the truth was there was no connection between the two cases which meant i had spent the night in federal lockup for nothing and milton had been killed while pursuing what amounted to nothing a wild goose chase i tried not to think about this and moved on with the story when marty gessler got that hit she called up jack dorsey because his name was on the list when it was circulated to other law enforcement agencies it went from there youre saying that dorsey then put two and two together and came up with simonson lindell said maybe he knew about the forgery or maybe he knew about something else but he knew enough to know he went to simonson and cut himself in i noticed that we were all nodding the story worked dorsey had money problems i added the insurance investigator on this did routine background checks on all the cops involved dorsey was in debt up to his neck had two kids in college and two still to go everybodys got money problems rider said angrily its no excuse that made us all silent for a long moment and then i took up the story again there was just one problem at that point agent gessler rider said she knew too much she had to disappear rider didnt know anything about lindells relationship with gessler and lindell did little to reveal it he just sat quietly his eyes down i moved the story forward my guess is that simonson and his guys played dorsey along while they took care of the gessler problem dorsey knew what they did but what could he do or say about it he was in too deep then simonson took care of him in nats cross and the bartender were window dressing rider squinted her eyes and shook her head what lindell asked doesnt work for me she said theres a disconnect there with gessler shes gone without a trace very smooth three years later and who knows where the body is i was cringing for lindells sake but tried not to show it but with dorsey its a shootout at the ok corral dorsey cross the bartender two completely different styles one smooth as smoke the other a blood bath well i said with dorsey they wanted it to look like a robbery gone wrong if he just disappeared then the obvious thing to do would be to go back over the old cases simonson didnt want that so he orchestrated the big blowout so the investigators would think robbery i still dont buy it i think theyre different look i dont remember all the details but didnt marty gessler disappear while driving home through the sepulveda pass thats right somebody bumped her and she pulled over okay then heres an armed and trained agent are you going to tell me simonson and these guys got her to pull over by bumping her car and then they got the best of her uhuh guys i say no way not without a fight not without somebody seeing something i think she stopped because she felt safe she stopped for a cop she pointed at me and nodded when she said the last line lindell brought a fist down hard on the table rider had convinced him i had defended my theory but now saw the cracks in it i started thinking rider might be right i noticed rider looking at lindell she was finally picking up the vibe you really knew her didnt you she asked lindell just nodded to the question then he brought his eyes up to stare angrily at me and you blew it bosch he said i blew it what are you talking about with your little stunt last night going in there like fucking steve mcqueen what did you think that theyd be so spooked theyd march right down to parker center and turn themselves in roy rider said i think we you wanted to provoke them didnt you you wanted them to come after you thats crazy i said calmly four against one the only reason im alive right now and talking to you is because i saw them tailing me and because milton distracted them long enough for me to get out of the house yeah thats just it you saw the tail you saw it because you were looking for it and you were looking for it because you wanted it you blew it bosch if that kid in the hospital doesnt wake up with a working brain then well never know what happened to marty or where he stopped before his voice lost it he stopped speaking but didnt stop staring at me guys rider said quietly lets take a break here lets stop questioning motives and accusing we all want the same thing here lindell slowly and emphatically shook his head no not harry bosch he said quietly his eyes still on mine its always just what he wants hes always been a private investigator even when he carried a badge i looked from lindell to rider she didnt say anything but her eyes dropped away from mine and in their movement was a tell i saw her confirmation it was dawn by the time i got back to my house the place was still a swarm of police and media activity and the police would not let me back in the house and canyon comprised a major crime scene and as such they had commandeered custody of it i was told to try back in a day maybe two they would not even let me go back inside to get fresh clothes or any other belongings i was strictly persona non grata i was asked to stay away the one concession i was able to talk my way into was my car two uniform copshurwitz and swanny who had caught the precious overtime assignmentcleared room for me among the police and media vehicles and i backed the mercedes out of the carport and took off the adrenaline rush that came with the neardeath experience of the night before had long since ebbed away i was exhausted but had no place to go i drove aimlessly along mulholland until i came to laurel canyon boulevard and then took a right and drove down into the valley i started getting a sense of where i was headed but knew it was too early when i got to ventura i took another right and pulled into the parking lot at the dupars i decided that i needed some high octane and coffee and pancakes would fit the bill before getting out of the car i got the cell phone out and turned it on i called the numbers i had for janis langwiser and sandor szatmari and got no answers but left messages that the morning meeting was canceled because of circumstances beyond my control the phones screen showed that i had messages waiting i called to pick them up and listened to four messages left through the night by keisha russell the times reporter she started out very cool and concerned about my wellbeing and wanting to talk to me at my convenience to make sure i was okay by the third message her voice had taken on a highpitched urgency and in the fourth she demanded that i make good on our deal in which i promised to talk to her if anything happened with what i was working on somethings obviously happened now harry youve got four on the floor on woodrow wilson call me like you promised me you would yes dear i said as i erased the message the last message was from alexander taylor the box office champion there was a proprietary tone to his voice he wanted me to know that this story was his mr bosch i see you are all over the news i am assuming that the nastiness on the hill last night is related to my heist there were four robbers the news says there are four dead men on your property i want you to know that the offer i made still stands but ill double it one hundred thousand as an option on the story the back end is open to negotiation and we can talk about that when i hear back from you i will give you my assistants private number call me back ill be waiting he gave a number but i didnt bother writing it down i thought about the money for all of five seconds and then erased the message and closed the phone as i walked into the restaurant i wondered about what constituted circumstances beyond my control and what lindell had said at the end of the interview in north hollywood i thought about fighting monsters and what had been said about me and to me in the past and what i had said to peoples in that restaurant booth just a few nights earlier i wondered if a subtle slide into the abyss was any different from the kind of swan dive milton had taken i knew i would have to think about this and the motives behind my actions of the last ten hours but i soon decided it would have to keep there was still a mystery to solve and as soon as i refueled i was going after it i sat at the counter and ordered the number two special without looking at a menu the waitress with the wide hips poured my coffee and was about to put the order in at the kitchen window when somebody took the stool next to me and said ill have coffee too i recognized the voice and turned and saw keisha russell smiling at me as she put her bag down on the floor between us she had followed me down the hill i shouldve known harry if you dont want to be followed all you have to do is return your calls i just got your messages five minutes ago keisha well now you dont have to call me back im not talking to you not yet harry your house is like a war zone bodies all over are you all right im sitting here arent i im all right but i still cant talk to you i dont know how this is going to play out and im not going to say anything that shows up in the paper and might be at odds with the official line thats suicide you mean you dont want to tell me the truth just in case what they put out isnt keisha you know me i will talk to you when i can why dont you let me have my coffee and eat in peace now just answer one question its not even a question just confirm for me that whatever happened up there is related to what you called me about about martha gessler i shook my head in frustration i knew i wasnt going to be able to shake her without giving her something actually i cant confirm that and thats the truth but look if i give you something that will help you will you let me be until there is a time i can talk about it before she answered the waitress slid a plate in front of me i looked down at a short stack of buttered pancakes with a fried egg and two pieces of bacon forming an x on top she then put down a small pitcher of maple syrup i grabbed it and started pouring syrup over everything my god russell said you eat that and im not sure there will ever be a time you can talk about it you are killing yourself harry i looked up at the waitress who was standing there writing up my check i gave her a whatareyougoingtodo smile and shrugged are you paying for her coffee she asked sure she put the bill down on the counter and walked away i looked at russell why dont you say that louder next time sorry harry but i dont want you to get fat and old and ugly youre my bud i want you around i saw through all of that she hid her motives the way the bartenders id seen the night before hid their nipples do we have a deal i give you something and you hit the road leave me alone she took a sip from her free coffee and smiled deal go pull your clips on the angella benton case she narrowed her eyes she didnt remember it you didnt do much with it at first then it blew up big when it was connected to the movie set heist over on selma eidolon productions ring a bell she almost came off her stool are you fucking kidding me she said a little too loud the four on the floor are those guys not quite three of them are those guys plus the one they took to the hospital then who is the fourth i gave you what im giving you keisha im going to eat now i turned to my plate and started cutting my food up this is so cool she said this is going to be big as if four bodies in the cahuenga pass wasnt already big i took my first bite and the syrup hit me like a sugar bullet great i said she reached down to her bag and started getting up ive gotta go harry thanks for the coffee one last thing i took another bite and turned to her and started talking with my mouth full check out los angeles magazine seven months ago they did this story on these four guys who own all the hot bars in hollywood it called them the kings of the night crawlers check it out her eyes widened youre kidding no check it out she leaned down and kissed me on the cheek she had never done that before when i carried a badge thanks harry ill call you i bet you will i watched her glide quickly through the restaurant and out i turned back to my plate the egg had been over easy and cutting it up had made a mess of things but at that moment it tasted like the best thing i had ever eaten finally alone i considered the question kiz rider had raised during the interview about how the style of the marty gessler disappearance was so different from the massacre at nats i was now sure rider was right the crimes had been designed if not carried out by different perpetrators dorsey i said out loud maybe too loud a man three stools down turned and looked at me until i turned and stared him back to his coffee cup most of my records and notes were in the house and not attainable i had the murder book in the mercedes but it contained nothing from the gessler case from memory i worked on the details of the fbi agents disappearance the car left at the airport the use of her credit card up near the desert to buy more gas than her car could hold i tried to fit these facts under the new heading of dorsey it was hard to make it work dorsey had been working crimes from one side of the law for nearly thirty years he was too smart he had seen too much to leave a trail like that but by the time i finished my plate i thought i had something something that worked i looked around to make sure the man three stools down and nobody else was looking at me i poured a little more syrup onto my plate and then dipped my fork into it and ate it i was about to dip again when the wide hips of the waitress appeared in front of me finished uh yes sure thank you more coffee can i get a togo cup yes you may she took the plate and my syrup away i thought about my next moves until she came back with the coffee and reworked my bill i left two bucks on the counter and took the bill to the cashier where i noticed bottles of the restaurants syrup were on display and for sale the cashier noticed my gaze how about a bottle of syrup to go i was tempted but decided to stick with the coffee nah i think ive had enough sweetness for today thanks you need sweetness its a nasty world out there i agreed with her paid my bill and left with my cup of harsh black coffee back in the car i opened the phone and called roy lindells cell number this is roy this is bosch we still talking what do you want an apology fuck you youre not getting one no i can live without an apology from you roy so fuck you too i want to know if you still want to find her there was no need to use a name what do you think bosch okay then i thought for a moment about how to do this bosch you still there yeah listen ive got to go see somebody right now can you meet me in two hours two hours where you know where bronson canyon is above hollywood right yeah griffith park meet me at the end of bronson canyon two hours if youre not there i wont wait whats up there what do you have right now just a hunch you going to meet me there was a pause ill be there bosch what should i bring good question i tried to think of what wed need bring flashlights and a bolt cutter i guess you better bring a shovel too roy that brought another pause before he replied what are you bringing i guess just my hunch for now where are we going up there ill tell you when i see you ill show you i closed the phone then the garage door at lawton crosss house was closed the van was parked in the driveway but there were no other vehicles kiz rider hadnt gotten there yet nobody had i pulled in behind the van and got out and knocked on the front door it didnt take too long for danny cross to answer it harry she said we were just watching it on the tv are you all right never better are they the ones the ones who did this to law she had a pleading look in her eyes i nodded it was them the one who was in the bar that day who shot law i took his face off with his own shotgun does that make you happy danny she pressed her lips together in an effort to hold back tears revenge tastes sweet doesnt it just like pancake syrup i reached out and put my hand on her shoulder but not to comfort her i gently pushed her to the side of the doorway and stepped in rather than head left toward lawton crosss sitting room i went to the right i went into the kitchen and found the door to the garage i went to the file cabinets in front of the malibu and pulled the file on the antonio markwell case the abductionmurder that had made cross and dorsey in the department i returned to the house and entered the sitting room i didnt know where danny had gone but her husband was waiting for me harry youre all over the tube he said i looked up at the television screen it was a helicopter view of my house i could see all the official cars and media vans on the street in front i could see the black tarps covering the bodies in the back i hit the power button with the side of my fist and the screen went blank i turned back to cross and dropped the markwell file on his lap he couldnt move all he could do was lower his eyes to it and try to read the tab how does it feel does it give you a hardon watching what you did in your case a makebelieve hardon harry i where is she law where is who harry i dont know what sure you do you know exactly what im talking about you sat there like a puppet but the whole time you were pulling the strings my strings harry please dont harry please me you wanted revenge on them and i was your ticket well you got it partner i took care of all of them just like you thought like you hoped you played me just right he didnt say anything his eyes were cast down away from mine now theres one thing i want from you i want to know where you and jack hid marty gessler i want to bring her home he remained silent his eyes away from me i reached down and took the file off his lap on the bureau i opened it and started leafing through the documents you know i didnt see it until somebody i taught the job to saw it first i said as i looked through the file shes the one who said it had to be a cop it was the only way gessler couldve been taken so easily and she was right those four punks didnt have the steel i gestured toward the empty television screen i mean look what happened when they came for me i found what i was looking for in the file a map of griffith park i started unfolding it its creases cracked and split it had been folded in the file for maybe five years it was marked by the location where antonio markwells body had been found in bronson canyon once i started in that direction then i began to see it the gas had always been a problem somebody used her card and they bought more gas than her car could hold that was a mistake law a big one not buying the gas that was part of the misdirection but getting so much of it the bureau thought maybe it was a truck that they were looking for a trucker but now im thinking crown vic the police interceptor model they make for all the departments the cars with extracapacity gas tanks so you dont get caught out there on the hunt without any juice i had delicately spread the map open it depicted the many winding roads and footpaths of the huge mountain park it showed the public road up through bronson canyon and then the fire road which extended further up into the rocky terrain it showed the area of caves and tunnels left behind when the canyon had been a quarry its rock payload crushed and used for railroad beds across the west i laid the map across crosss lap and over his dead arms the way i figure it you guys followed her from westwood then in the pass you pulled her over in one of the quiet spots used the blue light on your crown vic and she thought no problem theyre cops but then you put her in the trunk of that big car with the big gas tank one of you drove her car to the airport and the other followed and picked him up probably you backed her car into another car or a pillar or something somewhere nice touch sell the misdirection then you drive up to the desert and use the gas card again sell that misdirection and then you turn around and take her back to the real hiding place which one of you did it law which one actually took from her everything she had or would ever have i didnt expect an answer and didnt get one i pointed to the map thats my bet you guys went to a place you were familiar with a place nobody would be looking for marty gessler because theyd all be looking up in the desert you wanted her hidden but you wanted access to her right you wanted to know exactly where she was she was your ace in the hole right you would use her to get to them marty and her computer the connection was on that box find her and find the box the connection would be made and thered be a knock on linus simonsons door i paused to give him a chance to protest to tell me to get the hell out or call me a liar but he didnt do any of that he didnt say a word it all seemed to work i said and then that day at nats you guys were supposed to cut the deal right shake hands and share the wealth only linus simonson had other ideas about that turned out he didnt want to share anything and hed take his chances with gesslers computer that must have shocked you there you two were waiting in there probably already counting your money and he comes in and opens up on you i think you shouldve seen it coming law i leaned down and tapped the map with a finger bronson canyon all those tunnels caves where you found the boy my eyes came up from the map thats my guess theyve got the roads going up there locked but you two had a key didnt you from the boys case you kept that key and then it came in handy where is she cross finally brought his eyes up to mine and spoke look what they did to me he said they deserved what they got i nodded in agreement and you deserved what you got where is she his eyes turned and he looked up at the empty tv he said nothing anger bloomed inside of me i thought of milton squeezing the air tubes shut of becoming a monster of becoming the thing i hunted i took a step toward his chair and looked down on him with eyes dark with rage slowly i raised my hands toward his face tell him i turned and danny cross was in the doorway i didnt know how long she had been there or what she had heard i didnt know if it was a story that was new to her or not all i knew is that she brought me back from the edge of the abyss i turned and looked back at lawton cross his eyes were on his wife and his frozen face still somehow took on an expression of sadness and misery tell him lawton she said or i wont be there beside you a look of fear immediately took over his face then there was pleading in his eyes you promise to stay with me i promise his eyes dropped to the map spread across the chair you dont need this he said just go up there you go in the big cave and then take the tunnel on the right it comes to an open clearing somebody told us they call it the devils punchbowl anyway thats where we found him shes there now he could no longer hold my eyes and looked away back down at the map where do i look lawton where the kid was that family marked the spot youll know when you get there i nodded i understood slowly i took the map from him and refolded it i watched him as i did it he seemed becalmed his face now returned to expressionless id seen the look a thousand times before in the eyes and faces of those who have confessed a lifting of the burden there was nothing else to say i slipped the map back into the file and took it with me as i left the room danny cross remained just outside the door looking in at her husband i stopped as i passed her hes a black hole i said hell suck you in and take you down save yourself danny how you know how i left her there and went out i got in my car and started driving south toward hollywood and the secret the hills had hidden for so long it wasnt raining yet but the sky was full of the low rumbling of thunder by the time i got to hollywood from the freeway i took franklin over to bronson and then up into the hills bronson canyon had been in more movies than i had probably seen in my whole life its rugged terrain and jagged rock outcroppings formed the backdrop of countless westerns and more than a few lowbudget interplanetary explorations i had been there as a kid and i had been there on cases i knew that if you werent careful you could get lost on the trails or in the caves and quarriedout spaces the rock facings would begin to crowd you and after a while they all looked the same you could lose your bearings in that sameness was the danger i took the park road up until it terminated at the fire road entrance to this dirt and crushedgravel extension was blocked by a steel gate with a padlock on it the key to that lock resided with the fire department and the citys film bureau but thanks to lawton cross i knew better than that i got there before lindell and i was tempted not to wait it would be a long walk up to the caves on foot but my anger had forged into resolve and momentum sitting at the locked gate was not the way to stoke those fires and keep them burning i wanted to get up into the hills and get it over with i pulled out the cell phone and called him to see where he was right behind you i checked the mirror he was coming around the last bend in a federal crown vic it made me think about how he would react when he found out the last clue i had put together had been so close all along its about time i said i hung up and got out of the mercedes when lindell pulled up i leaned into his window did you bring the bolt cutter lindell looked out the windshield at the gate for that im not going to cut that theyll climb all over me if i break their lock roy i thought you were a bigtime federal agent give me the cutter ill do it and you can take all the heat just tell them you had a hunch i threw him a look hoping to communicate that i was operating on more than a hunch now he popped the trunk lid and i went back and pulled out the bolt cutter he had probably checked out of the federal equipment shed he stayed in the car while i walked over and cut the lock and pushed the gate open i walked by his window on the way back to the trunk by any means roy i said as i passed i think im getting the idea why you werent picked for the squad i threw the tool in the trunk slammed it and told him to follow me up the hill we drove up the winding road the gravel crunching under our wheels sounding like the rain that was still coming the road up took a final and terminated in front of the main tunnel entrance a fifteenfoothigh opening cut into a granite deposit the size of an office building i parked next to lindell and met him at the trunk hed brought two shovels and two flashlights as i was reaching in for mine he put his hand on my arm okay bosch what are we doing shes here were going to go in and find her confirmed i looked at him and nodded in my life i have told a lot of peopletoo many to countabout loved ones they werent going to see alive again i knew lindell had long ago given up hope for marty gessler but the final confirmation is still never easy to get or to give yes confirmed lawton cross told me lindell nodded and turned away from the trunk he looked up at the crest of the granite mountain i busied myself with getting the tools from the trunk and checking to see if my cell phone was catching a signal over my shoulder i heard him say its going to rain yeah i said lets go i handed him a light and a shovel and we approached the mouth of the tunnel hes going to pay for this lindell said i nodded i didnt bother to tell him that lawton cross had already been paying for it every day of his life the tunnel was big shaquille oneal could walk through with wilt chamberlain on his shoulders it was nothing like the stale claustrophobic systems i had crawled through thirtyfive years before the air inside was fresh it smelled clean ten feet in we put on the lights and in another fifty feet the channel curved and we were out of sight of the entrance i remembered crosss directions and kept to the right moving slowly we came to a central cavern and stopped there were three tributary tunnels i focused my light on the third opening and knew it was the way i then turned my light off and told lindell to do the same why whats going on nothing just turn it off for a second he did and i waited a moment for my eyes to adjust to the darkness my vision and focus came back and i could pick up the outline of the rock walls and jutting surfaces i could see the light that had followed us in what is it lindell asked lost light i wanted to see the lost light what you can always find it even in the dark even underground i snapped my light back on careful not to hit lindell in the face with the beam and headed toward the third tributary tunnel this time we needed to duck and proceed in single file as the tunnel grew smaller and more cramped the channel curved to the right and soon we could see light ahead an opening we moved through and came out into an open bowl a granite stadium chiseled out decades before the devils punchbowl over time the bottom of the bowl had filled with a layer of runoff granite debris and dust a layer just thick enough for brush to put down roots and for a body to be buried it was here that dorsey and cross had been led to the body of antonio markwell and where they would come back again with marty gessler i found myself wondering how long she had been alive on that night three years ago had she been pushed at gunpoint through the tunnel or dragged already dead to her final resting spot neither answer was any comfort i looked back at lindell as he came out of the tunnel into the opening his face was ghostly white and i guessed that he might have been considering the same thing where he asked i turned from him and scanned the bottom of the bowl and then i saw it a tiny white cross rising in the brownandyellow brush line by the granite facing there lindell took the lead and walked quickly to the cross he lifted it out of the ground without a second thought and tossed it to the side he was already putting his shovel into the ground when i got there i looked down at the cross it was made from an old picket fence at its center point was a photo of a young boy a school photo framed with popsicle sticks antonio markwell was long gone from this life and this spot but his family had marked it as a holy ground dorsey and cross had then used it because they knew the ground here would never be disturbed by trespassers i leaned down and picked the tiny cross up i leaned it against the granite wall and then i went to work with my borrowed shovel we didnt really dig with the shovels we scraped at the surface both of us instinctively reluctant to drive the point of the blade down too deeply in less than five minutes we found her one final scrape of lindells shovel revealed a thick plastic tarp we put the shovels aside and we both squatted to look the plastic was opaque like a shower curtain but through it was the distinct outline of a hand a small withered hand a womans hand okay roy we found her maybe we should back out of here now make the calls no i want to do this i he didnt finish he put his hand on my chest and gently pushed me back away he then crouched over the spot and started digging with his hands his arms moving quickly as though he thought he was in a race against time that he was trying to save her before she suffocated im sorry roy i said to his back but i dont think he heard me in a few minutes he had uncovered most of the plastic from her face down to her hips the plastic had apparently slowed but not stopped decay the air in the bowl took on a musty smell moving back closer and peering over lindells shoulder i could see that agent martha gessler had been wrapped and buried fully clothed with her arms crossed in front of her only half of her face was dimly visible through the plastic the rest was hidden in blackness blood in the folds of the plastic i guessed that they had killed her with a head shot her computer is here lindell said i stepped further forward to see i could make out the outline of a laptop computer it was wrapped in its own plastic and left on her chest it holds the connection to simonson i said though that was obvious by now it was their edge they wanted the body and the laptop someplace where they could get to it they thought it would keep simonson and the others in line but they were wrong i saw lindells shoulders start to shake but i knew he was no longer digging give me a minute harry he said his voice straining sure roy im going to make my way back to the cars and call some people i left my cell phone whether he knew i had lied or not he didnt object i picked up one of the flashlights and headed back on my way back through the smaller tunnel i could hear the big man crying behind me the sound was somehow picked up and intensified as it came into the tunnel it was like he was right next to me it was like he was inside my head i moved faster i got to the main channel and was almost running by the time i got to the entrance when i finally came out into the light it was raining the following afternoon i took another southwest jet from burbank to las vegas i still wasnt allowed back into my house and wasnt sure i ever wanted to go back anyway i was still a key part of the investigation but nobody had specifically told me not to leave town they only say that sort of stuff in movies anyway as usual the flight was full people going to the cathedrals of greed bringing their stores of cash and hope it made me think of simonson and dorsey and cross and angella benton and what part greed and luck had played in their lives most of all i thought of marty gessler and the bad luck she had left to molder for more than three years in that place she had simply made a phone call to a cop and that had brought about her own destruction good intentions trust what a way to go what a wonderful world this time i rented a car at mccarran and i fought my own way through the traffic the address lindell had gotten for me off the license plate number i had given him was located on the northwest side of the city it was out near the end of the sprawl for now at least it belonged to a house that was newly built and large it had a french provincial style to it i think it did at least im not that good at that sort of thing the twocar garage was closed but off to the side of the circular driveway was a car that wasnt the one i had been in with eleanor it was a toyota maybe five years old with a lot of miles on it i could tell i am good at that sort of thing i parked the rental at the edge of the circle and slowly got out i dont know maybe i thought if i took my time somebody would open the door and invite me in and all my qualms would be eased but it didnt happen i got to the door and had to push the button and knew i would probably have to push my way in figuratively i heard a chime sound from inside and i waited before i needed to ring again the door was answered by a woman a latina who looked to be in her sixties she was small and had a kind but worn face she looked like she felt bad about the shotgun burns on my face she didnt wear a uniform of any type but i was guessing she was the maid eleanor with a maid i had a hard time picturing that is eleanor wish here can i say who it is please her english was good and carried only a slight accent tell her its her husband i saw the alarm go off in her eyes and i realized that i had been stupid former husband i said quickly just tell her its harry please wait i nodded and she closed the door i heard her lock it as i waited i could feel the heat working through my clothes penetrating my scalp all around me the sun was reflecting brightly it was almost five minutes before the door was opened again and eleanor stood there harry are you all right im fine i saw everything on tv cnn i just nodded to that its so sad about marty gessler yeah and then nothing for a long moment before she finally spoke what are you doing here harry i dont know i just wanted to see you how did you find this place i shrugged im a detective was at least you should have called me first i know i should have done a lot of things but i didnt eleanor im sorry okay sorry for everything are you going to let me in or should i just melt out here in the sun before you come in i have to tell you this is not how i wanted to do this i felt a deep downward tug in my chest as she stepped back and opened the door she raised her hand in a welcoming gesture and i stepped into a foyer area that had arched doorways leading in three different directions its not how you wanted to do what i asked lets go into the living room she said we took the middle arch and stepped into a large room that was neat and nicely furnished in one corner was a baby grand piano that caught my eye eleanor didnt play unless she had taken it up since shed left me you want something to drink harry um water would be good its hot out there it usually is stay here and ill be right back i nodded and she left me there i looked around the room i recognized none of the furniture from the apartment where i had once visited her everything was different everything was new the rear wall of the room was comprised of sliding glass doors that looked upon a screenedin pool area i noticed that surrounding the pool was a white plastic safety fence that people with children put up as a precaution something suddenly began to click about all of eleanors mysteries the obtuse answers the car trunk that couldnt be opened people carry foldup strollers in their trunks people with children harry i turned eleanor was there and standing next to her was a little girl with dark hair and eyes they held hands i looked from eleanor to the girl and then back and forth again the girl had eleanors features the same wave in her hair the same full lips and bobbed nose there was something about her demeanor that was the same too the way she looked at me but the eyes werent eleanors they were the eyes i saw when i looked in the mirror they came from me a sudden rush of feelings welled up in me not all of them good but now i could not take my eyes off the girl eleanor this is maddie maddie short for madeline madeline how old shes almost four now my mind shifted back i remembered the last time wed been together before eleanor left for good in the house on the hill it could have happened then eleanor seemed to read my thoughts it was like it was supposed to be like something was supposed to make sure we never she didnt finish why didnt you tell me i wanted it to be the right time when was that going to be now i guess you are a detective i guess i wanted you to find out about it thats not right what would have been right twin skyrockets were going off inside me one left a trail of red the other green they were going different ways one anger one warmth one led to the hearts dark abyss a devils punchbowl filled with recriminations and revenge i could dip my cup fully into the other led away from all of that to paradise road to bright blessed days and dark sacred nights it led to the place where lost light came from my lost light i knew i could choose one path but not both i looked up from the girl to eleanor she had tears on her face and yet a smile i knew then what path to choose and that there is no end to things of the heart i stepped forward and squatted down in front of the girl i knew from dealing with young witnesses that it was best to approach them on their level hello maddie i said to my daughter she turned her face and pushed it into her mothers leg im too shy she said thats okay maddie im pretty shy myself can i just hold your hand she let go of her mothers hand and extended hers to me i took it and she wrapped her tiny fingers around my index finger i shifted forward until my knees were on the floor and i was sitting back on my heels she peeked her eyes out at me she didnt seem scared just cautious i raised my other hand and she gave me her other hand the fingers wrapping the same way around my one i leaned forward and raised her tiny fists and held them against my closed eyes in that moment i knew all the mysteries were solved that
