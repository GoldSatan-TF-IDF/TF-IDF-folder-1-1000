jonathan kellerman guilt chapter all mine the house the life growing inside her the husband holly finished her fifth circuit of the back room that looked out to the yard she paused for breath the babyaimeehad started pushing against her diaphragm since escrow had closed holly had done a hundred circuits imagining loving every inch of the place despite the odors embedded in ninetyyearold plaster cat pee mildew overripe vegetable soup old person in a few days the painting would begin and the aroma of fresh latex would bury all that and cheerful colors would mask the discouraging graybeige of hollys tenroom dream not counting bathrooms the house was a brickfaced tudor on a quarteracre lot at the southern edge of cheviot hills built when construction was meant to last and adorned by moldings wainscoting arched mahogany doors quartersawn oak floors parquet in the cute little study that would be matts home office when he needed to bring work home holly could close the door and not have to hear matts grumbling about moron clients incapable of keeping decent records meanwhile shed be on a comfy couch snuggling with aimee shed learned the sex of the baby at the fourmonth anatomical ultrasound decided on the name right then and there matt didnt know yet he was still adjusting to the whole fatherhood thing sometimes she wondered if matt dreamed in numbers resting her hands on a mahogany sill holly squinted to blank out the weeds and dead grass struggling to conjure a green flowerladen eden hard to visualize with a mountain of tree trunk taking up all that space the fivestory sycamore had been one of the houses selling points with its trunk as thick as an oil drum and dense foliage that created a moody almost spooky ambience hollys creative powers had immediately kicked into gear visualizing a swing attached to that swooping lower branch aimee giggling as she swooped up and shouted that holly was the best mommy two weeks into escrow during a massive unseasonal rainstorm the sycamores roots had given way thank god the monster had teetered but hadnt fallen the trajectory wouldve landed it right on the house an agreement was drawn up the sellersthe old womans son and daughterwould pay to have the monstrous thing chopped down and hauled away the stump ground to dust the soil leveled instead theyd cheaped out paying a tree company only to cut down the sycamore leaving behind a massive horror of deadwood that took up the entire rear half of the yard matt had gone bananas threatened to kill the deal abrogate what an ugly word holly had cooled him off by promising to handle the situation shed make sure they got duly compensated he wouldnt have to deal with it fine as long as you actually do it now holly stared at the mountain of wood feeling discouraged and a bit helpless some of the sycamore she supposed could be reduced to firewood fragments and leaves and loose pieces of bark she could rake up herself maybe create a compost pile but those massive columns whatever shed figure it out meanwhile there was catpeeoverripesoupmildewoldlady stink to deal with mrs hannah had lived in the house for fiftytwo years still how did a persons smell permeate lath and plaster not that holly had anything against old people though she didnt know too many there had to be something you could do to freshen yourselfa special deodorantwhen you reached a certain age one way or the other matt would settle down hed come around he always did like with the house itself hed never expressed any interest in design all of a sudden he was into contemporary holly had toured a ton of boring white boxes knowing matt would always find a reason to say no because that was matts thing by the time hollys dream house materialized he didnt care about style just a good price the deal had been one of those warpspeed magical things like when the stars are all aligned and your karmas perfectly positioned old lady dies greedy kids want quick cash and contact coldwell and randomly get hooked up with vanessa and vanessa calls holly before the house goes on the market because she owes holly bigtime all those nights talking vanessa down from bad highs listening to vanessas nonstop litany of personal issues toss in the biggest real estate slump in decades and the fact that holly had been a little ms scroogette working twelvehour days as a pr drone since graduating college nine years ago and matt was even tighter plus hed gotten that raise plus that ipo they got to invest in from one of matts tech buddies had paid off and they had just enough for the down payment and to qualify for financing mine including the tree holly struggled with a balky old brass handleoriginal hardware shoved a warped french door open and stepped out into the yard making her way through the obstacle course of felled branches deathbrowned leaves and ragged pieces of bark she reached the fence that separated her property from the neighbors this was her first serious look at the mess and it was even worse than shed thought the tree company had sawed away with abandon allowing the chunks to fall on unprotected ground the result was a whole bunch of holescraters a real disaster maybe she could use that to threaten a bigtime lawsuit unless they carted everything away and cleaned up properly shed need a lawyer one whod take it on contingency god those holes were ugly sprouting thick wormy masses of roots and a nastylooking giant splinter she kneeled at the rim of the grossest crater tugged at the roots no give moving to a smaller pit she dislodged only dust at the third hole as she managed to tug loose a thatch of smaller roots her fingers brushed against something cold metallic buried treasure aye aye pirate booty wouldnt that be justice laughing holly brushed away soil and rocks revealed a patch of pale blue then a red cross a few more strokes and the entire top of the metal thing came into view a box like a safedeposit box but larger blue except for the red cross at the center something medical or just kids burying whoknewwhat in an abandoned receptacle holly tried to budge the box it shimmied but held fast she rocked it back and forth made some progress but was unable to free the darn thing then she remembered and went to the garage and retrieved the ancient spade from the stack of rusty tools left behind by the sellers another broken promise theyd pledged to clean up completely gave the excuse that the tools were still usable they were just trying to be nice like matt would ever use hedge clippers or a rake or a hand edger returning to the hole she wedged the spades flat mouth between metal and dirt and put a little weight into the pry a creak sounded but the box only budged a tiny bit stubborn devil maybe she could pop the lid to see what was inside nope the clasp was held tight by soil she worked the spade some more same lack of progress back in the old days she wouldve borne down hard back when she did zumba twice a week and yoga once a week and ran ks and didnt have to avoid sushi or carpaccio or latte or chardonnay all for you aimee now every week brought increasing fatigue everything shed taken for granted was an ordeal she stood there catching her breath okay time for an alternative plan inserting the spade along every inch of the boxs edges she let loose a series of tiny sharp tugs working methodically careful not to strain after two gorounds she began again had barely pushed down on the spade when the boxs left side popped up and it flew out of the hole and holly staggered back caught offbalance the spade fell from her hands as she used both arms to fight for stability she felt herself going down willed herself not to managed to stay on her feet close call she was wheezing like an asthmatic couch potato finally she recovered enough to drag the blue box onto the dirt no lock on the latch just a hasp and loop rusted through but the rest of the box had turned green from oxidation and a patch worn through the blue paint explained that bronze from the weight solid that had to be worth something by itself sucking in a lungful of air holly jiggled with the hasp until she freed it prestogizmo she said lifting the lid the bottom and sides of the box were lined with browned newspaper resting in the nest of clippings was something wrapped in fuzzy clotha satinedged blanket once blue now faded mostly to tan and pale green purplish splotches on the satin borders something worth wrapping burying excited holly lifted the blanket out of the box feeling disappointed immediately because whatever was inside had no serious weight to it scratch doubloons or gold bars or rosecut diamonds laying the blanket on the ground holly took hold of a seam and unfurled the thing that had been inside the blanket grinned up at her then it shapeshifted oh god and she cried out and it fell apart in front of her eyes because all that had held it together was the tension of the blanketwrap tiny skeleton now a scatter of loose bones the skull had landed right in front of her smiling black eyeholes insanely piercing two minuscule tooththingies on the bottom jaw looked ready to bite holly sat there unable to move or breathe or think a bird peeped silence bore down on holly a leg bone rolled to one side as if by its own power and she let out a wordless retch of fear and revulsion that did nothing to discourage the skull it kept staring like it knew something holly mustered all of her strength and screamed kept screaming chapter the woman was blond pretty whitefaced pregnant her name was holly ruche and she sat hunched atop a tree stump one of a dozen or so massive chainsawed segments taking up a good portion of the rundown backyard breathing hard and clutching her belly she clenched her eyes shut one of milos cards rested between her right thumb and forefinger crumpled beyond recognition for the second time since id arrived she waved off help from the paramedics they hung around anyway paying scant attention to the uniforms and the coroners crew everyone standing around looking superfluous it would take an anthropologist to make sense of this milo had phoned the emts first priorities its not like theres any emergency to the rest of it the rest of it was an assortment of brown bones that had once been a babys skeleton scattered on an old blanket not a random toss the general shape was of a tiny disarticulated human body open sutures in the skull and a couple of dental eruptions in the mandible made my guess four to six months but my phds in the wrong science for that kind of prophecy the smallest bonesfingers toeswerent much thicker than toothpicks looking at the poor little thing made my eyes hurt i shifted my attention to details beneath the blanket was a wad of newspaper clippings from lining a blue metal box around two feet long the paper was the la daily news defunct since a sticker on the side of the box read property swedish benevolent hospital and infirmary central avenue los angeles caan institution just confirmed by milo to have shut down in the homely squat tudor house fronting the yard looked to be older than that probably from the twenties when so much of la had taken shape holly ruche began crying a paramedic approached again maam im fine swolleneyed hair cut in an offkilter bob mussed by nervous hands she focused on milo as if for the first time shifted to me shook her head stood folding her arms across her occupied abdomen she said when can i have my house back detective soon as we finish processing ms ruche she regarded me again milo said this is dr delaware our consulting psychologist psychologist is someone worried about my mental health no maam we sometimes call dr delaware in when thanks but im fine shuddering she glanced back to where shed found the bones so horrible milo said how deeply was the box buried i dont knownot deep i was able to pull it up wasnt i you dont really think this is a real crime do you i mean a new one its historical not for the police right the house was constructed in but it couldve even been there way before the land used to be bean fields and grapevines if you dug up the neighborhoodany neighborhoodwho knows what youd find she placed a hand on her chest seemed to be fighting for oxygen milo said maybe you should sit down maam dont worry i promise im okay how about we let the paramedics take a look at you ive already been looked at she said by a real doctor yesterday my obgyn everythings perfect how far along are you five months her smile was frigid what could possibly not be okay i own a gorgeous house even though youre processing it she hmmphed its their fault all i wanted to do was have them get rid of the tree if they hadnt done it sloppy this would never have happened the previous owners the hannahs mark and brenda it was their mothers she died they couldnt wait to cash out hey heres something for you detective im sorry whatd you say your name was lieutenant sturgis heres something lieutenant sturgis the old woman was ninetythree when she died she lived here for a long time the house still smells of her so she could easily have done that well look into it ms ruche what exactly does processing mean depends on what else we find she reached into a jean pocket and drew out a phone that she jabbed angrily cmon answer alreadyoh i got you finally listen i need you to come over to the house you wont believe what happened what no i cantokay soon as the meetings finished no dont call just come over she hung up milo said your husband hes an accountant as if that explained it so whats processing our first step will be bringing some dogs in to sniff around depending upon what they come up with maybe a belowground sonar to see if anything else is buried down there else said holly ruche why would there be anything else no reason but we need to be thorough youre saying my home is a graveyard thats disgusting all youve got is some old bones theres no reason to think theres more im sure youre right of course im right i own this place the house and the land a hand fluttered to her abdomen she massaged my babys developing perfectly thats great ms ruche she stared at milo gave out a tiny squeak her eyes rolled back her mouth went slack she pitched backward milo and i both caught her her skin was dank clammy as she went limp the paramedics rushed over looking oddly satisfied itoldyouso nods one of them said its always the stubborn ones well take it from here lieutenant milo said you sure as hell will and went to call the anthropologist chapter liz wilkinson had just finished a lecture at the u would be over in twenty milo went to make more calls and i sat with holly ruche all vital signs fine per the emts but she needed to rest and get down some fluids they gave me custody of the gatorade squeeze bottle packed up and left for an emergency call near the freeway the first time i offered the bottle to holly she clamped her mouth and shook her head the second time her lips parted several sips later she smiled and lowered her right hand until it rested atop my left her skin had warmed she said i feel much better youre a psychologist for victim aid i do whats needed theres no set routine i guess i am a victim of sorts it had to be rough it was horrible do you think hes going to dig up my entire yard he wont do anything unnecessary that sounds like youre covering for him im judging from experience so you work with him a lot i do must be ooh she winced touched her belly the black jersey of her top puffed shes moving like crazyits a girl congratulations girls rule she grinned im looking forward to having a little bff another grimace wow shes being really hyper oh my that one smarted a bit shes kicking me in the ribs i said first baby you can tell she said im coming across like an amateur not at all youre young not that young she said im thirtyone thats young my mother had me when she was eighteen thats younger she laughed grew serious i didnt want that starting so young her eyes shifted upward the way she did it but i always knew i wanted it motherhood motherhood house yard the whole domesticgoddess thing its going to be great looking past me she took in the crime scene techs studying the tree segments theyd arrived fifteen minutes ago were waiting for liz wilkinson had placed a white cloth over the blue box the fabric had settled into an oblong a deflated ghost costume holly ruche said i cant have them turning my property into a disaster zone or something i know its not much right now but i have plans not a word about the tiny bones i wondered why a married woman would avoid the plural form it was all coming together she said then that crazy tree had to movement from the driveway caused us both to turn a man around hollys age skinnybutsoft bald and bearded studied the felled tree before heading over he wore a longsleeved blue shirt gray slacks brown shoes beeper on his belt iphone in his hand aviator sunglasses perched atop his clean head hey she said hey he said his wedding ring matched hers neither of them took the greeting beyond that he had one of those faces thats allergic to smiling kept several feet between himself and holly looked putupon she said matt his attention shifted to the hand shed continued to drape over mine i stood introduced myself he said a doctor theres a problem healthwise shes doing well considering good matt ruche shes my wife holly said doctor as in psychologist hes been giving me support matt ruches eyes narrowed okay his wife flashed him a broad flat smile im feeling much better now it was crazy finding it had to be so when can we clean up dont know theyll tell us that sucks they have to do their job matt he touched his beeper what a hassle the stupid tree fell down said holly no way could anyone whatever he glanced at his phone i turned to leave holly ruche said hold on one sec she got to her feet do you have a card dr delaware i found one matt ruche reached to take it she beat him to it he flushed clear up to his scalp shrugging he began texting holly gripped my hand with both of hers thanks i wished her good luck just as liz wilkinson strode into the yard carrying two hardshell cases she had on a pantsuit the color of bittersweet chocolate same hue as her skin a couple of tones lighter a white coat was draped over one arm her hair had been straightened recently and she wore it loose and long she saw me waved kept going someone mustve prepped her because she headed straight for the tarp put on the coat tied her hair back gloved up stooped and drew the cloth back deftly oh look at this poor little thing the bones seemed even smaller the color of browned butter in places nearly black in others fragile as lace i could see tiny nubs running along the chewing surfaces of both jaws unerupted tooth buds lizs lower lip extended buried under the tree i pointed out the hole liz examined the blue box swedish hospital never heard of it closed down in what do you think the box was originally used for maybe exactly this she said a morgue receptacle i was thinking something used to transfer remains the baby died a natural death in the hospital and someone took the body bodies dont stay in hospitals they go to mortuaries alex after that who knows regulations were looser back then i said the box is solid brass maybe it was intended to transfer lab specimens and someone thought iron or steel increased the risk of oxidation she returned to the skeleton put on magnifying eyeglasses got an inch from the bones no wires or drill holes probably no bleach or chemical treatment so it doesnt appear to be a teaching specimen she touched the tooth buds not a newborn not with those mandibular incisors about to come through best guess is four to seven months which fits the overall size of the skeleton though if the baby was neglected or abused it could be older no fractures or stress marks im not seeing any obvious tool marksno wounds of any sort the neck bones appear to be intact so cross out strangulation no obvious bone malformations either like from rickets or some other deficiency in terms of sex its too young for sexual dimorphism but if we can get some dna we can determine gender and possibly a degree of racial origin unfortunately the backlogs pretty bad and something this old and cold isnt going to be prioritized in terms of time since death i can do some carbon dating but my gut tells me this isnt some ancient artifact i said the box was out of active use in those newspaper clippings are from and the house was built in i know that doesnt determine the time frame but its a good place to start i agree so rather than go all supertech from the getgo milo should pull up real estate records find out whos lived here and work backward he identifies a suspect we can prioritize dna unless the suspects deceased which is quite possible if were talking a sixty seventyyearold crime thats the case maybe some relative will cooperate and we can get a partial a deep voice behind and above us grumbled milo has begun pulling up real estate records afternoon elizabeth liz looked up hi didnt see you when i came in milo said in the house making calls and taking the detective walk through the empty space his expression said that nothing obvious had come up so what do you think kid liz repeated her initial impressions not that you need me for any of that he said young moses needs you i appreciate your input detective i moe reed was her true love theyd met at a swamp full of corpses she laughed moses appreciates me too say hi when you see him which is probably before i will she stood so what else can i do for you take custody of the bones and do your wizard thing if you need the box you can have it otherwise its going to the crime lab dont need the box she said but im not really sure i can tell you much more how about age of victim ill get it as close as i can she said we can also xray to see if some sort of damage comes up within the bones though thats unlikely theres certainly nothing overt to indicate assault or worse so we could be talking a natural death natural but someone buried it under a tree he frowned i hate thatit his shirt had come loose over his paunch he tucked it in hitched his trousers liz said maybe covert burial does imply some sort of guilt and no visible marks doesnt eliminate murder asphyxiating a baby is way too easy and its not rare in infanticides soft kill he said she blinked never heard that before im a master of terrible irony chapter milo and i returned to holly ruche her husband was gone she said he had a meeting milo said accountant stuff not too exciting huh milo said most jobs are a lot of routine she scanned the yard id still like to know why a psychologist was called in are you saying whoever lived here was a maniac not at all he turned to me youre fired doc i said finally holly ruche smiled for half a second milo said that woman in the white coat is a forensic anthropologist the black woman interesting her hands clenched i really hope this doesnt turn out to be one of those maddog serial killer things bodies all over the place if thats what happens i could never live here wed be tied up in court that would be a disaster im sure everything will turn out fine just one little teensy skeleton she snapped thats fine she looked down at her abdomen sorry lieutenant its justi just cant stand seeing my place overrun with strangers i understand no reason to stick around holly this is my home my apartments just a way station he said were gonna need the area clear for the dogs the dogs she said they find something youll bring in machinery and tear up everything we prefer noninvasive methods like groundpenetrating radar air and soil analysis how do you analyze air we insert thin flexible tubing into air pockets but with something this old decomposition smells are unlikely and if you find something suspicious you bring in machines and start ripping and shredding okay i will leave but please make sure if you turned on any lights you turn them off we just got the utilities registered in our name and the last thing i need is paying the police departments electrical bill she walked away using that oddly appealing waddle pregnant women acquire hands clenched neck rigid milo said highstrung girl i said not the best of mornings plus her marriage doesnt seem to be working too well ah notice how i avoided telling her how you got here no sense disillusioning the citizenry most homicides are mundane and on the way to clearance within a day or two milo sometimes calls me on the interesting ones this time though it was a matter of lunch steak salad and scotch to be exact at a place just west of downtown wed both spent the morning at the das office he reviewing the file on a horrific multiple murder i in the room next door proofreading my witness statement on the same killings hed tried to avoid the experience taking vacation time then ignoring messages but when deputy da john nguyen phoned him at midnight and threatened to come over with cartons of weekold vegan takeout milo had capitulated sensible decision and dont even think of flaking on me said nguyen also ask delaware if he wants to take care of his business at the same time the drafts just came in milo picked me up at nine am driving the porsche he shares with his partner rick silverman he wore an unhealthily shiny gray aloha shirt patterned with leering sea lions and clinically depressed angelfish baggy multipleated khakis scuffed desert boots the shirt did nothing to improve his indoor pallor but he loved hawaii so why not solving the multiple had taken a lot out of him chiefly because hed nearly died in the process id saved his life and that was something neither of us had ever imagined months had passed and we still hadnt talked about it i figured it was up to him to broach the topic and so far he hadnt when we finished at the court building he looked anything but celebratory but he insisted on taking me out for a seventybuck sirlointbone combo and all the chivas you can tolerate boyo seeing as im the designated wheelman an hour later all wed done was eat and drink and make the kind of small talk that doesnt work well between real friends i rejected dessert but he went for a threescoop praline sundae drowned in hot fudge syrup and pineapple sauce hed lost a bit of weight since facing mortality was carrying maybe two forty on his stiltlegged seventyfive inches most of it around the middle watching him maximize the calories made it tempting to theorize about anxiety denial masked depression guilt choose your psychobabble id known him long enough to know that sometimes gluttony was a balm other times an expression of joy hed finished two scoops when his phone signaled a text wiping his chin and brushing coarse black hair off his pockmarked forehead he read well well well its good i didnt indulge in the firewater time to go new case of sorts he said bones buried in an old box under an older tree from the size a baby of sorts sounds like an old one so probably not much to do other than trace ownership of the property tossing cash on the table he got up want me to drop you off wheres the property cheviot hills no need to drive all the way to my place then circle back up to you he said i probably wont be that long back at the car he tucked the aloha shirt into the khakis retrieved a sad brown tweed sport coat from the trunk ended up with a strange sartorial meld of scottish highlands and oahu a baby i said he said nothing chapter seconds after liz wilkinson left with the bones moe reed beeped in milo muttered two ships passing clicked his cell on conference reed said got all the deed holders el tee should have a list for you by the time you get back anything else thatll do it for now moses regards from your inamorata my what your true love she was just here oh said reed yeah of course bones she have anything to say just that she thinks youre dreamy reed laughed lets hope she holds that thought cause were going out tonight unless you need me to work late or something not a chance said milo this one wont earn overtime for anyone reed was waiting outside milos office holding a sheaf of paper and sipping from a water bottle his blond hair had grown out a couple of inches from the usual crew cut his young face was pink and unlined belying his oldsoul approach to life massive muscles strained the sleeves of his blue blazer his pants were creased his shoes spitshined id never seen him dress any other way just got a call el tee got to run blunt force trauma db in a bar on washington not far from sony studios go detect doesnt sound like much detection said reed offenders still at the scene patrol found him standing on top of the bar yelling space demons made him do it more like your department doc not unless ive offended someone he laughed hurried off milo unlocked his door one of milos lieutenant perks negotiated years ago in a tradeoff deal with a criminally vulnerable former chief of police is his own space separate from the big detective room anothers the ability to continue working cases rather than push paper like most lieutenants do the new chief couldve abrogated the deal but he was smart enough to check out milos solve stats and though he amuses himself with chronic abuse of mr socalled hotshot he doesnt fix what isnt broken the downside is a windowless work space the size of a closet milo is longlimbed and bulky and when he stretches he often touches plaster when hes in a certain mood the place has the feel of an oldfashioned zoo cage one of those claustrophobic confinements utilized before people started thinking of animals as having souls he sank down into his desk chair setting off a tirade of squeaks read the list passed it over holly ruches dream abode was a thirtyonehundredsquarefoot singlefamily residence situated in what was then the monte marvista tract completed on january and sold three months later to mr and mrs jacob thornton after ten years possession passed to the thorntons daughter marjorie who unloaded the property thirteen months later to dr and mrs malcolm crowell larner the larners lived there until when the deed was transferred to dr and mrs george j del rios the del rioses resided at the property until after which possession shifted to the del rios family trust in ownership passed to the robert and alice hannah family trust and in alice hannah newly widowed took sole possession a status that had endured until sixty days ago when her heirs sold to mr and mrs matthew ruche initial purchase price fortyeight hundred dollars holly and matt had gotten a recession bargain at nine hundred forty thousand dollars with a down payment of a hundred seventyfive thousand and the remainder financed by a lowinterest loan milo jabbed the list twice dr larner to dr del rios the time frame works that box came from a hospital and a shady whitecoat fits with swiping medical equipment for personal use i said id start with the period of those newspaper clippingspost that narrows it to the del rioses ownership agreed lets see what we can learn about these folk he plugged in his department password and typed away chewing a cold cigar to pulp official databases yielded nothing on dr george del rios other than a death certificate in age sixtythree natural causes a search for other decedents with the same surname pulled up del rios ethel a dod age sixtyfour cancer and del rios edward a dod age fortyfive vehicular accident i like edward a as a starting point he said the trust sold the house a year after he died so theres a decent chance he was george and ethels boy and inherited the place i said a boy in his thirties who george and ethel mightve worried about so they left the house in trust rather than bequeathed it to him outright and even though the trustee didnt get it until a son could have had access to the property before then when mama was living there alone she goes to bridge club he digs a little hole maybe their lack of faith was due to lifestyle issues eddies a miscreant back then a wellheeled miscreant could avoid stigma so vehicular accident mightve been code for a onecar dui but some stigmas youd need to take care of yourself like a socially embarrassing outofwedlock birth he said eddies married and the mothers someone other than wifey yeah that would be blushinducing at the country club even if eddie was a bachelor playboy burying a social inconvenience couldve seemed like a grand idea he thought i like it alex lets dig dirt on this charmer pun intended he searched for obituaries on all three family members dr george j del rioss was featured in the times and the examiner hed been an esteemed certaintobemissed cardiologist on staff at st vincent hospital as well as a faculty member at the med school where i sometimes taught no final bio for his widow nothing on her at all father edward del rios director of the good shepherd orphanage of santa barbara had perished when a bus ferrying children from that institution to the local zoo had veered off cabrillo boulevard on july several of the children had been injured a few seriously but all had recovered the priest and the bus driver hadnt been so lucky the santa barbara newspress covered the crash on its front page reporting that several of the terrified youngsters describe the driver meldrom perry suddenly slumping over the wheel leading to the bus going out of control the children also report that father eddie made an heroic attempt to gain control of the vehicle both perry of vista and father del rios just days from his birthday perished after being thrown free of the bus but the man of gods valiant attempts may have prevented an even worse disaster an investigation has begun into allegations that perry suffered from a prior heart condition a fact known to the bus charter company an outfit with previous violations on record some playboy said milo poor guy was a damn hero i said he lived in santa barbara so the house was probably rented out during his ownership and try finding a tenant okay time to canvass the neighborhood maybe some oldtimer will remember that far back theres another reason the house couldve been left in trust father eddie was in charge but he had siblings seeing as he was catholic seeing as most people have siblings if you can access any trust documents theyll list who else benefited it took a while but an appendix stashed in the bowels of the tax rolls finally yielded the data two brothers one sister all younger than father eddie ferdinand and mary alice had passed away decades ago in their sixties consistent with the genetic endowment bestowed by their parents the baby of the family john jacob del rios was listed as residing in burbank age eightynine milo looked up his number and called generally he switches to speaker so i can listen in this time he forgot or chose not to do so and i sat there as he introduced himself explained the reason for calling as an occurrence at john j del rioss old family home listened for a while said thank you sir and hung up sounds young for his age more than happy to talk about the good old days but it needs to be tomorrow hes entertaining a lady friend he also let me know hed been on the job lapd sheriff he typed some more commander john j del rios had run the sheriffs correctional division from through retired with pension and received a citation from his boss for distinguished service further cybersnooping pulled up a tenyear stretch at a private security firm after that nothing milo made a few calls to contacts at the tanshirts no one remembered del rios i said entertaining a lady friend maybe hes our playboy hed have been in his twenties prime time for an active sexual life well check him out tomorrow eleven am after his golf game golf women the good life i said a good long life the priest dies young the hedonist thrives yeah i love when justice prevails chapter the following morning i picked milo up on butler avenue and santa monica just north of the west la station the bones had made the morning news print and tv with holly ruches name left out and the neighborhood described as affluent westside milo was carrying a folded times by his side he wore a lintgray suit algaegreen shirt poly tie the color of venous blood the sun wasnt kind to his pockmarked face that and his size and his glower made him someone youd cross the street to avoid he appreciates the value of publicity as much as any experienced detective but he likes to control the flow and i expected him to be angry about the leak he got into the seville stretched yawned said top of the morning thumbed to the editorial pages scanning the oped columns he muttered cheerfully stupid stupid stupid and big surprise more stupid folding the paper he tossed it in back i said any tips come in from the story nothing serious so far moe and sean are working the phones the good news for mr and mrs ruche is the dogs turned up nothing else ditto for radar and snifftubes nothing remotely iffy in the house either so looks like weve got a lone antique whodunit not a psycho cemetery he stretched some more i said youre okay with the leak thats like saying im okay with earthquakes whats my choice he closed his eyes kept them shut as i got on the by the time i was over the hills and dipping down into the valley and the east he was snoring with glee burbank is lots of things a working to middleclass suburb host to film lots and tv studios nononsense neighbor to the mansions and estates of toluca lake where bob hope william holden the three stooges and other luminaries established a celebrity outpost that avoided the westside riffraff the city also also butts up against griffith park and has its own equestrian center and horse trails john jacob del rios lived just northeast of the park on a street of ranch houses set on halfacre lots paddocks were visible at the ends of driveways the aroma of wellseasoned equine dung seasoned the air a shortage of trees helped the sun along and as noon approached the asphalt simmered and a scorch like that of an iron left too long on wool melded with the horse odors del rioss residence was redwoodsided shingleroofed fronted by a marinebuzz lawn an old wagon wheel was propped to the left of the door a white suburban with utility tires was parked at the onset of the driveway inches behind a horse trailer no paddock in view but a corral fashioned from metal piping housed a beautiful black mare with a white diamond on her chest she watched us approach gave two short blinks flicked her tail i took the time to get a closer look she cocked her head flirtatiously glossy coat soft eyes years ago id take breaks from the cancer wards and ride up at sunset ranch near the hollywood sign i loved horses it had been too long i smiled at the mare she winked milo said cmon hopalong time to meet john wayne the man who answered the door was more gregory peck than duke six five and patrician with a shelf of deeply cleft chin a wellaligned arrogantly tilted nose and thick hair as snowy as wellbeaten egg whites his eyes were clear blue his skin clear bronze veneered by a fine mesh of wrinkles his build still athletically proportioned save for some hunching of the shoulders and widening of the hips nearing ninety john j del rio looked fifteen years younger he wore a blueandwhite minicheck longsleeved shirt navy slacks black calfskin loafers the bluefaced steel rolex on his left wrist was chunky and authoritative rimless hexagonal eyeglasses gave him the look of a popular professor emeritus for years but invited back to campus often or one of those actors hired by health insurance companies to play elderlybutfit on their scam commercials he proffered a hand larger than milos lieutenant j j del rios good to meet you and this is dr alex delaware our consulting psychologist i was a psychology major myself at stanford to me studied with professor ernest hilgard i assume youve heard of him i said of course he turned back to milo i read about your occurrence this morning least im assuming thats the case youre working is it milo said yes sir box of baby bones sad the article said they were probably old i figure youre here to pinpoint a likely offender using property tax rolls am i right milo smiled john j del rios said cant fault you for that approach makes sense but if its an old why the psych angle milo said cases that are out of the ordinary we find the input helpful psychological autopsy basically could we come in sir oh sure said del rios no sense keeping you in the heat he waved us into a limegreen beamceilinged front room cooled by a grumbling window ac burntorange carpeting was synthetic spotless firm as hardwood blocky oak furniture from the seventies the kind purchased as a suite was placed predictably horse prints clipped from magazines were the concession to art the only sign of modernity was a wallmounted flatscreen hung carefully so no wires showed a passthrough counter led to a kitchen devoid of counter equipment the house was clean and orderly but ripe with the stalesweatburntcoffeeold spice tang of longtime bachelorhood j j del rios headed for an avocadocolored fridge something to drink im having a shot of grape juice virgin cabernet if you will he gave a barklike chuckle too early for my oneaday booze infusion but the antioxidants in grape skin are good for you you dont even need the alcohol he brandished a bottle half full with magenta liquid good stuff no added sugar waterll be fine sir sir been a while since i heard that from someone who meant it another low clipped laugh dont miss the job but there was a nice order to it everyone knowing their place you ran the jail division big fun said del rios keeping lowlifes locked up making sure they knew they werent living at the hilton how long did you do it said milo del rios returned with two waters in one huge hand juice in the other we all sat whats this small talk to gain rapport if you know i ran it you know for how long milo said didnt dig that deep sir del rios snorted that off tell me about your bones infant said milo half a year old give or take that was in the paper thats what we know so far youve narrowed down the time frame to when my family owned the place yes sir how afraid i cant get into that sir del rios smiled now im not liking the sir so much milo smiled back the warmth generated by the exchange mightve heated a baby gnat del rios said no sense drawing this out my family had nothing to do with it but i cant tell you none of the tenants did nor can i give you a name i have no idea who rented the place stayed completely out of it out of real estate out of anything that got in the way of having fun del rios drank grape juice smacked his lips dabbed them with a linen handkerchief the resulting magenta stain seemed to fascinate him milo said weve narrowed the time frame to the period your mother lived in the house and what period might that be nineteen fifty to well said del rios im sure you think youre clever problem is youre wrong after dad died in mom did live there by herself but only until she was diagnosed with both heart disease and cancer the seams across del rioss brow deepened she was a devout woman talk about a onetwo punch from a benevolent god it happened winter of right after the twoyear anniversary of dads death she hung on for four years the last two were a horror show the only question was which disease would get her first we tried having her stay in the house with a nurse but that got to be too much and by the spring of she was living with my brother frankie his real name was ferdinand but he hated it so he had us call him frank he and his wife lived in palo alto he was in medical residency back then orthopedics that lasted until the beginning of when mom had to be put in a home near stanford during her last year she was basically vegetative by she was gone before she moved up north with frankie and bertie she put the house in trust for the four of us but none of us wanted to live there it reminded us of dead parents frankie was living in palo alto my sister mary alice was studying medicine in chicago and i the rotten kid the dropout was in the marines and couldnt care less so eddiethe oldest one he was a priesthired a management company and we rented it out for years like i said i cant tell you who any of the tenants were and everyone else is dead so youre out of luck son do you remember the name of the management company cant remember something i never knew in the first place said del rios im trying to tell you i had no interest in anything but fun to me the damn house was a source of moolah each month id get a check from eddie for my share of the rent and promptly blow it then eddie died in a bus accident and the three of us got rid of the place cant even tell you who bought it but obviously you know he finished his grape juice thats the full story my friend dont imagine it makes you happy but i cant change that milo said it clarifies things del rios removed his glasses a man who sees the bright side funny you dont give that impression he stood we did the same milo said thanks for your time chief at the door del rios said when i figured out what you were after the thought that my family was under suspicion annoyed me even though if it was my case id be doing the same thing then i realized i couldnt help you and i started feeling for you son having to dig that far back winking so to speak so heres one more tidbit thats probably irrelevant but i dont want you thinking jjs not simpatico with a fellow officer before my brother eddie became a priest he was a car nut an early hotrodder into anything with four wheels and a big engine he even got dad to buy him a ford coupe that he souped up and dragraced anyway one day eddie and i were having lunch in the city he was working as an assistant priest at st vibiana on main street this was before he got transferred to santa barbara during the time mom was already living with frankie anyway eddie says johnny i drove by the house a few nights ago making sure the managers were getting the lawn cut better than the last time and you wont believe what was parked in the driveway a duesie i said a duesenberg in the flesh said del rios the metal it didnt mean much to me i didnt care about cars still dont but eddie was excited going on about not just a duesenberg but one with the big chrome supercharger pipes coming out of the side apparently thats a big deal he informs me this is the greatest car ever built they were rare to begin with twenty years later theyre a treasure he tells me a car like that wouldve cost more new than the house did hes wondering how the tenant could have that kind of money his best guess is shes got a rich boyfriend then he blushes shuts his mouth remembering hes a priest no more gossip i laughed like hell told him he should get himself a hot rod on the sly it bothers him he can confess about it meanwhile he can lay rubber right in front of the church worst case the cardinal has a stroke he laughed we had our lunch end of topic okay female tenant thats what he said said del rios she a woman fits with a baby a rich boyfriend fits with an unwanted baby what do you think son i think sir that youre still at the top of your game always have been okay good now you have to get out of here got a hot date and at my age getting ready is a production chapter as i drove back to the city milo called a dmv supervisor to find out how far back car registrations ran inactive records are deleted after a few months lieutenant what about paper archives nothing like that sir no warehouse in sacramento no such thing lieutenant what exactly are you looking for milo told her she said with a subpoena we could give you a list of currently registered duesenbergs that german american he said really i lived in detroit never heard of them they havent been manufactured for a long time oh said the supervisor a historical vehicle would a list of current regs help probably not but if its all i can get ill settle send me the proper paper and its all yours lieutenant he hung up i said auburn indiana what about it its where duesenbergs were built back in the day cars were manufactured all over the country my home state he said never knew that never saw anything exotic you wouldnt unless you had rich friends when duesenbergs came out they cost the equivalent of a million bucks and father eddie was right theyre prime candidates for the greatest car ever made were talking massive power gorgeous custom coachwork every screw handfashioned listen to you amigo what you were once a gearhead more like a fantasizing kid whod memorized every make and model because cars represented freedom and escape mentally cataloging all that information was a good timefiller when hiding in the woods waiting out a drunken fathers rage milo tapped the tuckedleather passenger door now that i think about it this is kind of a classic buggy my daily rides a seville chesterfield green with a tan vinyl top that matches her interior leather she rolled out of detroit the last year before gm bloated the model beyond recognition is styled well enough to help you forget shes caddy froufrou over a chevy ii chassis she loves her third engine is dependable cushy and makes no unreasonable demands i see no reason to get a divorce i said bite your tongue she thinks shes still a hot number he laughed so how many duesenbergs were made id guess hundreds not thousands and chrome pipes means it was supercharged which would narrow it down further so getting that subpoena might be worthwhile but then id need to backtrack the history of every one i find and the most i can hope for is some guy who visited the woman who lived in the house maybe at the time the baby was buried i said there could be a more direct way to identify her if father eddie noticed the car other neighbors probably did anyone who was an adult back then is likely to be deceased but in nice neighborhoods like cheviot houses get passed down to heirs a kid who dug cars he said okay cant postpone the legwork any longer you have time nothing but we began with properties half a mile either way from the burial site encountered lots of surprise but no wisdom returning to the ruche house milo knocked on the door rang the bell checked windows no one home i followed him to the backyard the yellow tape was gone the holes where airsniffing tubes had been inserted were still open the chair where holly ruche had sat yesterday had been moved closer to the felled tree sections and a womans sweater black size m loehmanns label was draped over one of the massive cylinders a few errant blond hairs stood out on the shoulders beneath the chair a paperback book sat on the dirt what to expect during pregnancy i said she came back when everyone left wanting to check out her dream he said location location location okay lets ask around some more about the car haystacks and needles and all that expanding the canvass another quarter mile produced similar results initially but at a house well north also tudor but grander and more ornately trimmed than holly and matts acquisition a small mustachioed man in his sixties holding a crystal tumbler of scotch said a duesie sure sj blue over bluenavy over baby his mustache was a tooblack stripe above a thin upper lip the few hairs on his head were white he wore a bottlegreen velvet smoking jacket gray pinstriped slacks black slippers with gold lions embroidered on the toes milo said what else can you tell us about it sir gorgeous said the man true work of art i saw it in so were talking a twelveyearold car but youd never know shiny kept up beautifully those chrome supercharger pipes coming out the side were like pythons on the prowl all that menace and power im telling you that was one magnificent beast who owned it said milo the man shook his head i tried to get her to tell me shed just smile and change the subject she eleanor said the man ellie green she lived therethat brick place pretending to be this place thats where the duesie used to park right in the driveway not often just once in a while and always at night but there was a porch light so you could see it down to the color looking back it had to be a boyfriend of hers but i was a kid five years old it was the car that interested me not her personal life id never seen anything like it asked my father about it he knew everything about everything when it came to cars raced at muroc before the war he grinned then he married my mother and she civilized him and he went to work selling packards downtown hes the one who filled me in on the duesie thats how i know it was a true sj because he told me it wasnt one of those where someone retrofitted the pipes this was the real deal he never mentioned whose it was never asked him said the man why whats up i saw all the commotion yesterday what happened at that place something was found there what can you tell us about ellie green sir she babysat me back before i started school i was always sick my parents got tired of never going out so they hired her to watch over me couldnt have been fun for her i was a runty piece of misery had scarlet fever bad case of the mumps measles even worse could throw up at will and believe me i did when the devil told me to he laughed at one point they thought i had diphtheria but it was just some nasty flu but ellie was always patient how old was she hmm to a kid everyone looks old probably thirty give or take whyre you asking about her what was found over there i asked one of your guys in uniform but all he said was an incident milo said some bones were dug up in the backyard it was on the news mr dave helmholtz i avoid the news back when i was a stockbroker i had to pay attention now i dont bones as in human yes sir a complete human skeleton a baby a baby buried in the backyard milo nodded helmholtz whistled thats pretty grotesque you think ellie had something to do with it why we dont know much at all at this point mr helmholtz but theres indication the bones were buried during the early fifties and the only information we picked up about that period was that a duesenberg was sometimes parked at the house early fifties said helmholtz yup that could certainly fit when ellie was here but why in the world would she bury a baby she didnt have any kids youre sure positive and i never saw her pregnant just the opposite she was skinny for back then i mean today shed be whats expected of a woman how long did she live there she babysat me for close to a year did she have a day job sure said helmholtz she was a nurse he smoked tamped smoked some more mom made a big deal about thata trained nurse because i pulled a snit about being left with a stranger i was a cranky runt mamas boy afraid of my own shadow trained nurse what did i care the first time ellie came over i hid under the covers ignored her completely she sat down waited me out finally i stuck my head out and she was smiling at me beeyootiful smile im talking moviestar caliber the blond hair the red lips the smoky eyes not that i care much about that i kept ignoring her finally i got hot and thirsty and came out and she fetched me something to drink i had a fever that year i always had a fever she put a cold compress on my forehead she hummed it soothed me she had a nice voice she was a nice person never tried to force anything real relaxed and a looker no question about that i smiled you didnt care about her looks you were concentrating on the duesenberg helmholtz stared at me broke into laughter okay you got me i had a crush on her who wouldnt she was nice as they came took care of me i stopped being upset when my parents went out obviously someone else thought she was nice whos that the owner of the duesenberg oh said helmholtz yeah mr lucky bastard he laughed some more thats what dad called him looking back it makes sense some rich guy wooed her maybe thats why she left i said she never gave you any indication at all who he was i asked a couple of times hoping maybe shed figure out i loved the car was angling for a ride all she did was smile and change the subject now that i think about it she never talked about herself period it was always about me what i wanted what i needed how was i feeling pretty good approach when youre working with a spoiled little brat no i can see her doing great as a nurse he brightened hey maybe lucky bastard was a rich doctor isnt that why girls became nurses back then to hook up with mds milo said is there anything else you can tell us about her nope i turned six got miraculously better went to school made friends dont know exactly when ellie moved out but it wasnt long after and instead of the duesenberg we got a plymouth big family with a plymouth station wagon the color of pea soup talk about a comedown i said could you estimate how many times you saw the duesenberg youre trying to figure out if she was entertaining some regular visitor something hot and heavy going on well all i can say is less than a dozen and probably more than half a dozen at night so how did a fiveyearold see it because that fiveyearold was a disobedient brat whod sneak out of the house through the kitchen in the middle of the night and walk over to see the car sometimes it was there sometimes it wasnt the last time i tried it i ran into my father he was standing on the sidewalk in front of ellies house looking at the car himself i turned to escape he saw me caught me i thought hed whack me but he didnt he laughed said yeah its fantastic davey cant blame you thats when he told me the model thirtyeight sj and what the pipes meant the advantage of supercharging we stood there together taking in that monster it was one of thosei guess youd call it a bonding thing but then he warned me never to leave the house without permission or he would tan my hide helmholtz smiled i always felt he thought i was a sissy i guess he didnt punish me because he assumed i was out there being a guy we continued up the block no one else remembered ellie green or the duesenberg back at the station milo ran her name nearly two dozen women came up but none whose stats fit the slim blonde whod lived at the bone house in he repeated the process with greene gruen gruhn even breen came up empty same for death notices in la and the neighboring counties i said she worked as a nurse and the box came from the swedish hospital he looked up the defunct institution pairing it with eleanor green and the same variants a few historical references popped up but the only names were major benefactors and senior doctors he said helmholtz could be right about lucky bastard being a medical honcho maybe even someone george del rios or his two md kids knew and ellie green came to rent the house through personal referral rich doctor wanting a stash pad for his pretty girlfriend i said for partying or waiting out her pregnancy helmholtz never saw her pregnant helmholtz was a fiveyearold not an obstetrician if she moved in before she started babysitting him she could have already delivered rich doctor he said insert married between those two words and youve got one hell of an inconvenience problem is ellie seems to have disappeared like her baby i said lucky bastard making sure to clean up his trail the baby was only found by chance if her body was concealed just as skillfully thered be no official death notice nasty wish i could say it felt wrong he got up paced you know anyone whod remember swedish hospital ill ask around thanks he frowned as usual chapter milos request to find an oldtimer got me shuffling the reminiscence rolodex the first two people i thought of turned out to be dead my third choice was in her late eighties and still training residents at western pediatric medical center salome greiner picked up her own phone hi sal its alex delaware well well she said what favor does alex delaware need who says i need anything you dont write you dont call you dont even email or text or tweet her cackle had the dry confidence of someone whod outlived her enemies and yes i am still alluring but i dont see you asking me on a hot date what do you need i was wondering if you remembered swedish hospital that place she said yes i remember it why its related to a police case youre still doing that she said at times what kind of police case i told her about the bones she said i read about it chirps in the background ahh a page need to run alex do you have time for coffee where and when here and lets say an hour the alleged emergency wont last long just a hysterical intern a man i might add roll that in your sexist cigar sigmund ill be there i said wondering why she didnt just ask me to call back meet me in the doctors dining roomyou still have your badge no on my altar with all the other icons ha said salome you were always quick with a retort thats a sign of aggressiveness no but no doubt you hid it from patients good psychologist that you are western pediatric medical center is three acres of gleaming optimism set in an otherwise shabby section of east hollywood during the hospitals hundred years of existence la money and status migrated relentlessly westward leaving western peds with patients dependent on the ebb and flow of governmental goodwill that keeps the place chronically broke but it doesnt stop some of the smartest most dedicated doctors in the world from joining the staff my time on the cancer ward comprised some of the best years of my life back in those days i rarely left my office doubting id done something worthwhile i should have missed it more than i did the drive ate up fifty minutes parking and hiking to the main building another ten the doctors dining room is in the basement accessible through an unmarked door just beyond the cafeteria steam tables woodpaneled and quiet and staffed by whiteshirted servers it makes a good first impression but the foods not much different from the fare ladled to people without advanced degrees the room was nearly empty and salome was easy to spot tiny nearly swallowed by her white coat back to the wall at a corner table eating cottage cheese and neonred gelatin molded into a daisy a misshapen sludgecolored coffee mug looked like a preschool project or something dreamed up by the hottest big deal grad of the hippest big deal art school salome saw me raised the mug in greeting i got close enough to read crude lettering on the sludge to doctor greatgramma a bluntnailed finger pinged ceramic brilliant no fashioned by number six of generation four she just turned five taught herself to read and is able to add single digits congratulations the geegees are entertaining but you dont get as close as with the grandchildren more like diversion from senility get yourself some coffee and well chat i filled a cup and sat down you look the same alex so do you you lie the same too dipping her head she batted long white lashes id seen a photo from her youth grace kellys undersized sib her eyes were still clear a delicate shade of aqua her hair once dyed ashblond had been left its natural silver the cut hadnt changed jawlength pageboy shiny as a freshly chromed bumper bangs snipped architecturally straight born to a wealthy berlin family she was onequarter jewish which qualified her to enroll in dachau escaping to new york in the thirties she worked as a governess while attending city college night school got into harvard med trained at boston childrens where she did research on whooping cough at thirty she married a chaucer scholar who never made much money but dressed as if he did widowed at fifty she raised five kids whod turned out well down to business she said tell me more about that skeleton i filled in a few more details ach she said a fully formed baby four to six months old intact yes interesting she said in view of the rumors about that place she returned to her cottage cheese it took me a moment to decode her remark it was an abortion mill not exclusively my dear but if you were a girl from a welltodo family whod gotten into a predicament the talk was swedish could be exceptionally discreet the founders were wellmeaning lutheran missionaries seeking to help the poor over the years any religious affiliation was dropped and priorities changed they went forprofit what else one thing they didnt have was a pediatrics department or a conventional maternity ward so i really cant see how a baby would ever come in contact with the place i described the blue box asked if she knew what it was ive never heard of such a thing we wrap our bodies in shrouds then bag them typically mortuaries pick them up thered be no reason to use solid brass containers maybe it was designed for something else and whoever buried the baby improvised hmm she said yes why nothow about storage for tissue samples a precaution when dealing with infectious material back in those days all kinds of nasties were rampanttb polio my old friend pertussis i dont see bronze serving any particular antiseptic purpose but someone couldve had a theory makes sense did you know any of the staff my work was always here not really an answer i said but you know quite a bit about the place she smiled its not only psychologists who know how to listen who did the talking a friend of mine attended there briefly why only briefly she used her fork to section a perfect cube of jello id imagine something drew his attention elsewhere was he bothered by what went on she speared the jello ate drank tea i cant remember what was related to me back in the jurassic era ill bet you can salome then you lose the bet was it the abortions carving and piercing another cube she withdrew the tines slowly red liquid oozed onto her plate i dont need to tell you alex those were different times in any event i cant see any direct link between swedish hospital and a fullterm baby i said eleanor green the fork wavered she put it down whos that a pediatric nurse she lived in the house where the bones were found if you already have a name why all the circumlocution go and track her down she seems to have disappeared nurse on the run she chuckled sounds like a bad movie i said the friend who told you about swedish is gone alex everyone from my wanton youth is gone leaving me the last woman standing thats either my triumph or cause for clinical depression take your pick no peds no obgyn i said besides abortions what brought in the profit my guess would be the same kinds of things that bring it in now proceduresradiology shortterm surgery were the attending physicians from any particular part of town she stared at me i appreciate your persistence darling but youre pressing me for data i simply dont have but if were still in a betting mood id wager against watts or boyle heights she took hold of the fork speared the abandoned jello savored how have things been going for you my dear doing anything interesting other than police work some court work i said custody custody and injury one more question sal did your friend ever mention a doctor who drove a duesenberg she blinked thats a car i said its a very expensive car made in the thirties and forties ive never been much for automobiles alex a fact that greatly distressed my boys when they wanted fancyshmancy wheels and i insisted on nofrills functionality she looked at her watch oops need to get going standing on tiptoes she pecked my cheek hard marched away stiffshouldered stethoscope swinging i called her name but she never broke step chapter milo said abortion mill plenty of those back then i said this one served wealthy families good business model he speared a massive forkful of curried lamb studied the outsized portion as if daring himself engulfed chewed slowly we were at cafe moghul a storefront indian restaurant on santa monica near the station the bespectacled woman who runs the place believes milo is a oneman strategic defense system and treats him like a god in need of gastric tribute today the sacrificial array was crab and chicken and the lamb enough vegetables to fill a truck garden the woman came over smiling as always and refilled our chai her sari was hot pink printed with gold swirls and loops id seen it before more than once over the years ive seen her entire wardrobe but i have no idea what her name is im not sure milo does either more of anything lieutenant fine for the time being he snarfed more lamb to prove it reached for a crab claw when the woman left he said anything else thats it i go with dr greiners logic no reason for a baby to be linked to a place like that same for ellie green seeing as she worked with kids anyone with access to medical equipment coulda gotten hold of that box i said nothing he put the claw down hard enough for it to rattle what when i asked salome if she recalled a doctor who drove a duesenberg she tensed up and terminated the conversation and walked out on me you touched a nerve okay maybe duesieman was the guy who worked at swedish and he was more than a friend and she didnt want to get into details with you was greiner married back then yes happily i thought about that dont know kids five what was her husband like he wrote books about chaucer professor never got his phd howd he earn a living he didnt real alpha male alex so she was the breadwinner so a fellow doc with hot wheels coulda been appealing she doesnt want to dredge all that up so she terminates the teteatete why have a teteatete in the first place i said why not just talk over the phone she bothers you that much he said im not saying salome did anything criminal i do think she knows more than she let on fine i respect your intuition now what do you suggest i do about it i had no answer didnt have to say so because his phone began playing debussy golliwogs cakewalk he slapped it to his ear sturgis oh hi really that was quick okay okay okay yeah makes sense could be if i need to ill try it no nothing else from this end thanks kid clicking off he snatched up the crab claw sucked meat swallowed that was liz wilkinson she dates the bones consistent with the clippings no new evidence of trauma internal or external not a single deformity or irregularity she didnt find any marrow or soft tissue but will ask doj to try to get dna from the bone tissue problem is between budget cuts and backlog this is gonna go straight to the bottom of the pile if i want to speed it up she suggested i ask zeus to descend from olympus only thing thatll motivate him is if the media continue to cover the case and liz just got a call from a times reporter the press contacts her but not you when did you hear me say i wasnt contacted his tongue worked to dislodge food from a molar placing the crab claw on a plate piled with empties he scrolled his phone through a screen of missed calls the number he selected was from yesterday afternoon kelly lemasters this is lieutenant milo sturgis returning your call on the bones dug up in cheviot hills nothing new to report if that changes ill let you know he returned to his food i said so we forget about swedish hospital i dont see it leading anywhere but feel free to pursue you come up with something juicy ill say it was my idea in the first place an innocuous chime sounded in my pocket my phones turn to join the conversation milo said the ringtone era and youre living in a cave i picked up hi doctor louise at your service just took one from a holly ruche she said no emergency but to me she sounded kind of upset so i thought id be careful thanks louise all these years talking to your patients she said you pick things up heres her number i walked to the front of the restaurant made the call holly ruche said that was quick im sorry i didnt mean to bother you no bother whats up is there anything new on the on what happened at my house not yet holly i guess these things take time they do that poor little thing sharp intake of breath that baby i was all about myself didnt even think about it now i cant stop thinking about it not that im ocd or anything its a tough thing to go through holly but im fine she said i really am um would you have time to talk nothing serious just one session to clear things up sure oh she said well thank you i couldnt do it tomorrow or the day after what works for you holly um say in three days four at your convenience i checked my calendar how about three days one pm perfect um could i ask what your fee is three hundred dollars for a fortyfiveminute session she said okay thatll work seeing as its only once wheres your office i work out of my home i told her the address off of beverly glen you must have fantastic views its nice bet it is she said id have loved something like that chapter there are many reasons i became a psychologist some i understand some ill never even be aware of one motive i think i do get is the urge to protect to make up for the abandonment that ruled my childhood its a trait that usually fits the job well earning patient gratitude and delusions of godliness sometimes i get heavyhanded offering armorplate when a thin sweater will do thats why figuring out how much to tell robin about the bad stuff has always been an issue ive learned to include her but im careful about the details on this one i didnt even know how to start robins an only child her mothers a difficult woman emotionally stingy selfcentered competitive with her daughter the loving parent was her dad a master carpenter he taught her what he knew about wood and the joy of craft died when robin was young now she works with power tools doesnt take well to being smothered by testosterone no matter how well intended for all the support i got from my older sister i might as well have been a singleton mom was too up and down moodwise to be of use when dad drank and went hunting for prey i learned to value solitude because alone meant safe inherently a friendly child i learned to be sociable and genuinely empathic but more often than not any group of people makes me feel alienated two people like that and you can see how it would take time to work out relationship i believe robin and i have done a pretty good job weve been together for a long time are faithful without strain love each other madly press each others erotic buttons all that bliss has been ruptured twice by breakups neither of which i understand fully during one separation robin got pregnant by another man the pregnancy and her time with him ended badly ive worked with children my entire adult life but have never been a father robin and i havent talked about that in ages i hope she doesnt spend too much time wondering i drove home thinking about tiny bones a life barely lived a nurse who could be anything between saint and monster i still hadnt figured out what to divulge when i reached the top of the old bridle path that snakes up to our property to look at the house free of trim or artifice high white stucco walls sliced into acute angles where the trees dont shroud youd think emotionally distant people live here the original structure the one i bought for myself as soon as i had a bit of money was tiny rustic all wood and shingle and quirk and creak a psychopath burned it down and when we rebuilt we were looking for change maybe a fortress inside mattefinished oak floors comfortable slouchy furniture and art biased toward pretty rather than politics combine to warm things up the square footage isnt vast but its more than two people and one small dog need and my footsteps echo when i cross the living room and head up the skylit corridor to my office robins truck was parked out front but no sign of her in the house so she was out in her studio working i postponed a bit checking email paying bills scanning news sites and reassuring myself that the world continued to spin with all the logic of a grand mal seizure by the time i poured a mug full of coffee in the kitchen and walked down to the garden where i stopped to feed the koi i was still unresolved about what to say baby bones i told the fish dont even know if it was a boy or a girl they slurped in gratitude i was dawdling by the waters edge when the door to the studio opened blanche our little french bulldog trotted toward me twenty pounds of blond charm and zenserenity the breed tends to be stubborn blanche isnt preferring diplomacy to artillery she nuzzled my pant leg snorted coquettishly i rubbed her head and she purred like a cat shed rolled on her back for a belly tickle when robin emerged fluffing her mass of auburn curls and brushing sawdust from her favorite red overalls mouthing an air kiss as she hurried toward me she arrived smiling planted a real smooch on my lips her breath was sweet with cola the black tshirt under the overalls fragrant with wood dust spanish cypress a material that holds on to its perfume for centuries the featherlight flamenco guitar shed been working on for weeks i kissed her back she said whats the matter who says anything she stepped back studied me honey what was the tell the shoulders she said its always in the shoulders maybe its just a kink taking my hand she guided me toward the house blanche trotted at our side checking me out every few seconds between the two of them i felt like a patient as we reached the door robin said the new case i nodded especially bad maybe she put her arm around my waist when we got in the kitchen i offered her coffee no thanks just water she fetched a bottle from the fridge sat down at the table propped her perfect chin in one hand chocolate eyes were soft yet searching her lips parted the slightly oversized central incisors that had turned me on years ago flashed into view i filled a second mug joined her a baby a babys skeleton she winced that must have been terrible for everyone involved she stroked my fingers i told her everything when i was through she said one of the girls at that hospital changed her mind and had her baby gave it to that nurse to take care of and something went wrong could be wrong doesnt have to mean a crime alex what if the poor little thing died by accident or from a disease and it couldnt be buried legally because officially it didnt exist a new tremolo colored the last three words she said a thing it can they do dna find out the sex theoretically i told her about the cases low priority she said every generation thinks it invented the world no one cares about history are you sorry i told you not at all she stood got behind me kneaded my shoulders you are one block of iron darling oh i said perfect thanks fullservice girlfriend she worked on my muscles some more stepped away unsnapped the overalls let them fall to the kitchen floor the black tshirt and a navy blue thong contrasted with smooth tawny skin she stretched flexed each lovely leg i stood im filthy hon going to shower off after that we can figure out what to do about dinner i was waiting when she emerged from the bathroom armed with a few restaurant suggestions she unpeeled her towel folded it neatly stood there naked holding out a hand she led me to the bed time for you to be a fullservice boyfriend afterward she ran her nails lightly over my cheek bobbled my lips with the side of an index finger the way kids do when theyre goofing i let out a highpitched moan did a fair imitation of a leaky drain when we both stopped laughing she said how are you doing now a lot better high point of my day too how about italian chapter id heard nothing new about the bones for two days when the times ran a followup piece the article was stuck at the bottom of page trumped by water issues and legislative ineptitude a shooting in compton the usual petty corruption by various civic employees the byline was kelly lemasters the reporter milo had belatedly called the coverage boiled down to a spacefilling rehash ending with the pronouncement that a priority request to analyze the bones for dna at the state department of justice lab is lapds best hope for yielding fresh information on a decadesold mystery the newspaper was in milos hand when he rapped on my door at ten am i said pleasant surprise he strode past me into the kitchen flung the fridge door open did the usual bearscrounge and came up with a rubberylooking chicken leg that he gnawed to the bone and a halffull quart of milk that he chugged empty wiping the lactomustache from his nearlyaspale face he thrust the times piece at me compelling and insightful call the pulitzer committee i said pulitzer was a tabloid shlockmeister he shrugged time heals especially with money in the ointment he flung the article onto the table i said so you spoke to lemasters not quite i spoke to his grandiositys office begging for doj grease that was yesterday afternoon next morning voila the chief leaks the chief plays the press like a harmonica which is fine in this case because everythings deadended social security cant turn up records of our eleanor green and i cant find dirt on swedish even the oldest vice guy i know doesnt remember it one way or the other so if they were breaking the law they were doing it discreetly he got up again searched the pantry poured himself a bowl of dry cereal midway to the bottom he said the bones arent why im here i never really thanked you for last year not necessary i beg to differ he flushed if ensuring my continuing survival doesnt deserve gratitude what the hell does alex chalk it up to the friendship thing just because i didnt get all sentimental doesnt mean im not aware of what you did deep breath ive been thinking about it every damn day i said nothing anyway he used his fingers to grasp the last few nuggets of cereal drawing his big frame to its feet a second time he loped to the sink washed the bowl said something i couldnt hear over the water when he turned off the spigot i said didnt catch that the t word amigo gracias merci danke schoen youre welcome okay now that weve got that out of the way howre robin and the pooch she working out back delivering a mandolin ah his jacket pocket puffed as his phone squawked moe reeds pleasant voice tighter and higher than usual said new one boss i could use something fresh moses its fresh all right said reed but im not sure youll like it why not more bones boss same neighborhood another baby a city worker part of a crew planning a drainage ditch at the western edge of cheviot hills park had spotted the scatter of white unruly toss strewn like trash barely concealed by bushes what might pass for dried twigs at a distance was an assortment of tiny skeletal components this baby appeared even smaller than the one unearthed in the ruches backyard the skull was the size of an apple some of the bones were as thin as drinking straws and some of the smallestthe phalanges of the handwere threadlike these remnants were cleanlooking silvery white luminous in the sunlight i thought scrubbed clean maybe polished prepared the orangevested laborer whod found them was a huge muscular guy named george guzman who kept dabbing tears moe reed stood next to him pad in hand his expression said hed been offering continuous sympathy wasnt sure he liked that gig at reeds other side stood liz wilkinson impassive but for soft searching eyes tool cases on the ground next to her white coat draped over one arm ready to have a go at the skeleton but waiting for the coroners investigator to release the victim for further analysis the ci hadnt shown up yet neither had the crime scene techs but liz had gloved up in anticipation she stood right up against moe hips pressed against his hard to say who was supporting who guzman stared at the white bones and sniffled reeds mouth twisted okay thanks sir for what calling us there was a choice said guzman he took another look man reed said you can go now guzman said sure but he lingered reed prompted his exit by pointing at the yellow tape guzman said sure sure took a step stopped ill never forget this we just had one one what sir baby the word came out strangled george junior we waited a long time for him congratulations said milo guzman looked at him reed said this is my boss lieutenant sturgis sir mr guzman is our first arriver he called it in guzman said im always here first since we started the job i mean whats the job said milo making sure water doesnt collect and ruin the roots of all those trees guzman pointed we need to check out the entire area taking samples of whats below then if we need drains we put em in few years ago it was done wrong flooded the archery field its your job to get here before anyone else no no not officially said guzman but thats what happens i make it at seven ten fifteen the other guys not till seven thirty cause i take my wife to work she waitresses at juniors on westwood i drop her off she gives me coffee i drive a couple minutes and im here guzmans eyes drifted back to the bones i thought it was a squirrel or something dead animals we see plenty of that then i got close and he blinked its definitely human everyone turned to liz wilkinson she said unfortunately damn said guzman biting his lip his eyes misted milo said appreciate your help sir have a nice day his prompt was more directive than reeds a nudge to guzmans elbow that got the giant in motion guzman plodded toward the tape ducked under with effort walked several yards and joined another group of orangevests hanging near a yellow city truck the group stayed there listening as guzman regaled them milo said theres one who likes attention you pick up anything about him that fills your nostrils moses kind of a crybaby said reed but nothing overtly creepy run him through anyway already done boss clean good work kid thats why you get the big bucks any anthropological impressions liz wilkinson said by its size this child might be younger than the first the teeth will help me judge but i havent inspected them because the way the skulls positioned the mouth is in the dirt well get you access soon as the ci okays it to reed any word from the crypt held up in traffic best guess is within the hour what about crime scene they shouldve been here already milo turned to liz you were notified by the crypt crew she smiled by moe reed fidgeted milo laughed anything for a date detective reed ill take what i can get liz said i think thats a compliment milo said anything else of a scientific nature dr w these bones look considerably fresher than the first so you could have a fairly recent crime but that could also be the result of cleaning or bleaching from what i can see so far they appear totally defleshed as to how that was done im a bit puzzled the most common methods would be mechanicalscrapingor chemicalcorrosives boilingor a combination of both but all that seems to be lacking here how can you tell she let go of reeds hand walked closer to the bones dont tattle on me to the crypt folk milo but i crouched down and had a good close look she held up a gloved hand then i put these on and touched several of the bones because the freshness intrigued me i was careful not to move anything there was no disruption of the crime scene but i wanted to see how they responded to tactile pressure i also used a magnifying loupe and couldnt find any of the tool marks youd get from scraping or the pitting and cloudiness youd get from a corrosive bath more important the bones felt relatively rigid as firm as an infant skeleton could be and with boiling youd expect them to turn at least a bit rubbery especially the smaller bones those could be as pliable as cooked noodles its possible theres a new chemical able to do the job without leaving traces but i havent heard of it maybe somethingll turn up in the analysis defleshed said milo but no sign of trauma so maybe this one is a lab specimen liz some sick wiseass reads about the first case decides to prank us with a medical souvenir he buys on the internet anythings possible but i dont think so for the same reason as with the first youd expect holes for wires milo went over to the bones squatted a buddha in a bad suit almost like plastic with that shine i said is it possible they were coated with something thats obscuring the tool marks liz said i thought about some kind of lacquering but it would have to be superthin because normal anatomical irregularities are visible milo said call the ci again moses get a fix on eta reed complied half an hour minimum wonderful i said sick joke or murder with the dump being so close to the first bones this reeks of copycat milo inhaled gut heaving two in cheviot hills cant remember the last time we had a murder here liz said the distance to the ruche home is less than a milepoint nine three to be exact milo smiled geographys in your job description reed said she clocked it cause i asked her you did me a favor honey distracted me from thinking about two dead babies ungloving she took out her phone walked a few feet to the side milo said moe soon as the techies and the crypters get here you and i are heading back to the office to run a search on missing infants meanwhile call sean ill be wanting him to canvass the neighborhood moe left a message for binchy liz returned just spoke to one of my old profs hes never seen a specimen without wires and hes not aware of any lacquer thats commonly used but no one knows everything so ill stay on it one bright spot if these are relatively fresh dnas likely speaking of which whats the status with the first set doj hasnt instructed me to send them yet start the paperwork kid reeds phone rang he said hey essman whusup what as he listened his hand tapped the butt of his service gun when he clicked off his face was tight youre not going to believe this they just found another liz said another baby her voice caught all pretense of scientific detachment ripped away like a dangling scab reed said another db adult female gunshot wound right here in the park the southern edge milos face was as animated as a frozen chuck roast he waved a uniform over keep this area tight officer no one but the techies and the ci gets in yessir that mean youre finished here not even close chapter the woman was late twenties to early thirties darkhaired medium height slightly heavy at arms hips and ankles she lay on her right side the front part of her body shaded by shrubbery her dress shortsleeved and kneelength was patterned in a pale green minipaisley with oldfashioned cap sleeves one leg rested atop the other a position that almost resembled peaceful sleep no disruption of clothing no obvious sexual posing but milo pointed out faint pink rings around her wrists that were probably the residuals of being bound a rubbersoled brown loafer encased her right foot its mate lay a couple of feet away to the north her hair was trimmed short enough to expose the nape of her neck the bullet hole was a redblack minicrater at the junction of cranium and spine a single shot fired at close enough range to leave light stippling entering the medulla oblongata and cutting off the respiratory functions marshaled by the lower brain what the papers like to call executionstyle but there are all sorts of ways to execute someone and what this wound and the wrist marks said was a killer in total control leaving nothing to chance the two uniforms guarding the scene said shed been spotted by a jogger her bare foot clean and white amid the greenery had been the attentiongetter no jogger in sight milo didnt comment on that as he explored the edges of the scene even without her foot protruding the woman wouldve been noticed soon enough this part of the park was relatively secluded but could be reached by any number of pathways or a simple walk across rolling lawn followed by a brief pass through a planting of gum trees the jogging trail was a wellworn rut that paralleled the parks southern border where the body lay the trail veered especially close maybe three feet away intending for her to be found a methodical killer eager to show off milo kept looking at the woman i forced myself to do the same her mouth was agape eyes half open filmed like those of a hooked fish left too long on deck crusts of dried blood leaked from her ears nose and mouth that and the size of the bullet hole said a smallcaliber slug had bounced around her brain like a pinball no purse no jewelry no id whatever bare skin was visible was free of tattoos scars distinguishing marks i spotted additional blood speckling dirt leaves a rock no need to point it out milo crouched like a silverback gorilla examining one of the larger splotches he moved to a spot just north of the womans legs and pointed a broken chain of footprints appeared to lead up to the body a second series pointed in the opposite direction large deep impressions for both the same person a heavyweight the tracks revealed none of the corrugations youd see with an athletic shoe or a hiking boot just your smooth heelsole imprint lacking trademark or label or idiosyncrasy both sets of prints vanished as soil gave way to grass tough park turf had sprung back hours ago concealing the killers entrance and exit milo circled a couple more times wrote something down in his pad showed me a pair of depressions in the grass slightly to the left of the corpse shallow indentations as if two weighted bowls had been placed there easy to miss but hard to ignore once you saw them the resilient lawn had tried but failed to mask them completely i said on her knees has to be he said then he shot her and she fell over or was pushed no bruising or dirt on her face he couldve cleaned her off before he arranged her you think she looks posed he didnt put that other shoe on it was dark maybe he didnt notice he crouched took out his flashlight despite ample sun aimed the beam between her teeth victim on her knees check for oral rape i said anything no obvious fluid but i am seeing little white specks on her gums he showed me i said looks like fabric bound and gagged he waved the uniforms over both were young male cleanfeatured with gymrat swaggers one was sandyhaired and freckled the other had a dark buzz cut and suspicious brown eyes you guys check for casings sandy said we did sir nothing milo did his own search took his time but came up emptyhanded careful shooter or a revolver the uniforms had returned to their original positions he waved them back who called it in like we said the jogger said sandy a girl where is she buzz said we got her information and let her go home here you go sir milo took the paper heather goldfeder sandy said she lives just a few blocks away with her parents we talking a minor barely a major sir eighteen last month she was pretty traumatized who made the judgment to let her go the cops looked at each other buzz said sir it was a joint decision shes maybe five two hundred pounds so shes obviously not the offender milo said teeny toon student at smc sir she was really distraught milo said thanks for the psychological profile sir said buzz she told us she runs here three times a week never saw your victim before ever sandy said sir if we did something wrong by letting her go were sorry she was totally emotional we made the judgment that babysitting her would distract our attention away from what needed to be done which was securing the scene sir milo ushered me several yards away everyones a damn therapist so what does a real shrink have to say about this one being connected to the new bones i said two bodies in the park same approximate time he nodded so what do we have mommy and baby if so baby died first days or weeks or months ago maybe mommy got blamed for that by daddy that would be a good place to start on the other hand if daddys so devoted why would he dump his kids bones i thought about that we could be talking about someone with serious psychiatric issuesparanoia an active delusional system that got kicked up by the babys death that could also explain the bones being preserved he elevated them to an object of worshipsome sort of icon it also fits with leaving them in the park on the night he killed the person he deems responsible this is what she did this is what i did to her some nutter defleshing his own kids skeleton whats next he walks into traffic with an ak delusional doesnt have to mean a raving lunatic i said theres nothing disordered about the womans murder so you could be dealing with someone who keeps it under wraps pretty well till he doesnt he phoned reed found out the coroners investigator had arrived done a quick visual authorized liz to take possession of the bones and left the crime scene techs were doing their thing but had turned up nothing so far returning to sandy and buzz he said were heading back to the other scene you stay here how is that one sir said sandy what do you mean the other scene we heard bones over the radio whose someone dead sandy flinched buzz said they have something to do with each other have to be no milo rocked on his heels he spoke between clenched jaws heres what has to be guard this scene as if it was your best set of barbells dont let anyone but the ci and the cs crew within fifty yards of the bodymake that a hundred stand right there dont wander off dont answer any questions of any sort from anyone at any time if youre considering thinking dont do that either buzz stood straighter sir were all about proper procedure milo saved his laughter until we were well away not a pleasant sound quick and harsh as a gunshot liz wilkinson stood just outside the perimeter of the bonedump a team of three crime scene techs had nailed up an inner cordon on stakes was photographing bagging and tagging moe reed stood near enough to observe far enough to avoid getting in their way liz said got some new data for you the front of the face exhibits no breakage or damage of any sort no erupted teeth on either jaw the buds are barely visible im estimating age at around two months and alex you were right about the bones being coated when i got up close i could smell beeswax its got a distinct aroma my father collects antique tea caddies and he uses it to shine them up so maybe were dealing with another type of collector some sort of fetishist milo repeated the enragedfather theory she said a father preserving his own childs bones she looked at me i said you know the drill anythings possible god i hope thats not how it turns out these past few days are already testing my detachment mettle if there were faint tool marks could they be spotted under the wax i think so but ill find out when i get them magnified ill xray every single one maybe well get lucky and internal damage due to disease will show up or a subtle injury the nice thinggod that sounds horribleis that fresh infant skeletal remains have the best chance of yielding genetic material milo said fresh as opposed to the first ones dnas been extracted from eonsold tissue so im guardedly optimistic on those as well that like nervously calm she grinned kind of anyway mommy and baby should be easy enough to verify good said milo i like answers chapter milo and i drove back to his office where he searched missing persons for a match to the dead woman by three pm twentyeight possibilities had surfaced by six each lead had fizzled an initial foray into one of the national data banks proved fruitless but there were other lists so many women unaccounted for my phone rang service operator letting me know that holly ruche had canceled her appointment any reason given no doctor but she did sound kind of tense youd think that would be a bad time to cancel huh i agreed and amended my date book milo was staring at a phonephoto hed taken of the dead woman he said even if her main squeeze doesnt miss her someone will time to go back to the media starting with that reporter he checked the bluebound murder book hed begun on the old bones found what he was looking for kelly lemasters youre my new girlfriend and thats saying a lot he punched numbers barked sturgis call me moments later his office phone rang i said that was quick the old charm kicking in he switched to speaker deputy chief maria thomas said hows it going on the two you picked up today just started maria run the details by me not sounding the least bit curious he gave her basics she said how are you planning to id your adult vic the usual way meaning our pals in the press just left a message for the times reporter what message to call me back when she does said thomas undo it what tell her you were just touching base on the old one dont give her anything on the new ones why would i touch base without new info figure something out whats going on maria you know the answer actually i dont think edict from on high an administrative decision has been made why cant get into that nor can i advise you how long itll be operative on the first bones you couldnt wait to play meet the press in fact you did it without letting me flexibility said thomas is the hallmark of good management what the hell changed nothing changed the cases arent the least bit similar exactly maria the first one was ancient history with these new ones i might actually get a lead by going public or not said thomas whats the risk as i said the cases are structurally different the first bones were perceived as a humaninterest story historical quaint however you want to put it a dead baby is quaint no one likes a dead baby milo but the consensus is that we probably dont have a murdered baby are most likely dealing with natural causes some sort of extreme grief reaction the consensus is also that lacking media input youd never close it but that with media exposure you had a minimal chance obviously that hasnt panned out so much for good press for the department this is about pr have you seen the latest city council budget proposals i avoid smut some of us dont have that luxury and trust me its bad were talking acrosstheboard slashandburn like ive never seen before given that some touchyfeely closure on a poor little baby wouldve been nice that doesnt answer my first question maria why a blackout on the new ones closing real murders is gonna make us look even better whatever she said meanwhile do not talk to the times or anyone else in the media how do i id my adult victim let alone a sack of bones did your adult victim appear homeless or otherwise a lowlife said thomas no and thats exactly why i figured if shes not a throwaway someone will report her missing so i wait you do your job and obey directives whose secret are we keeping maria stop whining some things are better left unsaid not in my business were in the same business are we he said she snickered it didnt take long did it the outrage the selfrighteousness the lonely warrior tilting against windmills whos tilting i just want to listen and listen well because im only going to explain it one more time theres a strong desire among those responsible for the decisions that govern your professional life to avoid getting lurid with this particular case at this particular juncture lurid as in yuckstuff she said as in more baby bones start popping up all over the place because psychotics get stimulated by coverage go ask your shrink friend hell tell you about that kind of thing yuckstuff he said that just happens to take place in a highend neighborhood a dead woman and baby bones in nickerson gardens would be a whole different story discussion over said thomas click milo swiveled and faced me youre an earwitness that actually happened i said your point about which neighborhood got to her may i as i pulled my chair up to his computer he rolled his back to give me room a check of viprealestatenet subheaded cheviot hills pulled it up in nanoseconds last year maxine cleveland a recently retired county supervisor had purchased a thirteen room mediterranean manse on an oversized lot on forrester drive in the leafy upscale district of cheviot hills a onetime public defender long considered hostile to cops cleveland had morphed into a lawandorder stalwart following the chiefs endorsement of her reelection and some wellplaced fundraisers arranged by the chiefs retiredanchorwoman wife cleveland and her laborlawyer husband had only lived in the cheviot house for seven months before putting it up for sale both had accepted jobs in dc she as an assistant attorney general he as chief counsel for the occupational safety and health administration clevelands first assignment would be heading a task force on financial shenanigans in the banking arena and the real estate website wondered if she could be objective given a drop in the value of her investment due to the recession an economic slump brought on in part by wall streets addiction to junk mortgages i said toss in two dbs a short hop away and it wont be much of a brokers carousel idiots he growled okay go home no sense sitting and watching me type i moved out of the way and he bellied up to his keyboard entering his password he logged onto ncic the screen froze he cursed i said what about the joggerheather goldfeder what about her my resident geniuses said she didnt know the victim she didnt know the victim but the way the bones and the body were dumped suggests a bad guy familiar with the park she runs there regularly so its possible shes seen something or someone she doesnt realize is relevant a man casing the area or loitering near the jogging path he loosened his tie yanked it off i was going to get to her once i finished with missing persons his phone rang again kelly lemasters sounding excited about touching base instead of picking up he sat there and listened as lemasters emphasized her interest in the old bones offered an additional cell number and hung up okay he said lets do it do what check out little heather you changed your mind i hate typing he phoned the goldfeder home heathers father picked up milo introduced himself then listened for a while yes i know that had to be difficult mr goldfeder doctor goldfeder sorry yes im sure it was which is one reason im calling you we happen to have an expert psychologist and hes available to offer some crisis he hung up shaking his head i said nogo quite the contrary definite yesgo about time you people considered the human factor thanks for calling me an expert onward chapter i pulled up in front of the goldfeder home at ten the following morning going it alone because milo felt the pure psych angle would work best the twostory spanish colonial was three blocks south of the dead womans dump site two white priuses shared the driveway with an identically hued porsche cayenne suv one of the hybrids bore a santa monica college decal on the rear window that vehicle was duststreaked its interior a jumble of paper empty bottles rumpled clothing the other two were spotless i climbed a geraniumlined walkway to a stout oak door raised a brass lionshead knocker and let it drop gently onto the wood the man who answered wore green surgical sweats baggy in most places but snug around bulky shoulders and lifters arms fifty or so he had thinning dark hair a small face conceding to gravity a gray goatee more stubble than beard dr delaware howard goldfeder the hand he offered was outsized smooth at the palms pink around the cuticles from frequent washing id looked him up last night ent surgeon with a clinical professorship same for his wife arlene department of ophthalmology heathers facebook page had showed her as a pixiefaced cutie nearly overwhelmed by a storm cloud of dark hair the page was thinly utilized with only a smattering of friends favorite activities running more running phys ed major at smc doctor i said howards fine so is alex given the context ill stick with howard and dr delaware what context is that youre here to work im here as heathers dad speaking of which how about we get things straight from the outset are you here to counsel my daughter about finding a corpse or to pry information out of her for the police im asking because i thought it was a little weird for that lieutenant to offer the services of a psychologist out of the clear blue also i did a little checking and youre a serious guy were both faculty crosstown why would someone with your credentials work for the cops do you have some sort of research project going on i said i work with them not for them because i find it satisfying in terms of your main concern which is understandable lieutenant sturgis would love any new information but my focus is going to be on heathers wellbeing hows she doing howard goldfeder studied me okay i guess you have your doubts she can be a highstrung kid cmon in anything else i should know before i talk to her my opinion is she exercises too much the living room was vaultceilinged furnished in overstuffed chenille suede and brassaccented mahogany a ushaped staircase rose to a landing rails risers and newel posts gleamed the furniture looked as if it was rarely used every pillow plumped and dimpled as if styled for a photo shoot persian rugs lay as flat as if theyd been stenciled onto the wideplank floor mullion windows sparkled fireplace tools glinted if dust was present it was hiding in fear howard goldfeder said my wifes working shes an eye surgeon ill go get heather if you need me ill be in my study how long do you figure this will take probably no more than an hour i can handle that i said what did heather tell you about finding the body she was running said goldfeder like she usually does every day rain or shine shes out the door between seven and nine depending on her class schedule does her six miles religiously sometimes she ups it as high as ten a day rigorous thats just morning her afternoon runs another three four that she does at the track at school was she a high school athlete not even close couldnt get her involved in anything extracurricular she started after she graduated his lips pursed obviously youre wondering if shes got an eating disorder and honestly we dont think so she doesnt take in a lot of calories true and shes vegan im always on her to get more iron but shes always been a small eater and we have plenty of meals together so we can tell what shes ingesting in terms of bingeing and bulimia theres absolutely no sign of that her teeth are as perfect as the day her braces came off and i had her pediatrician look at her electrolytes just in case i was missing something and shes in peak condition yes shes on the thin side but shes always been that way just like my wife and my wifes entire family my sides all the fatties which is why i need to watch patting a flat abdomen make yourself comfortable in terms of finding the body goldfeders meaty shoulders drooped that was some drawnout answer to a simple question huh i guess im not too concerned with a onetime thing like the body its the general stuff that concerns me like the fact that shes incredibly compulsive about her running but with everything else she slacks off totally i wont even tell you her gpa its clearly way below what shes capable of thats why shes at smc instead of the u not much for academics never reads never shows any interest inbut shes a good kid never had a boyfriend either never dated ever i guess we should be grateful shes never gotten into any sort of trouble with boys but now that shes in college also she doesnt share much about whats going on with her her feelings her life she used to share everythings lip service now love you daddy love you mommy then shes off by herself but her moods okay she seems happy to me said goldfeder so she likes her privacy i guess but i cant stop wondering if shes holding back shes an only child we put a lot into herthis all probably sounds neurotic maybe it is i dont know i said sounds like parental concern i guess i should stop being a painyoull meet her you be the judge okay back to your question she didnt say much about what happened yesterday just that she was running and saw it she could tell right away it was dead from the color and the blood some flies were already there she said that freaked her out the most the flies the noise they made she felt lightheaded but she didnt faint she kept her wits about her called and stuck around overall id have to say im proud of how she handled it you should be basically shes a great kid ill go get her the girl who preceded him down the stairs seconds later had lopped off most of her hair since posting her facebook shot massive mane giving way to a crew cut her features were delicate and symmetrical huge deep blue eyes connoted wonder she smiled and waved as she bounced down on sticklegs seemed to take flight only to alight with grace i thought tinker bell her father worked to keep up with her when she reached the bottom she kissed his cheek go back to work daddy im fine ive got paperwork to do in the study oh daddy really he looks like a nice man i dont need a chaperone im not trying to be one baby there are bills to be paid so organized she giggled okay go to your study but close the door i intended to sure you did howard goldfeders reply was inaudible as he headed up the hall looking back for a second he shut his door heather said hes protective cause he loves me and sat down perpendicular to me she had on an oversized sleeveless white blouse khaki shorts flat sandals skinny limbs but none of the ropy dehydration of severe anorexia lovely teeth as her father had claimed no evidence of breast development but the shirt would hide a lessthangenerous bust well she said my therapy begins i laughed whats funny she said youre pretty organized yourself oh im not trust me im a total slob your dad tells me youre quite a runner what he means is im a freak my mother thinks so too cause i like to get down at least three hundred miles a month more if i have time impressive they think its nuts like an ocd thing even though they bugged me to do sports in high school even though shes at the gym six times a week and hes there like three four times lifting weights and hurting himself all the time i run cause im good at it first time i tried i could go five miles without even breathing hard i thought it would take time but it was easy felt amazing still does when i run its like im flying nothing else makes me feel that way thats why i switched from spanish to pe i want to be a coach or a personal trainer makes sense so she said what should we talk about whatever youd like would you like me to talk about yesterday if you want what do you want she said being with the police im not here as a police representative then what to make sure youre okay after what happened okay sure im okay it was a great experience seeing a dead person lets do it again tomorrow she looked at the carpet will talking to you help with my dreams youre having nightmares just last night first i saw her face then it kind of blended into a skeleton then i saw babies tons of babies with teensy little faces all looking at me like they needed help then they turned into skeletons it was like a mountain of skeletons babies i said babies turning into skeletons they told me about the skeleton across the park and it probably got stuck in my brain dont you think whos they the two cops that showed up they said thered been another case across the park a baby skeleton maybe it was connected to the woman till then i was holding out pretty good but a baby just thinking about it freaked me out she smiled broadly burst into tears i fetched tissues from a spotless powder room left of the front door waited until shed composed herself wow she said i really thought i was okay guess i wasnt crying doesnt mean youre not okay heather neither does dreaming yesterday was a lot to deal with its weird she said seeing her again its not like i knew her but now i feel i kind of do like finding her made us connected us like her face will be with me forever who was she we dont know yet she looked like a nice person laughing thats a stupid thing to say not at all heather youre searching for answers everyone is she sat there for a while shredding the tissue letting flecks fall to the immaculate rug i saw the hole in her head she was shot right i asked the cops but they wouldnt tell me she was i said howd the topic of the baby come up soon after they finished asking me questions one of them got a call on his doowhat his radio then he hung up and the two of them started discussing something they looked nervous so i asked them whats up they didnt want to tell me but i cried and bugged them because that always works with my parents finally they told me was it her baby we dont know dont you think it was why would both of them get killed the same time in the park nothing ever happens in the park ive been running for months and the worst thing i ever saw was a coyote that was way back when i first started just standing there all bony and hungrylooking i screamed and it ran away spotting the body was a lot tougher the flies she said that was the grossest at first i thought it was one of those dummies in the department storea manikin giggle they should call it a womanikin right she had one bare foot and thats what got my attention real pale almost like plastic then i saw the rest of her then i heard the flies she sighed i guess someone had to find her keeping your wits about you and calling took presence of mind actually my first thought was to book as fast as i could but then i thought what if someones still around and they try to shoot me so i took a second to look around check out the area figure out the best escape route the park was so quiet and that kind of made it even freakier a nice morning the sky was blue and shes just lying there when do the cops think theyll know who she is theres no way to tell heather that sucks so my dreams dont mean im a headcase your brains using sleep to take in what happened and give your mind time to integrate and yes talking about it can help because one way or the other people need to express themselves she finished destroying the tissue deliberately sprinkled the fragments onto the floor is this talk totally secret absolutely no one finds out not the cops not my parents you have total confidentiality what if i want you to say something to someone your choice im in control yes thats interesting she got up spent a long time gathering the shredded tissue found every single speck threw the collection out in the powder room when she returned she remained on her feet her mouth was tight so can i get you something to drink no thanks youre sure im fine okay i guess thats it thanks for talking to me i said your question about confidentiality what about it so far you havent told me anything your parents and the cops dont already know she turned her back on me gave a half turn reversed it rotated a bit more and revealed a tightjawed profile no i havent she said i sat there she said i like girls okay like that katy perry song i kissed one and it was more than cherry chapstick that made me do it now im in love with someone and that gives me good dreams she faced me do you think im weird not in the least they will the cops will cant speak for your parents but the cops wont know or care its no ones business anyway doctor just mine and ame i dont want my parents to know ever i can understand that but thats not realistic is it she said im their kid youre an adult heather what you tell them is your decision ha she said i mean the part about being an adult like im even close legally you are so if my birthday was next month instead of last month id still be a kid and you could tell them it can get complicated i said but id never tell them anyway why not its your personal business but now i am an adult cool giggle i guess that sucks if it means i have to pay for stuff she turned serious touched her cropped hair i cut it all off last month i feel like wearing boy clothes but i dont have the guts think i can get away with boy clothes like in a cute way so theyll think its just a fashion thing keep it subtle enough sure like what dont show up in a business suit and a tie and id forget the pencil mustache she laughed you seem okay but no offense i dont think i need you i already started therapy with someone at student counseling shes a total dykecompared with her im superfemme im glad youve found someone you trust i dont know if i trust her yet but maybe well see so anyway thanks for trying to help me thanks for being open to it honestly she said the only reason i agreed to talk to you was dad and mom were bugging me to do it saying they were finally getting something from their tax dollars i try to do what they ask if its only a small hassle no offense picking your battles that way i can do what i want when its important sounds like a good strategy same one id used throughout my childhood up to the day i turned sixteen and bought an old car and began my escape from missouri she said you think its okay to play them like that youre not playing them youre being selective sometimes i wonder if i should just be honestthis is who i am deal one day you may be able to do that thats kind of scary she said one day it may not be a creak came from up the hall the door to howard goldfeders study opened and he stuck his head out heather said im fine daddy just checking thank you daddy he didnt budge daddy he went back inside but the door remained ajar heather trotted over pushed it shut returned do me a favor dr delaware before you leave tell him i look normal so he doesnt think i need some beverly hills shrink will do i said you dont think i need that right youre the best judge of that are you saying im screwed up but you dont want to piss me off everything youve told me says youre reacting normally the fact that youre already in therapy says you know how to take care of yourself what about my running sounds like you like to run so do i thats it do you eat normally yes do you binge and gag yourself in secret no in general do you think lifes going okay yes i shrugged she said are you like supersupportive to everyone i dont read minds heather so all i can go on is what you tell me and what i observe about you if theres some secret problem youre not telling me about i could be missing something but so far youre not setting off any alarms okay do you like talk directly to the police not about what patients tell me no no thats not what i meant she said im talking about crimes like if someone tells you something and wants you to tell the cops what do you do just get on the phone you bet and then the police come to see that person sometimes i said but the police cant force anyone to talk to them even a suspect like on tv you have the right to remain silent exactly she sat back down okay i have something its probably not important i was going to call them then i said why bother its probably nothing then i wasnt sure if i was doing a wrong thing but since youre here anyway she exhaled its not some big clue or anything but the night before i was near the park pretty close to where i found her but outside the park on the other side of the fence on the street i wouldnt think anything about it but with what happened i mean it was so close if you could walk through the fence youd be right there in seconds her right hand tugged at the fingers of her left i was with someone parked in my car my parents were out late a party in newport beach i figured it would be a good time to then i chickened out of using the house so we went driving and we parked not that we were doing anything we were just talking she colored kissing a little thats it just hanging out it was nice until someone drove by and slowed down then they drove away and came back and slowed down again like they were checking us out we got the frick out of there think we were in danger i think you were smart to be careful i figured i should tell the cops she said but the person with me cant shes got commitments okay this could screw things up i understand she punched the arm of her chair im trying to do the right thing but i also need to do the right thing for her i dont see a problem with that heather you promise she wont get hassled she doesnt need to get involved at all if you know everything she does i do i was in the drivers seat had a better view then i dont see any need for her to be interviewed i need to be interviewed at the most lieutenant sturgis will follow up with a phone call and have you repeat what you just said to me so he can have an official statement thats it you promise i do i dont mind talking its just ameliei care about her so you want me to pass this along to lieutenant sturgis i guess i need you to be sure fine im sure is there anything else you want to say about the car that checked you out not a car an suv thats all i know i dont know brands can you recall any details it wasnt the same as my dads suv his is a porsche this was bigger higher up what about color dark cant tell you a color unusually high like it had been raised hmm she said maybe yes id say so i definitely felt we were being looked down onoh yeah it had shiny rims did you see who was inside no it was dark and honestly we didnt want to know we just got out of there what did the suv do it didnt follow us she said maybe it stayed there i dont know which would be weird when the next morning someone checking out the park i mean you can see right through the fence its not wood its just chain link do you think im making a big deal out of nothing one pass might be someone driving by heather coming back a second times more troublesome whatever the intention you were right to leave oh man city full of freaks i dont know if ill ever step foot in the park again what time did this happen late she said like one am i know cause i called my parents at twelve fortyfive they were just about to leave i figured we had half an hour more but after the suv freaked us out i drove her to her car and went home any chance you saw even part of the suvs license plate uhuh anything else you remember no she said oh one more thing the police guy can call me but use my personal cell not the landline where they pick up i copied down the number howard goldfeder emerged from his office how we doing were doing great daddy he said doctor as if his daughter hadnt spoken i said shes terrific goldfeder said i couldve told you that heather smiled hiding it from him but allowing me a glimpse of her satisfaction chapter milo cursed geniuses they give a witness info then let her leave the scene before i have a chance to talk to her it could work in your favor i said hard to keep secrets with that level of professionalism so maxine clevelands squeeze play may be exposed you ever touch base with that reporter we keep missing each other wink wink meanwhile no ones reported my vic missing maybe she hasnt been gone long enough always the optimist he said the prelim from the coroner just came in shes had good dental care maybe orthodontia her bloods clean no booze drugs or disease and her bodys free of needle marks scars iffy tattoos or any other sign of a rough life dr rosenblatt said she looked like someone who shouldnt have ended up on his table and yeah i know thats politically incorrect but truth is truth right he pounded his hand with his fist someone has to be looking for her he gulped a big chunk out of the egg bagel id just turned down a bag that had once held a dozen mixed leaned against his computer the crumbs of the jalapeno and the onion that hed finished littered his desktop in terms of lemasters its all i can do not to call her and leak but when the air turns brown and the fan gets filthy you know who the brass will be chasing down want me to call her oh yeah that would be subtle so little heather and her girlfriend got spooked by a dark suvnot a porscheno info on the tags no view of the driver that narrows it to half the vehicles on the westside even without more info its interesting no somebody casing the park hell yeah the egg bagel disappeared down his gullet he washed it down with cold coffee from the big detective room we were in his office the tiny space humid from poor ventilation and discouragement id arrived just before noon honoring his earlymorning request for a sitdown hed sounded anxious id been there for a quarter hour still had no idea exactly what he wanted he brushed crumbs into his wastebasket one pass by the suv might not mean much but coming back a second times a bit more ominous but ominous doesnt mean its connected to my murders there are all kinds of nightcrawlers out at that hour and showing himself that openly doesnt fit an offender who picks up his casings leaves nothing serious behind or he used a revolver and got lucky hey he said youre supposed to see the good in everyone yeah thats possible but the overall pictures organized you said so yourself someone like thats planning a shootanddump hes gonna advertise his presence the night before to a coupla jumpy girls true i said dont do that what agree so readily it scares me keep living youll have plenty of opportunity for terror he grinned stretched pushed lank black hair off his mottled forehead sank as low as the chair would allow this guys an exhibitionist right showing off his work look how clever i am having a grand old time he could be bragging i said or his message is something not so obvious specific to his mode of thinking hes crazy not to the point where he cant function but his minds probably a scary place whatever his motive its personal woman and child a family thing yeah i know we talked about that but im having my doubts alex i just cant see a father processing his own kids bones then strewing them like garbage speaking of which liz wilkinson called me just before you got here totally beating herself up apparently theres a technique for cleaning bones that she missed he pulled two sheets of paper out of his printer one contained a pair of splitframe photos on the left half a dozen small glossy hardshelled brown insects to the right a single spiky caterpillartype creature the second sheet was an order blank for highgrade mitefree dermestid beetles from a lab supply company in chicago i said flesheating bugs flesh hair wool carpeting any sort of animal matter wet dry or in between not bone and teeth because the little buggers jaws cant handle anything that hard but anything short of that the adults like to snack but its the larvaethe ones with the whiskersthat are the serious gourmets set em loose and they can munch a bear skull sparkling clean within twentyfour hours inflict no damage on the skeleton which is exactly why taxidermists and museums and scientists use em to spruce up specimens liz called it anthro for dummies said two babies in a row probably clouded her judgment he swung his feet onto the desk does the use of creepycrawlies spark any ideas i said set the beetles then wax and buff its starting to sound ritualistic beetles and beeswax he said maybe i should be looking for a deranged entomologist or one of those guys who like to mount heads over the mantel her id was missing same for jewelry if she was wearing any trophytaking maybe not in the sense of a sexual sadist evoking a memory i said if that was his aim hed have held on to at least some of the bones family or not this ones rooted in intimacy and specific to these victims can purchasers of the beetles be traced if only he said theyre legal and not protected like toxic chemicals so anyone can buy them no way could i get a subpoena that broad you could narrow the search i said how order your two geniuses not to leak the information then sit back as the tips pour in he started with laughter ended with a coughing fit when he recovered he said how do you see the first bones fitting in if at all reading about them could have been the trigger that got our bad guy to dump his bones nearby and shoot and dump the woman the same night what he got a message from god time to take out the garbage or hearing about the first bones jelled things for him i said maybe hed been holding on to them trying to achieve mastery by transforming them that didnt work or it did either way he had no further use for them i still cant get past a father doing that to his own kid we could be dealing with a stepfather or a boyfriend maybe even someone who thought the baby was his until he learned differently and grew enraged infanticides not that rare among primates and that includes us one of the most frequent motives is eliminating another males offspring our offender may have believed that getting rid of the baby would solve his problems hed be able to forgive her move on that didnt happen so he got rid of her too flaunted both victims as a final flourish now im the master of my own destiny and by leaving the bodies in proximity he made sure they were connected this is what she did this is why she died so why not leave her right next to the bones dont know i said guess by placing his kills at opposite ends of the park he couldve been symbolically laying claim to the entire area or im overinterpreting and it was a simple matter of expediency he got distracted or alarmed by someone you guess pretty fast used to get into trouble in school for that thought you were mr straight a that annoyed the teachers even more this time he produced a complete laugh a stepdad yeah i like that but holding on to the bones and fooling with them you see mommy going along with that who says mommy knew she has a baby one day next day its gone what if he forced her to give it up for adoption as a condition of staying together told her hed handle it and took care of business in a horrible way even if she suspected she couldve been too passive or guilty or frightened to do anything about it back when i worked at the hospital i cant tell you how many cases i saw where mothers stood by as stepfathers and boyfriends did terrible things to their children including torture and murder any word on the dna maria thomas emailed an hour ago wanting me to know she got it prioritized like im supposed to feel grateful for her allowing me to do my job looks like under a week for basic analyses but fancy stuff will take longer he took out a cold cigar propped it between his index fingers you ever feel youve had enough of the garbage i send your way nah keeps life interesting does it why the question just wondering he got up opened the office door stood gazing out to the corridor his back to me what about robin shes okay with it all these years first time hed asked robins fine and the pooch perfectly content so are the fish whats going on big guy long silence then what you did for me im not gonna forget it that sounded more like complaint than gratitude i said lets not forget the times you saved my bacon ancient history everything ends up as history then we die that too we both laughed for lack of anything else chapter the new murders had nudged the first set of bones off milos screen but i couldnt let go of the baby in the blue box kept thinking about salome greiners tension when id asked about a duesenbergdriving doctor dmv kept no records of old registrations but a car that rare and collectible couldnt be hard to trace back home i went straight to my office the auburn cord duesenberg club in indiana had a museum an online store and an energetic members forum a woman answered the phone sounding cheerful i told her what i was looking for and she said youre in california la the top duesenberg expert is right near you in huntington beach whos that andrew zeiman hes a master restorer works on all the serious cars heres his shop number appreciate it was a duesie involved in a crime no i said but it might lead to information about a crime too bad i was hoping for something juicy lots of colorful characters owned our babiesal capone father divine hearstbut nowadays its mostly nice people with money and good taste and that can get a little routine good luck a clipped voice said andy zeiman i began explaining he said marcy from acd just called you want to locate an sj for some sort of criminal investigation statement not a question unperturbed i said if thats possible anythings possible date and model weve been told it was a sj blue over blue sj because it had pipes right problem is you can put pipes on anything real sjs are rare arent all duesenbergs everythings relative total duesenberg production is four hundred eightyone sjs are less than ten percent of that most were sold on the east coast until then the trend shifted out here because thats where the money and the flamboyance were hollywood types gable cooper garbo mae west tyrone power et cetera how about we start with the real sjs is there a listing of original owners sure where can i find it with me said zeiman what year does your witness think he saw this supposed sj nineteen fifty give or take twelveyearold car thered be a good chance of repaint so color might not matter also it wasnt uncommon to put new bodies on old chassis like a custommade suit altered to taste if it helps to narrow things down the owner may have been a doctor give me your number something comes up ill let you know seven minutes later he called back you might have gotten lucky ive got a blueblue murphybodied dual cowl phaeton ordered by a walter asherwood in delivered november murphy body with later enhancement by bohman and schwartz both were labased coachbuilders the car started out on the west coast yup walter asherwood held on to it until when he transferred ownership to james asherwood md nothing else in the log fits so its either this one or your person didnt see a real sj where did the asherwoods live cant give you the address because for all i know family members are still living there and we respect privacy can you give me a general vicinity la pasadena you can fish but i wont bite said zeiman youve got a name that should be sufficient fair enough i said can you tell me who owns the car now one of our members did he or she buy it from dr asherwood theres a complete chain of ownership but thats all i can say why do you need the current owner anyway were trying to trace a dead babys mother what the car was seen parked in the driveway of a house where an infant was buried decades ago the bones were just dug up dead baby said zeiman so were talking murder thats not clear i dont get it either its murder or its not i said depends on cause of death hold on he said my wife mentioned something about that shed heard it on the news made her cry okay ill make some calls thanks for all the help most interesting request ive had since two months ago what happened two months ago shifty mideastern type walks into my shop flashing cash wants me to build a frankencar out of retools that he can sell as genuine to a sucker in dubai i said no thanks phoned the huntington beach cops they told me intents no felony until a crime was committed theres nothing they can do that felt wrong to me so i tried the fbi they didnt even return my call at least you do your job so ill help you it took just over an hour to hear back from zeiman by then id made progress on my own a search of duesenberg dual cowl phaeton murphy body had produced three possibilities the first was a barn find up for auction in monterey the oncesleek masterpiece had been the victim of a engine fire during careless storage in greenwich connecticut hobbled by engine rot char scars metastatic rust and a broken axle it was deemed ripe for restoration to show condition and estimated to fetch between six and eight hundred thousand dollars the auction companys catalog presented a history that included a california stint up north under the stewardship of a mrs helen bracken of hillsborough but subsequent owners included neither walter nor james asherwood and the original color still in evidence through the blemishes was claret over scarlet candidate number two a black beauty due to go on the block in amelia island florida had accumulated a slew of awards during a pampered life five owners new york toronto savannah miami fishers island bingo came in the form of a car that had taken first place at the pebble beach concourse delegance ten years ago a gleaming behemoth benefiting from a sixyear frameoff restoration by andrew o zeiman program notes from the award ceremony noted that care had been taken to replicate the cars original ceruleanazure paint job as well as the precise hue of its robins egg blue convertible roof now replaced with modern but periodreminiscent materials the proud owners were mr and mrs f walker monahan beverly hills california a winners circle photo showed them to be midsixtyish immaculately turned out flanked by a burly whitebearded man andrew zeiman was clad as was mr monahan in a straw borsalino a navy blazer pressed khakis conservative school tie i had my eyes on zeimans photograph when the phone rang its andy again lowtech skype you must be one of those fortunate sons maybe we should hit the blackjack tables the case resolves i might just take you up on that the current owners agreed to talk to you theyre good people do they remember the asherwoods talk to them said zeiman chapter researching the person youre trying to influence is a handy tool when peddling gewgaws pushing con games and practicing psychotherapy the same goes for witness interviews before reaching out to the f walker monahans of beverly hills i searched their names on the web mister sat on the board of two banks and missus a woman named grace occupied similar positions at the getty the huntington and the volunteer committee of western pediatric medical center the hospital affiliation made me wonder if shed be the link to dr james asherwood a search of his name pulled up nothing but a twelveyearold times obituary dr james walter asherwood had passed away of natural causes at his home in la canadaflintridge age eightynine that placed him at forty or so during the period ellie green had lived at the house in cheviot hills easily feasible age for a relationship for unwanted fatherhood asherwoods bio was brief trained at stanford as an obstetriciangynecologist hed retired from medicine to pursue the life of a sportsman and financier the times hasnt run social pages in a while and being rich and wellborn no longer entitles you to an obit at first glance nothing in asherwoods life seemed to justify the papers attention but his death was the hook a lifelong bachelor asherwood had long voiced intentions to bequeath his entire estate to charity that promise has been kept the final paragraph listed beneficiaries of asherwoods generosity including several innercity public schools to which asherwood had bequeathed a hangarful of vintage automobiles western peds was listed midway through the roster but unlike the cancer society save the bay and the graduate nursing program at the old school across town the hospital wasnt singled out for special largesse fondness for the nursing school because he remembered one particular rn had obgyn skills meant detour to a career as an illegal abortionist did dropping out of medicine imply guilt a legal concession as part of a plea deal lifelong bachelor didnt mean loveless or childless doctor to financier moving big money around could mean the ability to purchase just about anything including that most precious of commodities silence no sense wondering i called the f walker monahans a beautifully inflected female voice said good evening doctor this is grace andy told us youd be phoning no curiosity about a psychologist asking questions on behalf of the police thanks for speaking with me mrs monahan of course well speak with you as if a failure to cooperate wouldve been unpatriotic when would you care to drop by we can chat over the phone about cars her laugh was soft feline oddly soothing about a car once owned by dr james asherwood ah blue belle she said you do know that weve sold her i didnt oh yes a month ago shell be shipped in a few weeks immediately after pebble beach we were besieged with offers but refused years later were finally ready not without ambivalence but its time to let someone else enjoy her wheres she going to texas a natural gas man a very fine person we know from the show circuit hell pamper her and drive her with respect winwin situation for everyone congratulations well miss her said grace monahan shes quite remarkable ill bet if youd like to pay your respects before she leaves that can be arranged appreciate the offer i said if you dont mind could we talk a bit about dr asherwood what in particular would you like to know anything you can tell me about him and if youre familiar with a woman he knew named eleanor green that would be extremely helpful well she said this is a person were going to discuss and that deserves a more personal setting than the phone dont you think why dont you drop by tomorrow morning say eleven where are you located beverly glen were not far at all heres the address thank you mrs monahan youre quite welcome board seats and ownership of a multimilliondollar show car had led me to expect residence in beverly hills uppermost echelons a manse at the northern edge of the flats or one of the mammoth estates nestled in the hillocks above sunset the address grace monahan gave me was on south rodeo drive a pleasant but lowkey neighborhood well away from the trytoohard glitz and glassyeyed tourism of the twentyfourkarat shopping district the numbers matched a nondescript twostory notquitecolonial apartment building on a block of similar structures shadowed by the white marble monument on wilshire that was saks fifth avenue monahan a a oncewealthy couple whod fallen on hard times the real reason for selling the blue duesenberg i climbed whitepainted concrete steps to a skimpy landing ringed by three units the wooden door to a was open but blocked by a screen door no entry hall meant a clear view into a low dim living room music and the smell of coffee blew through the mesh two people sat on a tufted floral sofa the woman got up and unlatched the screen doctor grace five and a half feet tall in spangled ballet slippers grace monahan wore a peachcolored velvet jumpsuit and serious gold jewelry at all the pressure points her hair was subtly hennaed thick and straight reaching an inch below her shoulder blades her makeup was discreet highlighting clear wide brown eyes the pebble beach photo was a decade old but she hadnt aged visibly nothing to do with artifice smile lines and crowsfeet abounded along with the inevitable loosening of flesh that either softens a face or blurs it depending on selfesteem at seventy the duration and warmth of grace monahans smile said life was just grand in her eighth decade one of those women whod been a knockout from birth and had avoided addiction to youth she took my hand and drew me inside do come in some coffee we get ours from santa fe its flavored with pinon if you havent tried it you must ive had it am happy to repeat the experience you know santa fe been there a couple of times we winter there because we love clean snowhave a seat please anywhere is fine anywhere consisted of a pair of brocade side chairs or the floral sofa where her husband remained planted as he continued watching a financial show on the now muted tv still canted away from me he gave an obligatory wave grace monahan said felix he quarterturned sorry just a second felix a sec sweetie i want to see what buffetts up to now that hes a celebrity you and buffett grace monahan completed the three steps required to transition to a tiny kitchenette she fiddled with a drip percolator i sat there as felix walker monahan attended to stock quotes scrolling along the bottom of the screen above the numbers a talking head ranted mutely about derivatives watching without sound didnt seem to bother felix monahan maybe he was a good lipreader the same tolerance applied to tv reception that turned to snow every few moments the set was a convexscreened rca in a case the size of a mastiffs doghouse topped by rabbit ears the room was warm slightly close filled with wellplaced furniture old not antique three small paintings on the walls two florals and a softfocus portrait of a beautiful roundfaced child great color and composition and the signature was the same if these were real renoirs they could finance another show car the blowhard on the screen pointed to a graph loosened his tie continued to vent felix walker monahan chuckled his wife said what can you get out of it without hearing it think of it as performance art sweetie he switched off swiveled toward me unlike his wife hed changed a lot since pebble beach smaller paler less of a presence scant white hair was combed back from a wrinkledpaper visage that wouldve looked good under a powdered wig or gracing coinage he wore a gray silk shirt black slacks grayblackchecked converse sneakers sans socks the skin of his ankles was dry chafed lightly bruised his hands vibrated with minor palsy he said jimmy asherwood fine man better than fine firstrate did you buy the duesenberg from him he grinned even better he gave it to us to gracie actually she was his favorite niece i lucked out when i met her i knew nothing about cars or much else jimmys collection was quite the education his wife said i was his favorite niece because i was his only niece my father was jack asherwood jimmys older brother jimmy was the doctor dad was the lawyer felix said if jimmy had twenty nieces youd still be his favorite oh my she laughed i already give you everything you want why bother keeping in practice for when you finally say no scant chanceheres coffee let me help you he said dont you dare be getting up oh boy he said starting to feel like a cripple the difference felix is that cripples remain crippled while you can be up and around soon enough if you follow orders hear hear he said to me had surgery five weeks ago you dont want to know the details grace said he certainly doesnt lets just say plumbing issues and leave it at that felix he rotated his arm they cored and bored me like an engine rotorooter wasnt picking up their messages so i had to go to a urologist feelix tmi whats that mean sweetie dont play innocent with me young man the grandkids always say it when youre overdoing ah he said too many issues exactly she brought a silver tray holding three coffees and a box of cookies pepperidge farm milano mints doctor cream blacks fine pouring she sat down next to her husband they lifted their cups but waited until id sipped i said delicious thanks felix said heres to another day aboveground so dramatic said grace but her voice caught i said nice paintings theyre all we have room for i dont like crowding art needs room to breathe she sipped in santa fe we have oodles of wall space but not being there much of the year we dont like to hang anything too serious in sf we patronize the local artists said felix nice level of talent but not much in the way of investment lifes about more than compound interest dear so you keep telling me i said have you lived here long ten years bought the building fifteen years ago said felix followed it up by buying the rest of this side of the block there you go again said grace making like a tycoon just citing facts sweetie working to steady his hand he put his cup down bone china rattled coffee sloshed and spilled his lips moved the same way milos do when he wants to curse grace monahan bit her lip returned to smiling at nothing in particular felix monahan said the original plan was to tear the entire block down and build one big luxury condo but the city proved obdurate so we kept the block as is and went into the landlord business the last thing on our minds was actually moving here we had a fine wallace neff on mountain drive above sunset then our daughter moved to england and we said what do we need thirty rooms for lets downsize the house sold quickly those were the days caught us offguard and we hadnt found a new one this apartment was vacant so we said lets bunk down temporarily grace said we found out we liked the simplicity and here we are tell him the real reason sweetie convenience darling walking distance to shopping for someone whos not me by the way neiman phoned theyre prepared to offer you a daily chauffeur if strolling three blocks proves too strenuous stop being terrible felix to me i buy only for the grandkids were in our postacquisitional stage i said perfect time to sell the car felix said on the contrary perfect time to keep it and all the others one day the entire collection will go to a deserving museum but blue belle is taking her leave because we believe cars are to be driven and shes gotten too valuable for that his eyes softened shes lovely i said dr asherwood was a generous man generous doesnt do him justice said grace uncle jimmy was selfless and i mean that literally nothing for himself everything for others he left every penny to charity and no one was resentful because we respected him hed given us so much during his lifetime i read about the donations in his obituary his obituary doesnt begin to describe it dr delaware well before jimmy passed he was giving away money and things i said i used to work at western pediatric and i noticed the hospital on the list of beneficiaries did he attend there no she said but he cared about the little ones scooting back on the couch she sat up straight why are you curious about him her voice remained pleasant but her stare was piercing know the person you want to influence the real reason shed wanted a facetoface i said did you read about a babys skeleton being dug up in cheviot hills that yes i did tragic what in the world would jimmy have to do with such a thing probably nothing i said the burial date was traced to a period when a woman named eleanor green lived in the house i waited for a reaction grace monahan remained still felixs hand seemed to shake a bit more he said you think this woman was the mother if we could learn more about her we might find out i said unfortunately she seems to be somewhat of a phantomno public records no indication where she went after moving dr asherwoods name came up because his duesenberg was spotted parked in her driveway on more than one occasion grace said eleanor green no doesnt ring a bell she turned to her husband hmm dont believe so his palsy had definitely grown more pronounced her fingers had stiffened she said sorry we cant help you doctor jimmy knew lots of women he was an extremely handsome man she crossed the room to a low bookshelf took out a leather album paged through and handed it to me the man in the scallopedged blackandwhite photo was tall narrow finefeatured with a downy pencil mustache under an upturned nose and pale downslanted eyes he wore a cinchwaisted pinstriped doublebreasted suit blackandwhite wingtips a polkadot handkerchief that threatened to tumble from his breast pocket a soft fedora set slightly askew hed been photographed leaning against the swooping front fender of a lowslung bubbletopped coupe not the duesenberg obviously said felix monahan thats a talbotlago jimmy brought it over from france immediately after the war it was decaying in some nazi bastards lair jimmy rescued it and brought it back to life grace said he was barely out of med school when he enlisted was assigned to an infantry unit as a field surgeon served in the battle of the bulge raided utah beach he was injured on dday earned a purple heart and a host of other medals a hero said felix the real deal grace said now would you like to see blue belle shes downstairs in the garage as smooth a dismissal as any id heard i said shes here why not said felix a garage is a garage is a garage said grace to paraphrase alice b toklas i said id love to see the car but could we talk a bit more about what your uncles medical practice theres nothing to talk about after his wounds healed he delivered babies then he quit i said no she said he retired quitting implies a character flaw jimmy left medicine because his father my grandfather walter was ill and his mother my nana beatrice was terminal someone had to take care of them jimmy had no wife or children quick glances passed between them thats true said grace if you ask me why ill tell you i dont know it was none of my business never met the right woman said felix that would be my guess thats not what hes after darling hes looking for dirt on poor jimmy not at all mrs monahan no she said you work with the police they dig dirtgranted its generally for a good cause youve been involved in over a score of very nasty cases have probably come to see the world as a terrible place but that doesnt apply to jimmy a score serious research on her part i said id like to think i keep a pretty balanced view of the world rosy spots radiated through her makeup forgive me that was rude its just that i adored uncle jimmy andi confess to being a bit of a snoop myself dr delaware after you called i inquired about you at western peds we donate there everyone had good things to say about you thats why were talking she caught her breath if that offends you im sorry girl scout heritage said felix be prepared and all that brownie she corrected but yes i do respect a logical plan as im sure you do dr delaware but trust me jimmy led a quiet noble life and i cant have his name sullied mrs monahan im sorry if i actually felix broke in its doctor monahan no its not she snapped he flinched she said sorry darling sorry and touched his hand he remained still forgive me felix but all this talk about uncle jimmy has made me edgy he said nothing to forgive sweetie to me she doesnt like tooting her own horn but she is a doctor full md trained and qualified womens medicine same as jimmy not to be contentious she said but a doctor is someone who doctors i never practiced got married during my last year of residency had catherine said id go back but i never did there was more than a bit of guilt about that i felt id let everyone down especially jimmy because it was he whod written a personal letter to the dean back then women werent exactly welcomed with open arms after i decided to eschew medicine it was jimmy i talked to he told me to live my life the way i wanted in any event if you need me to tend to your ills youre in trouble now since you probably have no serious interest in seeing blue belle i do dont be polite dr delaware we dont force our enthusiasms on anyone never seen a duesenberg i said id be foolish to pass up the opportunity felix monahan stood with effort ill take him sweetie absolutely not said grace i cant have you im taking him darling felix grace i have yet to convince myself im a fully functional human being but if you could pretend it would be an enormous help you dont need to prove anything but i do he said in a new voice low flat cold i most certainly do he walked toward the door slowly overly deliberate like a drunk coping with a sobriety test grace monahan stood there as if daring him to continue he opened the door and said come doctor she said hold his arm felix monahan turned and glared not necessary sweetheart he left the apartment i followed grace said men i trailed felix monahan down the stairs to the sidewalk sticking close and watching him sway and lurch and intentionally ignore the handrail midway down he tripped and i reached out to steady him he shook me off appreciate the offer but if you do it again i might just acquaint you with my left jab laughing but not kidding i said you boxed boxed did some grecoroman wrestling a bit of judo i get the point smart man when we reached the street he continued south turned the corner at charleville and entered the alley behind his building six garages one for each unit each furnished with a bolt and a combination lock the third garage was secured with an additional key lock keeping me out of view monahan twirled inserted a key stood back slide it up im smart enough to know my limitations the door rose on smooth greased bearings curved inward and upward exposing two hundred square feet of pristine white space filled with something massive and blue and stunning a gleaming vertically barred grille stared me in the face the radiator cap was a sharpedged v aimed for takeoff the car was huge barely fitting into the space most of the length was taken up by a hood fashioned to accommodate a gargantuan engine headlights the size of dinner plates stared at me like the eyes of a giant squid handsculpted winglike fenders merged with polished running boards topped by gleaming metal treadplates a sidemounted spare matched four widewall wirewheeled tires the cars flanks were fluid and arrogant supercharged said felix monahan pointing to a quartet of chrome pipes looping out of a chromeplated grid thick and sinewy and menacing as a swarm of morays were talking zero to sixty in eight seconds in the thirties i whistled he went on she cruises at one oh four in second gear and thats without syncromesh max speed is one forty and back when she was born you were lucky to get fifty horsepower out of a luxury car unbelievable i said not really doctor whats unbelievable is how a country that could create this cant come up with anything better than plastic phones that die in six months put together by peasants living on gruel id come to see the car in the hope that i might pry more info from him but the duesenbergs beauty held me captive the paint a perfect duet of convivial blues was a masterpiece of lacquer the interior was buttersoft handstitched leather whose pale aqua hue matched the spotless top more artisanal metalwork for the sculpted dashboard the rosewoodandsilver steering wheel wouldve looked dandy on a museum pedestal even silent and static the car managed to project an aura of ferocity and mastery the kind of queenly confidence you see in a certain type of woman able to work natural beauty to her advantage without flirting or raising her voice i said thanks for giving me the opportunity felix monahan said you can thank me by dropping the whole notion of jimmy asherwood being some sort of criminal a he isnt and b i dont like anything that upsets my wife no ones out to he stopped me with a palm that woman you mentionedgreeni cant tell you about her because i dont know her and im sure that applies to grace however i did know jimmy and theres zero chance he fathered that baby or had anything to do with its death okay that doesnt sound sincere i when grace inquired about you she was told youre quite the brilliant fellow had a promising academic career that you traded for some reason for immersing yourself in the lowest elements of societyhear me out im not judging you as jimmy told grace everyone should live their own life but now i see you as intruding on graces life and that worries me because of something else your former colleagues said you never let go i kept silent he said close the garage after he locked up he faced me his eyes were slits and the tremor in his hands was mimicked by quivers along his jawline mr monahan im listen carefully young man jimmy didnt father that child or any other he was incapable sterile grace doesnt know but i do because jimmy was like an older brother to me and he could confide in me in a way he couldnt with grace because i was able to keep my emotions in check he and i used to motor together drive out to where he stored his cars pick one on a whim and go hit some great dusty roads one day we were out in his auburn boattail speedster motoring in malibu up in the hills in those days it was brush and scrub the auburn chewed up the asphalt glorious thing jimmy and i took turns behind the wheel we stopped for a smoke and a nipnothing extreme a taste from the hip flask and a couple of fine havanas at a spot where the ocean was visible jimmy seemed more relaxed than id ever seen him then all of a sudden he said felix people think im homosexual dont they because i like art and going to the ballet and have never married what do you say to something like that the truth was he was right jimmy was regarded as what was then called sensitive apart from cars his interests were feminine the paper described him as a sportsman the paper relied on information provided by grace the only sport i ever saw jimmy engage in was a spot of polo in montecito and not much of that now theres nothing wrong with liking die fledermaus but combine that with his never marryingnever showing interest in womenit was a reasonable conclusion but what i said was jimmy thats rot to which he said youre not a fool felix you never wondered i said your business is your own jimmy to which he replied so you believe it too i protested and he laughed that off stood and proceeded to unbuckle his belt and lower his trousers and his shorts his eyes clamped shut terrible sight hed been mangled shrapnel flyoff from a land mine on dday larger pieces and hed have been sheared in two fortunately he survived however the shards that did find their way into his body left hideous scars on his legs and nothing much in the way of manhood poor man when i saw it dr delaware i couldnt help myself i cried like a baby not my style when my mother passed i held myself in check but jimmy like that long sigh he pulled up his trousers and smiled and said so you see felix its not for lack of interest its for lack of equipment then he took a long swallow from the flaskemptied itsaid you drive home monahan placed both hands to his temples jimmy was a mans man and you need to honor that and vow to not repeat this to anyone because if grace ever learned the truth and that i was the one who told you it would destroy her and do irreparable harm to my marriage i promise mr monahan but theres something you need to consider the lieutenant i work with is honorable and discreet but hes also extremely persistent and left to his own devices he may eventually trace the car back to jimmy as i did i have credibility with him and if im allowed to give him some basic details its unlikely youll ever hear from him unlikely he said but you cant guarantee im being honest mr monahan youre a psychologist sir your allegiance should be building people up not tearing them down i agree what would you like to tell this policeman that jimmy was a good man whose war injuries prevented him from fathering a child that most of his life seems to have centered around good deeds not most said felix monahan all a purer soul never walked this earth his eyes swept over my face thorough as a cat scanner i choose to consider you a man of honor i appreciate that show your appreciation by doing the right thing chapter a call to the development office at western peds added focus to dr james asherwoods generosity back in the sixties hed endowed a small fund for the neonatal icu special concern for problem newborns on the part of a man unable to father children a man who worked obgyn at a place where covert abortions were standard operating procedure how that connected to a baby buried under a tree eluded me that night the big blue duesenberg didnt appear in my dream but a creamcolored auburn boattail speedster did no reason to believe jimmy asherwoods had been that color but id pulled up images on the web supplied my own script and scenery in the dream asherwood and a young felix monahan who bore a striking resemblance to me in my twenties roared up a series of dusty sunsplotched canyons that snaked through the santa monica mountains the ride ended with a smoke and a nip from a silver flask at a spot where the ocean grew vast then a return ride that felt more like aerial gliding than motoring when asherwood dropped me at the dingy apartment building on overland that had housed me during starvingstudent days he tipped his fedora and saluted and i did the same and i assured him id never betray him his smile was blinding i trust you alex the following morning milo dropped in at nine oclock robin had left early for a trip to temecula visiting an old italian violinmaker whod finally retired and was parting with maple ebony and ivory i was sitting at the kitchen table reviewing a custody report that had a decent chance of being read because the judge was a decent human being blanche curled at my feet relishing the shallow sleep of dogs snoring gently she sensed milos presence before the door opened was up on her feet waiting for him he said ah the security system patted her head placed his attache case on the table and sat down no fridgescavenge maybe hed eaten a big breakfast time for current events class out of the case came a rolledup newspaper the masthead read the corsair the voice of santa monica college a pair of articles shared the front page a feature on renewed interest in the benefits of high colonics and smc student plays crucial role in westside murder heather goldfeders headshot was accurately elfin the slant was her extreme bravery after coming across a hideously slain homicide corpse as she trained for a marathon in cheviot park what made it worse said the smc freshman was this wasnt the first murder in my neighborhood a little baby skeleton was also found in the park and there was also another baby dug up real close to where i live though i heard that one was real old i said lets hear it for freedom of the press maria know yet she woke me at six was spewing like ive never heard her i told her it hadnt come from me she said she didnt believe me i said feel free to waste time investigating then she started in on how it was my responsibility to muzzle my witness and i said last i heard gag orders came from judges he put the paper away the one whos really got steam coming out of her ears is that times gal lemasters she left a message an hour ago using naughty words and accusing me of allowing this august publication to scoop her probably because i have a kid who goes there he went to the fridge searched a top shelf i said any tips come in nothing serious yet and i dont think there will be unless flower dresss picture goes public still waiting to hear back from maria on that he tried a lower tier whats with you guys no leftovers weve been eating out not even a doggie bag oh yeah thats not a dog its an alien princess who wont touch her foie gras unless its been consecrated by a celebrity chef am i right about that mademoiselle blanche trotted up to him cocked her head to the side grumbling about his back he bent low to rub behind her ears she rolled over and exposed her belly he murmured something about entitlement she purred nice to see my charm transcends gender i said shes a happy girl had lamb chop leftovers last night dont gloat dr de sade he foraged some more returned with a half pint of cottage cheese and a bottle of kc masterpiece original barbecue sauce that he glurped directly into the container concocting a melange that evoked something youd find at a shotgun homicide three tablespoons later got the dna results on everything nothing in the old bones too degraded but plenty in the new bones the babys mommy had some african american heritage so flower dress wasnt her so much for the motherchildbaddaddy theory any suggestions nothing that would make you feel better try me take away the family angle and you could have an offender who murders all kinds of people for motives you wont understand until you catch him a pleasure killer he said gets off on amateur taxidermy i was hoping you wouldnt say that knew you would his eyes dropped to the cottage cheese container he downed another spoonful of clotted red soup first time id seen him grimace after ingesting anything dumping the mixture in the trash he drank water from the tap so whats my plan just wait and hope this nutcase screws up on the next one you could put the park under surveillance you think hed actually go back nothing succeeds like success well he said the best i can do for surveillance is a couple of additional drivebys per shift by sector cars i know cause ive already asked great minds and all that maybe ill do an allnighter god im hungry how long will it take you to defrost a steak or a roast or half a cow his phone chirped ravels bolero he picked up flashed a v thats great sir i apprec the victory sign wilted as he listened for a long time he put the phone down and drank more water at the sink i said his godliness ranting lower the volume it woulda been a rant well sturgis looks like your fucking victim is gonna be a fucking reality star for fifteen fucking minutes so get a decent fucking photo of her fucking dead face because youve got one fucking shot at this and you better fucking be able to do something with it because i just swallowed a whole lot of fucking bullshit from a fucking pieceofshit politician whos got fucking white house connections i said when will the photo run tonight at six if i get my fucking ass in gear he smiled i believe i will tensecond flash at the tail end of the news three hours later milo phoned exuberant her names adriana betts and shes originally from boise a cousin from downey saw it and recognized her called adrianas sister back in idaho the sister called me emailed a photo shes flying down tomorrow i booked interrogation b at the butler avenue hilton did the sister have anything interesting to say about adriana wonderful person not an enemy in the world how could this happen why do bad things happen to good people that got me thinking about jimmy asherwood and i was hit with a strange aching sympathy for a man id never known alex you there pardon i asked if you can make it tomorrow for the sister and you didnt answer three pm yes i said my favorite word chapter no dna was needed to link helene johansons chromosomes to those of adriana betts four years older than adriana helene had a pleasant square face solid build and chestnut hair that made her a neartwin to her sister watching her step into the interview room was unsettling a dead woman come to life the match didnt extend to style adriana had been found wearing a loose dress and budget shoes both tagged by the coroner as walmart made in china helenes preferences ran to designer jeans with rhinestone accents a formfitting black ribbed top under a fringed caramel suede jacket snakeskin cowboy boots her nails were polished rosepink the diamond studs in her ears looked real so did the lady rolex on her left wrist and the gucci bag from which she pulled out a silk laceedged handkerchief haj monogram on one corner she took in the room dried a corner of one eye milo said thanks for getting here so quickly ms johanson im sorry it had to be for such a terrible reason helene johanson said im sure you hear this all the time but i cant believe this is real i hear it often maam but that doesnt make it any less true are you able to talk about adriana im here she said with no conviction i guess its better than watching the bulls get castrated pardon we ranch beef cattle outside of bliss red and black angus for the organic market this is the week some of the boys become lessthanboys the noise and the smell are terrible i always leave but id rather be doing that than this she slapped the handkerchief on the table lieutenant what happened to my sister what we know so far is she was shot in a park during the day at night maam that makes absolutely no sense said helene johanson what would adriana be doing in a park at night did she make a wrong turn into a slum or something actually its a very nice neighborhood a place called cheviot park did adriana ever mention it no she didnt mention la period why would she she lived in san diego really said milo when did she move there around a year ago before that she was a year in portland why would she be in a park in la did she know anyone here not that she ever mentioned what brought her to san diego same thing as portland said johanson a job babysitting not like a teenager doing it parttime a real job working for a family she loved it loved children her face crumpled now shell never have any of her owncan i call my husband sure said milo she took a while to locate her cell in her purse speeddialed spoke to danny and cried when she hung up milo said ms johanson anything you can tell us about adriana will be helpful the kind of person she was who her friends were the kind of person she was is a good person a wonderful person there wasnt a mean cell in adrianas body she was kind and sincere very religious we were brought up methodist but she went for something more intense religion was important to her she taught sunday school preschoolersshe always loved the little ones in terms of her friends her church group even before she switched she always hung with the good kids whod she hang with in california she twisted a diamond stud i guess this is the point where i tell you we werent close and feel crappy about it the entire flight i was thinking of why i didnt pay adriana more attention even if she didnt ask for it i shouldve included her more im sorry i dont know dont know much about her life since she left idaho whyd she leave portland the people she worked for couldnt afford her adriana had grown attached to the little boy but there was no choice did she get her jobs through an employment agency couldnt tell you milo said do you have her address in portland as well if you recall head shake sorry what about a phone number all she gave me was her cell she scrolled her own phone read off the number not committed to memory the sisters hadnt talked often milo said did she tell you anything about her san diego employers they were doctorsmedical professors i said at uc san diego all she told me was one of them did research on cancer adriana was impressed by that but i cant tell you if it was the husband or the wife was she happy with the job adriana was happy about everything she was a happy personoh heres something the little girl was adopted korean or chinese some kind of asian her eyes brightened oh yeah her name was may adriana said she was adorable how long ago did you have that conversation helene johansons eyes wandered too long ago right after she started milo said this may sound like a stupid question maam but did adriana have any enemies no everyone loved adriana and i cant see her falling in with a bad crowd that wasnt her she liked quiet things reading crochetingshed make blankets for her church friends babies what about her personal relationships with men yes she had a boyfriend in high school dwayne hightower his family farmed a big spread near where danny and i run our angus great family everyone thought dwayne and adriana would be married after high school graduation then dwayne got himself killed in a tractor accident and adriana never wanted to date she sniffled all those years doing for others its so unfair im sorry maam when dwayne died its like adriana pulled away drew into herself but then she came out of it and it was the same old adriana cheerful happy helping others resilient i said you bet but no interest in dating it wasnt for lack of guys trying then they stopped i guess they got the message was there anyone in particular who mightve felt rejected one of those crazy stalker things no way would your parents have any additional theyre gone she said cancer both danny thinks it was the radon in the basement and i think he might be right because mom and dad went within nineteen months of each other and there was definitely radon danny had it measured so wed know if our kids could be safe they didnt find a lot but there was some i wanted adriana to sell the house and keep all the money danny and i sell every pound of meat we raise and were also getting good money for bones and skin and renderable fat so i wanted adriana to get the house but she said it belonged to both of us by right she wouldnt take extra what happened to the house after adriana moved to portland we sold it by the time taxes and the mortgage were paid there really wasnt much left i said any reason adriana took jobs outside of boise she told me it was time to travel see what was out there i said why dont you go all the way do something crazy check out europe danny and i love to travel we cruise last year we saw the coast of italy it was amazing she smiled i guess the west coast was adventure enough for adriana she bit her lip now i guess i have to look to identify her that wont be necessary ms johanson no we know who she is oh okay so how does it work do i take her back with me eventually but not quite yet ms johanson shes being autopsied yes maam when will that be finished within a few days then what milo said youll be informed and given a list of local undertakers who can help you through the process theyll take care of everything i guess ill bury her next to mom and dad theres a space two one for each of us i said no other sibs nope just adriana and me ill tell her pastor im sure hell want to do some kind of memorial milo said could we have his name please pastor goleman life tabernacle church of the fields any recommendations for picking an undertaker lieutenant sturgis theyre all good maam six of one half dozen of the other okay i guess ill fly back you tell me when i can have my sister do you need a ride to the airport no i reserved a car and driver for all day whens your flight whenever i want she looked away im leaving from van nuys we own a small planea tiny little jet you cant even stand up in it nothing fancy we use it for business visiting the various cattle auctions and semen dealers and whatnot makes sense said milo efficient thats what danny says though between us i think he just wanted his own plane i thought id be bringing adriana back with me talked to the pilot about there being room in the hold he said there was she swiped at her eyes i guess ill be going home alone chapter adriana bettss cell phone registration traced to an address in portland but her recent billing had gone to a mailboxes galore in a la jolla strip mall milo began the paperwork for subpoenaing the records then tried the mail drop the clerk said let me check here we go betts closed three months ago any idea why we dont ask she leave a forwarding let me check nope just a closedown was she all paid up to the day said the clerk thats pretty cool what is someone being honest i said la jolla makes sense if she was working for two doctors big medical town and a pair of physicians would be less likely to run out of nanny money med schools a big place he said you have any contacts a few in pediatrics but the sister said cancer research so id try oncology first sister didnt know much did she maybe adriana didnt want her to why would a church girl need a pob i said church girl with a secret life she didnt die pretty an outraged activist might call that blaming the victim anyone with homicide experience would call it logic he read off the portland address on the cell registration lets talk to these people first susan van dyne worked as a reference librarian at the multnomah county library main branch bradley van dyne was in human resources at a startup software company both had facebook pages that showed them as bespectacled towheads with an interest in snow sports their only child was a threeyearold named lucas already wearing glasses in one of several posted photos adriana betts could be seen holding the boy on her knee everyone smiling adrianas grin the widest she had on the same dress shed died in lucas grasped her finger with a tiny hand child and nanny appeared in love so far i believed everything adriana had told her sister the van dynes number was listed they gasped in unison when milo told them about the murder my god my god said susan adriana was a gem we so regretted having to let her go why did you bradley said lost my job couldnt afford her anymore when the hr department gets reamed you know the companys terminal and guess what they bellied up ten days after i got my pink slip susan said with bradley staying home it didnt make sense i became mr mom said bradley not my finest hour im finally bringing in a paycheck again poor adriana i cant believe anyone would hurt her was it a random thing cause its not like she traveled the fast lane no partying i said her she made us look like nightlifers and trust me were not susan said she had her evenings to herself but never went out all she wanted to do was read and watch tv and crochet she made three lovely blankets for lucas oh god hed be so sad if he knew milo said did adriana have any friends none that we ever met bradley said she actually told me her best friend was lucas susan said she and lucas really bonded she had great instincts could get down and play at his level he still asks about her letting her go wasnt easy howd she react to that bradley said no drama it was like shed expected it id been bitching for a while about the company having problems susan said to tell you the kind of person she was we offered her an extra months severance she refused to take it said we needed it to tide ourselves over i said thats pretty close to saintly bradley said you could describe her as saintly thats why it doesnt make sense someone killing her susan said maybe not brad what do you mean saints get martyred oh he said yeah i guess so i said any idea whod want to martyr adriana of course not said susan we havent been in touch for over a year do you know who she went to work for of course she said the changs you know them no but adriana gave us their address so we could forward mail theyre doctors better financial bet said bradley milo said did she get much mail for forwarding actually not a single piece even when she lived here it was just junkcoupons she gave to us oh yeah she also got occasional correspondence from her church back in idaho susan said tabernacle something i guess she was a fundamentalist but its not like she was heavyhanded some kind of jesus freak did she find a church in portland she went every sunday she said ten to noon thats the only time she left for any stretch cant tell you where the church was though because we never asked and she never said anything else you think would help us bradley said sue susan said no sorry milo said how about the address in la jolla susan said hold on ill find it seconds later she was reading off the pob milo had just called he gestured obscenely one more question did you find adriana through an agency nope said bradley through an ad we ran in the paper it wasnt as risky as it sounds said susan we ran a background check through a friend he does security for one of the hotels he said she came up absolutely spotless could we have his name silence thats absolutely necessary theres a problem maam well said susan actually hes not a friend hes my brother and im not sure hes allowed to freelance with the hotel account i promise not to get him in trouble ms van dyne just want to find out anything i can about adriana okay michael ramsden heres his number appreciate it and if you think of anything heres mine it really makes no sense said bradley whoever did this has to be mentally ill or something absolutely said susan adriana was so stable lucas adored her i am not going to tell him what happened michael ramsden was caught offguard by the call from milo he said who adriana betts never heard of her hmm said milo so i guess your sister lied hold onlet me switch to another phone moments later are we talking the housekeeper susan said you backgrounded her all i did was the basics nothing anyone couldnt do online so id appreciate your not making a big deal of it doing it on company time coffeebreak time said ramsden my personal laptop my sister was satisfied youre saying someone killed this girl yes whoa said ramsden well there was nothing in her record to suggest that might happen spotless thats what the computer said a scan of the ucsd med school faculty revealed that donald chang md was a fellow in vascular surgery and lilly chang phd worked in oncology as a cell biologist he was in the operating room she answered her extension adriana oh no thats terrible in la yes doctor well she said i suppose that might explain it explain what dr chang her flaking on us she said at least thats what we assumed not at the outset mind you our initial worry was something had happened to her because shed always been so reliable never even went out at night then about three months ago she said she was meeting a friend for dinner and never came back we called the police checked ers were really worried when she didnt answer her phone we figured shed bailed and got pretty irate i have to tell you both of us work all day and now there was no one for may we complained to the agency and they gave us a discount on her replacement what about her car she didnt have one used the bus or walked obviously that would restrict her but as i said she wasnt much for going out until she was said milo well yes said lilly chang im so sorry to hear what happened to her it happened in la thats where she went did she ever talk about la never said lilly chang what agency did you get her from happy tots they were highly apologetic what happened to adrianas personal effects the little she had we boxed and stored its still there because frankly we forgot about it wed like to come down and pick up the boxes sure theyre just sitting in our storage unit there really wasnt much how about we come down today this evening would be okay i guess after seven thirty ive got meetings until six thirty want to put may to bed myself no problem doctor while were there if we could chat a bit more with you and your husband that would be great there really isnt anything to chat about im sure doctor but this is a homicide and we need to be thorough of course but if you want donald itll have to be even laterno earlier than nine probably closer to ten he keeps long hours long would be good said lilly chang more like infinite milo phoned happy tots child care specialists spoke to a woman named irma rodriguez who sounded as if she was wrestling with abdominal pain that one she said she sure fooled us about what maam thinking she was reliable what troubles she gotten herself into death said milo pardon she was murdered oh good lord said rodriguez youre kidding wish i was maam howd adriana come to register with you she phoned us emailed references from her previous employers was lucky the job with the changs came up right then thats a good solid job i was pod at adriana for treating them so shabbily what was adriana like well said rodriguez usually i meet applicants facetoface but with the quality of her references and the perfect background check i figured shed be okay who supplied the references hold on several moments of dead air before she returned only one but it was good mr and mrs van dyne from portland oregon someone killed her huh you just never know i called robin told her id either be home late or spend the night in san diego explained why she said a nanny everything seems to revolve around little ones seems to i said picturing a paperdoll chain of tiny skeletons if you do come home tonight wake me no matter how late youre sure positive i miss your feet in the bed the way you end up in some weird position and im stretching and groping to find you love you thats another way of saying it whoever drives be careful we left the station at five fifteen rather than brave rushhour freeway traffic milo took surface streets to playa del rey where we had dinner at a dockside italian place with c decor and a food he said leave the driving to moi you can have wine mr wingman we both drank coffee and by seven thirty i was feeling keyed up but no clearer on whod want to kill a nearsaintly woman once we got on the south milo turned quiet and i picked up my messages holly ruche had phoned at six apologizing for canceling and wanting another appointment i left her a message saying okay a hundred and ten minutes later we rolled into la jolla chapter donald and lilly chang lived a brief stroll from the ucsd campus in a massive gated complex called regal life la jolla fourstory brownandbeige apartment blocks were surrounded by torrey pines so was most of the beach town where land didnt nudge blue pacific gorgeous place warm night a lot more temperate than portland though i doubted adriana betts had weather on her mind when shed moved searching for the right kind of job caring for other peoples little treasures i knew all about that milo rolled up to the regal life guardhouse no need to flash the badge lilly chang had left his name we parked in a visitors area walked past fountains flagstone roundabouts perfect palms and pines and coral trees precise sections of velvet lawn it took a while to locate the building but we got buzzed through the security door immediately a redheaded exuberantly freckled woman wearing enormous blueframed eyeglasses a black tshirt and baggy green linen pants responded to milos knock her feet were bare the shirt read i may look lazy but on a cellular level im quite busy hi im lilly cmon in donalds showering hell be right with you dr lilly chang was five six and lanky with a loose walk that caused her ginger mop of hair to shudder as she led us into her living room despite the exterior luxe the apartment was small white generically bland a status unrelieved by the obligatory granite kitchen outfitted with the requisite brushedsteel appliances what passed for a juliet balcony offered an oblique view of a brown wall the furniture looked as if it had been rescued from a dorm the sole artwork was a poster featuring a cartoon human brain the legend beneath the drawing read software sometimes you dont have to buy it no need for paintings or prints the walls were pretty much taken up by photos of a beautiful almondeyed baby with blueblack hair in some of the shots may chang had been propped up for a solo pose her reaction to stardom ranged from stunned disbelief to glee in other pictures she sat on lilly changs lap or that of a balding asian man who looked close to forty a white plastic baby monitor breathed static from atop a black plastic end table above the table hung the largest portrait of may giltframed lilly chang said i know were a bit too in love i said shes adorable how old is she twentytwo months shes our joy she fingered the hem of the tshirt one of those smoothfaced women whose age was hard to determine my guess was early thirties please sit she said how was your drive milo said piece of cake my parents live in la i try to see them every five six weeks sometimes it can get pretty hairy she smiled though i guess you guys could use your siren to speed through milo said that would be nice but unfortunately its a big nono figures she said can i get you some coffee or juice no thanks dr chang lillys fine i said where do your parents live sherman oaks i was the original valley girl showing teeth gag me with a spoon fer sure she turned grave so were here to talk about poor adriana im still integrating the news its so dreadful it is said milo may i ask where it happened milo said cheviot park wow she said my family used to go there for fourth of july fireworks it always seemed like a safe place it generally is wow she repeated after we spoke i tried to think if there was anything i could remember that might help you the only thing i came up with and its probably nothing is four five months ago adriana came with us on a trip to see my parents we offered her the day off but she said she didnt need it just in case donald and i wanted to go out to dinner shed be available to babysit i said your parents couldnt babysit of course they could i sensed that adriana wanted to come along so i said sure my mother had cooked dinner so we stayed in when adriana heard that she asked if we minded if she went out to meet a friend for dinner i know i told you over the phone that she didnt have friends but i was thinking of down here and the la thing slipped my mind anyway we said sure go have fun she made a call and soon after someone picked her up and she was gone for a couple of hours now im wondering if her real reason for tagging along was shed planned on a date milo said a man picked her up no idea all i can tell you is it was a red car and the only reason i remember that was the color shined through the lace curtains over the picture window i do remember thinking pretty flashy for adriana maybe shes got a secret boyfriend but then she never went out again and i mean never i said what was her mood when she returned normal she said not upset not ecstatic she was always kind of quiet to tell the truth i wasnt paying attention because i was exhausted and dreading two more hours on the freeway donald had been on call and he was just zonked out and adriana didnt have a license so i was stuck with the driving you did a great job said a voice from the doorway since being photographed with his daughter donald chang had shaved his head and grown a drooping mustache broadshouldered and slimhipped he had taut skin and bright black eyes i revised my age estimate a few years downward we shook hands his skin barely touched mine surgeons caution id anticipated that and was careful not to squeeze milos touch was even lighter a bare graze of fingertips courtesy of all those years living with rick whose name for the policy was dont scratch the stradivarius donald chang sat next to his wife placed a hand on her knee terrible about adriana he said she was a really nice person not the most social person but i dont mean that in a weird way i just never saw her desirous of any prolonged interaction with anyone but may lilly said except for that time in sherman oaks what time when we were with my folks and she went out oh said donald that is true but it never happened again did it she shook her head i said she enjoyed her time with may but wasnt much for adult conversation i wouldnt imply immaturity from that said donald she was a serious person but yes she definitely preferred to be with may and the moment may was asleep shed retire to her room lilly said not to evade housework during the day she managed to clean and straighten up beautifully even though thats not what she was originally hired for the plan was to get a maid twice a week donald said adriana insisted it wasnt necessary the place isnt big she could handle everything we offered to pay her whatever we were going to pay the maid but she refused we didnt want to take advantage of her and insisted she get something extra finally she agreed to an additional hundred dollars a week which was a huge bargain for us so when she considered her day over and went into her room that was fine lilly said right from the getgo she was great with may but we were careful anyway installed hidden baby cams watching the recordings reassured us she couldnt have been more patient or loving or attentive milo said do you have the recordings sorry everything was uploaded to my computer at work and once i was confident adriana was okay i deleted the file and got rid of the system donald said we removed the cameras when adriana was out walking may we didnt want her discovering them thinking we hadnt trusted her though of course we hadnt trust needs to be earned i said and adriana earned it in spades said lilly she was a gem same term susan van dyne had used donald said for someone like that to be murdered is astonishing do you have any idea who did it not yet doctor said milo what else can you tell me about her donald turned to his wife she shook her head i said where did she sleep in the spare bedroom could we see it theres nothing of hers left in there its all the current nannys stuff and shes sleeping in there hows the new nanny working out shes nice said lilly i said but no adriana corinnes pleasant may seems to be attaching to her but adriana had something special a real kid person donald said corinnes also not much for cleaning now we do bring a maid in once a week i said did adriana talk about herself not really said lilly she wasnt rude but she had a way of i guess deflecting would be the right word how so with ambiguous answers then changing the subject oops theres a stain on the counter and shed get busy cleaning i wondered if her personal history was painful maybe a past relationship that had hurt her donald stared at her really yes darling he said i always thought she was just shy what specific evidence of being hurt did you pick up she smiled no evidence at all it was just a feeling i said did you pick up signs of her worrying about anything lilly thought like depression depression anxiety or just plain worry no i couldnt say that she wasnt moody at all just the opposite she was eventempered never raised her voice i just felt she wanted her privacy and i respected that unemotional said milo no i wouldnt say that either her default mood was even is the best word i can come up with going through her day pleasant never complaining once in a whileinfrequentlyid catch her with a remote look on her face like she was remembering something troubling but honestly it was nothing dramatic i said she lost a fiance to a farm accident oh my well that could be it then donald put his arm around lillys shoulder honey youre an emotional detective im impressed a beep sounded on the monitor both changs turned to the machine silence back to sleep said donald crossing his fingers lilly said thats really all i can tell you about adriana would you like to collect her belongings donald said so to speak milo said not much in the way of worldly possessions lets put it this way guys everything fit into two boxes and one of thems small thats not much of a life is it chapter donald chang took us down in the elevator to a parking garage filled with vehicles save for a section cordoned by a mesh gate behind the mesh was a wall lined with storage lockers chang unlocked the gate and one of the lockers and stood back the two in front are adrianas everything else is our stuff milo drew out a cardboard wardrobe and a carton of the same material around two feet square both boxes had been sealed cleanly with packing tape and neatly labeled adriana bettss belongings chang said cant tell you whats in there lilly packed do you want to go upstairs to look at them thanks but well take them back to la forensic procedure and all that makes sense good luck guys milo gave him a card in case you or your wife remember something chang tugged a mustache end i dont want to demean the dead but my opinion is adriana was a bit odder than you just heard from lilly how so dr chang my wife sees the good in everyone puts a gloss on everything the way i perceived adriana she was a total loner no life at all other than caring for may and cleaning like a demon i said except for that one time the red car picked her up yes that would be the exception but outliers dont necessarily say much do they milo said when she got back from the date she looked okay nothing stood out but bear in mind that neither of us was psychoanalyzing adriana our priority was that may stay calm during the drive home another mustache tug i certainly dont want to put adriana down just because she stuck to herself lots of the people i worked with in computer sciences at yale were like that and im not complaining about her work as lilly said adriana was a dream employee great with may but once in a while i wondered about her wondered about what her being too good to be true because ive observed people like thatthe ones who come across totally dedicated to the job singleminded no outside life sometimes theyre fine but other times they end up cracking ive seen it on highpressure wards your saintly types can turn out to be horrid id learned the same lesson working my first job as a psychologist the plastic bubble unit on the western peds cancer ward where i finally figured out the most important question to ask prospective hires what do you do for fun milo said so you were waiting for the shoe to fall huh no im not saying that lieutenant not even close i liked adriana was pleased with the order she brought to our lives im just a curious person he smiled maybe overly analytic i didnt want to say any of this in front of lilly she was totally enamored of adriana hearing about the murder was pretty traumatic for her i know she looked fine to you but two hours ago she was sobbing her heart out its an especially soft heart my wife likes to believe in happy endings i said youre a bit more discriminating maybe im just a distrustful bastard by nature but when adriana flaked on uswhat we thought was flakinglilly was surprised but i wasnt milo said you figured something stressed her out i figured she was like everyone else something better comes up you bail chang smiled again wider but no warmer thats a california thing right we placed the boxes in the back of the unmarked and headed back to la milo swerved into the carpool lane and kept up a steady eightyfive per jutting his head forward as if personally cutting through wind resistance at del mar he said adriana goes on her one and only date with someone in a red car so maybe the suv little heather saw isnt relevant hell whats to say any of its relevant i said something drew adriana to that park something drew her to la amigo id say a better gig but bailing on the changs for extra dough doesnt sound in character a friend in need might have lured her someone with a baby it was mama in a red car not a date mama in a red car who called adriana for help because something scared her if those fears were justified adriana could have lost her life because she got too close to the situation bad daddy majorleague monster daddy who murdered the mother of his child and the child held on to the babys skeleton as a psychopathic trophy that ended when he read about the bones in holly ruches backyard and decided to ditch his collection nearby mom had already been taken care of and adriana suspicious after her friend disappeared followed him unfortunately he spotted her he drove for a while charming scenario too bad ive got nada to back any of it up youve got adrianas personal effects there was anything juicy in those boxes the changsbeing trained observerswouldve noticed and said something thats assuming they snooped everyone snoops alex not busy people okay fine ill burn some incense to the evidence gods pray a hot lead shows up in the boxes i was a less professional detective id pull into the next truck stop and do an impromptu forensic everything goes straight to the lab hell no he said finders keepers but im doing it by the book we got off the freeway at santa monica boulevard at am for all its rep as a party town most of la closes down early and the streets were dark hazy and empty that can stimulate the creepers and the crawlers but milos police radio was calm and back at the station the big detective room was nearly deserted every interview room empty he used the same room where helene johanson had cried dragged in an additional table and created a work space spraying the surfaces with disinfectant he gloved up used a box cutter to slit the wardrobe open emptied the contents clothing more clothing a peer at the bottom evoked a disgusted head shake he examined the garments anyway a couple more bland dresses similar to the one adriana betts had died in two pairs of nononsense jeans seven nondescript blouses cotton undergarments tshirts a pair of sneakers black flats cheap plastic sunglasses no naughty secretlife duds amigo he sniffed the garments no secretlife perfume either adriana you wild and crazy kid shutting his eyes for several moments as if meditating he opened them repacked the clothes sealed the box and filled out a lab tag the smaller box yielded a hairbrush a toothbrush antacid acetaminophen a blue bandanna and more garments two pairs of walking shorts and a wad of white tshirts milo was about to put everything back when he stopped and hefted the shirts too heavy running his hands over each tee he extracted a shirt from the middle of the stack and unfolded inside was a brown leatherette album around six inches square fastened by a brass key clasp looky here dear diary he pressed his palms together prayerfully our father who art in heaven grant me something evidentiary and ill attend mass next sunday for the first time in you know how long the clasp sprang free with a fingertap a pulse in his neck throbbed as he opened the book no diary notations no prose of any sort three cardboard pages held photographs moored by clear plastic bands the first page was of a teenage adriana betts with a boy her age bubbly cursive read dwayne and me happy times dwayne hightower had been a huge kid easily six six three hundred with a sideofbeef upper body and thick short hairless limbs his face was a pink pie under coppery curls his smile wide and open as the prairie he and adriana had posed in front of hay bales barns a brickfaced building and a green john deere tractor with wheels as tall as adriana in each shot hightowers heavy arm rested lightly on adrianas shoulder her head reached his elbow she clung to his biceps their smiles were a match in terms of innocence and wattage the following page began with more of the same but ended with shots from dwayne hightowers funeral adriana in a black dress her hair tied back severely wearing the cheap sunglasses from the wardrobe the final page was all group shots adriana and several other young adults in front of a redbrick church the edifice that had backdropped her and dwayne had they planned to wed there not a single tattoo body pierce or edgy hairdo in sight these pictures couldve dated from the fifties heartland america unaffected by fad or fashion in some of the shots a portly whitehaired man in his sixties wearing a suit and tie stood to the left of the group in most of the pictures adriana though not particularly tall had positioned herself at the back not so in the last three where she posed frontcenter next to the same person young black woman with short straightened hair and a heartshaped face extremely pretty and graceful despite a drab smock that couldve come out of adrianas closet a single chocolate dot in a sea of vanilla the bones in the park had yielded african american maternal dna i didnt need to say anything milo muttered maybe then he pointed to the older man in the suit got to be the pastor whatever his name is reverend goleman i said life tabernacle church of the fields he turned to me you memorize everything just what i think might be important you figured the church might be important why didnt you say so theres might and theres is i said no lead before its time you and that party wine from when we were kidsthe orson welles thing paul masson now youre showing off i reexamined the photos that included the black woman adriana stands nearer to her than she does to anyone else so lets assume a close relationship the pal in the red car what weve heard about adriana says she had a moral compass would never have bailed on the changs without a good reason helping a good friend might qualify if she was murdered because she knew too much why dump the bones near her and risk the association hes a confident guy talk about a poor choice for your babys daddy and that leads me back to the problem i had before child abuse even murder something ragerelated happens all the time but im still having trouble seeing anyone even a psychopath taking the time to clean and wax his own offsprings bones then tossing them like trash i have no trouble seeing anything and that turns some nights hellish i said youre probably right the first step is iding this woman he looked at his watch close to three am too early to rouse reverend goleman in idaho separating the photo album from the cartons he dropped it into an evidence bag we carried both boxes to the big droom where he secured them in a locker returning to his office he wrote an email to the crime lab leaning back in his chair he yawned go home sleep late kiss robin and pet the pooch have a nice breakfast tomorrow morning youre not going home theres a sleeping room near the holding cells i may just bunk out so i can be ready to phone boise in four hours hopefully a devout fellow like the rev will be cooperative speaking of devout i said where will you be attending sunday mass what oh that i said evidentiary not suggestive driving a tough bargain with the almighty he wouldnt respect me otherwise chapter i slipped into bed just after three thirty am careful not to rouse robin she rolled toward me wrapped her arms around my neck murmured morning not enough morning go back to sleep one of her eyes opened anything new ill tell you about it when we wake up were awake now she propped herself up i gave her a rundown she said mothers and babies sighed and slid away from me was breathing evenly within seconds sometimes she talks in her sleep when shes upset this time she remained silent until daybreak i knew because i watched her for a long time an internal prompt woke me at seven am i shouldve been wiped out instead i was hyped eager to know what milo had learned from the right reverend goleman i waited for him to call and when he hadnt by seven thirty i took a robotic run showered shaved brought coffee out to robin in her studio no saw buzz or hammer percussion as i approached maybe shed dozed less soundly than id thought didnt trust herself with sharp things she was sitting on her couch blanche a little blond pillow under her arm studying a beautiful book showcasing a collection of vintage guitars one mans monomania id bought it for her last christmas i said inspiration aesthetics you get any decent sleep sure i lied hear from big guy not yet i held out the mug she said lets go outside and we sat near the pond tossing pellets to the koi and drinking coffee and not saying a thing eleven minutes of uneasy serenity before i heard from big guy for someone who hadnt slept at all milo sounded chipper the bad news reverend goleman is away from the office the good news hes right here in socal attending a convention in fullerton were meeting at my office at noon he give you the name of adrianas friend yes he said but its complicated see you when the suns high wouldnt miss it i arrived a few minutes early encountered milo as he was locking up his office according to goleman the friend is qeesha dembo unfortunately that doesnt match anything in the databases alias she was hiding something maybethis looks like our clergytype a tall rotund man accompanied by a smallish female officer headed our way milo said ill take it from here officer and shook golemans hand golemans suit was plaid deep blue with a pale pink crosshatch his white hair was shorter than in the church photos cropped nearly to the skin at the sides bristly and uncooperative on top heavy build but hardfat no jiggle when he moved one of those thick sturdy men built for hours behind the plow thanks for meeting with me reverend of course said goleman his voice was deep and mellow easylistening at sermon time he reached out to grip my hand his paw was padded and callused just firm enough to be sociable milo led him to the same interview room minus the extra table when goleman sat he overwhelmed the chair he tugged up his trousers revealed highlaced work boots something to drink reverend goleman patted his belly no thanks lieutenant i had breakfast at the hotel including way too much coffee big buffet and i overdid it with the huevos rancheros as usual milo said know what you mean goleman smiled faintly its tough for us big guys with healthy appetites i dont even make resolutions anymore because im wearyand waryof failing my savior he began crossing a leg changed his mind planted his foot back on the linoleum im in despair over adriana she was a wonderful girl not a mean bone in her body i say that as more than her pastor i knew her personally she dated my nephew dwayne golemans lips folded inward you know about dwayne he came up in the course of trying to learn about adriana terrible terrible thing said goleman farmworks always dangerous but when it actually happens i have no doubt dwayne and adriana wouldve married and raised wonderful warmhearted children his voice caught now its adriana were mourning do you have any idea who did this no reverend this is the kind of ordeal that tests ones faith and im not going to tell you i passed with flying colors because when i heard about adriana from her sisterwanting me to conduct the servicei couldnt dredge up an ounce of faith milo said bad stuff can do that reverend oh it can lieutenant but thats the point of faith isnt it believing when everythings rolling along hunkydory is no challenge goleman massaged double chins and now youve implied qeesha might be in trouble i didnt find any record of any qeesha dembo im not surprised said goleman you figured it for an alias qeesha was always quite secretive lieutenant and given her circumstances i cant say i blamed her she came to us two years ago as part of a group of fire survivors a conflagration in new orleans poor desperate people whod survived katrina only to see their homes go up in flames several churches in our city collaborated to take some of them in and we got qeesha she was a lovely girl hardworking when it came to church activities and the fires not all i was referring to as her circumstances not only had she lost her mother and her house she was forced to run from someone whod terrorized her terrorized her how domestic violence said goleman one of those stalking situations this fellowshe only referred to him by his first name clydehad become obsessed with her wouldnt take no for an answer mind you i never heard this from qeesha adriana told me after i voiced my concerns about qeeshas reluctance to talk about her ordeal suggested bottling everything up might not be the best idea perhaps counseling would help adriana explained to me that qeesha was dealing with more than the fire was too overwhelmed to handle counseling i said instead she confided in adriana adriana opened her home to qeesha they grew close very quickly inseparable really it was rare to see one without the other adriana was our best preschool teacher and qeesha served as her aide they were terrific with the little ones then one day qeesha didnt arrive with adriana and adriana told me shed moved to california running from clyde i dont know lieutenant adriana seemed to be surprised herself apparently qeesha had moved out in the middle of the night without explanation same thing adriana had done with the changs how long ago was this qeesha was only with us for a short whileid say a couple of years ago give or take reverend said milo when a homicide occurs we need to ask all sorts of questions you just said adriana and qeesha grew inseparable could there have been more than friendship were they lovers said goleman hmm never considered that there were certainly no signs and we do have gay people in our church there wouldnt be any official stigma though im sure some of our parishioners might look askance but no i never saw that not that im an expert what kind of church is it nondenominational fairly fundamentalist in terms of how we read scripture and yes i do have my personal views on homosexuality but i keep them to myself because our emphasis is on faith prayer careful study of both testaments with an emphasis on textual exegesis and most important good works were a community of doers charity said milo charity implies one person doing a favor for another lieutenant our view is that the giver gets as much out of the gift as the taker im sure that sounds selfrighteous but in practice it works out quite well all of our members tithe and most everyone takes on some kind of good work were not a wealthy tabernacle but we do our best to provide shelter and sustenance to the needy milo nodded back to clyde if we might goleman said the only thing i can tell you other than his first nameand i must say i found it appallingis that hes a police officer from new orleans adriana never specified but i assumed that to be the case she told me that contributed to qeeshas fear clyde was a law officer she felt he could get away with anything was there any indication clyde had located qeesha no sir said goleman may i assume from your questions that you believe shes also been a victim the investigation has just begun so we dont believe anything reverend did qeesha have a vehicle no sheall the new orleans peoplearrived with virtually nothing did adriana drive of course why do you ask because she didnt drive in california really said goleman really well i cant explain that lieutenant what she drove in boise was dwaynes truck his parentsmy sister and brotherinlawinsisted adriana have it but when she left to take the job in portland she insisted on returning it to nancy and tom and left on greyhound truth is my sister never wanted to see the truck again dwaynes high school sticker was still on the rear window and adriana hadnt cleaned out his personal effects from the glove compartment but adriana insisted i said whyd adriana leave boise she never told me said goleman i assumed shed had enough of what grief memories a life that needed changing chapter milo and goleman exchanged cards and goleman extracted a promise from milo to let him know once youve solved it as we watched him barrel away milo said optimism of the righteous we returned to his office where he called delano hardys home number in ladera heights milos initial partner at west la hardy had retired a few months ago the departments logic back then was a pairing of outsiders gay d with black d the partnership had worked well until dels wife pressured him not to spend his days with someone like that that same wife answered martha its milo del around milo how nice her voice was karo syrup hes out gardening howve you been doing great martha well thats good everything just coasting along the usual martha thats really good milo hold on del came on whats the occasion high intrigue in new orleans you garden yeah right im weeding her flower beds bigtime fun said hardy the old country huh hed moved to california as a teen but had grown up in one of the parishes swept away by katrina the division had passed around the hat for some of his relatives i kicked in a couple hundred bucks received a personal call from del im sure he did the same in response to milos thousanddollar donation so what can i help you with big guy milo explained about qeesha dembo and a scary cop named clyde hardy said only connection i might conceivably still have is uncle raynot my real uncle my godfather ray lhermitte did patrol with daddy worked his way up to captain but hes a lot older than us kids milo for all i know hes passed this point ill take anything dh got a number for him hold on ill go find it you want i can prime the pump by calling him first thanks i should be thanking you said hardy for what letting me pretend im half useful this retirement business is like dying on your feet eighteen minutes later a call came in from commander raymond delongpre lhermitte retired in a bass voice that alternated between rasp and molasses lhermitte said tell me why you need this son milo obliged okay said lhermitte you present your case well problem is weve been dealing with some pretty bad corruption issues here hurricane agitated it the waters are still roiling and even though im off the job i have no desire to stir up more me neither sir but youre working a whodunit so to hell with anything else thats true as it should be said lhermitte fact is i shouldnt even care im growing orchids and shooting nutria for sport but i cant break the bonds to the department as well as to my beautiful crazy city never found a better place to live but sometimes it seems weve irritated the almighty gotta be rough said milo so said lhermitte this girl was one of the fire survivors that was a bad one started in a hotel and took down an entire block of old wood buildings what was that name again qeesha dembo sounds africanphony to me son no afraid im not aware of anyone by that name wouldnt expect you to know everyone sir i know a lot of people said lhermitte including clyde bordelon a cop unfortunately son ugly piece of psychology id like to think the regs we got in place now hed never have gotten hired but who knows nothings perfect hes still on the force no hes lying under dirt shot with his own poorly maintained service gun in the backyard of his own poorly maintained house when coupla years ago still an open case any suspects too many suspects son nasty individual that he was what kind of nasty clyde was whats known as an individual of loose morals by that i dont mean transgressions of a sexual nature though if you told me clyde had congress with a herd of cocaineblinded goats i wouldnt gasp in amazement because bottom line the man was amoral rules just didnt apply to him but the sins the department suspected were of a monetary nature payoffs bribes hijacking cigarette and liquor trucks consorting with the criminal element on a variety of projects so you can see what i mean about a plethora of suspects any of them stand out a girl said lhermitte a dancer not a churchgirl but her name wasnt qeesha it was charlene rae chambers by dancer i mean stripper her stage name was coco like the dress designer pretty little thing not one of ours she was a yankee came up from somewhere in new york to work the pole at the deuces wild one of clydes favorite afterhour spots after she started there it became his only afterhour spot obsessed you could say that why was she the prime said milo because she was the last person seen with clyde when he was alive and talk was hed stalked her wouldnt take no for an answer despite her claim of being bothered witnesses have her getting into his car that night and riding away it took a while for our detectives to talk to her so many suspects and all by the time they reached her it was too late for a gsr and she had an alibi clyde took her straight home she showered and slept for eight hours her roommate another dancer verified it not exactly ironclad oh theres a good chance she did it said lhermitte or had someone else do it for her matter of fact id bet on her being responsible two days after she was interviewed she was gone no forwarding id like to send you a picture of qeesha then youd have to do it by what my grandbabies call snail mail got no computer no fax machine only one phone in the house a rotary as old as me made of bakelite tell you what though ill make a call and see if someone still on the job can help you appreciate it sir did charlene actually live in the fire zone dont know if she did or she didnt said lhermitte ill ask about that too thank you sir pleasures all mine by the time a new orleans detective named mark montecino had emailed asking for milos fax number milo had already pulled up two ncic mug shots of charlene rae chambers female black brown and brown five four one oh two a dob that would make her twentyseven her record was unimpressive fiveyearold bust for soliciting prostitution fouryearold bust for battery on a peace officer both filed at a precinct in brooklyn dismissal on the first four days in jail for the second couldnt have been heavyduty battery he said even disheveled and wildeyed with fright charlene chambers had photographed pretty i said she looks scared that she does his fax beeped out slid a solicitation mug shot from new orleans now she was beautiful and more composed than during her previous arrests on the paper mark montecino had written she didnt live near the fire milo ran her through the data banks shed never paid taxes or registered for social security in new york louisiana idaho or california no drivers license no registered vehicle red or otherwise running away he said but not because she was scared of clyde she was worried shed be collared for his murder church folk in idaho were charitable so she took advantage an opportunity came up here in la and she was gone i said i know its a stereotype but new orleans and voodoo arent strangers and waxy bones sounds like something that could be part of a hex lets find out he said turning back to his screen first time in a long time im not feeling hexed chapter websites on new orleans voodoo pulled up nothing about waxed infant skeletons the closest match was a day of the dead offering to the ancestral spirit gede that sometimes included bones milo looked up the date of the rite november first months off i said people improvise some local whack concocted his own private sacrifice making it ups a lot easier and more lucrative than studying theology big guy doityourself religions the socal way another charlie manson wonderful to a devout woman like adriana blackarts worship wouldve been the worst kind of heresy but qeesha could have been attracted to an occult group because it reminded her of her time in new orleans if it started to bother her and she wanted out and told adriana about it im betting adriana wouldve jumped at helping her it was qeesha picking her up in that red car doesnt sound as if unregistered wheels would be a problem for qeesha coupla old friends trying to escape the zombie horde i said what if qeeshas involvement with the horde included getting pregnant with daddy being a loony warlock who ended up killing her and the baby adriana went looking for them paid for her loyalty adriana bailed on the changs three months ago but she got shot a few days ago what happened during the interim alex are we talking about a patient bunch of freaks because theres no evidence she was confined zero signs of abuse on her body and those lig marks were relatively fresh maybe she was careful snooping around without showing herself until she did he rubbed his face a picture just flashed in my head blackrobed ghouls chanting ominously in the moonlight youre getting a little scary dude you dont know know what phds in psych i said the state grants us a license to mindread what am i thinking now youre back in bizarro world with no damn leads oh man he said this case ever closes were definitely playing the stock market his desk phone jangled dr clarice jernigan said new lab result your victim adriana betts was dosed up before she was shot nothing illegal her blood showed high concentrations of diphenhydramine your basic firstgeneration antihistamine what they put in benadryl how much is high doc not a lethal dosage but enough to sedate her profoundly or put her out completely she was knocked out first then shot thats the sequence milo to me it says a calculated offender operating in a highly structured manner seeing as her murder is probably related to that infant skeleton were obviously dealing with someone who operates on a different psychiatric plane have you spoken to delaware recently i said right here clarice hi alex im thinking a sociopath with some looseness of thought around the edges or someone downright deranged who manages to keep his craziness under wraps not necessarily schizophrenic but maybe an isolated paranoid delusion make sense it does clarice im also wondering if weve got a killer who lacks physical strength he uses a downer to incapacitate her sure why not whats your take on the baby beyond cruel sorry i asked after she hung up milo said lack of physical strength as in female ray lhermitte pegs qeesha as a likely murderer what if she acquired a taste for power and became a cult queen no warlock he said a nasty little witch thats turning it a whole new way youre saying she killed adriana whats the motive and why bring adriana back to la to do it couldve been something religious i said uncomfortable truths about the cult adriana was outraged threatened to go to the cops that could explain the diphenhydramine a relatively humane way to eliminate a former friend then why shoot her in the head why not just poison her straight out i had no answer for that he said qeesha as devil spawn we keep jumping around like frogs on a griddle sit around long enough we can probably come up with another hundred scenarios he stood hitched his trousers one way or the other i need to look for ms dembo aka chambers aka godknowswhoelse i said if shes driving unregistered wheels she could wrongly assume thats another layer of security so focus on the car maybe its stolen starting with people who frequent the park and theres restricted parking at night so check for citations yeah i like it its damn close to normal police work moe reed and sean binchy reported nothing fruitful from the canvass of park employees patrons and nearby residents both would reinquire about red cars and dark suvs while milo checked the grand theft auto file i stepped into the hall and phoned holly ruche she said i hope youre not mad at me for canceling im sure you had a good reason iill explain when i come in if youll take me no problem just like that do you have time tomorrow i checked my book eleven am works wow she said youre not that busy huh looking forward to seeing you holly im so sorry that was bratty hows the house going the house remodeling oh she said nothings really happening ill tell you everything tomorrow eleven right right thanks again dr delaware youve been incredibly tolerant i returned to milos office he said no vehicles were ticketed that night these are the theft stats not as bad as i expected he showed me his notes sixteen thousand gtas in the city of la over the past year the threemonth total was three thousand eight hundred fiftyfour of those six hundred thirtythree were red westside red gtas numbered twentyeight ten of those had been recovered milo got on the phone and questioned the detectives assigned to the eighteen open cases seven were suspected insurance scams all from a section of picorobertson with the reporting individuals members of a smalltime ukrainian gang of the remaining eleven cars one was a fourhundredthousanddollar ferrari lifted from the palisades the other a comparably priced lamborghini taken in holmby hills both deemed improbable choices for the car lilly chang had seen because of their conspicuousness and the engine noise theyd generate the d handling the exotics was a woman named loretta thayer she said if your witness didnt hear a roar that set off the richter scale it wasnt one of those same for a red porsche turbo i just picked up thats not in the files yet milo said spate of red hotwheel heists interesting no said thayer my hunch is theyre going to the same collector overseas probably asia or the mideast toys for some oil sheiks twelveyearold to roll around the desert in at that age said thayer i was happy to have roller skates milo emailed photos of charlene chambersqeesha dembo to thayer and two other detectives asked them to show the images to their victims thayer called back an hour later sorry no recognition that was fast protect and serve lieutenant it helps being on the westside everyones got a computer or an iphone i reached them electronically no calls back from the other ds for the next half hour milo worked on some overdue files and i read abstracts of psych articles on his computer he looked at his watch more i think about it more of a waste of time the car angle seems it could be unregistered but not stolen or lilly chang remembers wrong and it wasnt even redhell maybe it was a scooter or an rv or a horse and buggy i said power of positive thinking wanna hear positive time for lunch the usual no im craving vegan just kidding we drove to a steak house a mile west of the station sawed through a couple of tbones and drove back to his office where he picked up replies from the remaining auto theft detectives none of their victims recognized qeesha but a d ii named doug groot said its possible one of my victims lied why do you think that the usual tells said groot looking everywhere but at me too quick on the draw like hed rehearsed it also he just gave me a feeling from the beginning the car was a nice one bmw series all tricked out only a couple of years old low mileage but he didnt seem that bugged about having it boosted made the right speech but no emotionagain like hed rehearsed insurance thing said milo he filed with his carrier the day after i interviewed him when did it happen nineteen months ago what were the circumstances taken from his driveway sometime during the night said groot its not impossible his buildings got an open carport but supposedly hed left it locked with the security system set and i talked to the neighbors and no one heard any alarm go off he seemed so hinky i actually ran a check on him but he had no obvious ties to any scammers no record of anything whats this solid citizens name melvin jaron wedd like getting married but two ds this guy really twanged your antenna huh you know what its like el tee sometimes you get a feeling unfortunately none of mine led anywhere the cars never shown up loretta said nice red wheels might be going to the mideast twoyearold bimmers nice said groot but probably not nice enough for that mexico or central america maybe for all i know its being used to ferry around zeta hit men what line of work is wedd in something showbizzy can i ask what your curiosity is about the car and this chambers woman she might be a really bad girl said milo or a victim or neither and im spinning my wire wheels groot chuckled the job as usual you want to follow up with wedd might as well heres his info milo copied thanked groot clicked off seconds later hed pulled melvin jaron wedds drivers license male white thirtyseven six two one ninety brown brown needs corrective lenses wedds photo showed him with a pink squarish face smallish eyes thin lips a dark spiky haircut hed posed in a black vnecked tshirt blackframed glasses gave him the hipstergeek look of any other westside guy working a mac at a starbucks table doesnt look like a warlock said milo i said more like clark kent at leisure he ran wedd through the banks just in case something had popped up since groots search no criminal record a scatter of parking tickets the most recent thirty months ago all paid in a timely fashion then he switched to the dmv files and said well looky here wedds new registered vehicle was a black ford explorer purchased brandnew three weeks after the theft of the red bmw be interesting if he jacked it way up and stuck on fancy rims he shifted to the web called up an image of an explorer enhanced that way sent the picture to heather goldfeder and asked if it resembled the suv shed seen seconds later cud b cant say sure how r u he sent back a happy face emoticon her instant response me xoxoxo the landline and cell phone groot had given for wedd were unresponsive to milos calls no message machine on either he said a fellow who likes his privacy lets invade it the address was an apartment west of barrington and just north of wilshire officially brentwood but not what you thought of when someone said brentwood quarterhour drive from the station under the worst circumstances circumstances were favorable ie milos leaden foot we made it in eight chapter back in the fifties someone thought it was a nifty idea to erect a twostory box with the top floor cantilevered over a concrete carport the entire structure slathered with pimply aqua stucco the squat expressionless face embellished by a fivefoot starburst spraypainted gold and the proclamation dawnlite apts in that same gaudy tint several decades later someone thought restoring the dingbat to its original glory was historical preservation as we pulled up to melvin jaron wedds building a whitegarbed painter was regilding the star his compadre patching thin spots of aqua milo said misdemeanor maybe a felony i said you dont like midcentury depends on the century didnt know you were into architecture big guy rick is i imbibe through osmosis we got out and inspected the carport from which the bmw had been lifted six stalls one occupied by a dusty brown acura no tenant names not even a unit number the mailbox at the foot of the grubby stairs that led up to the second story listed j wedd as residing in each apartment was accessed through an open landing number was groundfloor rear cheap vertical blinds blocked the single window a dead plant in a terracottacolored vinyl pot squatted near the door so did several piles of junk mail milo pushed a button the resulting buzzer sounded like flatulence no answer he tried again rapped hard with detectivecallused knuckles the door to the adjoining unit opened and a dreadlocked head emerged bleachedblond with dark roots matted strands trailed to a blackshirted shoulder the face below the hair was bronze seamed craggy hazed by three days of dark stubble sagging eyes were wary a bass voice said police right and the eyes turned friendly milo said yes sir my brothers a cop six feet of sundamaged sinew stepped out onto the landing the black shirt was a bodyconscious tee that said think its not illegal yet below that baggy shorts printed with leaping dolphins ended at knees enlarged by random bumps bare feet sported ragged nails and more protrusions calcium deposits your basic surfer knots he looked around thirtyfive accounting for sun damage a thumb hooked toward melvin jaron wedds door he do something were here to talk to him he hasnt been here for days any idea where hes gone hes gone all the time obviously hes got somewhere else to crash whens the last time you saw him mister robert sommers cornrow grinned crookedly as if his name provided unceasing amusement the last time was a couple of weeks ago im not good with time except for the tide tables chasing waves said milo whenever i can said sommers follow the big ones sommers grinned not to peahi or anything like that im only laird hamilton in my dreams my folks have a place in malibu sometimes i bunk down with them wider grin dump some laundry too mom claims she still misses me nice to have that kind of freedom im a web designer so im flexible we heard wedd does something in show business sommers huffed that could mean hes part of a catering crew how long have you been living next to him ive been here around three years he moved in later maybe two two and a half i dont have problems with him he keeps to himself not your friendly type though hell never be the first to say hi and when he answers its like hes being forced to do it guess that makes him your basic loner my brother says that can be a danger sign but i cant say anything weird goes on here milo said your brother a detective malibu sheriff rides a cruiser up and down pch one time he stopped me made like he was going to ticket me revenge for all those times i kicked his ass milo said you got a warning instead sommers flexed a muscle and laughed more like i warned him do you recall when mr wedds car was stolen so thats what youre here about what you recovered it not yet oh said sommers that little bimmer was sweet i wouldnt replace it with a monstromobile the explorer explorer all ghettoed up with crazy wheels black paint job black windows what kind of crazy wheels said milo big said sommers drawing a wide circle with his hands chromed reversed had to be serious cash and the whole things jacked up maybe hes got hydraulics to lowride it never seen him do it but people get crazy with their cars big wheels jacked and black i said pretty macho my exgirlfriend says youre secure in your masculinity you dont need to pimp your wheels sommers laughed but maybe she was just making me feel good about my turdmobile brown acura thats a nice way to put it said sommers used to be my parents cleaning ladys she got a new one i glommed el crappo you guys suspect clark of a ripoff like an insurance scam clark he looks just like clark kent plus dudes attitude is kind of i guess youd say selfrighteous i said takes himself seriously jump in the phone booth and save metropolis said sommers who does he hang out with no bros but lots of girls mostly i hear them rather than see them thin walls sommers laughed not that at least that would be entertaining more like they talk wake me up like its the morning and im hearing chick voices i keep flexible hours because i have clients in asia try to catch zs whenever i can when hes here its like chick central and chicks talk milo clucked sympathetically as he drew out a photo of charleneqeesha any hint the image was a mug shot had been removed still she didnt look happy to be posing robert ever see this girl with wedd not for a while but you have seen her sure said sommers i remember her because she was the only black chick also she was pregnant like out to here im like whoa clark thinks hes a superhero but he forgot the condom i kinda felt sorry for her because she was in and out a lotmore than the others and hes playing around with other chicks when shes not here whens the last time you saw her hmm maybe a half year ago it was a while you ever see any conflict between them sommers said you know one time guess it was the last time i heard the door slam and i looked out the blinds and saw her leaving shes walking real fast but he didnt go after her and i didnt hear them hassling so i dont know is that conflictis that like from a mug shot milo said it is robert shes a criminal type her and clark are doing car scams together she was here more than the others definitely most of the chicks you saw them once twice sommers twirled a dread the black chick i saw maybe six times seven times i said hes into onenight stands guess so he snorted playah clark milo showed him a picture of adriana betts her i never saw she part of the scam gang looks kinda shady his hand gathered up several clumps of hair more i think about it more im pretty sure she was pissed at himthe black chick walking fast like she couldnt wait to get away from him maybe it was hormones you know baby hormones that happened to my girlfriend when she was with child the bigger she got the grumpier she turned kind of hellish you have a kid nope she terminated her decision shed rather go to law school sommers shrugged i thought it might be cool being a daddy but she had to do what she had to do chapter milo gave his card to sommers asked him to call if wedd showed up sommer said sure but like i said hes not here too much we tried the remaining four apartments in wedds building no answers at the first three units a woman came to the fourth door towing an iv line on wheels something clear and viscous dripped into her veins her hair was a gray tangle one shade darker than her face sorry she paused for breath i never leave dont know anyone he lives downstairs in three said milo had his car stolen a while back oh that her jaws worked she couldve been any age from fifty to eighty people were surprised whys that maam she inhaled twice braced herself in the doorway at nights the lights are superbright anyone trying to break into a car would be conspicuous yes funny she labored to smile succeeded and hinted at the beautiful woman shed once been it happens we returned to the unmarked milo put the key in the ignition but didnt start up groots instincts were good the bimmers a likely scam and clark kents shaping up like a bad boy with a second pad think hes the daddy i said hes got women coming in and out constantly but qeeshas the only one seen more than once or twice that says beyond casual and the last time sommers saw her she was conspicuously pregnant and looked angry maybe because wedd wanted her to terminate if she was pressing wedd for money it couldve motivated the car scam he finds her wheels gets her temporarily out of his hair uses the insurance money for his own new drive a pimpedup suv just like heather saw at the park that night at the park cause hes doing advance work taking care of business qeesha hassled him he killed her and the baby ditto adriana because she knew too much clarks sounding like a real bad boy he frowned with no criminal record the timing works i said qeesha left idaho a couple of years ago plenty of time to hook up with wedd get pregnant what i find interesting is adriana didnt follow her to la but she did leave home right around the same time reverend goleman suggested she needed a life change meeting qeesha seeing her independence mightve inspired adriana shed run the day care at the church she found childcare work with the van dynes then the changs san diegos close to la so its not illogical she and qeesha would reconnect maybe that post office box of hers was her own bit of naughty intrigue allowing the two of them to correspond in secrecy allowing her vicarious entry to qeeshas world without actually participating but four five months ago that changed when qeesha called for help and adriana went down to la with the changsa break of her usual routine thats the same time sommers saw qeesha pregnant and unhappy what if qeesha sensed she was in dangershed seen something frightening in wedds attitudeand wanted support or a witness he looked over at the building the painters had paused were sitting at the curb eating burritos those bugs wax if wedds our guy hes something other than human head shake all those women hes got some kind of charisma going women who arent seen more than once or twice he stared at me oh no dont get imaginative too early in the day he started the car but kept it in park his left hand gripped the steering wheel the fingers of his right hand clawed his knee he rubbed his face i said sorry no no now its my heads going in bad directions what if the baby wasnt unwanted alex what if it was wanted in a bad way literally for some kind of nutcult ritual his normal pallor had leached to an unhealthy offwhite i felt my own skin go cold he said dear god in heaven what if that poor little thing was farmed chapter a woman stood near the entrance to the division parking lot tall lanky longlegged with frizzy yellow hair wearing a maroon pantsuit with shoulder pads a couple of decades too big she consulted a piece of paper as she checked out entering vehicles a badge was clipped to her lapel i said department bean counter milo said your tax dollars at work he rolled up behind a blackandwhite and a blue corvette that was someones civilian ride both cars passed the frizzyhaired womans scrutiny when milo pulled up to the keypad she looked at him waved the paper lieutenant sturgis she approached the drivers side milo said another survey not today began rolling the window up dont do that her protest was more screech than bellow her pantsuit was the color of pickled beets some fabric that had never known soil or harvest she wore glasses framed in pale blue plastic rouge that was too bright lipstick that wasnt bright enough had one of those rawboned bodies that abhor body fat nothing masculine about her but nothing feminine either she pressed a hand on the halfrolled window picture on her badge i was too far to read the small print she showed milo the paper in her hand on it was a fullpage color photo of him he said never seen the guy cmon lieutenant he rolled down the window what can i do for you you could stop avoiding me she unclipped the badge showed it to him kelly lemasters la times milo didnt oblige her with a response she said thats the way its going to be fine ill grovel for every crumb even though i shouldnt have to cause im with the paper of record and ive been calling you all week on those skeletons and youve been shining me on like im your exwife filing for more spousal support she smiled or in your case exhusband milo said a comedian anything that works said kelly lemasters her tone said she was used to rejection but not inured to it a car pulled up behind us large black man at the wheel of a brandnew chevy unmarked dark suit white shirt red tie scowl of impatience hornbeep milo said thats a captain behind me so im going to pull into the lot it has nothing to do with avoiding you you couldnt avoid me if you wanted to ill be right here when you come walking out true to her word she hadnt budged a foot looking at me she said this is the psychologist he advise you to shine me on no ones shining you on sorry if it came across that way maam bam thank you not she said what youre allergic to cooperation she looked me over toptobottom good angle grizzled homicide cop and dashing shrink blue eyes shifted back to milo delete grizzled insert rumpled he reached for his tie lying crookedly across his paunch the reflexive move cracked up kelly lemasters she slapped her knee with glee long time since id seen anyone do that not since my last drive through the ozarks milo said glad to be amusing kelly lemasters said see youre human have your vanities like everyone else so why in the world would you refuse to cooperate with me i could make you famous at least temporaryfamous and thats pretty cool no thanks but no thanks playing hard to get why run from stardom milo sturgis in addition to being a sexualpreference pioneer for which youve never received just credit youre darn good at what you do according to my sources over the past twenty years youve closed proportionately more murders than any other detective and yet no one really knows about the totality of your accomplishments because you refuse to maintain any sort of media presence sure you pop up from time to time giving pithy little quotes but more often than not you let some bosstype get the credit for your work aw shucks fine youre the gay jimmy stewart but why shut me out on these baby cases what is it my breath she leaned close exhaled noisily see minty fresh i was favored with a second blast of herbal aroma back me up on that doctor milo and i laughed see she said im a funny girl reward me milo sturgis its complicated so what isnt her hand shot out a whitegold wedding band circled one of ten bony fingers her nails were short unpolished but for the ring she wore no jewelry milo said now we shake we sure do said kelly lemasters seeing as were going to be warm nurturing mutually advantageous buddies a car approached from santa monica boulevard shiny unmarked new enough to lack plates milo motioned lemasters away from the lot entrance turned his back to the oncoming vehicle whos that she said doesnt matter lets not talk here kelly lemasters said no prob that indian place you like he glared at her nowhere i like i dont want to be seen with you minty fresh notwithstanding fine she said if it means youre going to give me something juicy no obligations thats what they all say we headed up the block into the residential area south of the station milo and lemasters walked abreast as i trailed two steps behind a few turns later he stopped in front of a dingbat apartment building white stucco instead of aqua but stylistically not dissimilar from melvin j wedds parttime residence milos idea of a private joke nothing about him suggested mirth as he drew himself up to max height the way he does when hes out to intimidate if that was the goal it failed with kelly lemasters she took a notepad and pen out of her bag and said go for it milo said put that away were off the record if you guys still respect that milo milo she said if nothings on the record what use are you to me this may come as a shock kelly being useful to you isnt my priority of course not solving nasty old murders is yadda yadda yadda but you know as well as i do that those things go together how many of your closed files would still be open if you didnt get media exposure when you needed it i appreciate the value of a free press but my hands are tied by off the record regarding that small point she said sure bureaucracy she said youve got to be kidding thats the staggering secret we all deal with red tape you think my employers all bill of rights and no bullshit glad you empathize i dont need you to tell me why your stupid venal bosses closed you up on the second skeleton politics as usual the whole maxine cleveland real estate thing you ever meet her braindead and clueless should be a perfect fit in dc that ploy was stupid where did it get her she removed her glasses your idiot bosses let me get scooped by a damn student paper you want to complain i can give you some phone numbers how far would that get me exactly my point kelly its like talking to dust she studied him youre a crafty one arent you okay we go off the record as long as at some point it goes on the record and i dont mean months nope cant give you a deadline i dont want a deadline i just want you to be reasonable she put her glasses back on wrote something in her pad angling the page so he couldnt see ive seen him do the same thing with witnesses trying to kick up the intrigue establish dominance the two of them would make an interesting bridge twosome define reasonable kelly use common sense cut the crap however you want to define it i am not going to remain mute for eternity only to have every moron on tv and the internet going with the story bony hands slapped onto bony hips got it got it fine her pen poised shoot put the pad away you dont trust me to keep it under wraps you just said your patience couldnt be guaranteed were wasting each others time she said this is bullshit then how about we table the proceedings something opens up i promise to let you know why would you do that because youre right he said she studied him youre shitting me nice try im not youre right admitting you made a mistake have you checked your y chromosomes recently if it was up to me kelly id have lots to tell you and it would hit the paper tomorrow not because i care about you or your job but because it could be in my best interest unfortunately by pulling that stunt at the parking lot you made sure anything you write is going to be traced right back to me i maybe that was poor judgment but what was my choice milo shrugged kelly lemasters said okay fine no notes and i swear to protect your identity the pad and pen returned to her bag milo said same for the tape recorder youve got in there how fine youre an ace detective she produced the machine switched it off he took it removed a minispool that he pocketed returned the recorder her nostrils flared youre going to keep that for both our sakes want to check if ive got a nuclearlaser thoughtreader in here nah those are so twentieth century so what do you want to know kelly after all that i have to ask questions just tell me what youve learned about those baby skeletons the first skeleton may not be related to a crime what makes you say that no signs of trauma or injury maybe it was smothered or something anythings possible but i need evidence a body buried under a tree is evidence she said if no crime was committed why conceal it couldve been a death due to natural causes that someone wanted to cover up what kind of death is natural for a baby disease then why cover it up wish i knew kelly i may never know why the pessimism too old too cold i assume youve traced the owners of the house you assume correctly no leads there i know said lemasters i looked into it myself found that old guy in burbank the whole john wayne thing he had nothing to say neither did anyone in cheviot hills including that kid who blabbed to the smc paper her thing was i talk to lieutenant sturgis no one else milo said power of the press yeah were real popularso i should just forget about the first one probe to your hearts content kelly you learn anything ill be grateful sounding sincere not a word about eleanor green a big blue duesenberg nothing from me to either of them about dr jimmy asherwood kelly lemasters said okay lets get to the juicy one once again kelly theres no evidence of trauma but im assuming homicide because of the dead woman who was found across the park also weve done prelim dna on the bones and the baby was a girl kelly lemasters didnt emote okay go on by the state of her dentition two or three months old thats it what about the woman milo said does it bother you at all what a baby her jaw tightened and her arms grew rigid does it bother you you bet well me too she said so its settled we both make our livings off other peoples misery but were still human she turned to me guess that applies to you toothe misery part tell me did you coach him in all this psychological warfare she faced milo again does it bother me lets put it this way ive got one kid and it took me three miscarriages to get him so no i dont get a thrill out of dead babies dont find them the least bit entertaining now what the hell else do you want to know milo said sorry screw the apology give me some meat to chew on weve identified the adult victim nothing in her past predisposes her to being murdered name said lemasters adriana betts originally from idaho she was religious had no bad habits worked as a nanny she took care of kids yes that include babies in some cases that doesnt sound like a connection to you theoretically sure kelly but we interviewed her employers and all their kids are alive and well no one has a bad word to say about her religious types can be hypocrites anyone can what youre a holy roller despite what the church says about people like you lets stick with the case kelly i cant see it said lemasters being catholic and gay she laughed unless youre a parish priest youre catholic once upon a time nice to know youve got no biases she frowned where will you be taking the investigation hard to say no its not she said everyone says youre methodical as well as intuitive always come up with a plan so dont hold back on me whats next same answer kelly she folded her arms across her chest i go offrecord and you give me generalities thats because generalities are all ive got i could feed you stuff that would spark your prurient interest set you off on a useless mazerun but it wouldnt help my case could even hurt it if you printed fallacious crap i thought we were working on trust here we are he said have we reached our goal of what mutually advantageous buddyhood not even close she said i promised to keep everything under wraps and you gave me squat he creased his brow im going to tell you something else but you have to pledge not to use it until i say otherwise i mean that kelly its essential fine fine what though of apparently sound moral character adriana betts may have somehow gotten mixed up with bad people what kind of bad people this isnt factbased he said but possibly cult members not factbased then what inference yours or dr delawares mine you inferred from the body she said some sort of ritual mutilation i heard she was just shot sorry thats all i can say kelly churchgirl in the clutches of satan worshippers any freakos in particular not even close he said ill be looking into that world would welcome your input on the topic i dont know squat about cults that makes two of us kelly her arms relaxed her eyes brightened are we talking another manson thing i sure hope not this town said lemasters is weirdo central can you narrow it down at all wish i could kelly and you need to make sure no one knows we had this talk like i said i protect my sources im not talking legally i mean total blackout his turn to move closer to her big black eyebrows dipped he loomed kelly lemasters shrank back he filled another few inches of her personal space she tried to stand her ground but the primal fear of something big and aggressive caused her to step back total he repeated you screw that up ill never talk to you again and neither will anyone in the department hed lowered his voice the resultant half whisper was movievillain ominous lemasters blinked forced herself to smile youre threatening me im stating a contingency kelly and heres another one just to show you what a nice guy i am if you stick to your part of the deal youll be the first one to know if i close the case if not when appreciate the vote of confidence kelly either way youll scoop everyone i promise how much lead time will i get enough to close everyone out you can guarantee that she said what about your bosses fuck em he growled his eyes were green slits kelly lemasters knew better than to argue we walked her back to butler avenue watched her diminish to a beetcolored speck that turned east on santa monica and disappeared i said to paraphrase persistent kelly whats next i look into mr wedd and you go about your normal life whatever that means it means have a nice day relatively speaking chapter holly ruche showed up six minutes late blanche and i greeted her at the door she said i generally dont like dogs but ive been thinking of getting one for the baby worst reason in the world i said im happy to keep her out of the office shes like a therapy dog not officially but shes got enough credits for her own phd she looked down at blanche blanche beamed up at her she said whats her name blanche shes kind of cute almost like shes smiling okay i guess she can be there up to you holly its okay yes its definitely okay shes well behaved she took in the living room stylish youre into contemporary after a psychopath burns down your first house simplicity can be a tonic i smiled she said have you been here long a while this neighborhood mustve cost a fortune lets go to my office seated on the battered leather couch she said sorry that crack about a fortune no business of mine i guess im just hyper about how much things cost especially real estate the decoratings at a standstill still in the talking stages you and matt she knitted her hands gazed down mostly me and me kind of a monologue she stroked her belly shed put on some girth and her face had grown fuller her hair was tied back functionally tiny pimples paralleled her hairline i guess thats part of why im here hes not available physically or emotionally they go together i guess he works all the time is that something new her lower lip curled tears seeped from under her lower lids and trickled onto her cheeks i guess not she finally said i guess thats the real problem nothings changed i handed her a tissue kleenex should pay me a commission matts always been workoriented i respect that dr delaware hes superresponsible thats a big deal right he could be a slacker sure he thinks its manly taking care of business i guess it is i know it is i said its part of why you were attracted to him yeshowd you know that educated guess well youre right that was a big part of it its justi guess you need to know more about my father like the fact that i didnt have one i waited she said i never knew him im not sure my mother knew him her fingers closed over the tissue this is hard to talk about but i need to be honest right i mean this is the place for that her fingers relaxed she dropped the tissue in a wastebasket being pregnant has made me think about all sorts of things i told myself id never have to think about your own family if you can call it that there wasnt much in the way of family just me and my mother and she was she sat for a while theres no two ways about it mom was loose morally i mean not to me to me she was just mom but looking back she was a cocktail waitressim not saying that was bad she worked incredibly hard she took care of me put food on the table but she also supplemented her income by bringing men home when i was little i thought it was normal locking me in my room with cookies and candies she bit her lip that didnt stop me from seeing some of them hearing them all kinds of men different ages races it was like she called them her friends time for quiet time with these oreos and kit kats sweetie i need to spend time with my friends i said at some point you realized that wasnt typical i realized it when i started kindergarten and saw how other kids lived my first years were kind of isolated we lived in a trailer park dont get me wrong it was a nice trailer mom kept it up planted flowers all around there was a little birdbath where sparrows and finches would come we were pretty close to a nice neighborhood working class solid people lots of religious types it didnt take me long to catch on that other mothers didnt do what mine did i never said anything because mom loved me took care of me i always had nice clothes and good food the same things other kids had who was i to be ungrateful more tears i shouldnt have said that calling her loose that was wrong really mean another tissue interlude she said shes gone cant defend herself i just feel its time to be honest you know confront reality so i can understand myself now that youre becoming a mom i dont want to be like her she said i mean in some ways i do i want to be loving to take care of my aimee to give her everything thats why i married matt hes a totally great provider when i talked to you at your house you said youd worked most of your life had a career until recently thats true you set out to be independent yes so so even though matts maturity and industriousness were qualities you found attractive you never intended to rely upon him totally i yes thats true i guess youre right youre saying mom made me tough im saying youre an obviously capable thoughtful person does your mother get some of the credit sure but in the end you made your own decisions i guess i did but im still sorry for saying that about mom i miss her so much she burst out weeping took a while to compose herself she passed three years ago doctor she suffered so much i guess ive been angry at her for leaving so young she was fiftyfour even though thats not rational i was being selfish im too selfish period i shouldnt have said that did you treat her unkindly when she was alive no of course not when she had to go to hospiceshe had als lou gehrigs diseasei was always there for her it was terrible she hung on for three years i paid for whatever medical and insurance didnt cover i was there all the time her mind was still working but nothing else was thats what made it so horrible at the end she could still move her eyes i could see the love in them so how could i say that your lifes in flux holly its normal for old feelings to come back you love your mother but some of the things she did frightened and embarrassed you youve never expressed how you felt about it its okay youre telling me its okay to say things like that calling her loose its a word holly your actions spoke much louder long silence youre so nice your wife is luckyare you married i smiled sorry sorry i need to mind my own business its not that holly this is about you she smiled thats sure different being the star though i guess i was the star to mom she never had any more kids i guess one whoopsie baby was enough you know for sure you were an accident why wouldnt i be your mother sounds like an organized person youre saying she intended me did she make any other whoopsies she pulled at the tissue tugged at her ponytail i see what you mean she always told me i was the best thing ever happened to her im sure you were she glanced at blanche i gave the okay nod and blanche waddled over to the couch holly said is she allowed up here absolutely if you want you can come up cutie blanche leaped effortlessly to her side moved in close for a snuggle holly stroked the folds of her neck shes so soft like a stuffed animal as cute as a toy i said and a whole lot smarter youve got it all dont you she said the house the dog maybe a wifesorry so maybe thats why you think i was a deliriously desired baby okay ill go with that my aimees wanted thats whats important let me ask you something do you think permissives the best way to go or keep up the discipline depends on the child some kids need more discipline i nodded she said matt sure doesnt need any more hes the most selfdisciplined person ive ever met how about you im okay i guess i know how to take care of myself i wonder what aimee will be like not that im trying to box her in with expectations i mean obviously id like her to be beautiful and brillianthealthy thats the most important thing healthy so youre saying i need to get to know her before i work out my plan you may not need a plan i said no a lot of people have good instincts but some dont how about your mother she had excellent instincts she said the best wide smile now i feel better saying something nice to make up for the other thing she crossed her legs that was your plan right to guide me to say something nice like i said holly sometimes a plan isnt necessary you knew me well enough to just let me go on you know yourself i guess i do dr delaware she placed a hand on her belly this is mine i own it im not saying aimees not a separate person i get that im talking about the process carrying her nurturing her with my body a woman needs to feel she owns that i feel much better now if i need you can i call of course i dont care anymore about the house or the remodeling or any material crap she said that kind of ownership doesnt matter chapter i made a couple of tuna sandwiches brought them to robins studio she said the perfect man washed sawdust from her hands gave me a kiss we ate near the pond talked about everything but work returned to work blanche chose to stay with robin but she licked my hand first i said master diplomat robin held out the half sandwich shed wrapped in a napkin more like ive got the goodies definition of diplomacy i sat wondering what adriana betts had done for money and lodging during the months between leaving la jolla and showing up dead in the park maybe shed saved up enough to coast or perhaps shed resorted to what she knew best taking care of other peoples offspring i printed a list of every employment agency in la county that advertised nannies au pairs governesses any sort of inhouse staff for the next hour my lie was glib and consistent i was adrianas potential employer and shed listed the agency as having handled her in the past i must have been pretty convincing because i encountered a lot of outrage at the falsehood several people said i was lucky to learn about adrianas poor character early on most made sure to let me know they had far superior candidates with a dozen calls to go i took a coffee break and checked with my service a family court judge had left a message thanking me for a helpful custody report ditto one of the attorneys on the case third was holly ruche offering her gratitude no specifics the service operator a woman id never talked to before said you have teenagers by any chance doctor i said why everyone seems to appreciate you if you tell me your teenagers do i may make an appointment myself i laughed she said you sound cheerful so thats my answer you dont have any id whittled the agency list to four companies when the man who answered at gold standard professionals in beverly hills listened to my pitch but didnt reply i said you know adriana he said hold on for a moment please deep mellifluous voice as i waited i examined the companys internet ad the pitch featured twentiesstyle cartoons of butlers footmen chefs in toques maids in lace uniforms lettering in an angular art deco font boldface motto the ultimate in classic service beyond the ultimate in classic discretion maybe discretion was what kept me on hold for seven minutes before the connection was cut i redialed got voice mail after fielding more indignation at the remaining three agencies i gave gold standard another try this time no one answered i googled the company a single reference popped up a piece from the beverly hills clarion that couldve been a paid ad or leastresistance journalism gold standards owners were jack and daisy weathers former performers now entrepreneurs in the field of highend service whod parlayed their knowledge of the unique demands of the industry with postgraduate training in human factors and development for jack that meant a masters degree from a university i knew to be a correspondence mill no educational specs for daisy the accompanying photo showed the weatherses to be whitehaired tan wearing matching pink shirts and smiles crammed with postgraduate dental work the smooth voice could easily have been that of an actor so maybe id talked to the boss gold standards address was a pob in beverly hills south end of the city maybe a mail drop was there no need for an office because clients of sufficient importance merited house calls or did one have to pass muster before being favored with privateclub status if the latter was the case id flunked maybe that had nothing to do with adriana just disdain for an obviously undeserving plebe with no link to the industry but no other agency had reacted that way i put in a call to milo he said i was just going to call you eat yet had a sandwich thats a snack not a meal the usual place no reporter in tow huh speaking of lois lane i may have created a monster im walking over right now gonna start grubfesting without you seeing as you already had a sandwich i found him at his usual corner table at cafe moghul perched like a potentate behind platters of lamb chicken lobster and crab some kind of meatball big enough to hurl at dodger stadium the usual himalaya of naan and vegetables bowls of mystery sauce be nice if synchrony ruled the world and there was a master detective in mumbai stuffing his face with burgers fried chicken and pizza unlike every other time id been in the restaurant the dining room was nearly full the new patrons were uniformed cops and plainclothes detectives everyone chowing down on generous portions but none of the wretched excess left at the altar of milo i sat down looks like the worlds caught on what they caught on to is a special lunch deal half price on everything a detective i recognized waved and brandished a lobster claw milo muttered bargainhunting vulgarians the bespectacled woman brought me iced tea and a clean plate she looked exhausted i said busy she beamed at milo they listen to him he said youve got to believe me it was the flyer you left at the station her smile widened knowing shed encountered a deity and figuring humility was one of his divine attributes i said whats up mahatma he leaned in close lowered his voice ol kellys digging like a gopher so far ive received about fifty pages of attachments on infanticides none of which is relevant meanwhile zip on adriana wedd or charlene chambers as herself or as qeesha dembo and none of the cult sites ive found seems to fit including their photos cults post publicity photos you better believe it theyre proud of themselves basically its a party scene alex lots of nudity and naughty groping weirdest thing i found was a beelzebubworshipping bunch that gets off by smearing themselves with food the prime sacramental offering being baked beans vegetarian of course i said someones engaged in truly ugly behavior why advertise nodding he downed half a plate of lamb wiped his hands and mouth scanned the room switched to a lowvolume leprechaun brogue i was a wee bit impish laddy gave ms lemasters the name and number of one maria thomas and told her it wouldnt displease me if she harassed the brass about going public on selective info selective as in what you decide is there another definition marias not going to make the connection to you the story kellys telling her is shes fed up with me because i keep stonewalling her so shes decided to go over my head if maria gives her the okay no problem if maria tells her no shell publish a followup piece on the park murders anyway to my great apparent chagrin i said impressively devious when in nome do as the ice queen does meanwhile no cult link to wedd but i have learned a few things about him most of it disappointing not only does he lack a criminal record according to his landlord hes a model tenant pays on time never complains as opposed to surfboy sommers whos chronically late with his rent and bitches about everything and who the landlord sees as a druggie so im not sure hes gonna work as a witness i also found out that an ac company was in wedds place to install new thermostats two weeks ago landlord let them in the place was neat clean nothing out of the ordinary landlords have to notify tenants about service calls so wedd wouldve had time to clean up in this case the landlord got phone authorization from wedd the same day he did say from the look of the place wedd didnt seem to use it much which backs up the dualcrib theory i was able to get wedds cell number and email as well as the work history wedd listed on his application he pulled out his pad steadily and gainfully employed for over three years at a company called capd inc the intriguing factoid in this whole data storm is capd has no listed address the pd part made me wonder if theyre trying to sound policelike a hushhush private security outfit but there are no business listings in the county under that name and when i called the number wedd listed i was automatically transferred to a company of the same name on grand cayman island and their answer was an electronic beep that then cut off midsentence and when i searched for an island address there was none i said the caymans are big on offshore banking that was hypothesis two some shady financial scam and qeesha being a naughty girl mighta had a history with them so i called ray lhermitte in new orleans but capd meant nothing to him wedd told sommers he worked in the industry i just fielded my own bit of intrigue based on that i told him about my agency calls the evasive response at gold standard maybe he just didnt like the sound of my voice but my gut says he was hiding something a cop across the room flashed a thumbsup milo growled rank conformist to me gold standard why not platinum okay lets ditch these bandwagonjumpers and see what gold standards all about he threw cash on the table the woman in the sari rushed over and tried to return the money for your commission give it to charity he said what charity lieutenant something kind and gentle like you he stomped out of the restaurant the woman said such a wonderful man one of the cops called out pardon could we have some more of that spinach chapter as we drove to the south end of beverly hills i thought of something sommers said wedd avoided conversation howd he know wedd was an industry guy lets find out sommers answered his phone he used to get variety delivered used to havent seen it for a while also the way he walked was a tipoff full of himself like im a dude who knows people he do something bad to those girls no evidence of that robert meaning maybe he did said sommers okay if he shows up ill let you know gold standards address matched a twostory building clad with salmoncolored granite quick n easy postal and packaging took up the streetlevel space the female clerk working the counter was young and cute with doe eyes and a foxface her hair was a red tsunami sleeve tattoos and a steel stud jutting from her chin said pain wasnt an issue for her neither was discretion milo said where can i find the people who rent box three thirtyfive go outside and up the stairs id been wrong about a mail drop was glad to be humbled if their office is right here why do they need you the clerk said hmm cause im cute he squinted to read her name tag well sure i can see that cheyenne is there any other reason she twirled the chin stud it caught for an instant made her wince finally rotated the building owner doesnt provide mail slots for the tenants how come cause that was the deal in order for us to move in it worked most of them rent from us are those guys in trouble or something cause they dont seem like the type what type is that said milo theyre kinda like old she inspected us i mean serious old grandma and grandpa not like my grampeeps they dont have a clue these guys do these guys are like cool dressers in an old way these fashion plates have a name plates she said what are their names cheyenne a fingernail pinged the stud a speck of blood seeped from between steel and skin a tiny red bubble formed she flicked it away they are in trouble wow not at all cheyenne we just need to talk to them oh theyre daisy and jack she used to act on tv and he was like a musician they told you that yeah but its true i saw her acting where on tv she said one of those movies cowboys and horses she was like the girl he loved the main cowboy totally he put her on the horse and they did a liplock she was hot i said was jack playing guitar in the background huh oh no he was like into trumpets or something in a tv band one of those latenight shows blank look if i was a network head id be worried about longevity milo said so what kind of business do daisy and jack run upstairs i dunno what kind of mail do they get dunno that either he smiled you never look mail comes in the morning she said i get here at noon why dont you just go up and talk to them if youre so interested theyre in dunno okay thanks cheyenne so maybe theyre in trouble huh stairs carpeted in cheap blue lowpile polyester led to a windowless foyer rimmed by five slab doors no sound from behind any of them gold standard professionals neighbors offered electrolysis bookbinding tax preparation and gift counseling milo said gift counseling what the hell does that mean i said maybe they tell you whos been naughty or nice next therell be laxative counseling we open new channels of communication okay here goes nothing he rapped on gold standards door a male voice said whos there police what police please open up another what but the door cracked jack weathers had added a clipped white mustache and some wrinkles since his clarion interview he was tall well built seventy to seventyfive wore a white polo shirt under a seagreen cashmere vneck taupe linen slacks calfskin loafers sans socks his skin was shiny and spraybronzed his eyes a deeper tan a wedding band crusted with pave diamonds circled his left ring finger one pinkie hosted a whitegold emerald ring the other a rosegold creation dominated by a massive amethyst the gold chain around his neck was curiously delicate he said police i dont understand milo flashed the badge could we come in please mr weathers do i have a choice of course sir a female voice said jack whats going on before weathers could answer a woman came up behind him and shoved the door wide open a foot shorter than her husband daisy weathers had on a black jacquard silk top cream gabardine slacks red stilettos that advertised a virtuoso pedicure serious bling glinted at all the predictable spots the white in her hair verged on silverplate the style was some cosmetologists ode to meringue her eyes were glacierblue oddly innocent small bones and a sweet face had kept her cute well beyond the expiration date jack weathers said theyre the police daisy weathers said hi boys collecting for the law enforcement ball we give every year sultry voice she winked milo said not exactly maam jack weathers said they dont send guys in suits for the ball daze they send kidsscouts cadets whatever you call em daisy weathers said cute kids theyre making em bigger nowadays what can we do for you boys milo said wed like to talk about adriana betts she looked puzzled well i cant say i know who that is jack weatherss face darkened a fist punched a palm knew itit was one of you who called earlier right if youd left a number id have called you back i said got cut off couldnt get through after that his eyes danced to the right well i dont know about that our phones are working fine daisy said jack whats going on all they had to do was call this really isnt necessary he says he did well all he had to do was try again maybe weathers was usually truthful because lying didnt sit well with him i counted at least three tells in as many seconds lipgnaw browtwitch foottap then his eyes got jumpy anyway i said were here so no harm no foul milo moved toward the doorway jack weathers considered his options and stepped aside daisy weathers said what was that name boys milo said adriana betts is that someone im supposed to know jack the eyes turned into pinballs she touched his wrist he jerked reflexively jackie whats going on its nothing baby i said so she did work for you no one works for us said jack weathers were facilitators jaackee said his wife again weathers looked away jack no big deal daze obviously it is a big deal if the police are here he cursed under his breath she said you boys better come in and straighten this out the singleroom office was furnished with two cheap desks and three hardplastic chairs the walls were hospitalbeige and bare a lone window half covered by warped plastic blinds looked out to an alley and the brick wall of the neighboring building one desk was set up with a multiline phone a modem a computer a printer and a fax machine the other held a collection of bisque figurinesslender whitewigged court figures engaged in spirited nonsense daisy weathers took a seat behind the porcelain and lifted a luteplaying lady in a ball gown one of her six rings clinked against the doll her husband winced then he slipped behind the bank of business machines and eased his long body as low as he could manage milo said tell us about adriana betts daisy said yes do dear jack said she came with good recommendations did you do the screening jackie it was an urgent one daze she slapped her forehead bending rules what a shock to us my sweetie pie here has a heart softer than a ripe persimmon that sounded like a line from a movie jack said someone comes to me in need i try to help he really does boys i wish i could get mad at him but you need to know him hes a peoplepleaser milo said what kind of screening do you usually do comprehensive screening said jack just what you do what we do er what im sure you do when you hire police officers weatherss smile was a pathetic grope for rapport to ensure the best fit right everyone knows bhpds the best ill pass that along to them said milo actually im lapd oh said jack weathers well im sure the same applies to you we used to live in los angeles hancock park lovely we had a gorgeous colonial with a halfacre garden the police were always helpful great to hear that sir so with adriana betts you decided to forgo the usual screening daisy let out a prolonged sigh jack shot her a look that couldve been a warning or fear as i said there was urgency i said someone was in need thats what we do said jack we fill needs in ms bettss case childcare needs he didnt answer daisy said no matter who you are finding the right people is always a challenge i faced jack meaning someone important whod you send adriana to he shook his head milo said sir jack weathers said what exactly are you claiming happened because i absolutely refuse to believe it was anything serious i pride myself on being an excellent judge of character and that young lady had obviously fine character she was religious had a letter from her pastor milo pulled out one of qeeshas mug shots what about this young lady daisy blurted her jack tried to hiss her silent she said im really at sea over this will someone please tell me whats going on jack folded his arms across his chest milo said youd placed qeesha dembo where you sent adriana silence i said qeesha vouched for adriana thats why you didnt feel the need to screen her daisy said normally wed still screen but if it was urgent they get it said her husband she pouted jackie were not saying anything more gentlemen not without advice of counsel milo said you want a lawyer to answer routine questions you bet daisy put the figurine down no visible tremor but the base rattled on the desktop milo said youre not being accused of any crime mr weathers even so said jack you didnt screen adriana but you did screen qeesha daisy said ive never heard of qeesha we knew her by another namewhat was it again jackie weathers shook his head drew his finger across his lip shes a beautiful girl said daisy the way those black girls can be with their big dark eyes what was her name something with an s i believe id have to check the shut up daze daisy weathers stared at her husband one hand bounced on her desktop the other rose to her face pinched cheekskin twisted her eyes turned wet jack weathers said oh baby daisy sniffled he turned to us now look what youve donei need you to leave standing he pointed to the door milo said suit yourself mr weathers and got up but heres what puzzles me you run a business based on the ability to judge character you said before that whatever happened to adriana wasnt a big deal because she was a woman of good character but from what i can tell youre only batting five hundred sir good for baseball not so good for job placement what are you talking about you were right about one thing wrong about the other yes adriana seems to have been a woman of excellent character but what happened was a really big deal what happened weathers demanded your lawyer can tell you after we return with your friends at bhpd armed with a search warrant for all of your records thats impossible weathers shouted jack said daisy its not only possible said milo its probable youre not making sense said weathers adriana had excellent character but she still committed some kind of bad deed she didnt do anything mr weathers something was done to her shes hurt said daisy shes dead maam someone murdered her oh no im afraid yes mrs weathers i never even knew her jack hired her poor thing she cried it seemed genuine but who could be sure about anything on the westside of la her husband remained dryeyed milo said care to fill us in sir not on your life said jack weathers not on one blessed second of your blessed life chapter we lingered outside the door jack weathers had just shut conversational noise began filtering through the wood daisy weatherss higherpitched voice plaintive then demanding no response from jack daisy again louder a bark from her husband that silenced her several seconds later his voice resumed softer less staccato a long string of sentences milo whispered on the phone now its a lawyer game we left the building milo drove a block uturned found the farthest spot that afforded a view of the marbleclad building red zone but until a bh parking nazi showed up the perfect vantage point i said waiting for jack to leave maybe i stirred up enough for him to meet with legal counsel i tail him find out who ill be dealing with without that i cant approach him no warrant party with bhpd yeah right on what grounds jacks demeanor he got agitated to a psychologist thats grounds to a judge you know what it is he stretched knuckled an eyelid any way it shakes out hes toast runs a business based on image and trust and hires one woman with a police record another who ends up getting killed and who was referred by the bad girl screening my ass i said maybe it goes beyond that weathers bills himself as a hollywood insider so maybe he also placed wedd at the same client who employed qeesha and adriana someone powerful enough to shelter income in the caymans and to scare weathers straight to legal counsel capd he said lets try to find out who they are easier said than done maybe not i pulled out my cell punched my preset robin said hi hon whats up got a spare minute for some research about what ever hear of capd nope who would you call if you needed info on a bigtime showbiztype whats this about alex i told her she said interesting ill see what i can do most of robins guitars and mandolins are commissioned by professional musicians and collectors who play seriously a few end up stashed in the vaults of rich men seeking trophiesluckysperm recipients real estate tycoons aspergian algorithmers movie stars plus the lampreys who get rich off movie stars i rarely think of my girl as a hollywood type but shes the one who gets invited to all the parties we seldom attend six minutes later that paid off got what you need that was quick i looped in brent dorf dorf was a luminary at a major talent agency id met him last year when he picked up a replica of an eighteenthcentury parlor guitar that would end up hanging on a wall when he found out what i did for a living he reminisced about being a psych major at yale regretted that he hadnt pursued it because his primary passion was helping people my experience is people who talk about being passionate seldom are brent had impressed me as the perfect political typea mile wide and an inch deep programmed to banter on cue his jokes were clever his attention span brief whatever charm he managed to project was diluted by the flat eyes and sanguinary grin of a monitor lizard at least he paid his bills on time i said dorf knew about capd boy did he honey unfortunately big guys life is going to get really complicated she explained why i told milo he said oh then he swore chapter premarani moon was hollywood royalty as is the case with real

which time he wangled a day job as a golf caddie supplemented by a nighttime gig sweeping up a pizza joint in brentwood it was there that the wife of a tv producer took a shine to the blackhaired

you having to deal with that bitch maria was her usual charming self maria she said is one of those automatons who delude themselves theyre capable of independent thought she stonewalled you huh she sure tried said lemasters i told her id run a followup story hell or high water and would harass you to the point of stalking and she waffled just like you said the way we left it is shell call you to work out the proper data feed and get back to me good work kid now were buddies common enemy and all that kelly click he said ten acres didnt know you were interested in movie stars a couple of years ago a man representing them called for an appointment for a family member but claimed he didnt know who i asked him whod referred them to me he had no idea about that either was just following instructions asked if i could make a house call i said okay if payment would be portaltoportal he said money was no object gave me the address i was intrigued so i did some research including google maps the next day a call came into my service canceling when i phoned to ask why i couldnt get through i tried again same result they hire another shrink i have no idea lucky me he said if youd actually seen them or their kids youd have to recuse yourself no actual contract or contact no confidentiality right right but if someone that powerful wanted to sue me theyd do it anyway youre staying out of it hell no chapter wed watched the marbleclad building for nine minutes when maria thomas called just had an obnoxious conversation with a times reporter who brags shes been dogging you milo said kelly lemasters olympic gold medalist in the pestathlon she getting in the way of the job if it goes any further she will he said at this point shes just an annoyance well said thomas shes threatening to hound you to the ground unless you feed her exclusive info and if you dont give her anything shell dig for alternative sources and go public and we both know shell find alternatives all those looselipped idiots floating around the department thats my problem maria now it is milo groaned turned to me and gave a thumbsup and grinned like a drunk way i see it thomas continued you can neutralize her by being selective easy for you to say maria youre not the one getting dogged yeah yeah anyway thats the way its going to be youre instructed to meet with her asap and offer her judicious info define judicious at this point said thomas moron maxines real estate deals totally screwed so feel free to play with the cheviot hills angle give her anything that doesnt compromise the investigation ive been shutting her out completely he said now i do a total aboutface flexibility said thomas its a sign of psychological strength ask delaware i see him i might just do that whatever now go meet with the bitch and stay in control any progress on the case not much then its no big deal feed her a steaming mound of bullshit presstypes are born with taste buds for it click i said didnt know machiavelli was irish he laughed when youre in love laddie everyone is irish his head swiveled toward beverly drive a car had pulled up in front of gold standards building irongray mercedes sedan a curlyhaired middleaged man in a navy suit got out and remotelocked the car bypassing the mailbox outfit he opened the door to the second floor stepped in and up milo said maybe hes someone needs gift counseling but im smelling the musty aroma of lawyer he swung another u got behind the mercedes copied the tags continuing south into la he crossed pico turned left on cashio street parked ran the numbers floyd banfer home address on south camden drive in bh a call obtained banfers professional listing attorneyatlaw office on roxbury drive just north of wilshire in bh keeping it local said milo should i go back in there and confront them or give myself time to plan im leaning toward wait and see sounds like you know what to do spoken like a master therapist we headed back to the station he continued past the staff lot stopped where id parked the seville kept the engine running i said playdates over id better get the meeting with lemasters out of the way id bring you along but shell probably make a big deal about the copshrink thing and i figure you dont want the exposure more important itll be good for kelly to feel shes getting your undivided attention that too anything i can do in the meantime clean up your room and stop sassing your mother what can you do okay heres something figure out a way i can get into premadonnyland to look for mr wedd maybe you wont need to i said if hes holed up there eventually hell leave start surveillance on the place out came his pad you remember the address no but its easy to find coldwater north about a mile past mulholland on the west side of the road theres an unmarked private road that leads up to a gate your research included driving up there im an empiricist some rep called you huh wouldnt it be something if it was wedd it would i said youve already thought about that i wished him well got out of the car he said hooray for hollywood roared away chapter my research on premadonny had involved more than id let on to milo after the call from the stars rep id picked among millions of web citations bios composed early in their careers aired bins of dirty laundry everything subsequent was pr pap programmed as carefully as a laugh track clips from their films left no question about their physical perfection a renaissance artist wouldve submitted to indignity if not outright torture in order to paint them prema moon came across as a competent occasionally impressive performer who could amplify or lower her sexuality as if equipped with an erotic rheostat the only mention she made of her children was on a press release announcing her hiatus from film work in order to concentrate on being a fulltime mom donny rader lent his support to that move calling his wife the ultimate earth mother protective as a mama lion raders acting was surprisingly onenote his default mannerisms were the slow theatrical lowering of hooded eyes and the tendency to slur his words the man whod requested the appointment had begun talking in a choppy agitated delivery but had shifted quickly to mumbly diction i replayed a few of raders clips heard the same elisions over and over if not identical to the man on the phone awfully close had it been a worried father phoning me about his child but choosing to hide that fact because alist celebs werent supposed to do things for themselves or was there a deeper motive for the deception whoever the representative was hed skated away from naming the child in question assuring me id find out soon enough then hanging up his tension had been notable and that could mean an especially worrisome problem id keyworded premadonny children millions of hits on the parents but almost nothing on the kids an image search pulled up a solitary photo gone viral a shot taken a few months before in new york of prema and her kids attending a broadway disney musical redvelvet giltmolded walls in the background supported the captions assertion that the group had been photographed in the theater lobby but the space was otherwise unpopulated which was odd for an sro hit and the lighting was dim but for a crisp klieglike beam focused on the subjects maybe prema and her brood had been let in early or theyd arrived on a dark monday in order to be posed as carefully as a velazquez royal sitting i studied the shot prema moon wearing a conservative dark pantsuit that set off cascades of golden hair stood behind the four kids the lighting was gracious to her heartshaped face and her perfect chin and her beyondperfect cheekbones the oldest child a boy of ten or eleven had fine features and ebony skin that evoked somalia or ethiopia a dolllike asian girl around eight and a grave asian boy slightly younger flanked a platinumhaired pouting toddler with cherubic chubby cheeks and dimpled knuckles all of them were dressed in matching white shirts and dark pants as uniformly clad as parochial school students no names provided just prema and her pretty quartet pretty was an understatement each child was gorgeous all but the youngest smiled woodenly the collective posture again excepting the toddler was militaryrigid prema graced the photographer with the faintest smilejust enough parting of moist full lips to imply the theoretical possibility of mirth her eyes refused to go along laserintense they aimed at some distant focal point no physical contact between her and her progeny her arms remained pressed to her sides i searched the kids faces looking for anything that might tell me whom i was scheduled to see not much of anything emotionwise which in kids meant plenty was going on intrigued about what id encounter once i got behind the gates of the compound i logged off a day or two after the cancellation i remained curious then my calendar booked up the way it usually does and i was concentrating on murder victims and patients who actually showed up now nearly two years later i drove home curiosity reignited this time the computer was a bit more cooperative and i found a couple of hundred references to the children including their names kion thirteen kembara eleven kylejacques eight kristina four but not a single image the theaterlobby shot had been expunged a closer reading of the citations proved disappointing all of them discussed how zealously premadonny protected their progenys privacy a few snarky types bemoaned the couples cia approach to parenting but most of the chatterers and bloggers and gurus of gossip were supportive of the attempt to prevent the children from becoming grist for the paparazzi mill maybe so but there was another reason for isolating children milo was concentrating on melvin jaron wedds link to the compound on mulholland drive my mind was going in a completely different direction i made some coffee added foamed milk and cinnamon brought a mugful to robins studio she put down her chisel and smiled this is becoming a regular thing blanches little flat nose quivered as she inhaled the aroma i fetched her a baconbone from the box robin keeps at hand she took the treat from my fingers with her usual delicacy trotted over to a corner to nosh in peace robin sipped and said you even girlied it up for me what a good boyfriend least i can do you owe me for something cosmically i owe you a ton when you call brent dorf a second time my gratitude will blossom further ask if i can talk to him in person about premadonny if he has nothing to offer maybe he can refer me to someone who does you actually suspect those two of something it hasnt gotten that far but a murder victim worked for them and maybe so did a prime suspect toss in qeesha dembo who could be victim or suspect and its well beyond interesting weird goingson behind the gates she said maybe they just hired the wrong people maybe i said but all of this has stirred up something that happened a couple of years ago i told her about the canceled referral my suspicion that donny rader had tried to hide his identity back then my gut told me there was a serious problem with the family now im wondering if that meant a child disturbed enough to hurt a baby she put her cup down thats horrible horrible and worth covering up prema moon gave up her career and recast herself as a devoted protective mother both of them have can you imagine the repercussions if it turned out theyd raised a murderous child even if the babys death was accidentalkids horsing around something unfortunate happenedthat kind of disclosure would be disastrous any mother would have good reason to go to the cops but qeesha dembo was no stranger to deceit and working the angles so she mightve put a serious squeeze on we know she had conflict with wedd assumed it was a romantic issue but wedd couldve been premadonnys paymaster so maybe the problem between them was business she wanted more he said no shes dead too her nails pinged the coffee mug i said sorry to pollute your day im finethe car scam alex why would premadonny stoop to insurance fraud that couldve been wedd improvising so he could pocket the payoff money or he really is the only bad guy and they had the misfortune of hiring him what exactly does he do for them dont know the agencys clammed up a murderous child she said how old are the kids four eight eleven thirteen so the oldest she said most likely boy or girl boy what else do you know about him nothing theyve all been swept out of sight im talking utter invisibility there are good reasons for keeping your kids out of the public eye but there are also bad ones protecting a homicidal thirteenyearold protecting the alternative universe that created a homicidal thirteenyearold rob when i come across unusually secretive isolated families theres almost always major pathology at play the most common factor is abuse of powera cultlike situation sometimes that stops at eccentricity sometimes it leads to really bad things she drank more coffee placed the mug on her desk okay ill call brent right now thanks babe let him know i need him because hes dialed in brents all about being mr inside thats the perfect approach she smiled but of course you knew that chapter brent dorf had just left for new york on business his assistant claimed a return date hadnt been set but promised to deliver the message robin said brentll be interested in what i have for him im counting on you luv she hung up i said luv charles is british and gay but he likes flirting with girls brents gay too for that matter but he has absolutely no interest in girls she laughed i can just imagine him and milo taking lunch at the grill on the alley they allow polyester on alternate tuesdays we havent been there in a long time i dont think weve ever been there theres another reason to go i said tonight sound good youre in the mood for time with you always meaning youre tired of thinking i told her thats not what i meant at all and that i loved her and went back to my office dinner was a twohour respite and when we left the grill shortly after ten pm i felt loose and content the night air was clean and warm an invitation to walk rodeo drives around the corner from the restaurant and once the tourists go to bed its a peaceful stroll robin held my arm as we strolled past windows showcasing stuff no one could afford we made it home by eleven making love was a great next step in the quest for distraction but when youre compulsive and addicted to the bad stuff you inevitably return to that dark place i lay next to robin as she slept peacefully unanswerable questions eddying in my head the following morning as she showered i took blanche outside for her am toilette and retrieved the paper from the driveway leafing through i came across kelly lemasterss followup story on the park murders page maybe five hundred words but shed scored abovethecrease placement milo had lured her with the promise of something juicy but nothing close to that appeared in the article leaving lemasters to play with humaninterest filler the mystery trajectory that had taken adriana betts from churchgirl to murder victim the impact of two cheviot hills murders upon affluent citizens adrianas sister helene and the reverend goleman were quoted but their comments were no more revelatory than their stationhouse interviews the sad mystery of a strewn infant skeleton was noted as was the eerie parallel to the bones found under matt and holly ruches cedar tree nothing about the park babys racial makeup or parentage milos name didnt come up until the final paragraph where he was described as a veteran homicide detective left baffled the piece ended with an anyone with information message and his landline i figured hed be busy all morning fielding leads was surprised when he phoned at nine taking a break from the tipsters got moe and sean on that i need to roll just got a call from floyd banfer jack weatherss lawyer he wants to meet an hour and a half bh parkway corner rexford right near city hall banfers serving papers at bhpd said hed walk over hes suing the police some sort of workers comp deal on behalf of a fired officer nothing he assured me that id find objectionable whats on his mind he wouldnt say but hes definitely antsy alex i like that in attorneys makes them seem almost human milo and i arrived at ten twenty found a bench on the north side of the parkway with a clear view of the beverly hills government complex the original city hall is a thirties spanish renaissance masterpiece the civic center complex built fifty years later tried to work deco and contemporary into the mix and ended up looking tacked on a degraded granite path chinese elms and lawn separated us from santa monica boulevard traffic howled in both directions an ancient man accompanied by a husky attendant inched a walker past us a trio of persian women in fila tracksuits bounced by chatting in farsi a young woman who could have been a victorias secret model if the company raised its standards raced past all of them looking miserable directly in front of us was a sixfootbytenfoot mound of lumpy chromeplate milo said what the hell is that public art looks like a jumbo jet had digestive problems at ten twentysix floyd banfer exited the police station crossed the street and headed toward us when he arrived he was flushed and smiling a compact man with a peanutshaped head bright blue eyes and the kind of white stubble that milo calls a terrorist beard punctual he boomed nice to be dealing with professionals compact man with an expansive bass voice a hand shot out floyd banfer milo sturgis this is alex delaware shakes all around banfers grip was a mite too firm his arm remained stiff his eyes wary the smile hed arrived with seemed glued to his face pretty morning eh dont imagine beverly hills would allow anything less counselor banfer chuckled youd be surprised his suit was the same dark gray wed seen yesterday a slightly shiny silkandwool his shirt was a tv blue spreadcollar his tie a pink hermes patterned with bugles fifty to fiftyfive with thin wavy hair tinted brown and throwing off red highlights the way mens dyed hair often does he radiated an odd mix of good cheer and anxiety as if he enjoyed being on edge milo motioned to the space wed created between us on the bench banfer said mind if we walk that piece of shit they call art makes me queasy and any chance to exercise is welcome sure the three of us headed west the granite pathways are supposed to resist dust but banfers black wingtips turned gray within seconds every few yards he managed to wipe the shoes on the back of his trousers without breaking step at crescent drive we paused until crosstraffic cleared a helmeted bicyclist rounded the corner and sped toward us and banfer had to step to the right to avoid collision totally illegal he said still smiling no bikes allowed want to chase him down and give him a ticket lieutenant milo hadnt told banfer his rank banfer did his homework above my pay grade counselor banfer chuckled again so why did i ask for this meeting he paused as if really expecting an answer milo and i kept walking banfer said first off thanks for being accommodating got a tough week if not now it would have to wait happy to oblige mr banfer whats on your mind floyds fine okay let me start with a given jack weathers is a good man milo didnt answer banfer said you kind of scared him popping in like that not my intention banfer picked up his pace be that as it may lieutenant heres the thing jack and daisy are good people run a good business perform a good servicedid you know they used to be in the industry small screen mostly jack played music and acted did a whole bunch of hawaii fiveos some gunsmoke couple of magnums daisy was on lawrence welk for years then jack did real estate out in the valley and daisy did some dance teaching she was a dancer before she was an actress performed with martha graham knew cyd charisse im talking talent impressive said milo id say several more steps a group of younger persian women glided past trim in black velour wearing pearls and diamonds listening to ipods banfer said what im trying to get across is these are decent honest people been working all their lives neither of them came from money they found a niche developed it thank god theyve been doing well can even possibly think about retiring at some point though i dont know if they will thats up to them makes sense what does said banfer making their own decision about retirement yes of course my point here is that were talking good people ill take your word for it floyd good anyway in case you dont know how the industry works let me cue you in its all hierarchy bottom of the pyramid up to the top were talking highly structured who you know determines how you do things can change in a snap he paused to breathe whom i preaching to this is la youre pros we reached canon drive a homeless man shuffled toward us leaving a wake of stench banfer wrinkled his nose no more vagrancy laws im ambivalent about that would like to see them taken care of properly but you cant just go scoop them up out of the park the way i saw in europe when i was a student backpacking in the eighties made me think of storm troopers milo made no effort hiding the glance at his timex banfer said time to cut to the chase sure makes sense but he offered no additional wisdom as we continued walking halfway to beverly drive milo said floyd what exactly can i do for you accept the data im going to proffer in the spirit with which its offered meaning jack and daisy need to be kept out of any homicide investigation nor will their contract clientthe client in questionbe notified of their input to the police capd said milo creative aura of prema and donny banfers chin vibrated so you know okay now you see what i mean you go to court much floyd the question threw banfer offbalance and he stiffened his arms when its necessary why just curious youre saying im longwinded would bore a jury dont worry i do just fine am i being a bit detailed maybe i am yes i am because i told jack and daisy id take care of it and darned if im going to go back to them and tell them i didnt theyre good folk which one are you related to banfer turned scarlet why would you assume that you seem unusually dedicated but sorry if i presumed let me assure you id do the same for any client lieutenant a beat but if you must know jack was married to my mothers sister and then she died and he married daisy so technically daisys my stepaunt but i think of her as my full aunt shes dear to me shes a dear woman she seemed very nice jacks nice too no doubt so do we have a deal that depends on what you have to offer i have the truth to offer lieutenant sturgismay i call you milo sure milo this can be extremely simple if we go the simplicity route i give you information and you use it as you see fit in your criminal investigation but you dont draw jack and daisy into it i have no desire to complicate their lives floyd but i need to be up front with you if theyve got crucial information it could find its way into the case file not true snapped banfer just call them confidential informants and everything will go smooth as silk i can do that but i cant promise that at some point a prosecutors not going to want to know their identity if that happens you say no it doesnt work that way floyd then we have a problem you may have all kinds of problems if jack and daisy dont cooperate floyd i dont need to tell you about all the unpleasant legal maneuvers at the das disposal ill fight each and every one that will toss jack and daisy right into the limelight banfer slanted forward walked faster milo said all this hassle just to make sure premadonny doesnt get mad at them its not a matter of mad said banfer its a matter of excommunication do you know how powerful those two are alist oh no no no banfers hand arced above his head like a kid playing airplane miles above alist its like pissing off the queen of en gland last i checked the queen hadnt excommunicated anyone floyd okay said the lawyer perhaps i engaged in a bit of hyperbole but still if word gets out that jack somehow violated a confidence the results could be professionally and financially devastating jack and daisy signed a gag clause banfer frowned standard operating procedure when dealing with clients at that level maybe so but we already know jack sent adriana betts to work at premadonnys compound and were fairly certain he did the same for a couple of other people who may be connected to adriana bettss murder did you read todays times of course said banfer thats why i called you the reporters itching for anything i can give her ive been holding her off but that could change youre threatening to leak my clients identities you called the meeting floyd im letting you know how things stand banfer clicked his teeth lieutenant sturgis he said as if hearing the title for the first time do you by chance have legal training ill take that as a compliment though im not sure i should the answer is just what ive learned on the job well youre a wily man milo not what id expect because frankly most of the cops i encounter arent what youd call intellectual giants you encounter a lot of cops i do my share of workers comp have represented several of your compatriots learned how they tick typically their longterm goals dont stretch beyond a brandnew motorcycle and a hawaiian vacation oh those crazy kids in blue it was meant as a compliment you seem different milo a careful planner accepted and appreciated floyd so what is it youd like to tell me in the hope that jack and daisy remain bulletproof banfer stopped took hold of the bulb at the end of his nose and twisted his breath had grown ragged he said lets sit down chapter beverly hills park benches are complex creations curvy and black and wrought iron with a center divider that makes it difficult for more than two people to sit milo motioned banfer to the left a flick of his head directed me to the right leaving him on his feet looming another homeless man shambled by eyes rolling stumbling banfer said thats probably where they got the idea for that picturedown and out in beverly hills they prettied it up but thats the industry okay back to business jack and daisy are wonderful people acknowledged floyd ethical people banfer corrected jack made some mistakes granted but the basic core is ethical so theres no reason for you to worry about them mistakes as in hiring adriana betts without vetting her banfer rubbed his temples facts can only tell you so much when youre dealing with human beings milo jacks come to trust his instincts and ms betts impressed him as a decent young woman i said plus it was an urgent situation banfer clicked his teeth again allegedly you have your doubts the origin of that supposition was a call jack received from another employee at the compound someone hed placed a while back shethere was an assertion that the clients needed additional child care as soon as possible jack was to come up with someone immediately this individual knew someone who fit the bill perfectlythe right training and experience jacks a peoplepleaser he got into the business to fill human need it seemed like an ideal arrangement milo said dont see a big problem there floyd if he had checked adriana out he wouldve learned she was squeakyclean banfer crossed his legs tugged a sock up a hairless shin well thats good to hear on the other hand floyd if the employee who recommended her was qeesha dembo that complicates matters im not familiar with that name how about charlene chambers nor that one milo produced the mug shot banfer sagged how do you know her floyd she represented herself to jack and daisy as simone chambord thats the name jack and daisy used to check her out and she came up spotless when was she hired twentythree months ago soon after leaving boise i said what was she hired for the question seemed to puzzle banfer child care of course he tapped the photo after you showed that to jack and he called me in a panic i took a closer look at her specifically i traced the social security number shed used when she applied for the job it matches a simone chambord all right but that person turns out to be an eightynineyearold woman living in a rest home in new orleans i called over there and the director informed me mrs chambord had advanced alzheimers had been that way for five years jack and daisys search didnt pull that up they were focused on relevant criteria criminal record poor credit good point i said advanced alzheimers would sure inhibit criminality banfer shook his head the potential ramifications for gold standard are obvious but no harm was intended milo said your clients provided a con artist as a nanny for movie stars kids did the same for a woman who ended up dead yeah id say those are ramifications thats a tiny proportion of all the wonderful people jack and daisy have connected with wonderful clients recited with all the conviction of a gulag loyalty pledge i said unfortunately youre only as good as your last picture banfer sighed ive advised jack to sit tight but obviously hes on pins and needles to make matters worse daisy knew nothing about any of this milo said unhappy wife unhappy life its a mess all right by the way i did check out ms bettss social security and it comes back to her have i missed something because she and chambord seem an unlikely pairing milo said nothing crooked has turned up on adriana that baby found at the parkthose boneswhats the connection dont know yet floyd thats why we wanted to talk to jack and daisy well they certainly cant tell you anything about that qeeshasimonewas hired twentythree months ago what about adriana recently around three four months ago according to jack he cant be more precise banfer stared straight ahead milo said he destroyed the files i cant get into that your client got rid of potential evidence if you advised him to do that you could be facing obstruction charges same answer im afraid banfer turned to milo milo glared and banfer faced forward again lets put this in context ive been more forthcoming than i need to be given the circumstances what circumstances are those floyd no charges have been filed against anyone youre at the supposition stage fishing around and neither i nor my client is obligated to talk to you about anything however we chose to cooperate volitionally because were not obstructionistic and in terms of files im unaware of any statute requiring a small businessman to cope with needless paper buildup fair enough said milo sudden switch to an easy amiable tone banfer risked another try at eye contact milo smiled well said the attorney its good to see weve reached a meeting of the minds i agree now how about we talk to jack directly you feel thats necessary wouldnt ask if i didnt floyd banfer sighed again punched numbers on his cell phone hey its me as well as can be expected i told them that they still want to talk to you ill stay right here not to worry might as well youve got nothing to hide sooners better than later jack lets get it over with and move on were on the parkway between beverly and camden good idea clicking off he studied the traffic on his way jack weathers wore a blue cashmere blazer a white silk shirt dovecolored slacks blue suede loafers with gold buckles if they recast gilligans island hed be great for thurston howell the third except for the defeated sagging shoulders the bags under his eyes the wrinkles that had deepened during the twentyfour hours since wed last seen him the shuffling gait of an old weary man i got up and vacated the space next to banfer weathers hesitated milo said take a load off jack weatherss jowls quivered pink capillaries laced the whites of his eyes a couple of cuticles were rubbed raw detracting from an otherwise perfect manicure he sat down heavily and banfer filled him in on what we knew when banfer wanted to he could be concise jack weathers laced his hands together stared at his knees milo said tell me everything you remember about the woman who called herself simone chambord whats her real name said weathers why dont you let me do the asking so you can do the answering weatherss head snapped back floyd banfer said lets keep it streamlined jack and theyll be out of your hair weathers said nothing the group of younger persian women returned his attention shifted to shapely rears and that seemed to relax him he said goodlooking girl black but lightish i figured her for a wannabe actress because of her looks that and she had a way about her what way was that jack vivacious said weathers theatrically vivacious like she was playing a role this town everyone plays a role what im getting at is everything was just a little bit exaggerated he studied milo youre kind of centralcasting yourself so you figured simone for a wannabe but she had the right credentials for the childcare job experience letters of reference from who previous employers how about some names dont recall said weathers how about checking the file no file weathers colored we turn everything over regularly paper buildup floyd banfer rubbed one leg against the other jack weathers said exactly okay said milo but when she applied you mustve called her references any memories of who they were and what they told you nah ive got so many applications nothing stands out business is good can be said weathers all i can tell you is she checked out wannabe actress said milo guess you see a lot of that i go in assuming the real agenda is advancing their careers or so they believe milo said doesnt work that way works against them whys that because once someones seen as being in a service position they tend to be always seen that way theyre viewed as inferior not inferior said weathers different donny rader started off as a golf caddie and houseboy for a producer thats the official story not true weathers sneered i dont know whats true whats not i dont know anyones narrative floyd banfer said its all a matter of information control we hear what they want us to hear stars said milo anyone in power i said so you have no problem hiring wannabes jack weathers said not if they learn their proper place and do the damn job did simone chambord learn never heard about problems far as you know shes still working for premadonny id assume what else do you remember about her goodlooking said weathers extremely attractive in that fresh way great figure she could carry on a conversation said she loved kids showed me a childdevelopment book she was reading she was hired as a nanny no said weathers as a childcare assistant whats the difference pay scale for starts when the client insists on an official nanny we hire british girls who take formal training at one of the schools they have over there theyve got the book learning but some of them can be a little uptight some clients like that others want something more relaxed prema moon and donny rader have a relaxed attitude id assume how many other people have you sent to them couldnt say said weathers milo said wild guess weathers looked at banfer banfer nodded wild guess id say half a dozen what jobs did you fill for them i believe there were a couple of domestics housekeepers we dont do that anymore cant compete with the domesticspecialty agencies all those ads they run in the spanish papers but back then we did so probably thats it couple of domestics he turned to banfer this is okay so far jack milo said youre worried about premadonnys gag clause hell yeah said weathers were talking damn stringent as opposed to banfer said clauses that are less stringent he smiled at his own obfuscation milo said educate me counselor its nothing complicated milo default is generally a ban on talking to the media publishing a book that kind of thing this particular clause covers virtually every single syllable uttered about premadonny to anyone on any topic is it legally binding probably not but testing that theory would bring considerable anguish in any event jacks told you everything he knows about the chambord woman and ms betts then on to the next topic said milo pulling out the enlargement of melvin jaron wedds dmv photo floyd banfers face remained blank jack weathers said oh shit chapter floyd banfer placed a hand on jack weatherss cashmere sleeve hes also one of yours milo said who is he jack weathers wrung his hands a guy mj milo said melvin jaron wedd when did you place him at the compound weathers muttered something speak up jack three years ago give or take whats his job title estate manager said weathers id placed him before similar thing whose estate did he manage before saudi family gigantic place in bel air four five years ago and before then no that was the first they had no problems with himthe arabs they moved back to riyadh so you sent him to premadonny yeah yeah who solicited your help business manager whos that weatherss eyes traveled to the right not the manager directly some assistant floyd banfer said or some assistants assistant weathers regarded his nephew crossly thats the way it goes with people at their level milo said whos their business manager apex management they handle a lot of the biggies what do you remember about mj a guy said weathers i think he had some bookkeeping experience him i did check out whats the problem with him maybe nothing jack maybe nothing but youre carrying around his picture his name came up meaning his name came up weathers waved a hand frankly i dont want to know now can i go and try to pay some bills im no civil servant got no cushy pension and overtime milo said sure have a nice day sure unless youve got something more to tell us jack ive got nothing to tell or to hide or to relate or report im in the service business i find service people for clients who need service what they do once theyre hired is their business bracing himself on the benchs center divider he got to his feet buttoned his blazer banfer stood and took him by the elbow weathers shook off the support with surprising fury not ready for a scooter yet floyd lets get breakfast nate n al bagel nosh whatever working hard at casual banfer tapped his rolex oyster sorry appointments busy guy said weathers everyones busy i should be busy he hobbled away banfer said his blood pressures not great i hope the stress doesnt cause problems milo winked that sounds like prep for a civil suit not funny lieutenant are we through before waiting for an answer banfer headed east on the parkway a curvaceous female jogger came heading his way he didnt bother to look milo sat down on the bench i drove by that private road this morning like i thought tough surveillance the county registered the compound as eleven acres divided into three legal parcels all registered to another holding company called prime mayfair tried a traceback it deadends at a paperpusher who works for apex management i said a lot of plot to thicken he looked up apexs number got transferred a few times hung up shaking his head got stonewalled by an assistants assistants walkingaroundguys gophers peons underling slave not that anyone would tell me anything even if i could get through weatherss destroying his files doesnt help want to take bets hell be torching wedds soon as he gets back from breakfast and for all the tough talk to banfer theres nothing i can really do about it at least youve got confirmation that all three of them worked together he kicked a leg of the bench unfolded wedds dmv shot and stared at it for a while i need facetime with this prince but getting into that compounds as likely as being invited to an oscar after party he smiled actually rick was invited to one a few years ago after sewing up the dui daughter of some hoohah producer who drove her aston into a wall did you go nah both of us were on call that night okay ill figure out a way to watch the place after i recanvass the park see if the staff or the regulars remember anything he checked with reed and binchy to learn if kelly lemasterss story had pulled up anything solid it hadnt same for the anonymous crime stoppers line i said breakfast nate n al bagel nosh no thanks already ate prior meals had never deterred him before i said hope you feel better back home i put in a call to dr leonard coates len and i were classmates in grad school worked together for a year at western pediatric i stuck around at the hospital putting in time on the cancer wards while len shifted to a beverly hills private practice soon after hiring a publicist len began getting quoted in the popular press it didnt take long to acquire a celebrity patient load and a few years in hed taken over the penthouse floor of a building on roxbury was overseeing half a dozen associates while suffering from a serious case of hollywood sepsis its a progressive condition also known as malignant lookatme syndrome leading to excessive dependency on public exposure selfinvention and the narcosis of fame lens addiction had led him to write a useless poppsych book peddle countless treatments for screenplays and reality shows obsess on getting his picture taken at certain parties in the company of eye candy tall and slim and meticulously bearded he plowed through a succession of women id stopped counting his marriages at four he had two kids that i knew of and the few times i saw them they both looked depressed the last time len and i had run into each other was at a hospital fundraiser smiling all the while and checking out the crowd nonstop hed spent a lot of time griping about ungrateful brats just like their mothers you cant fight genetics his service operator put me on hold the audio track was a sales pitch for dr coatess compelling new book putting your life in balance the operator broke back in as a synopsis of chapter was ending the gist was stop and smell the roses id never known len to have a hobby she said sorry doctors unavailable but hell get the message i said hows the book doing pardon dr coatess new book she laughed i just sit here in a small room and answer the phone last thing i read was a utility bill to my surprise len called my private line nine minutes later hey alex great to hear from you hows life treating you i said well len you offthechart busy it never stops but whats the alternative stagnation were like sharks right we need to keep moving congratulations on the book oh you heard the tape well see how it does i calculated my hourly fee writing it somewhere south of ten bucks an hour but my agent claims its a steppingstone shes been getting nibbles for a talk show says ive got more peoplewarmth than youknowwho so maybe whats up what do you know about prema moon and donny rader a beat may i ask why youd care about people like that hollywood types shallow types he said thats my bailiwick youre not going to encroach on my territory are you alex he laughed just kidding you want em theyre yours though you have to admit im better suited to that kind of thing because we both know im about as deep as a rain puddle in august you on the other hand please dont tell me youve sold out alexander ive always thought of you as my positive role model guffaws rich loud audiofriendly youre selling yourself short len not in the least know thyself is my first commandment meanwhile i just bought myself a

undereducated so they never know anything i had oneobviously i wont tell you her namewho came in to talk to one of my staff about a problem kid but only after she was turned down by the dog whisperer whyd she go to him first probably to get on tv but the reason she gave us was all animals are the same right it just takes the proper vibrations to make everything perfect i laughed sure its funny

run things no she sounds like the perfect political spouse ha there it isthat acid wit alexander occasionally allows himself to indulge in i used to dig when you did that in school made me feel better about my own uncharitable cognitions i used to dig our time in school period western peds too alex they worked us like galley slaves but we knew we were doing good every day and it was exciting right we never knew what each day would bring thats for sure like the time we were trying to have lunch i remember like it was yesterday weve got our tuna salad and our coffee on our trays are about to finally take ten minutes and you get paged and this look comes over your face and you just leave later i run into you and you tell me some patients father brought a gun onto the onco ward you spent an hour talking him down good times i said they were man especially cause i ate your tuna he laughed imagine that todayshrink gets a call handles it finito nowadays thered be a mass panic some gross overreaction due to protocol and someone would probably get hurt i did some of that shit myself when i was there alex crisis interventions no one heard about because they were successful those were great times they were len but get real and move on huh i do love my r how many miles on the caddy lost count by the third engine beyond loyal were talking commitment well good for you and great to hear from you friend we need to do lunch chapter i trolled gossip sites and the links they sent me to for personal sightings of prema moon andor donny rader theyd been highly visible until four five years ago showing up at clubs screenings premieres charity events shopping sprees audiences with heads of state but the two hits i found covering the last eighteen months featured prema only both times in la world affairs council symposium on african famine banish hunger luncheon where the actress received an award time to give my personal conduit to glitzworld another try robin was sweeping her workbench pads for applying french polish sat in a wastebasket the flamenco guitar hung drying gorgeous you can testdrive it for me in a couple of days perks of the job i said do you still have a way of contacting paparazzi im sure some of my clients do could you call one of them looking for a lead on the staaahs i told her about the sudden drop in sightings burrowing because theyve gotten weird she said okay ill try zenith hes not so big anymore but he hangs with the biggies and his current flames that actress on the doctor show and shes always good for a cleavage shot zenith streak ne james baxter professed ignorance of all that bullshit but he connected her to his publicist who punted to another rock stars personal manager it took three additional calls before she obtained the number of a paparazzo named ali whom she sweettalked before passing the phone to me i introduced myself he said hey dog whusup in a middle eastern accent havent seen much on premadonny lately his voice climbed three notes up the scale whu you know em no i was just wondering why aw man so why you they pissing me off man why whu you think for not being know muh saying no more photo ops got to eat dog they the meat dog we don hassle em we they friends with the lens so no idea why they used to be man like a clock we getting the call they there smiling waving smiling waving we shooting and booting and sending then we spending they orchestrated everything huh it was all prearranged sure man what you think you ever get pictures of their kids nah just them pissing me off know what a baby brings hot tot shots the mostest lot any idea why they dont call anymore they crazy how so they not callin they crazy you not there no one care so what youre like a music persons sinificant other yup you know katy sorry no taylor no adam justinyou know even christina thats coolhow bow bono you know anyone i slip you a share of whats there sorry you don know no one dog i chose to answer philosophically not really then we done robin said so they really are playing ground squirrel her smile was sudden mischievous or theyve just opted for the simple life i said growing their own vegetables and raising hyperintellectual organic cattle for the milk she said dont forget handstitched hemp duds we both laughed i tried to put my heart into it holly ruche had phoned while i was in the studio i called her back figuring singlesession euphoria had faded the way it often does but when she answered her voice was fat with pleasure thanks so much dr delaware for what youve accomplished not sure what id done i said glad everythings going well everythings going great dr delaware matts talking really talking not just the hello how are you we used to do thats great holly turns out what he needed was for me to tell him i valued what he had to say because his parents discouraged talking his father actually used to say children should be seen not heard can you believe that anyway i did tell him it just opened him up me too about my issues and he was surprised to know how i felt about my mom which makes sense i never talked about her until you led me in the right path anyway matt listened nonjudgmental interested then he told me more about his childhood then we everything kind of kicked up to a new level im feeling in control like i really own this pregnancy own my entire life thats terrific holly couldnt have done it without you dr delaware my line of work things like praise from patients arent supposed to affect you because its all about healing them not your ego to hell with that i take what i can get i really appreciate your telling me holly sure she said do you have another second whats up in terms of what happened to the baby im assuming they havent found anything out because i did read about that other poor little thing it made my heart ache i cried dr delaware sorry holly no progress yet something so long ago i imagine it would be difficult to solve and this probably wont help but that boxthe blue hospital box for some reason it bothered me someone putting a baby in something like that her voice caught this is going to sound weird but ive been going online and searching for something like it and finally i found it a box just like it at a collectibles site called oldstuffnet from the same hospitalswedish the seller calls it a bank box for depositing money she has others for sale from other hospitals i called her up and she told me back in the day they used metal boxes for extra security when they brought cash to the bank before the armored cars were safe enough so you could use bags interesting could it be important at this point any informations valuable great dr delaware then i feel good about all the time i spent online bye i logged onto the site identical blue box no additional wisdom robin knocked on my office door going to keep working for a while nah lets have some fun she looked at the screen i explained she said never thought of hospitals as cash businesses place was an abortion mill back when abortion was a felony illegal means high profit margins i logged off she said fun sounds okay utter lack of conviction i put my arm around her cmon lifes short lets own ours how about music sounds good let me check the catalina heres their calendar jane monheit like her she said if we can get tickets lets do it monheit was in fine voice backed by a band that never stopped swinging the food at the club was decent a couple of generous chivas pours went down well we got home and beelined to bed and afterward i plunged into sleep stayed out for an atypical seven hours woke up with an aching head that filled quickly with words and pictures when i got to my office my cell phone was beeping and my landline message machine was blinking a pair of calls less than a minute apart i punched play on the machine milos voice said found my boy wedd call sturgis congrats hear what i have to say first chapter melvin jaron wedd had been found in the passenger seat of his pimpedup black explorer single gunshot wound to his left temple the entry hole said largecaliber the stippling said up close and personal though probably not a contact wound brain matter clotted the back of his seat a baggie of weed sat between his splayed knees a glass bong glinted on the floor near his left shoe the impact had caused him to slide down leaving his corpse in an awkward semireclining state that wouldnt have been comfortable in life his mouth gaped his eyes were shut his bowels had emptied rot and insect activity said hed been there days rather than hours masked and gloved a ci named gloria was going through his pockets shed already procured his wallet pulled out a drivers license credit cards eighty bucks in cash milo didnt need any of that to know who the victim was a bolofind on wedds explorer had shown up in his office email shortly after six am hed been online an hour before eating futility for breakfast blood in the suv said the explorer was the murder scene the vehicle had been left at the rear of a construction site east of laurel canyon four hundred feet up a quiet street just north of the valley nice neighborhood a while back milo had caught a case not far from here a prep school teacher left in a bathtub packed with dry ice a large elaborate house had been framed up on the lot weathered wood marred by rust streaks below the nails said it had been a while since the project was active care had been taken to preserve the assortment of mature eucalyptus at the rear of the lot the trees hadnt been trimmed and some of their branches drooped to the ground and continued trailing along the dirt shaggy and green like oversized caterpillars the foliage had served to partially shield the explorer but if anyone had been working on the site theyd have noticed the vehicle immediately i said foreclosure milo said yup last year guy who found the body goes around checking out bankowned properties the former owners are a nice older couple from denver moved here to be with their grandkids tried to build their dream house got taxed out of their drycleaning business i had denver pd talk to them theyve never heard of wedd and they come up antisepticclean and there goes my case on adriana because ol melvin aint ever talking gloria called out his name we approached her tried to stand sufficiently back to avoid the wafting of death fumes this was in his jacket milo upper inside pocket she held out a matchbook white cover unmarked the kind you get with cigarettes at the liquor store milo said so he had a fuel source for his dope gloria opened the book no matches left just fuzzy stubs inside the books cover someone had scrawled in blue ballpoint tiny cramped cursive milo put on reading glasses gloved up took the book i read over his shoulder this is guilt gloria said can i theorize a little sure if wed found a gun id look at this as maybe a suicide note seeing as its clearly a homicide either your victim had remorse for something and wrote this himself or someone else thought he should pay for something have you checked his other pockets yet twice i even looked in his underwear she wrinkled her nose im dedicated up to a point any idea what mr wedd could be guilty of before this i had a few ideas he shook his head anything else the driversseat adjustment seems to roughly fit wedds height so either he was driving and moved to the passenger side or your offenders around the same size i guess the weed and the bong are meant to imply a drug party but with no matches in the book or anywhere else same for ashes or residue it looks staged to you that or there was an interruption before the party got going she said was wedd involved in that world not that i know said milo but i dont know much period he stepped away from the stench gloria and i followed she said ill do my best to rush dna on the bag and the pipe see if any chemistry other than his comes back you saw those prints the techies pulled from the car theyve already gone to the lab maybe youll get lucky he said thats my middle name lucky maybe a tow truck arrived to hook up the suv neighbors had begun to emerge and uniforms were doing their usual blankfaced centurion thing easing concerned citizens away from the scene with no thought to reassurance milo looked at the whitebagged body being gurneyed away melvin melvin melvin so now youre another victim to me all those women he had coming in and out there could be a horde of angry husbands boyfriends back at the corpse thanks a bundle for your dissolute lifestyle pal i said you see wedd getting into a car with an angry husband letting him drive someone with a gun sure or the offenders a jilted female hell hath no fury and all that tall girl plenty of those in socalwhat you dont like the jealousy angle its a common motive but you have a better idea i told him my growing suspicions about premadonny leaving out the possibility of a violent child he said creepyworld flourishes in coldwater canyon whats the motive for doing two maybe three employees alex theyre abusing their kids and bumping off the staff to keep them quiet put that way it sounds pretty weak no no i take every product of your fertile mind seriously it just came out of left field okay let me focus for a sec they bug you because they isolate their kids maybe they got tired of the hustle had enough dough said screw it i said that could be it but he said no buts gathering the flesh above his nose with two fingers he deepened the fissure that time and age had provided dealing with suspects like that god i hope youre wrong forget i brought it up his cell squawked tchaikovsky he said okay thanks dropped the phone back in his pocket prints from two individuals in the car wedds and an unknown contributor with no match to afis unknowns was on the drivers side of the center console wedds showed up on the trunk latch and the interior of the trunk to me that says our movie stars arent involved how so someone at that level chauffeuring the help more likely some disreputable who wedd pissed off did this not that it makes a difference in terms of adriana and the baby getting icier by the second he left me standing there headed toward the suv stopped returned that canceled appointment any hint about what kind of problem their kid was having the guy i spoke to wouldnt even tell me which kid it was okay theyre weirdly secretive maybe shitty parentsno shock given all the money no one getting told no but thats a long way from linking them to my murders and ive still got qeesha a confirmed criminal and likely a killer herself and wedd a guy who defrauded insurance and adriana who mightve had a secret life toss in ingredients like that and no telling whatll cook up i said felony gumbo you figure im in denial hell yeah sure i am but arent you the one says denial can be useful i love being quoted hey he said its either you or the bible and right now im not feeling sufficiently pious to invoke scripture cmon ill walk you to your car chapter obsessiveness and anxiety are traits that can clog up your life but the way i figure theyve got plenty of evolutionary value think of cavepeople surrounded by predators jumpy annoyingly picky oog sleeps fitfully because hes mindful of creatures that roar in the night more often than not he wakes up with a dry mouth and a pounding heart easygoing moog in contrast sinks easily into beautiful dreams one morning he fails to wake up at all because his hearts been chewed to hamburger and the rest of his innards have been served up as steaming mounds of carnivore candy the blessingcurse of an overly developed attention span helped me escape a family situation that wouldve continued to damage me and mightve ended up killing me since then overtheshoulder vigilance has saved my life more than once so ill sacrifice a bit of serenity milo was right denial could be the right way to go but this morning it felt wrong and i got home itching to focus an hour on the computer gave way to double that time on the phone my pitch grew better with repeated use but it proved useless then i switched gears and everything fell into place by four pm i was dressed in a steelgray italian suit opennecked white shirt brown loafers and hanging near the southwest corner of linden drive and wilshire busy stretch of impeccable beverly hills sidewalk easy to blend in with a light pedestrian parade as i repeated a twoblock circuit while pretending to windowshop the seville was parked in a bh city lot two hours gratis so shoppers could concentrate on consumer goods and cuisine i wasnt planning to buy anything i had something to sell or trade depending on how things worked out apex management was headquartered in a fortiesera threestory brick building that looked as if it had once housed doctors and dentists a few months ago id read about the beverly hills city council wanting to clamp down on medical offices because health care attracted hordes ofsurprise sick people who took up too many parking spaces and failed to spend like tourists entertainment ancillaries like apex on the other hand churned expense accounts at the citys truffledup eateries and attracted publicity magnets and the paparazzi and theres no such thing as bad publicity i was facing a collection of psychotically priced cashmere sweaters and wondering if the goats whod donated their hair were having a rough winter when the first human outflow emerged from behind apexs carved oak doors three men in their twenties and thirties then four more all wearing italian suits opennecked dress shirts and loafers industryancillary uniform which was the point next came a man and two women in tailored pantsuits followed by a pair of younger women similarly but less expensively attired those two let the door close on the next person out a tiredlooking older man in a green janitors uniform three minutes later the prey came into view tall late twenties crowned by a thick mop of blondstreaked light brown hair he wore blackframed geek eyeglasses that stretched wider than his pasty bony face in the firms christmas party photos hed worn wire rims hed also tended to pose standing slightly apart from his coworkers which had led me to hope he was a loner wish fulfilled all by himself and looking worn out and distracted the perfect quarry i watched him stop and fidget his suit was black with a pink pinstripe narrowlapelled snugly fitted cheaply cut when you got close as much hot glue as stitching in play a level two service assistants salary wouldnt cover highend threads i walked toward him noticed a loose thread curling from one shirt collar tsk tsk we were facetoface he was concentrating on the sidewalk didnt notice when my shadow intruded on his his head rose and he gave a start and tried to move past me i blocked him kevin do i know you no but you do know jaymar laboratory supplies huh i held my lapd consultant id badge close to my thigh raised it just enough so he had to strain to read the part i wasnt covering with my thumb showcasing the alwaysimpressive department seal while concealing my name and ambiguous title police i said could i have a moment of your time kevin his mouth opened wide so did the carved oak door ejecting more suits male and female a large group buoyant with liberation headed our way laughing raucously someone said hey kev the quarry waved i said i can show them the badge too his jaws clenched dont your call kev walking back to wilshire i returned to the sweater display kept my eye on him while pretending to study my cell phone coworkers coalesced around him a woman said something and pointed across wilshire smiling painfully he shook his head the group continued on merry as carolers crossing the boulevard they continued toward a restaurant on the ground floor of a blackglass office building el bandito grill a banner proclaimed happy hour not for kevin dubinsky as i waited for him he kicked one heel with the other contemplating an alternative failing to come up with one he removed his glasses and swung them at his side as pipestem legs propelled him toward me when he got close he mumbled whats going on i said how bout we walk while we chat chat about what or we could talk right here kevin i pulled out the photocopied order form jaymar laboratory supplies chula vista california five hundred dermestid beetles and a set of surgical tools including a bone saw purchased four months ago it had taken me a while to get the info call after futile call using the address of the compound off coldwater canyon the pitch im calling to renew an order for dermestid beetles no one knew what i was talking about then i realized id goofed bigtime people like that didnt do things for themselves after substituting apex managements shipping addressa warehouse in culver cityi had confirmation by the seventh call a nice clean fax of the form kevin dubinskys name at the bottom as purchaser facebook and linkedin supplied all i needed to know about him lets hear it for cybertruth he turned away from the order form so its my job exactly kev your jobs what we need to discuss why you buy flesheating insects and scalpels regularly i figured it was he shut his mouth it was what nothing flash of bitter smile im not paid to think are you paid not to think no answer what you take home kev you might want to reconsider your priorities theres a problem only if you dont cooperate with what better i ask the questions something bad happened i dont visit people to talk about jaywalking kev oh shitwhats going on like i said kev the less you know the better shit he licked his lips began walking east on wilshire i kept up with his long stride all those years with milo great practice i said tell me about it i dont remember specifics you buy what youre told all part of the job that is the job period service assistant yeah its stupid i know i need to eat okay you get a call to never a call always email buy me bugs i order all kinds of things thats what im paid to do you do all the purchasing for the premadonny compound no just head shake just things they dont want their name on silence wrong guess id try the same question later so how many times have you ordered beetles and knives just that once you didnt find it weird wondering wastes time busy guy i said they work you hard like i said i like to eat dont we all he stopped you dont get it i dont ask questions and im not allowed to answer any about anything ever thats rule number one numbers two through ten say refer back to one that sounds like something your boss told you no reply i said privacys a big deal for premadonny theyre all like that stars you can call em that what do you call em the gods his lips turned down a sneer full of reflexive disdain the same flavor of contempt id heard in len coatess voice perfect opening for me funny kev youd think theyd want nothing but attention they want it all right on their terms long slow intake of breath now im fucked i already said too much i said service assistant that could mean anything kevin dubinsky emitted a high coarse sound that didnt approach laughter it means fucking gopher know what they actually pay me not much less than that he laughed resisting the urge to pluck the loose thread from his collar i said thats the way the industry works the gods perch on olympus the peasants grovel better believe it so no sense getting screwed on their account kevin i like to eat man im discreet tell me about the job whats to tell i order stuff more eye movement time to revisit his first evasion i said not for the entire compound he gnawed his lip eventually were going to find out kevin no sense complicating your life by getting tagged as uncooperative please i cant help you whod you buy that crap for silence i said or maybe we should assume you bought it for your own personal use that could get really interesting her okay i only buy for her hes got his own slave whos that like i know i do what im told you buy stuff she doesnt want traced back to her i buy for her because she cant dirty her hands being a real person he laughed patted a trouser pocket i use a centuriona black cardjust for her swag get to pretend every day must get interesting nah it sucks boring purchases boring expensive purchases he mimed gagging himself with a finger i said you buy the stuff ships to culver city the paperwork gets filed somewhere else so if someone goes through her garbage they cant figure out what shes into maybe thats part of it he said i always figure its god forbid they do anything for themselves do you handle groceries and stuff like that nah that goes through her staff at the compound what do you buy special purchases meaning whatever she feels like we walked half a block before he stopped again drew me to another display window manikins whod have to plump up to be anorexic were draped in black crepe garments that might be coats blank white faces projected grief nothing like a funeral for selling product he said im going to tell you this so youll understand okay one timei dont know this personally i was told itthey actually set up a scene so she could fill her car up and look like a regular person they picked a gas station in brentwood apex paid to clear the place out for a day masked it off with those silver sheets photographers use so no one could see what was going on they gave her a car that wasnt hers something normal and she pretended to fill it up i said for one of those starsarejustlikeus deals another contemptuous look five takes for her to get the hang of putting gas in a fucking car she had no fucking clue unreal her life is unreal man so whatd she need those bugs for i smiled okay i get it shut up and cooperate do your purchases get audited every month a prick from accounting goes over every damn thing i charge a pencil that cant be explained my ass is grass a girl who used to work in the next cubicle she bought fori cant tell you whoshe got busted for a bottle of nail polish i said sucks so whats the most expensive item youve ever bought for her easy he said last year time share on a gulfstream five seven figures up front plus serious monthly maintenance she never uses it i whistled thats the point dude doing stuff no one else can do to show youre god one day im going to find a real job how long have you been at apex little over three years he said started out doing messenger shit which was basically bringing envelopes from one schmuck boss to another picking up lunch all kinds of scut when i signed up i figured it would be temporary so i could save up enough and go back to school what were you studying what do you think acting he chuckled they taught you to detect pretty good yeah i was like every fool comes to la thought because i was stanley in high school and my drama teacher loved me i could live atop olympus he shook his head my cribs a barfhole in reseda im barely getting by and now i got cops talking to me maybe its time to go back and study something real like real estate or online poker he reached for my sleeve retracted his hand before making contact please dont screw me dude all i did was what i was told if thats true i dont see you as having any liability kevin i dont mean problems with you i mean the job rule one ill do my best to keep you out of it the way you said that scares me why it could mean anything what it means kev is that we need each other how you dont want me talking about you and my bosses cant afford you telling anyone about this meeting because theres an ongoing investigation no prob i wont say a word then were cool i held out my hand we shook his skin was clammy thanks for talking to me kev believe me my yap is permanently shut but can i ask one thing just for my own sake what did she do something bad with that shit i figured it was for the kids some sort of science project you know shes always getting stuff for the kids i said ever hear of the lacey act no whats that protection for endangered species thats what this is about those stupid bugs were illegal protected i ran a finger across my lips like this communication have a nice day kevin ill try he said getting harder but ill try chapter the morning after meeting kevin dubinsky i dressed in sweatpants a tshirt running shoes and a dodgers cap was ready to leave by eight blanche figuring it was time for a stroll bounced up to me and smiled i said sorry honey fetched her a consolation strip of bacon that she regarded with sad eyes before deigning to nibble carried her to robins studio and left the house i drove up beverly glen turned right at mulholland passing the fire station near benedict canyon stopping once to pick up a nicesized branch that had fallen off an ancient sycamore sailing through pretty dewlivened hills i reached the coldwater canyon intersection across from treepeople headquarters a little more than half a mile south of the private road that led to the premadonny compound i drove two miles north of the property found a patch of turnoff not meant for longterm stay left the car there anyway stick in hand i returned south on foot crows squawked squirrels chittered all kinds of animal noises became evident once you listened i spotted a deer munching dry grass then speeding toward a mcmansion that blocked far too much canyon view came upon the desiccated remains of a gorgeous redandyellowbanded king snake juvenile from the size of it no signs of violence to the little reptile sometimes things just died i kept going using the branch for a walking stick that i hoped would imply habitual hiker nice day to be out walking if you ignored the occasional car roaring toward you oblivious or hostile to the concept of foot travel fools texting and phoneyakking and a notable cretin shaving his face made the journey an interesting challenge more than once i had to press myself against a hillside to avoid being pulverized i kept up a steady pace tapped a rhythm with the stick pretended to be caught up in pedestrian zen in la that makes you strange in la people ignore strange when i reached my destination i found a treeshielded spot across the road and had a look at the entry to the compound a discreet sign warned against trespassing an electric gate ten or so yards up blocked entry the road to that barrier was a single lane of agegrayed asphalt in need of patching shaded by bay laurels and untrimmed ficus a stray plastic cup lid glinted from the shrubbery appropriately secluded but a little on the shabby side not a hint this was buckingham west i continued walking searched for police surveillance none that i could see maybe milo hadnt gotten around to arranging it i hadnt heard from him since the meet at melvin wedds crime scene probably inspecting wedds apartment locating next of kin all that logical detective procedure correspondence with wedds family would be an exercise in deception prying out dirt about a victimpossible suspect under the guise of consolation milo was good at that id seen him pull it off plenty of times later hed mutter about the power of positive hypocrisy i covered another mile reversed direction took a second look at the access road to the compound repeated the process several times never encountering another person on foot they say walkings the best exercise if we had time to do enough of it we wouldnt need to jog or run or tussle with implements of gymtorture by the time i got back in the seville my feet were starting to protest and i guessed id covered at least ten miles it had been a learning experience body and mind when i was minutes from home robin called guess what brents back in town cant wait to talk to you eager to do his civic duty she laughed more like his uncivil duty he hates them alex quote unquote hes lunching guess where spago grill on the alley karma huh last time i was there the company was a whole lot cuter but nowhere near this informative baby good luck the grill bustles pleasantly at dinnertime during lunch it roars filling up with industry testosterone every power booth occupied by movers and shakers and those too rich to bother doing either each bar stool is occupied but no one gets drunk platters of food are transported smoothly by an army of whitejacketed waiters whove seen it all sometimes tourists and others naive enough to venture in without a reservation bunch up at the door like immigrants seeking asylum a trio of hosts seems genuinely remorseful when they reject the unschooled my hiking duds were far below the sartorial standard but youd never know it from the smile of the woman behind the lectern may i help you im meeting brent dorf certainly she beckoned a waiter with an eyebrow lift and he led me to a table on the south side of the restaurant concealed by the center partition far from the seeandbeseen brents clout was beta he was hunched over a caesar salad forking quickly as if he needed to be somewhere else yesterday when he saw me he didnt stop eating a millimeter of white wine remained in his glass the waiter said cocktail or chardonnay like mr dorf and handed me a menu i said iced teas fine ill also have a caesar no croutons dressing on the side like mr dorf dressing and croutons are fine anchovies too the waiter smiled approvingly as if someone finally had the sense to do it right brent said lay on the calories and the sodium easy for you skinny folk he was thinner than me had the wrinkles and sunken cheeks to show for it his head was shaved his oblong hounddog face had been barbered so closely that i wondered about electrolysis last time id seen him hed been thirty pounds heavier and sported a soul patch i said youre not exactly obese brent good tailoring you dont want to see me naked he looked at the ramekin of salad dressing at his right elbow considered his options pushed it away im under pressure my friend tough job not that pressure body pressure honestly you look good brent yeah yeah everythings relative he said got myself a twentyeightyearold dancer with statueofdavid definition im talking physical perfection he sighed todd claims he loves me but we both know hes out for the good life by both of us i dont mean him and me i mean you and me seeing as youre a mental health sage my tea came brent said hows your gorgeous other terrific robin robin he said i always thought she was special a knockout who knows how to use power tools sexy no argument brent his eyelids descended half hooding irises the color of silt he looked around the room bent closer lowered his voice so you want to know about lancelot and guinevere anything you can tell me funny he said i figured you could tell me whys that because i sent them to you referred them figured by now youd have all the insights that was you i said they canceled never saw them figures he said theyre big on that canceling reneging his hand tensed gave a small wave and brushed against his glass knocking it over the minuscule amount of wine was no threat as it dribbled to the tablecloth but he flung himself back as if escaping an avalanche highstrung type when the waiter came over to help he barked im fine just bring his food yes sir i drank tea as brent checked out the adjoining booths no one paid attention to his scrutiny so they never showed up he said well they fucked me over bigtime thats why im happy to give you dirt but first tell me why you need to know about them cant cant sorry thats all i can say brent ooooh big giant police mystery got to be juicy if that cop has you on it he winked another oj thing blake something better not even close i was hoping youd get me closer i do the giving you do the taking he laughed so youve met todd my salad arrived brent lifted an anchovy from my plate chewed swallowed blood pressures probably through the roof now but yummy so howd you come to refer them to me i was doing a deal and the issue came up i think kidshrink i think you what kind of problem were they having how should i know i never talked to them your people set it up with their people then you took lunch ha ha ha as a matter of fact yes thats what happened but highlevel people people authorized to make decisions we were at that stage by then i thought i had the deal nailed an index finger massaged the empty wineglass reassuring himself he was steady he said my house has a wine cellar ive got twelve hundred bottles more than ill be able to drink and todd doesnt touch alcohol embarrassment of riches yeah anyway thats it someone asked about a therapist i said i knew someone they asked for a child therapist specifically hmm he said i think sothis was what two years ago just about his eyes drifted toward the bar followed the entry of four men in suits and opennecked shirts and loafers he started to wave stopped when they failed to notice him or ignored him they continued to a corner booth he finished his wine i said no hint about what the problem was ri ight still checking out the room i ate salad as he gave the anchovies an occasional lustful look i need to be honest alex it wasnt something i thought much about i was concentrating on the deal besides i get that kind of thing all the time requests for referrals doctors dentists chiropractors masseuses all part of the job knowing the right people knowing the right matches who fits with who i figured youd be okay for them because you have all the right paper probably wouldnt fuck up i smiled thanks for the endorsement brent they canceled huh so what else is new whyd they bail on your deal not my deal a deal between titans im talking aest of the alist something that couldve been huge i set it up elegantly if it had gone through id never have to think about anything for the rest of my life blockbuster blockbuster times a quintzillion alex im talking action romance long and short arcs merchandising potential up the wazz sequels that wouldve gone on for infinity im talking the biggest thing theyd do together waaaay bigger than passion power and that piece of shit pulled in heavy eight figures with overseas distribution the upside wouldve been astronomical more important i staked my word on it staked my fucking soul everything was in place contracts drawn clauses hammered out legal fees alone cost more than entire pictures used to rack up we were set up for a signing going to make a big thing about it press conference photo ops the day before they change their mind how come people like that have to give a reason his fist hit the table the wineglass bounced he caught it gotcha you little bastard beckoning the waiter he brandished the glass take this away its annoying yes sir flecks of foam had collected at the corners of brents mouth he made claws out of his hands scratched air i put everything into it alex hadnt taken on another client the entire year and im talking names people pissed off at me everything else came my way i delegated to other agents at the firm so of course my alleged friends and colleagues held on to everything after i got after the deal got murdered and i had nothing was starting from fucking scratch and my credibilitys worse than a politician everything changed i got moved to a new office want to take odds it was bigger dont long sigh but im getting back to a good place in my life every days progress he shoved his plate to the side the deal was perfection every meeting was perfection and for a bullshit reason like that give me a fucking break i said thought they didnt give you a reason i said that i never said that what i said was people like that dont have to have a reason yeah they gave an excuse family matters and thats after i referred them to you so what the fuck was their problem his eyelids dropped farther heres a confession alex for a while i got paranoid about you did they go see you and you laid some shrink crap on themspend more time with the kids whateverand thats what fucked things up for a while i had thoughts about you then i realized i was getting psycho if i didnt watch out id go totally psycho he reached across patted my wrist i have to be honest thats one reason i wanted to meet with you to find out what the fuck happened so now i find out you dont know what the fuck happened and youre asking me what the fuck happened funny ironic ha ha ha and theyre in some kind of trouble good im happy they should rot in hell what kind of people are they what kind do you think selfish narcissistic inconsiderate hes an idiot shes a controlling bitch you buy that super momsuper dad crap its just part of the facade everything about people like that is a facade you ever hear him talk dluh dluh dluh dluh thats what passes for james dean now welcome to my world the waiter came over anything else gents coffee brent said no check i paid brent said good man chapter i reached milo at the coroners just watched a slug get pulled out of wedds head a weapon ever shows up its early christmas his apartment was vacant except for a mattress on the bedroom floor and some overthecounter pharmaceuticals in the john he used to get heartburn and headaches now hes passed both along to me had the place dusted sent the meds and the mattress to the lab located one relative wedds brother cowboytype in montana where wedds originally from no contact with brother mel for years was appropriately shocked about the murder said mel was always the wild one but he never figured it would get that bad he paused for breath i said wild but no criminal record minorleague stuff when he was youngjoyriding malicious pranks neighborhood mischief a few fights no criminal record because the sheriff was his uncle hed bring mel home and mels dad would whup him then mel got bigger than dad and the parents basically gave up when did he come to la ten years ago brothers had no contact with him since he wasnt surprised to know mel had gone hollywood said the only thing mel liked in high school was theater arts he was always getting starring roles could sing like hank williams do impressions john wayne clint eastwood you name it ive got something you might even think of it as progress i told him about the order from jaymar lab my talks with kevin dubinsky and brent dorf leaving out len coates because everything he knew was secondhand milo said knives and beetles her purchased right around the time the baby was born poor little thing mightve been targeted in utero i need to digest this got time my office an hour midway through the drive to the station i got a call from len alex i cant tell you where i got this so dont ask okay okay the client we discussed did in fact opt for a therapist other than yourself but the contact was limited to a single visit so obviously there was some serious resistance going on dont take it personally thanks for the reassurance len well he said we have feelings too no one likes to be passed over agreed one visit for what he cleared his throat heres what i can tell you please dont ask for more client shows up late cant seem to articulate a good reason for being there leaves before the session is over i said trouble focusing thinking of donny raders voice on the line his reputation as a barely literate dullard then len slipped and changed all that she there was a lot of generalized anxiety no ability to explicate basically it amounted to nothing alex so i dont see anything you can do with it she im sure youre right len thanks law enforcement issues notwithstanding alex none of this can ever be repeated to anyone i get it len you have my word good you still taking patients infrequently im asking because sometimes i get runover good cases not bullshit ones things get crazybusy i could use backup beyond your associates theyre kids alex were vets you interested something shortterm in a pinch i might be able to help pretty busy yourself it can get that way playing sherlock huh ever think of selling yourself to tv make a good series not really no interest at all i like the quiet life think about it anyway id produce in a heartbeat and dont be a stranger i continued toward the station thought about donny rader setting up an appointment prema moon showing up late and leaving early unable to explain what she was after a couple of nervous caring parents that didnt fit with the notion of coldblooded baby killers something was off i was struggling with that when milo rang in almost there i said change of plans he laid them out i got on the freeway sped downtown chapter the chief had opted to hide in plain sight designating the meet at number one fortune dim sum palace one of those arenasized places in chinatown that still feature gluey chop suey oildrenched moo goo gai pan and seafood of mysterious origin the air was humid with steam sweat and msg linoleum floors had been pounded dull by decades of feet the walls were red green more red raised panels embossed with gold dragon medallions and outsized renderings of birds fish and bats chinese lettering might have meant something hundreds of lunchers were crammed into vaultlike dining rooms tended by ancient waiters in black poly mao suits and tasseled gold beanies who moved as if running for their lives enough clatter and din to make the grill seem like a monastery if there was a caste system behind this seating scheme i couldnt decipher it and when milo asked to be directed to the chiefs table the stunning hostess looked at him as if he was stupid we dont take reservations and we have eight rooms we set out on the hunt finally spotted him at a smallish table near the center of the sixth room surrounded by hordes engrossed in their food no one paying attention to the whitehaired mustachioed man in the black shadowstripe suit white silk tabcollar shirt grayyellowscarlet leonard tie that screamed more is more he saw us when we were thirty feet away looked up from chopsticking noodles into his mouth wiped his mouth and drank from a glass of dark beer i looked around for his bodyguards spotted a pair of coldeyed burlies four tables over pretending to concentrate on a platter of something brown sit down i ordered spareribs pepper steak shrimpfried rice and some sort of deepfried chicken thing hopefully they wont include the damn feet glancing at milo you i know will eat anything to me that sound suitable for your constitution sure easy to please today doc strange phase of the moon hed been trying to hire me fulltime for years had never accepted failure with anything approaching good nature he returned to eating chopsticks whirling like darning needles excellent finemotor coordination motivated a huge load of noodles under the mustache he chewed had more beer looked around damn barn one of the old waiters brought tea and beer and sped away the chief said you stirred up a hornets nest doctor keeps life interesting maybe yours okay give me a brief summary and i mean brief you not sturgis he already went over the basics when he called and made my life complicated i said at least three people who lived at premadonnys compound have been murdered three he said ive got the nanny and the guywedd the baby found in the park that he said all right go on why do you suspect dark events at xanadu a couple of years ago i received a call from a man i believe to be donny rader requesting help why do you think it was him the way he spoke like a moron indistinctly i said okay he needed a shrink for a brat hes an actor big surprise what else i set up an appointment that was canceled i didnt think much of it but the death of one maybe two childcare workers got me wondering about the family situation and i tried to learn as much as i could that turned out to be next to nothing because the familys basically gone underground moon and rader used to be ultrapublic figures they peddled their fame now theyve disappeared no venturing out in public no chatter on the web and right around the time i got that call they abruptly canceled a major film project due to family issues maybe they didnt like the script the waiter returned platters were slammed down unceremoniously the chief said so theyre miserable maladjusts so what my experience is that extremely isolated families are often breeding grounds for psychopathology three people with connections to them are dead somethings going on there sounds like youve got nothing doc until recently i wouldve agreed with you then i learned that prema moon purchased flesheating beetles and surgical tools right around the time the baby was born show me the proof i produced the form from jaymar began explaining the purchasing process he cut me off theyve got peons to wipe their asses for them another big shock he put on glasses read frowned slid the form into an inner jacket pocket milo said only thing missing sir is beeswax if we can get access to the rest of their the chief waved him quiet beetles crazy bitch how exactly did you get hold of the form doctor i called supply houses pretending to be someone from apex said i wanted to renew the order eventually i found the right one planning on billing the department for your time hadnt thought about it you just do this for fun huh im a curious guy how long did it take you to find the right company a few hours youre a persistent bastard arent you i can be deceptive too no telling how thatll play into the hands of some nuclearpowered lawyer if youre deemed a police agent it could open up claims of insufficient grounds hence illegal search which is probably bullshit but with judges you never know if youre deemed to be a civilian it could open you up to some ballsqueezing crossexamination not to mention an invasionofprivacy suit by people who can buy and sell you a thousand times over that happens forget any chance of a quiet life for the foreseeable future these people are like governments they go to war you willing to take that risk i said sounds like youre trying to discourage me he put his chopsticks down i think longterm alex first time hed used my name that separates me from ninetynine percent of the population even at harvard he loved putting down the ivy league rarely missed the opportunity to bring up his graduate degree from the iviest of all i said you think i was wrong to dig up the information i think this could get nasty what happened to that baby was beyond nasty he glared i got a white knight here lifting a sparerib with his fingers he chewed down to the bone ingesting meat gristle and fat take one sturgis you not stuffing your face scares me its like the sun stopping midorbit milo spooned some fried rice onto his plate the chief said not into ribs today lieutenant this is fine sir the chief smirked establishing your independence that makes you feel like a grownup be my guest to me this is a mess he reached for the plate another rib got gnawed to the bone i said another thing i did another thing jesus almighty you figure youre running your own investigation his eyes shifted to milo milos head was down as he shoveled rice into his maw the chief turned back to me what i told him about the mornings hike none of the principals entered or exited the compound but i did learn that its a pretty busy place in the space of three hours i saw a sevenman groundskeeping crew a grocery delivery a repairman from a hometheater outfit and a plumber i copied down the tags why i figured it might offer a possible way to get in sturgis pretends to be a gardener or a plumber habla espanol sturgis know how to unclog a sink i do my father was a plumber i spent my summers elbowdeep in rich peoples muck you ever do that sturgis wade in rich folk shit milo said frequently sir dont like the job love it sir it is what it is the chief looked ready to spit don quixote and sancho panza so being a psychologist doc you figure a crafty way to gain entry would be to hitch a ride with one of the peasants who services the castle once youre inside you just mosey around at random in the hope of stumbling across definitive evidence i was hoping to catch moon rader or any of the kids leaving but when i saw the volume of traffic it occurred to me there might be an opening if moon or rader had left you figured to tail them discreetly his face darkened dr doalot you talk to animals as well if ive overstepped im sorry overstepped he laughed more like youve invented new dance moves what day does the garbage get taken out at that place milo said ill find out he walked to the dining room doorway talked on his cell the chief returned to his ribs tried some pepper steak pincergrasped a plump little pink shrimp out of the fried rice not hungry doc actually i am i tried a rib greasy and delicious just like you said the chief pardon youre like the damn ribs unhealthy but satisfying congratulations sturgis plodded along but youre the one who learned something he no need to defend him i know what he is hes good at what he does as good as im gonna get you on the other hand are a different animal you piss me off without trying you also make me wonder what the department would be like if everyone was supersmart and psychotically driven dont tell sturgis i said that youll hurt his feelings he and i ate in silence until milo returned garbage collections in two days sir be there before the trucks arrive sturgis wear comfortable clothes and bring enough empty barrels to haul away every bit of trash dont be noticed separate anything with dna potential and run a match to the baby bones maybe this qeesha character is still alive and shedding cells we find an eyebrow pencil a tampon whatever that links her to the bones were a step forward we also get an accurate victim count two not three and think of her as a homicidal bitch who killed her own kid milo said dna analysis could take a while ill speed it through to the max until then until then you and your geniuses try to do what the doctor an allegedly untrained civilian was apparently able to accomplish watch the goddamn place without being seen prema or donny or qeesha appear they get tailed with finesse seduction not rape sturgis got it sir milo started to rise where do you think youre going getting back to work this is work sturgis amusing the boss now dont let me down i want to see some calorie consumption chapter amusing the boss translated to a quarter hour of nearsilent scarfing the chief was a lean man but he had a staggering capacity for intake we watched him polish off the ribs and pick all the shrimp out of the rice before he shot a french cuff and smiled at his patek philippe on cue the burly duo got up and headed toward us the chief got to his feet buttoned his jacket he looked down at milo whos paying for this repast milo said if youd like just kidding sturgis i dont exploit the workingman or in your case doc the theorizing man he threw bills on the table stay as long as you like just be gone in ten minutes so you can resume what the city pays you for sturgis before his minions could reach him he racewalked out of the room milo looked at the pickedover rice would your hollywood buddies call that a good meeting my buddies contacts whatever well i said depends on whether the picture gets made we left the restaurant headed to a parking lot across hill street milo said he talked a good case but what i got out of it was lets stall whyd you call him i didnt i called maria she listened hung up two minutes later his secretary informs me where to go for lunch i said hes got to know he cant forestall the inevitable maybe but hell sure try so with prema getting the bugs and the tools whats our theory maybe competitive culling meaning one female eliminates anothers offspring in order to maintain dominance and eliminate competition for the desirable male big cats and primates do it all the time and where polygamy exists humans do it too donnys the babys daddy movie star attractive younger woman with a penchant for manipulation yeah thats a recipe so what donny was bigtime naughty with qeeshasimone whateverbut prema wants to hold on to him anyway prema wants to avoid public humiliation manipulation he said if its true think qeesha planned to get pregnant could be a baby with donny rader could kick up her lifestyle if she held on to her life i said maybe qeesha wanted more than generous child support maybe she thought she could actually replace the queen bee unfortunately for her the queen figured it out and took care of business that could explain why the bones were treated so cruelly deconstructing the competition reducing the problem to a lab specimen in a coldly efficient way it would also serve as a warning to donny look what im capable of when im threatened where does wedd fit in to me he still looks good as adrianas killer because even with doping her up i dont see prema managing to physically restrain another woman drive her to the park shoot her plus wedds car was spotted near the scene wedd couldve also dispatched qeeshatalk about your efficient estate manager but at some point he turned expendable queen bee tying up loose ends shes a tall woman i said might fit the seat position on the explorer getting wedd to drive her somewhere wouldnt be a problem attending to her needs was his job and the spot where he got shot isnt that far from the compound laurel up to mulholland hook west to coldwater drive a few miles for someone in good shape no challenge walking back shoot a guy mosey on home do pilates he said and maybe ditch the gun along the way he phoned sean binchy ordered him to search mulholland drive between laurel and coldwater for a i said qeesha was an experienced con had enough street smarts to pick up on any growing tension at the compound she called in adriana for support because she was unwilling to give up her dream figured if she could hold out until the baby was born donny would bond with his child and protect her he said buzz buzz buzz goes the queen bee and the drone wimps out we reached the seville he pointed to his unmarked several vehicles up the row off to garbage patrol when will you start the surveillance after the trash reap why im kind of into hiking i said for the exercise he looked at me free country hope you get good weather i was back on coldwater by nine the following morning had added a small backpack inside was a pair of miniature binoculars two bottles of water a few snacks being noticed wouldnt be a problem just the opposite but that was good i was now that guy who parked his cadillac on the turnoff and was foolish enough to brave oncoming traffic in the name of aerobics id also brought a companion blanche trotted along happily at the end of the short pink leash she favors when making personal appearances i made sure to keep her away from the road and she picked up the drill quickly heeling and adjusting herself to my pace breathing audibly but easily nothing like a dog to make you look harmless especially a small cute dog and theres nothing cuter than a french bulldog and no frenchie is more appealing than blanche still shes not a setter or a retriever and even with cool weather and ample hydration i knew my time would be limited by her stubby legs and her flat face my first sighting of the compound entrance was at nine eighteen sixteen minutes later i used my phone to record a delivery from an organic market on melrose eight minutes passed before the truck exited just before ten am a dry cleaner from beverly hills completed a similar circuit then nothing for the next half hour blanche and i settled in a shady safe spot up the road water for both of us i ate a powerbar and she made short but dainty work of a milkbone burped happily and grew entranced by flowers flies butterflies bees potato bugs a small plane that circled overhead for a few seconds we were back at ten fortyeight watching the entrance to the compound seconds later an unmarked white econoline van with blackened windows passed us rolling down from the east no livery number that i could see so not hired transport no id of any sort as it turned up the compound road i got my binocs out an arm shot out and punched the call button as the van idled i managed to make out the lettering around the licenseplate frame there was a phone number on the top slat home sweet home schooling on the bottom the gate swung open the van drove in i called home sweet homes number got voice mail for oxford educational services followed by a brief description of the mission statement specialized instruction and onsite learning experience provided by alumni of top universities designed to augment and enrich the educational experiences of homeschooled children did that include anatomy and forensic anthropology nine minutes after the oxford van had entered it drove back out headed south on coldwater one of the windows was half open i caught a flash of juvenile face before the glass slid back up onsite learning a field trip scooping blanche into my arms i ran back to the seville chapter i caught sight of the van descending coldwater a jaguar and a porsche traveled between us perfect cover as we crossed into beverly hills the cars kept going as the van turned right at beverly drive edging coldwater park and cruising slowly the park was small but well equipped with a shallow rockstream a playground and barbered grass toddlers frolicked mothers nurtured nice place for the youngest of the premadonny broodthe little blond girlto recreate the older kids would probably be bored then again these were children who rarely got out maybe swings and slides would be a big thrill the van made that moot by rolling past the park mansions gave way to small charming houses on narrow lots as the road grew dim under canopies of shaggy old trees potholes appeared the ambience was more funk than luxe not unlike the slice of beverly glen where i lived fifteen mph signs and speed bumps began to appear every few seconds no problem for the van it had been crawling at ten miles an hour came to a full stop at each bump i hung as far back as i could without losing visual contact allowed a gardeners truck to sandwich in the new convoy continued for another mile before the van veered right and the truck stayed on beverly drive now i knew our destination good clean fun for all ages franklin canyon park is a hidden slice of wilderness minutes from the selfconscious posing and the hypertensive drive of the city sixhundredplus acres of untamed chaparral skyscraper cedars pines and california oaks surround miles of hiking trails and a central hub bejeweled by a sunmirror lake a smaller pond is chock full with ducks and turtles and sunfish and minnows i knew franklin because i used to take my previous frenchie there when he grew restless a bully blackbrindle heathen named spike he loved to explore though his affinity for poultry made the duck pond a challenge packs of feral dogs were rumored to prowl the parks upper reaches but wed never seen them we did spot chipmunks squirrels the occasional laterising skunk lizards and snakes including a rattler or two that spike dismissed as unworthy of his attention a couple of times our presence provoked a chorus of ululation from distant coyotes it was all i could do to restrain spike from hunting down the uncouth intruders id never brought blanche to franklin canyon probably because shes so content with short strolls hanging with robin and consulting on clinical cases as i drove up the mile and a half of sinuous mountain road that led to the parks entrance she was sitting up alert head cocked quizzically first time for everything gorgeous space for cars was limited and once the van entered i could afford to hang back pulling over at the next turnoff i retrieved additional supplies from the sevilles backseat slipped them into my pack i rolled into the main lot a rectangle of dirt bordered by postandbeam fencing and surrounded by waisthigh native grasses no other vehicles in sight leashing blanche i put my pack on and began walking down an oaklined road one curve and there was the van right where id guessed just above the fenced hollow that contained the lake several yards above the pond at this hour not a lot of people around which i supposed was the point an attendant helped an old woman trudge along the pathway a few other dogwalkers strolled everyone smiled at blanche and a woman with a longhaired dachshund stopped to chat asking the usual caninerelated questions pleasant woman but the wiener dog wasnt nearly as amiable and it began to growl and chuff the woman said easy hansel blanche looked up at me with whatshisproblem curiosity hansel lunged bad boy said the woman with obvious insincerity the dachshund barked the woman smiled said my yours is quiet and walked on the perfect enabler my attention shifted to a spot up the road two people exiting the front of the van the first was the driver a softlooking fuzzbearded guy in his twenties wearing a blue shirt jeans and sneakers he placed a wheeled suitcase on the ground from the passenger side came a bespectacled curlyhaired woman around the same age garbed identically she carried a multicolored paisley bag heavy enough to require both hands the man slid open the vans rear door and extended his hand a dolllike asian girl accepted his help and descended truing the straps of her own pink backpack she wore a yellow tshirt lavender shorts bubblegumcolored running shoes topped by frilly socks long black hair was held in place by a silver band she began laughing as a younger asian boy leaped out landed on his feet and punched air his hair was spiked his backpack black dotted with white specks that were probably skulls a white tshirt billowed over green shorts worn long and baggy skaterdudestyle next came an older boy skinny smallish with skin the color of coal i knew he was thirteen but puberty hadnt arrived and his limbs were licorice sticks his purple shirt and yellow satin basketball shorts sported the lakers logo on his feet were black athletic shoes with silver trim kembara kylejacques kion the youngest boy tried to get kion sparring kion mussed his brothers hair waved his hands feinted back refused to take the bait kylejacques shouted aaaahyou die kion hooked thumbs to his chest flashed a whome grin kylejacques bounced turned to his sister began to harass her the same way she looked at him the way compassionate gods regard sinners he appeared to settle down then he leaped in the air and let out what the noninitiated would consider a martial arts yell landing offbalance he flailed stumbled back comically managed to stay on his feet the bearded man said good save kj kion and kembara laughed uncontrollably kylejacques scrunched his face jumped around stood still as if abruptly sedated the bearded man said okay tribe time to learn some sciencejulie we doing the full tribe or is bunnyboo still reluctant ill check julie disappeared around the van appeared seconds later holding the hand of a little towheaded girl fouryearold kristina wore a white blouse a pink chiffon tutu and sparkly sandals that said shed picked her own outfit she rubbed her eyes yawned julie said still sleepy boo want me to carry you she began lifting kristina the child resisted julie backed off kristina whimpered julie said itll be okay boo you just woke upwanna see the turtles head shake how about the ducksremember the ones with the funny red heads silence kristina sat down on the dirt kion said here we go again drama kembara said always drama with boo kylejacques resumed shadowboxing julie said sam sam shrugged if she needs to rest julie said okay boo you can rest in the van ill take you back kristina began toeing the dirt sam said okay remainderoftribe julie will deal with boo and we will proceed to learn about protozoans and other good stuff julie kneeled by kristina the little girl ignored her let out an abdominal grunt of protest a woman appeared from around the van tall thin in roomy gray sweats and a broadbrimmed straw hat that shielded her face she walked over to kristina bent her knees held out her hand kristina shook her head the woman in the hat swooped her up kristina molded to her the woman said something kristina didnt respond then she giggled the woman tickled her chin lightly kissed her cheek turned kristinas face gently and kissed the other cheek the tops of the childs eyelids she rocked the child said something else kristina nodded kembara sang out draaamaaa still carrying kristina the woman in the hat walked to the older girl kissed her the same way kembara said ugh but she looked pleased the woman in the hat had tilted her face so i could see her jawline clean and defined to begin with tightened by a broad smile she placed kristina down on the ground took the girls hand time for you to learn too boo youll love it kristina considered her options nodded the procession began chapter id eavesdropped half turning from the van and its occupants outwardly focused on canine toilet behavior blanche obliged by taking care of business in her usual dainty manner sniffing the dirt to find a perfect spot upon which to bestow her natural resources upon finishing she kicked up some dust one of the strategic implements id retrieved from the backseat was a plastic poop bag and i used it to good effect the nearest trash basket was right on the way karma swinging the bag conspicuously i sped up and passed the group the woman in the hat was carrying kristina again julie wheeled the suitcase sam toted the plastic bag as i got several paces ahead one of the boys probably kylejacques said cool dog kembara said looks like a gremlin its a bulldog said sam they were bred to fight bulls but that was a long time ago now theyre just pets kylejacques said that one couldnt fight nothing anything said a new voice adult female familiar in another context sultry what i heard now was gentle maternal instruction kylejacques said yeah whatever blanche and i reached the pond with time to spare a couple dozen ducks swam and splashed concentric rings on the surface of the water betrayed the presence of fish turtles the size of dinner plates lazed on the banks an old pittosporum tree in the process of dying it roots decaying slowly leaned precariously toward the water a queue of turtles lined its wizened trunk half a dozen glossy shells stationed as precisely as marines at roll call heads and limbs retracted arrayed that way the reptiles looked like exotic pods sprouting from the wood two benches at the far end of the pond were shaded by sycamores and oak i selected one placed my backpack at my feet lifted blanche and set her down next to me checking out the world beyond the sevilles passenger window walking and pooping had pretty much exhausted her she snuggled up tight against my thigh placed her knobby little head in my lap fluttered her eyes and began to snore i stroked her neck until her breathing grew rhythmic and slow sweet dreams gorgeous the group arrived at the pond just as i retrieved the other strategic object id stashed in the pack the current issue of the international journal of child psychology and psychiatry the lead article was a survey of pediatric responses to hospitalization an area id studied years ago id been meaning to get to it as i alternated between reading and peeking above the top of the magazine the party of seven stopped at the turtleclad tree branch sam pointed and lectured motioned to julie who did the same the kidsincluding little kristinapaid attention kion and kembara stood still kylejacques was a little jumpier and he moved toward the old tree to reach for a turtle julie held him off with a hand on his arm he asked her something julie drew him closer to the amphibians pointed to some detail of the turtles shell kylejacque nodded backed off sam opened the wheeled suitcase removed a blanket and spread it on the dirt extricating a stereoscopic microscope he carefully placed the instrument in the center of the fabric the scope was joined in turn by a fishnet a ladle and a plastic vial then a small wooden box whose contents glinted when sam popped the lid he held something up to the light glass specimen slides julie said something the older three kids removed their backpacks laid them down began unzipping kristina held on to the hand of the tall woman in the hat i thought time for the latest whizbang etablets out came three spiral notebooks and marker pens wrong smart guy about so much as julie lectured and pointed kion kembara and kylejacques sat crosslegged on the bank sketching and jotting notes sam walked to the ponds edge steered clear of the inert turtles and ladled water transferring the green liquid to the vial he capped it and brought it back to the microscope on the blanket it took several attempts to set up a slide bearing a water bubble by the time sam was finished kristinas interest had been piqued and shed pulled free from the tall woman in the hat stood next to the teacher sam focused the microscope narrowed the eyepieces to fit the little girls face she peered looked up beaming peered some more the woman in the hat said something kristina joined her sibs julie gave her a pad and a green crayon the woman walked a few paces away stopped called out you okay now boo kristina ignored her boo im going to sit down over there pointing to the free bench go mommy i continued reading as the woman sat down a few feet away out of her purse came a book happiest toddler on the block she read i read she snuck a few peeks at blanche now awake and serene id canted the journal cover to offer a clear view of the title the woman had another go at her book looked at blanche again i pretended to focus on the magazine read some of the lead article began skimming nothing had changed much since id worked in a hospital blanche stretched jumped from the bench onto the dirt stretched some more i said morning sleeping beauty blanche licked my hand rubbed her head against my fingers the woman said are you just the cutest blanche grinned excuse me but i have to ask did she just smile at me she does that with people she likes totally adorable with some dogs it seems like theyre smiling but theyre putting out a different energymore of a warning this one she really is something thanks the brim of the hat rose offering me a full view of the face below no makeup no need classic symmetrical bone structure the camera adored fine strands of hair escaped the confines of the hat but most remained tucked in mousy brown now blowaway fine filaments clouded the back of a long graceful neck impossible not to know who she was today i was playing the most clueless man in la offering her the merest of smiles i returned to my magazine footsteps caused me to lower the pages kristina running toward her mother easy boo dont trip mommy mommy its a smail holding out a brown cochlear shell is there actually a snail in there boo or is it empty its empty so the snail left its home huh the shell is the snails home boo maybe this one left to find another one huh the woman kissed the childs cheek its a beautiful shell boo its a smailaaahh wanna see the doggy we dont bother doggies boo wanna see i closed the magazine its okay youre sure i really dont want to bother you of course her name is blanche and she loves kids hand in hand the two of them approached on cue blanche assumed the sitstay kristina reached to pet the top of her head i said actually she likes it better when you do it this way placing my hand low in tongue range kristina imitated me i said perfect blanche licked kristina giggled and moved in for another tonguebath her mother said okay thats fine thank the nice man boo kristina began petting blanche her strokes quickened veered on slaps her mother took hold of her wrist guided the tiny hand down blanche licked pudgy fingers kristina squealed the woman said blanche like in streetcar i smiled she likes the company of strangers the woman laughed i can see that great disposition its a blessing kristina showed the shell to blanche and shouted smail blanche smiled kristina ran off laughing the woman said sorry for interrupting your reading i said talk about adorable her eyes drifted to the magazine youre a psychologist i am im reading something kind of relatedhold on her walk to her bench was languid graceful she returned with the toddler book i know its pop stuff she said would you mind telling me if its worth anything it is i said i know the author really we trained at the same time at western pediatric medical center your little ones a bit past toddler i know she said i just like to learn the book dropped to her side that hospital i actually did a i spent some time there not with my kids thank god just i helped out years ago before i had kids its a good place you bet anyway thanks for sharing blanche with kristina she offered her hand long graceful fingers clean nails no polish i said blanche lives to socialize taking a cue with the panache of streep blanche wiggled her hindquarters the woman laughed i see thatum do you happen to have a card i gave her one she read it her eyes saucered i said everything okay oh sure its just i almost this is going to sound totally weird but a few years back someone actually referred me to you small world i said im sorry this is kind of awkward the appointment got canceled i listened to someone else who gave me another name it wasnt very helpful sometimes i said its a matter of fit this was a bad fitlisten this is going to sound pushy but would you be willing to give it another try an appointment i mean sure wow she said thats gracious of you um could it be relatively soon i pulled my appointment book out of my pack knitted my brow she said youre booked solid of course i closed the book got a cancellation tomorrow but its early eight thirty if you can make it i can sure thatll be fine she looked at the card theres no address here i work from home ill give it to you she produced an iphone punched in the info eight thirty it is thank you so much dr alexander delawarei guess id better be getting back to my tribe we shook hands her skin was cool dry thrumming with the faintest tremor she said im preem by the way nice to meet you flashing a million bucks worth of smile she hurried to her brood i pretended to read another article slipped blanche a milkbone you earned caviar but this is all ive got when she was finished nibbling we left passing the kids and the teachers and prema moon everyone busy with an assortment of vials slides leaves illustrated books prema moon gave me a small wave and held a leaf up to kembara look at this honey trilobar the girl said great mom in a voice ripe with boredom pretty no uhhuh that means it has three lobesthree of these little roundy things moom i need to draw chapter hang around la long enough and youre going to spot actresses ive probably seen more than the average citizen because a few famous butts have warmed the battered leather couch in my office and once in a while i tag along with robin at the type of party most people imagine to be fascinating but typically turns out to be mindnumbing ive learned that cinematic beauty is a funny thing sometimes its limited to the screen and real life offers up a plain face that closes up like a frightened sea anemone when the cameras not whirring other times physical perfection transcends time and place prema moon sat on the couch wearing couldntcareless clothes loose jeans brown sneakers a shapeless vnecked sweater that had begun life as sad beige and had faded to tragic gray her macrame bag was one shade sootier fraying where the fabric gathered into bamboo handles like yesterday she wore no makeup indoor lighting turned her hair mousier than it had been at the park the ends were blunt and uneven barely reached her shoulders homemade hack job or an exorbitant styling meant to look that way if she indulged in botox she was overdue fine lines scored her brow the space between her eyes the sides of her mouth the skin beneath her eyes was puffy the indigo of her irises was lovely but oddly lowwatt warm but sad she was gorgeous shed arrived precisely on time driving a small gray mercedes with black windows and squeaky brakes blanche and i greeted her at the door prema stooped to pet hello again princess she did the usual quickcheck of the living room offered the comment i get all the time nice place dr delaware kind of hidden away thanks this way when we arrived in the office blanche waddled to premas feet and sat down is she a therapy dog she can be i said but she has no problem waiting outdoors oh no i couldnt do that to hercmon baby you join us she sank into the couch turned small the way skinny highwaisted people do leaning to scratch behind blanches ear she said i dont want to break any rules here but is it okay if she sits up here with me i clicked my tongue blanche jumped up on the couch settled in close prema moon said well that was pretty nimble i sat back and waited the calm patient therapist wondered if someone with her training would see through the act id had a restless night waking up four times with a pounding head and a racing mind wondering if i could trust my own judgment had i dragged milos case into a bog destined to sink it how would i tell prema id stalked her without scaring her out of the office at five am id crawled out of bed padded to my office scrawled notes i returned an hour later gobbledygook however it shook out prema passing through my doorway bought her insurance from now on i was bound by confidentiality maybe useless to milo a logistical mess i hadnt expected it to turn out this way had been aiming for a chance to observe the kids hadnt counted on prema being in the van not completely true the slim chance the putative evil queen might materialize had led me to bring blanche and the psych journal a pair of perfect lures even with that id expected small talk at best some kind of observational insight i could bring back to milo my clever little plan had worked too well id been wrong about so much prema moon kept massaging blanche checked out the prints on the wall put on dorky glasses and squinted at my diplomas returned the specs to her macrame bag nice she said the feeling here what you imagine a therapist office is like should be like the other onethe doctor i went to instead of youthat was a cold space just screamed i dont care about people cold and expensivewhats your fee by the way three hundred dollars for fortyfive minutes compared with her youre a bargain she counted out cash placed the bills on a side table this place talks softly earnestly she fooled with her hair a strand broke off and floated to her knee she tweezed it between thumb and forefinger tried to deposit it in the wastebasket the hair adhered to her fingertip she rubbed until it dropped that took a while as you can see im a little compulsive i smiled she smiled back hard to read the emotion behind it by comparison mona lisa was blatant okay she said the thing with therapy is to be utterly honest right as honest as you feel you can be there are degrees of honesty there are degrees of revelation i said its a matter of what youre comfortable with ah she said yes i suppose youre right in the end were all strangers except to ourselves thats why your job is so interesting you try to span the gap head shake that probably didnt make sense it made perfect sense her eyes drifted back to the paper on my wall blanche snuggled closer never had a pet dont know exactly why four kids i said id imagine youre pretty busy i mean even as a child i couldve had a pet if i asked i couldve had anything but i never asked she blinked okay time for that honesty the reason the appointment was canceled wasnt because i was urged to see someone else it was because of you specifically the other work you do do you understand what im saying police cases exactly someone thought it would be a bad idea for someone like me to get involved with a doctor who did that no one close to me just a suita person paid to be careful a beat but here i am after all which leads me to a second bit of honesty dr delaware i suspected you were following us the moment you turned off coldwater onto beverly i took a second to digest that you suspected but you didnt sound an alarm if it was me alone id probably have turned around and gotten the heck out of there but with the tribe a trip that had been planned for a long time i suspected but i didnt know for sure so no sense scaring them ruining their day so i waited to see what you did once you entered the park and you just walked your dog and ignored us and i figured i was wrong you were just a guy with a dog then we met up by the pond and you cleverly ignored me but made sure id see that magazine even then i didnt think much of it then i read your card and i remembered your name remembered that other work you do and started to wonder she twisted a thicker clump of hair several more strands fell to her lap she made no attempt to clear them and yet she said im here i said id like to help you she said with what thinking of holly ruche i said owning your life finally really she said as if finding that humorous then she cried i supplied a box of tissues and a bottle of water she dabbed drank i waited for her questions the first one she asked surprised me what do you think of my tribe they seem like a great bunch four gems dr delaware four flawless diamonds im not taking credit but at least i didnt screw them up prema a friend of mine says happiness comes from taking all the credit and none of the blame she clapped her hands i love that but sometimes its hard to separate blame from credit isnt it to know whats real and what isnt back when i was a public person people whod never met me had opinions about everything i did one day i was a goddess the next i was evil incarnate celebritys all about lovehate i said thinking as i had a hundred times over the last few days of the venomous contempt expressed by brent dorf kevin dubinsky len coates who should have known better because hed been trained to analyze facts not rumors had never laid eyes on her none of them had she said im not complaining its part of the game but i used to wonder where all that crap was coming from people so sure alleged experts accusing me of swooping into orphanages at random bribing officials so i could walk away with the cutest babies as if building a family was as simple as choosing strays at the pound or worse i raided third world villages with a private army and stole infants from poor people speaking in the singular she hugged herself true reality is i went through channels got screened had the kids screened too because im not that selfless forget all that sainthood crap theyve also tried to lay on mestupid diplomats at the un making like im mother teresa im a mother small m didnt want an incurably sick baby or a mentally challenged baby didnt want to be surprised by bad news does that offend you not at all i mean i was willing to deal with whatever came up naturally but why make life harder than it needs to be makes sense i mean theres no reason not to make your life as good as it can be right to feel worthy of happiness she crumpled a tissue i was clueless about creating a family its a challenge under the best of circumstances if you do it right its daunting you have to put in time personal investment doubting yourself educating yourself you cant just read books or dial it in you cant just delegate it to other people so i decided to do it right and changed my life she swiveled toward me big insight to a psychologist huh but what did i know not that im some suzy housewife baking cookies keep me away from kitchens keep me far away if you value your intestinal tract and i know im lucky i can pay people to do things i dont want to do but actually raising my children the real stuff thats my job she smiled listen im not some martyr claiming i gave it all up for them i lost nothing gained everything they bring me meaning every day the other stuff never did now the thought of blabbing someone elses lines makes me want to throw up i kept silent you think im a burnedout weirdo i think youve moved on well she said whether you mean it or not you say the right thingssorry i tend to be a little cynical more hair fluffing more ciliary rain so they seemed well adjusted to you they did did you expect spoiled monsters i didnt know what to expect prema aw cmon fess up dr delaware you had to have a little bit of expectation no crazy hollywood mom crazy kids but trust me no way that was going to happen no way they were going to have a childhood like mine i dont believei refuse to believe that were condemned to repeat our own crap my personal mantra when things got low i congratulated myself for not ending up like harry delaware i said if i didnt agree i wouldnt do this job prema moons eyes watered up again the tissue had wadded so tightly it disappeared in her fist i dont know why im getting into this why i feel the need to justify myself to you i said its normal to feel judged in a situation like this you followed us that was based on a judgment whats going on ive been trying to learn about you and your family havent been very successful because youve dropped off the grid when families isolate themselves its often because of serious problems and thats what i suspected i know now that youve been trying to take control of your life are focused on protecting the kids for good reason you know that better than anyone she bit her lip great monologue doctor you couldve made a living in my old business but you still havent answered my question you need help prema you know that thats why youre here she opened her palm watched the tissue expand like a timelapse flower crushed it again maybe youre being sincere i hope you are but with the good onesthe performersyou can never be sure meryl jack judi larry olivieri knew larry when i was a kid he was always sweet to me but when he chose to be someone else good luck maybe thats you dr alexander delaware youre the performer prema me im a hack i made a ridiculous fortune doing crap i think youre selling yourself short not in the least dr delaware i know what i am and im okay with it her knuckles were white and shiny as ivory how long have you been learning about us i did a bit of digging right after that first appointment was made because the circumstances were odd the person who called was evasive wouldnt even tell me who the patient was i assumed id be seeing one of the kids looked for anything i could find about them which wasnt much but i did come across a photo you and the kids a theater lobby in new york they seemed unhappy ill at ease you stood behind them you came across detached not exactly a happy family portrait her eyes flashed detestable picture you have no idea how much time and money it took to get it offline im glad i saw it before you succeeded now i understand understand what id missed the emotional content you were scaredall of you she flinched why would i be scared i said not why of who she shook her head closed her eyes sat lower and got even smaller i said my guess is youall of youwere scared of the person who set up the shot someone who doesnt care about kids but didnt mind using them the eyes opened new shade of indigo deep hot youre frightening am i wrong silence was my answer i said you talk about your children in the singular i not we youre doing it alone for good reason she crossed her arms blanche licked her hand prema remained unmoved her lips set angry i wondered if id lost her i said no matter what you do he rejects them completely it must be tough living with that degree of callousness your kids are your world why cant he see how wonderful they are understand the joy of being a parent but he doesnt and now theres a new level of fear and thats why youre here because of the other work i do shooting to her feet she stormed out of the office made it halfway up the hall where she stopped short swung the big bag as if working up momentum to use it as a battering ram i had a clear view stayed in my chair the bag grew still her shoulders heaved she returned stood in the doorway leaning against the jamb for support my god she said the things that come out of your mouth then she returned to the couch chapter another head shake more hair fell a woman coming apart strand by strand she hugged herself shuddered ten fingers began working like rubinstein on rachmaninoff i said if youre feeling cooped up we can talk outside how did you know i felt that because you look like a caged animal i said lucky guess i told blanche to stay in the office paid her with a milkbone prema moon said she can come with us she needs to nap the real reason time to minimize distraction and comfort i walked her through the house out through the kitchen and down the rear steps to the garden stopping by the ponds rock rim the waterfall burbled the sky was clear very mellow she said to encourage confession im not a priest isnt this the new religion god doesnt talk to me only freud does huh havent heard from him in a while either i sat down on the teak bench that faces the water the fish swarmed prema moon said what are they japanese koi pretty she took in the garden robins studio softened by trees and shrubs a whine cut through the waterfall the band saw whats that noise the woman i live with builds musical instruments shes going to come out here and see me no youve trained her to stay inside when a patients here once shes in there its for hours what if she does come out shell go right back in whats her name i shook my head sorry she said im just im jumping out of my skin this is i dont know what it is dont know what to do i uncapped the canister of fish food scooped a handful of pellets tossed she watched the koi eat said well yummy for them not a word out of her for a long time when that didnt look as if it was going to change i said tell me what frightens you why should i youre here she reached for the koi food may i tweezing again she threw in one pellet at a time i like the silver one elegant i said okay ill start people who work for you seem to die unnaturally her arm shot out she hurled the rest of the food the fish feasted people all i know is adriana and i only know about her because i heard it on tv and it freaked me out completely did you contact the police long pause you know the answer i didnt because i couldnt see what i could possibly offer she worked for me only for a short time i really didnt know her i said nothing she said what did you mean people youre freaking me out first adriana then melvin jaron wedd her hand flew to her face what mel no when a few days ago oh god nowhat are you telling me he was murdered a few days ago was he a good employee what i repeated the question sure fine he was great murder what happened reliable skilled at organizing yes yes all that what does it matter i said in addition to all that he had a special talent vocal impressions what oh that sure yes hed do cartoon characters for the kids so he did a pretty good imitation of donny when he called me for that appointment on your behalf what i thought it was donny but it was mel wasnt it she said mel called for me buti never told him to do that guess he improvised why would he i thought you might be able to tell me well i cant i have no idea why then ill take a guess prema subtle hostility he didnt much care for donny because hed learned what donny is like he knew that donny wouldnt be happy about your consulting a child psychologist so he mimicked donny mels little bit of nasty irony she stared at the water i said mel refused to tell me which kid id be seeing because the answer was none of them the kids didnt need help they were doing fine all things considered she looked at me her eyes were wet im doing my best i believe that you are so the question remains why did you want to see me im a child psychologist so it wasnt about therapy for you that leaves some kind of family issue she didnt answer i said maybe a marriage thats unraveling a concerned parent wanting to learn about the impact on the children and how to minimize it she covered her face with both hands i said you care about everyone and everything donny couldnt care less you always wanted kids he never did you convinced yourself his attitude would change once he saw how cute they could be it didnt he cut them off completely and they know it thats why that picture in the lobby was so stressful it was his idea the first time hed shown any interest in family life so there had to be an ulterior motive what was he planning to do with the shot use it for publicity she raised her arms punched air clumsily damn him for a stupid movie big lead role for him he was going to play a dad typecasting her laugh was bitter caring bumbling lovable dad can you believe the morons who thought of that not exactly citizen kane not exactly citizen sane pieceofcrap script pieceofcrap casting his big comedy debut it was going to open a whole new world for him she got up walked several steps away returned his plan was to sell the photo to people for big bucks he never asked me knew what id say instead he sprang it on me as we drove from the airport into the city hed instructed the driver to go straight to the theater his agent had paid to rent the lobby the whole purpose of the trip was educational show the kids the metropolitan museum of art the planetarium i was surprised when he offered to come along allowed myself to be hopeful maybe hed seen the light then he pulled that expecting them to pose for hours of pictures him with the tribe both of us with the tribe he wanted them to jump in the air and laugh and hug him and kiss him disgusting i killed it the rule from the beginning was always they never got used for his crap or mine he knew that and now hes trying to change it because someones paying him to be a dad he tried to force the issue i stood my ground it got ugly i told the kids to wait in the limo by the time i got back to the lobby he was gone he drove straight back to teterboro chartered a plane to vegas stayed there for weeks doing his vegas thing the tribe and i tried to make the best of it id rented a big quiet apartment on sutton place doorman security off the beaten path i managed to take them a few places without attracting attention they wanted to know where hed gone i said he wasnt feeling well but they knew i was lying i tried to reach out to him maybe we could talk work something out he wouldnt take my calls then he texted me a picture of himself and some girls let me know quite graphically that he didnt miss me her face tightened after that we moved even further apart lovable dad i said dont recall that film never got made how come maybe someone realized how bad he sucks as an actor shrug thats the way the business works mostly its air sandwiches her toe nudged the rock rim time for me to nudge her have you told the kids about adrianas death of course not how did you explain her absence i said she went away on vacation it would only matter to boo adriana was boos person the others dont need anything like that a nanny not even a nanny just someone to watch boo when im tied up four kids i said sometimes you can get spread pretty thin i manage she sniffed theres nothing else id rather be doing out of my pant pocket came a piece of paper i unfolded pretended to read she pretended to ignore me but it had been a long time since shed performed and she struggled with her curiosity what is that i handed it over fumbling in her bag she produced her glasses scanned the receipt from jaymar laboratory the copy id kept for myself beetles scalpels what is this check the name of the recipient prema whos that someone who buys stuff for you through apex management for you only her mouth dropped what thats ridiculous ive never heard of this place beetles scalpelsa bone saw what the hells going on she tried to return the receipt i kept my hands in my lap kevin dubinsky ordered all that stuff for you mel handles my purchases you wanted something youd tell mel hed pass it along to kevin whos kevin i dont know any kevin everythings done by email anyway youd email mel and hed pass it along to this is crazy she reread dermestidsounds gross why would i want bugs in my house we pay a pest service to get rid of bugs last year it took two days to clear a wasp nest kylejacques is allergic to bees and wasps dermestid beetles arent household pests theyre specialists prema at what they consume flesh quickly and cleanly scientists use them to clean bones thats disgusting why would i want something like that her hands shook the paper rattled id given her the perfect opening but shed made no attempt to weasel out by offering a plausible explanation oh those beetles i forgot they were part of the kids science project im big on teaching them science you saw that yesterday she said beetles scalpels she turned white youre saying someone cleaned mels bones or adrianasomigod mel was shot and left intact same for adriana is anyone else authorized to contact kevin dubinsky on your behalf i keep telling you i dont know any kevin dubinsky my lifeyou delegate things get away from you who has access to your email account no one has access to my personal account i dont use it much anyway try to stay off the computer because the internets nothing but mental pollution im into reading books never had much school i need to catch up so i can be smart for the tribe already they know stuff i dont especially kj he knows so much math are there other email accounts at your home of course for the household she said i cant tell you how many or who uses themi sure dont we have a computer company they set it up for daytoday things would those household accounts be used for shopping for food toilet paper not bugs whos on your staff total if you mean people coming in and out like gardeners pool servicethose pestcontrol peoplei couldnt even tell you theres always someone around fixing something who lives on the premises like mel it used to be crazy we used to have an army she said after i stopped working i began to pare down mel iswas the overall manager i used to have a personal assistant but i let her go a few years back the only reason most people have pas is theyre afraid of being alone i relish being alone does donny have an assistant always she said they come and go girls always girls the latest one i couldnt even tell you her name we live other than that theres just the housekeepers imelda lupe maria i need three to keep the place clean its a big undertaking theyre lovely religious ladies cousins thats it oh yeah a cook for healthy food plus adriana tears filled her eyes plus her she was also religious i could tell because she kept a bible by her bed and sometimes id see her praying personally im not into that but i respect it are you saying the same person who killed her killed mel too early to tell i said have you moved to replace adriana im not sure i need to boos growing more independent more interactive hanging out with the tribe more do you have chauffeurs we used to have two one for him one for the rest of us but that was a waste we dont go out much i switched to a car service did donny keep his driver no i dont think so you dont know she exhaled we dont exactly live together where does he live next door the adjoining property i mean its one property i bought it years ago but its three separate parcels i was going to develop it as one big estate but then things changed the tribe and i use the big lot seven acres a main house some outbuildings tennis court pool stuff and donny he took the middle one around three acres the smallest one is a little less than an acre no buildings on it no one goes there she thrust the jaymar form at me take this back its freaking me out i pocketed the paper when you heard about adriana did you talk about it to anyone no not mel why would i discuss it with him people work together they talk to each other mel and i werent like that she said no socializing we talked when there was something to talk about dont get the wrong picture i didnt snob him out but its not likewasnt like we were friends a friend is someone who likes you for yourself mel wouldnt have stuck around for a second if i didnt pay him her smile was grim i dont have friends dr delaware i have people i pay thinking of all the women robert sommers had spotted parading in and out of wedds apartment i said how was mels love life he had none that i knew about no girlfriend she smiled mel was gay you know that because he told me like i said when there was something to talk about we talked one time mel was looking upset and i asked him what was wrong and he told me i have to admit i had no idea he never gave off any gay vibe what was bothering him was he hashad a brother some macho cowboytype and they hadnt seen each other in a long time because mel had run from who he was now mel wanted to whats the word he usedresurrect he wanted to resurrect the relationship was worried once the brother found out it would screw things up permanently why is his love life important someone gets murdered its good to know about their relationships mel may have had some but im unaware of them why did you show me that beetle thing the night adriana was killed something else was found in the park the skeleton of a twomonthold the bones had been cleaned by dermestid beetles she gasped made a retching sound bent low im supposed to be connected to that thats insane she clawed her hair this cant be happening whod want to set you up prema no one i said one more thing after the bones were cleaned they were coated with beeswax she clutched my arms looked me full in the face shrieked springing to her feet she backed away from me as if i were diseased ran toward the house made it to the kitchen steps but didnt climb them instead she began pacing the yard fast robotic tearing at her hair great workout companion for milo on her ninth circuit she sped to the rear of the yard where tall trees blacken the grass leaning against the trunk of my oldest coast redwood she sobbed convulsively just as id decided to approach her she straightened her shoulders sucked in breath and returned to the teak bench the park where shewhere they were both found if they mentioned it on the tv i didnt hear i really wasnt paying attention until i heard adrianas name was it cheviot howd you know that prema oh i know gripping her knees with both hands she put herself in an awkward crouch as if prepping for a leap off a cliff nowhere to fly she remained frozen moaned i know all sorts of things chapter milo was at his desk you did what it started out as surveillance i said things progressed you told her everything i told her enough to get through to her shes your new pal shes not the offender you know that ill put money on it silence i said you need her and at this point she thinks she needs you needs me for what keeping her kids safe all of a sudden devil princess is a saint think of it this way i said you may get out of garbage detail she came to your house alone no paparazzi in the bushes not her style anymore i said just a simple gal your new best friend love to chat big guy but you need to get over here he grumbled i heard a door slam on my way good man so few of us left back in the office i poured prema herb tea gave her some playtime with blanche allowed her to drift into abstract discussions on childrearing then i got back to the questions she offered no resistance was answering freely when the bell rang she blinked thats him we really need to do this we do only time ive ever dealt with the police was in london a bunch of us got busted for smoking hash in a park rich little twits everyone had connections we got off with a warning youve got connections again do i prema theres a reason you decided to come here i got to my feet ready standing slowly she teetered for a second hooked her arm in mine no red carpet she whispered but here we go introductions were brief both of them were wary when they shook hands prema used both of hers as if wanting to prolong contact milo offered only his fingers pulled away soon i led prema to the living room sofa sat down next to her milo settled in a facing chair his suit was one id seen for years a baggy greenbrown hopsack worn over a white shirt and a muddy blue tie that prozac couldnt fix one thing was different hed slicked down his hair twohundredfortypound kid waiting for communion prema said you look just like a cop should milo said you look just like a movie star should i meant that as a compliment lieutenant i find it reassuring so taken his expression was unreadable what can i do for you ms moon she turned to me i said just go for it she inhaled okay all right donny rader smokes meerschaum pipes does he do you know what meerschaum is some kind of carved stone its a mineral lieutenant it washes up on the beach and people carve it into smoking pipes donny rader has lots of carved meerschaum smoking pipes i dont know how many he smokes weed in them not tobacco hes a compulsive collector loves things to my mind its just greed like cars hes got a dozen maybe more even though he hardly ever drives them he has more clothing than i do one hand kneaded the other he collects women but we dont need to go there sounds like your husband leads a busy life ms moon she flinched i said theres another collection yes she said there is he has a closet full of guns when we were living together i made him lock them up in a big safe that i paid for for the childrens safety where are the guns now ms moon at his place you dont live together he lives in the adjoining property i bought all of it years ago but i only use part of it you know about his gun closet because i saw it not recently we dont have much i stay at my place hes at his when did you see the gun closet her chest heaved maybe half a year i really cant be sure you went to visit not a visit an obligation he needed to sign a tax form from our accountant our life is complicated you can delegate a lot of things but at some point you still need to sign your name to papers all the financial forms come to me because hed neglect them so around six months ago could be seven months eight five i dont know what i do recall is he was still in bed the place was a mess as usual there was a woman i asked her to leave for a moment so he could sign the tax form the safes in a closet in his bedroom the closet door was open there were also loose guns on shelves and big onesriflespropped up on the floor of the closet i got out of there has he ever threatened you with a firearm not yet you think he might at this point lieutenant i dont know what to think i said about the meerschaums milos eyebrows rose prema said yes of course the meerschaums the lovely meerschaums when you collect them the big deal is to get them to color gradually as you smoke them from white to amber for that to happen the pipes are coated after theyre carved then the owner recoats them from time to time her hands clenched whats used for the coating lieutenant is beeswax milos lips pursed really specifically confectioners beeswax lieutenant with all those pipes donny rader must go through the stuff like crazy because he buys pots of confectioners beeswax back when we were living together i saw it in his workshop he builds things birdhouses ashtrays not very well youve seen him work with beeswax nod one time he called me in to watch him work on a pipe showing off he heated up the beeswax brushed it on waited for it to cool then buffed it shiny about a month ago he ordered six fresh pots of beeswax i know that because instead of going through his purchasing assistanta gopher at apex our management firm we each have onehe ordered it online himself using my personal credit card the package ended up on my desk it came from a baking supplies outfit my first thought was the cook had bought it someone had screwed up and used my personal card instead of one of the household cards then i opened it and realized what was inside and called him to take it we met at the gate to his place i asked him why hed bought it using my name he didnt really have an answer was pretty much loaded on weed or whatever as usual he say anything at all he mumbled something about not being able to find his own card which made sense hes always losing things it didnt explain why he hadnt gone through apex but i didnt push it this was wax no big deal and frankly the less contact we have with each other the better i forgot about the whole incident until i learned today that hed bought something else saying it was for me only this time he had contacted my purchasing assistant at apex probably using one of my email addresses and bought those terrible things you know the order came from him because because i didnt buy them lieutenant hes obviously trying to cover his tracks by casting suspicion on me milo studied her she said i know it sounds crazy but lieutenant i will take any liedetector test you want me to take i have never once in my life bought beetles or surgical tools or beeswax nor have i ever asked anyone to buy those things for me check out every single computer in my house including my personal computer im sure youve got specialists who can do that do you know for a fact that he bought the wax online how else maybe he got on the phone and ordered she thought okay good point maybeso examine our phone records weve got i dont know how many lines between us go ahead and trace them all then do the same thing for his phones and see what you learn milo rolled his tie up to his collar let it drop any idea why your husband would need beetles and surgical tools her hands clenched do i have to say it she turned to me i gave her my best therapist smile she said fine im afraidim terrified that it had something to do with that poor baby in the park and thats another thing the park like i told dr delaware just before you got here donny rader has a connection to that place he used to work as a caddie at the golf course right next door back when he was a nothing milos bulk inched forward this is all very interesting ms moon thanks for coming forward whats my choice lieutenant hes obviously trying to ruin me so you believe your husband is could i ask a favor lieutenant please dont call him that hes my husband in name only you believe mr rader had something to do with the baby in the park i dont know what else to think lieutenant those bones were treated just like he treats his stupid pipes after he sicced those horrible bugs on them any idea why hed do such a thing no she said i mean hes not a caring person quite the opposite but i never imagined not until dr delaware told me about the beeswax no idea at all what mr raders motive might be the question i hadnt gotten to when the bell rang her eyes filled with tears i have an idea but not one that makes sense whats that maam its not rational not in terms of normal people anyway she said i mean how can you ever explain things like that explain what maam she pulled at her hair this is even for him itslet me ask you one thing lieutenant was the baby in the park black milo looked at me why would the baby be black ms moon because the only baby i can think of who lived at my house since boomy youngestwas born was black the mother was someone who worked for us she went into labor early actually delivered in her room in the staff house needless to say i was shocked one day shes pregnant the next shes got a baby she said she delivered it herself her a little girl i wanted to get her to the hospital she said no she was fine i thought that was absolutely crazy but she insisted and she seemed fine even though the baby was small not abnormal small not a preemie everything seemed okay except for the blood and crud on her bed she frowned my home her delivery how long ago was this maybe four months ago what happened after that the baby was adorablelovely little thing great disposition cordelia thats the name the mother gave her i gave the mother time off to care for her gave her some of boos old baby clothes had boos crib set up in her room she repaid me by leaving without giving notice thats what i assumeda flakeout but now you think something worse happened she didnt reply milo said ms moon why would mr rader harm this particular baby long silence prema said maybe you can do dna for what to find out who the father was you think it couldve been mr rader her eyes narrowed i know what he is i didnt know he could be that stupid what is he anything with a vagina gravitates toward him he doesnt exactly play hardtoget you suspect the mother of the child and mr rader had an i dont suspect i know once after her workday was over i saw her go over to his place after dark wearing a minidress there was no reason for that she worked for me watching my children did you mention it to her head shake no big deal everyone has sex with him its about as meaningful as taking a drink of water his promiscuity didnt bother you in the beginningwhen we started outit sure as hell did but later just the opposite kept him out of my hair but did i suspect hed knocked her up never because that had never happened before and she never got that look they always get expectant mothers no no she snapped freelance vaginas thinking theyve snagged him when that happens they get a certain smile a smug smile ive fired assistants cooks maids not because im jealous but dont think you can collect a paycheck from me and give me that smile milo said the babys mother didnt have the smile she had a nice smile the way a woman gets when shes productive its a special thing for women lieutenant her hand grazed her belly tears filled her eyes or so ive been toldno no scratch that no playing the pity card ive got my tribe theyre gems just as precious as if id carried them myself she bounded up hurried to the door flung it open ran out no footsteps from the terrace milo glanced at me i held up a restraining palm a minute later she returned positioned herself between us center stage milo said please and pointed to the sofa she said i know you guys are just doing your job but this is cutting the guts out of me chapter the police detective strode to the movie stars side placed his arm around her guided her back to the sofa im sorry ms moon i really am if it makes you feel any better youre helping achieve justice for that baby and others prema didnt answer milo relocated to a closer chair pulled it even nearer she said mr fuckeverythingthatmoves another collection thats why my estate manager iswas a man thats why the maids i have are church ladies in their sixties you think donny rader killed the baby i never would have thought him capable i mean i know he couldnt care less about kids but i guess hes capable of anything if its in his best interests she probably became an inconveniencepressured him for money money or emotional commitmentwanting him to step up to the plate i will tell you one thing giving her serious money would definitely be a problem for him because he has no control over the finances gets an allowance because hes an idiot whats serious money anything more than ten thousand dollars a month if he needed to come up with something like that hed have to ask me or else start selling his crap she turned to milo thats probably the motive lieutenant she got greedy put him in a bind she sagged but that poor baby how did it die thats unclear what do you mean the skeleton bore no evidence of trauma the skeleton she said why would he do that she turned to me what kind of insanity is that dr delaware i shook my head milo said this woman what was her simone simone chambord he showed her qeesha dembos mug shot in this photo no concealment of the booking numbers around her neck her mouth formed an oval shes a criminal she had a police record oh god what a sucker i am she told me she was a teachers aide had preschool experience thats what the agency told me because of that i hired her to watch over boo boo was just a toddler another stare at the arrest form youre telling me i entrusted my boo to a criminal sorry to say ms moon i must be the biggest fool in the universe anyone can get taken maam there wasnt a hint of anything off she was kind to boo boo liked her and boo doesnt take to everyone i liked her thats why when she got pregnant and her energy flagged i took pity on her and helped her out by hiring another person adriana betts youre going to tell me that one was an ax murderer no maam cleanliving churchgirl howd she and simone get along fine she said why she shuddered oh of course he killed her too so she was connected she rubbed her face that plus the pacing milos spiritual sister what was her story i was wondering if you knew well i dont adriana was there seemed nothing complicated about her then again i liked simone she laughed to think i helped her with her pregnancygave her clothes books encouraged her to take it easy adriana came on to relieve simone yes your suggestion or simones mine i used the same agency and once simone was gone adriana took over completely did a great job then she walked out on me too or so i thought did you try to find out why she left she threw up her hands my life is hectic people come and go you have no idea how hard it is to find dependable help like mel wedd said milo did he work for mr rader as well as for you he was the estate manager and technically all three properties are the estate but his daytoday job was under my supervision how did he and mr rader get along he didnt respect donny or so he told me why because of donnys behavior promiscuity she ticked her fingers promiscuity being constantly stoned never taking responsibility mostly not caring about the kids mel thought that was unconscionable milo said mr rader shut the kids out of his life to shut them out hed have to be aware of them lieutenant he acted as if they didnt exist how do you explain that to a child her hand touched her mouth i guess with that attitude doing things to a baby isnt so big a stretch milo said back to mel wedd for a moment any idea why mr rader would kill him assuming he did another easy opening if she was manipulating once again she didnt take it no i cant imagine milo looked at me again i shrugged still your play big guy he said was mr wedd involved in any of mr raders activities with women mel why would you ask that wedds been spotted in the company of several attractive women streaming in and out of his apartment including simone chambord youre saying mel pimped for that bastard or he might have been in charge of the finances what finances paying women off when mr rader was through with them in simone chambords case that may have included getting a car for her a red bmw it once belonged to mr wedd but he reported it stolen and simone chambord was seen driving it oh this is all too much what else do you want to drop on me lieutenant thats it insanity she said okay now what do we do about it chapter the plan was logical meticulous elegant in its simplicity even in the chiefs grudging appraisal assuming youre lucky sturgis at eight thirty am two days after my session with prema moon the tutors from oxford educational services drove through the stout wooden gate of her estate newly scheduled allday trip to seaworld in san diego the kids had visited last year begged to return prema had punted with the classic parental soon one day at seven thirty she announced surprise to a quartet of sleepy young faces how come mom because sam and julie say youve all been great with your studies oh whoa cool when are we going right now everyone get dressed afterward sam and julie will take you to a great mexican restaurant and you can all stay up late mumbled thanks big smile from boo at ten fourteen am a brown dustcaked kidneypunishing dodge van rolled through that same gate entering premas spread required a thousand feet of climbing past the wroughtiron barrier that blocked access to the treeshrouded private road at the top were three identical barriers of weathered oak inlaid with oversized black nailheads each equipped with a call box per directions milo drove up to the lefthand box as we waited to enter i spotted a black glass eye peering from the boughs of a pine closedcircuit lens focused on premas gate then another aimed at donny raders maybe hed installed his own security system or prema cared more about his comings and goings than shed let on i pointed the cameras out to milo his placid nod said hed already seen them four beeps from the call box the gate swung open smoothly we rattled through the brown van had been borrowed from the westside lapd impound yard cheap stickon signs on each flank read adaptive plumbers the number below was printed in numerals too small to read from a distance if someone actually called it theyd get a disconnect i sat up front in the shotgun seat behind me was a tech sergeant named morry burns who occupied himself playing sudoku online the slew of equipment hed brought including a portable dolly occupied the vans rear storage area behind burns sat k specialist tyler oshea and a panting retriever mix named sally milo said pooch okay oshea said shes awesome lives to do the job allamerican work ethic el tee ill take her any day over your gardenvariety socalled human prema moon was waiting for us in the parking lot west of her mansion the area was an easy acre paved beautifully ringed by river rock cordoned by low privet hedges space for dozens of cars but only four today all compact sedans three bore the bumper sticker of a spanishlanguage christian station the fourth had customized plates reading trffles the mansion hovered in the distance a frothy pinkbeige mediterranean that almost succeeded in looking old perched assertively on the propertys highest knoll windows gleamed like zircons red bougainvillea climbed the walls like gravitydefying rivulets of blood the hue of the stucco was a perfect foil for an uncommonly blue sky several smaller outbuildings dotted the property same color same genre as if the mansion had dropped pups north of the structures walls of cypress surrounded something unseen to the rear of the property was a blackgreen cloud of untamed conifer sycamore eucalyptus and oak as we got out of the van prema strode toward us holding a sheaf of papers she wore formfitted black jeans a black mock turtle red suede flats her hair was combed out and shiny held in place by a thin black band shed put on lipstick and eye shadow and mascara new take on gorgeous milo said morning morning lieutenant i just called the tribe theyre halfway to san diego should be gone until eight or even nine is that enough time milo said well do our best he introduced her to morry burns she said pleased to meet you without answering burns laid down a pair of metal carrying cases returned to the van brought out the dolly a third trip produced the flat sides of several unassembled cardboard boxes he walked up to prema is there some hub where all your computers feed like command central i dont think so you dont think or you dont know prema blinked no theres nothing like that how many computers on the premises dont know that either sorry you have a smarthouse setup crestron running the lights the utilities your home theater all your toys we do have a system but im not sure the computers go through it show me your personal machine well work backward from there right now you got something better to do burns began stacking his dolly milo pointed to the papers in premas hand she said i pulled phone records for the last six months every line that goes through this property without looking back burns said landlines and cells yes your employees have personal cell accounts im sure they do then thats not every line he made another trip to the van well yes said prema i just wanted to help tyler oshea appeared with sally in tow prema said a dog milo said while you work with detective burns on the hardware officer oshea will be exploring the property with sally oshea young virile muscular gawked at prema when he managed to engage eye contact he beamed she smiled back oshea blushed hi sally arent you a pretty girl she reached to pet the dog oshea blocked her with his arm sorry maam she needs to concentrate oh of courseconcentrate on what milo said finding anything interesting you think youll find evidence here we need to be thorough ms moon sallys leash strained as she oriented herself toward the forest her nose twitched she panted faster prema said sallys one of those dogs that look for bodies oshea said thats part of her repertoire maam oh my head shake whats back there in the trees maam just trees honestly youre not going to find anything hope youre right maam oshea clicked his tongue twice he and sally headed out at a quick trot morry burns returned tapped his foot checked his watch milo said whos working on the premises today maam just the core staff she said the maids and the cook do you need to talk to them eventually meanwhile go with detective burns dr delaware and i will stroll around a bit prema forced a half smile of course hes a psychologist anything can be interesting first stop the four walls of cypress an opening on the east side led us into a flat area the size of two football fields one corner was devoted to a safetyfenced halfolympic pool with a padlocked alarmed gate the opposing corner housed a sunken tennis court diagonal to that were a regulation basketball court a rubbermatted area set up with four trampolines a moonbounce a tetherball pole two pingpong tables and a sand pit that hosted a plastic slide a swingset a seesaw and a yellow vinyl tunnelmaze milo said kidheaven courtesy super mom whats that making up for her own shitty childhood could be if youre in an analytical mood youre not lets find the maids and the cook the interior of the house was what youd expect the requisite vaulted rooms quarryemptying expanses of marble enough polished wood to threaten a rain forest the art on the walls was professionally spaced perfectly framed and lit oil paintings biased toward women and children as subjects and the kind of pastel landscape that combats insomnia the maids were easy to find imelda rojas polished silver in the dining room lupe soto folded laundry in a whitetiled utility room the size of some new york apartments maria elena miramonte tidied up a playroom that would thrill a preschool class all three women were in their sixties solidly built and well groomed wearing impeccable powderblue uniforms milo spoke to them individually easy consensus senora prema was wonderful senor donny was never here despite that raders name elicited tension but when milo asked imelda rojas what she thought of him she insisted she didnt know he kept up the questioning but stepped aside early on and punted to me my doctorate wasnt any help at first maria and imelda were unable or unwilling to articulate their feelings about rader then lupe soto opined that he was a sinner and when pressed specified the nature of raders iniquities putas always lots of girls no girls senor putas is good he no live here better for the chillin they no see that he used to bring putas here lupe said you kidding always there his place yeah but we know how the tv in the kitchen could you show me please she led us down a double staircase too grand for tara through a succession of big bright sitting rooms and into a tinceilinged mapleandsteel kitchen easily forty feet long mounted on the far wall were a dozen small screens lupe soto pointed to one the image was inert one of the wooden gates see i said he didnt try to hide what he was doing nah i showed her the wellworn mug shot of charlene chambers aka qeesha dembo aka simone chambord la negra said lupe soto yeah she too she went over to senor donnys place all the time but i don tell senora prema why not not my business she placed a hand over her heart no one wanted to hurt her feelings yeh whats simonethis womanlike who

car is white thought the red car was mel wedds him no you never saw him drive the red car nup i see a black one big she shaped a circle with her hands like senor donny car mel and senor donny drove

head she said nice lady she go away looks like it she shrugged i said people come and go all the time not me you like it here i like to work could you show us where senor mel lives building two we all there could you show us prolonged sigh then i got to work building two was a pleasantly landscaped singlestory structure due north of the mansion an eightbyeight lobby set up with dried flowers in big copper vases opened to hallways on two sides like a nice boutique hotel four doors lined each corridor lupe soto said okay and started to leave evoking additional sighs i got her to show us her quarters a spotless daylit bedroom with a small sitting area and an ensuite bathroom imelda and maria slept in the flanking rooms same as me zactly the farthest room was occupied by the cook a sticklike woman in her late twenties wearing minicheck chefs pants and a white smock she answered our knock filing her nails the layout behind her was identical to lupes but festooned with rock posters and oversized illustrations of food the bed was unmade the smell of gym sweat and perfume blew out into the hallway yeah whats going on her hair was short yellow textured like fleece bruisecolored tattoos coiled up the side of her neck i wondered if avoiding the carotid and the jugular had been a challenge milos badge caused the skin around the illustration to pale she lowered the nail file police whats going on nothing serious were just here to check a few things out at ms moons request about what an employee who worked here seems to have gone missing whos that simone chambord sorry she said must be before my time how long have you been working here ms georgie she said georgette weiss how long like a month make that thirty eight days she okay that woman i mean did something

what about him what he easy to work for i work for prema he does his thing we really dont interact another sideward glance can i tell you something but really please i mean it dont quote me sure seriously said georgie weiss seriously she scratched her head mel hes not the friendliest guy but thats not what im talking about officially i think he works for prema at least he seems to hes like here all the time but i think he could also be hanging with him donny i mean because ive seen him drive over there at night after hours nod thats another thing about prema when the days over its over some of them they think they own you its like slavery you know do for me twentyfourseven not prema prema makes the rules and youre expected to keep them but she keeps them too she doesnt exploit the help trust me thats rare said georgie weiss she rattled off the names of two other actresses and a male star spent some time pcingprivate chefingfor them slavery nice to know someones different you bet maybe its cause she has kids shes totally into them eating healthy shes like an involved mom but not crazyhealthy like every anorexic westside bitch they see a glass of juice they have a seizure its reasonable stuff just watch out for too much sugar and fat thats my food anyway good deal the best i love it hope you find that woman she began to close the door milo didnt try to stop her physically his voice was enough so you think mel wedd is going behind premas back after hours she studied him youre trying to say he did something to that woman not at all said milo just checking everyone out i just thought it was weird mel going over there because he works for prema and obviously theyre notits not like theyre a coupleso what could he be doing over there mels the estate manager i said maybe the entire propertys considered the estate hmm she said guess so nervous smile whatever keep me out of it okay i just want to cook my food the second hallway contained three rooms instead of four a utility closet at the rear housed the water heater and the ac unit the first door was unlocked bare mattress empty nightstand and dresser a portable crib stood folded in the corner milo gloved up had me wait as he went in emerged shaking his head nothing and its obviously been cleaned but ill have it processed anyway the second room was locked he said stay here make sure no one goes into simones and left the building ten minutes later he returned with a large ring of keys stored in the laundry room but none of the maids would tell me that so i had to bring prema down she inspires loyalty i said hows it going with the computers hard to tell with burns hes so damn grumpy how come youre the shrink selecting a key he unlocked the second room tightly made bed bible on the nightstand framed pictures on the dresser regloving he ran through the same solo search opened a closet door wide enough for me to view the contents from the corridor sparse supply of blandlooking garments he went into the bathroom called out nothing sexy here either returning to the dresser he opened drawers inspected the framed pictures stepped closer and held them out for my inspection adriana and her church group including the woman shed known as qeesha dembo but had come to accept as simone chambord because friends in need did what was expected of them the two women stood heads together beaming qeesha cradled a tiny brown infant the baby had a round face inquisitive black eyes a sweet mouth graceful longfingered hands a full head of dark hair beautiful child finally the bones had a face cordelia my throat clogged milo raced out of the room melvin jaron wedds quarters veered toward messy but smelled okay probably the armani cologne in his medicine cabinet the fragrance shared space with viagra for fun lunesta for sleep five varieties of caffeine pills for energy tube of lube in the top nightstand drawer in the second a short stack of gay porn nothing interesting in the dresser until milo kneeled low and pulled a small blue leatherette spiral notebook out of the bottom righthand drawer stashed under a stack of beefy sweaters too warm for la the book bore the goldimprinted legend of an insurance broker with an office in beverly hills probably one of those christmas giveaways inside was an appointment calendar complete with holiday notations dated the previous year wedd hadnt used it to organize his schedule the pages were unmarked milo leafed through toward the end several blank pages headed notes contained just that mel wedds penmanship was impressive nice straight columns too two side by side per page cheryl jan melissa jan shayanne jan fortynine womens names fifteen of them occurring twice or more monthly totals approached ten thousand dollars but always fell slightly short simone showed up sixteen times over a twoyear period first payment three hundred dollars an increase to six hundred then six notations of eight fifty milo said merit raisewhoa look at this sudden boost on the eighth payment seven more of those each dated the first of the month milo said she takes up a whole bunch of the tengrand limit leaving less for other girls guys a superstar would have to come begging for dough talk about demeaning i said hes premas bad child he looked at me been carrying around that insight for a while just thought of it she couldnt raise him properly moved on to real kids shes invented her own world i took a longer look at the log eight big payments conforms to the final months of qeeshas pregnancy up to that point she was figuring out what to do by the fourth month she couldnt hide it any longer decided to take action donny told her to abort she strung him along kept delaying as he kept paying then it was too late and she had the baby and her hold over him was telling prema she continued to live here got prema to hire adriana for backup to serve as an insurance policy if things got ugly adriana didnt turn out to be much insurance when qeesha and the baby disappeared adriana suspected the worst but going to the police wasnt an option childcare aide makes accusations against megacelebs no evidence to back it up how far would that get so adriana decided to stick around and snoop then the baby skeleton showed up under holly ruches tree and it made the news and someone heard about it and thought it would be a grand idea to ditch a second set of bones not far from there so the police would think some sort of serial ghoul was at work fifty years between dumps is a serial not well thought out i said not a genius he said aka donny hes the one with the wax and the knives and the bugs and the guns according to prema all verifiable accusations and im the verifier we left wedds room milo carried the appointment book away from his body gotta get an evidence bag for this heres something else to chew on alex donny dumping his own kids bones and doing adriana the same night seems like a challenge for someone supposedly that dumb i said agreed had to be a twoperson job donny and wedd that way thered be no need to schlep adriana across the park wedd was premas guy by day but donnys pimp and paymaster and whoknowswhatelse by night the maids knew about it everyone knew about it except prema wedd was a wannabe actor wanted to emulate the stardrove the same kind of car as the star he wasnt ridiculing donny when he imitated him over the phone he was pretending to be him hell alex maybe it was more than that what if wedd had a crush on donny so when donny asks him to take care of nasty business hes fine with it unfortunately donny grew uncomfortable with his knowing too much and took care of him i said nighttime drive weed and a bong sure it fits wedd probably figured hed be partying with his idol power of celebrity he said it even got the best of a wily manipulative woman like qeesha if her head had been clear shed have known from the way donny shut out four kids that he wouldnt take well to fatherhood to being pressured playing her usual game he said but out of her league footsteps at the mouth of the corridor made us turn tyler oshea held a tiredlooking sally at the end of a slack leash milo said anything oshea gave a thumbsdown only dead thing in that forest was a really gross rotting squirrel way at the back thats what was attracting her sorry el tee no big deal said milo you knew already i never know kid thats what makes the job fun oh okay so were finished not even close chapter we came upon morry burns and prema leaving the big house burns walked ahead of her wheeling his dolly now piled high with boxes when he saw us he picked up speed prema stopped stood there for a second walked back through her front door when burns reached us milo said youre really starstruck morry burns said huh whatd you learn her system stinks burns cocked a head at the mansion all that dough the kids have rooms like a broadway production and she cheaps out on crap hardware i could get technical but it wouldnt mean anything to you so leave it at crap nothings linked real pain to go through each machine same question huh learn anything burns tapped a metal case nah but i took her hard drive will dig deeper also drives from other machines they useget thisto buy groceries orgahnic arugula no need to encrypt that what about the kids computers two desktops for four of them burns cackled maybe theyre learning how to share shes got them on every parental lock known to mankind theyre lucky to get the weather maybe thats why they hardly ever go online i said could be they like to read burns stared at me as if id talked in tongues to milo we through here not even close oshea and burns took a lunch break near the pool takeout mexican milo had brought along we found prema in her cavernous kitchen sitting at a granitetopped counter drinking tea no maid in sight the cctv screens remained inert milo said do you have those real estate documents you need to actually see them we do she left returned a few minutes later heres the trust deed on the entire property milo read carefully per deputy da john nguyens instructions as you can see im the sole owner she said i bought it before i knew him a divorce lawyer would laugh at that but for milos purposes the deed was sufficient he produced a form of his own premas consent to search the entire property she scrawled her name without reading okay she said drumming granite youre sure hes over there he drove in late like one thirty in the morning hasnt left since i saw it right there pointing to the bank of screens it records twentyfourseven it sure does everything feeds into a computer and before you got here i scrolled through he has not left does detective burns have the hard drive for that computer premas perfect mouth formed an o sorry forgot to tell him about it but all it does is record feed from the security system and most of thats blank wheres the computer she slid open a drawer beneath the screens pulled out a small laptop how far back do you keep recordings hmm i really dont know burnss grumpiness turned to outright hostility i told you to give me everything you didnt think to mention this prema said iit slipped my mind he began pushing buttons muttered nother piece of crap prema looked to me for support i gave her a whoknows smile she returned to her tea as burns fiddled with the laptop what date do you want lieutenant milo told him hmmph here you go nothing the night of the murders until one thirtythree am when a vehicle passed through donny raders gate big dark suv no front plate said burns tough luck for you lieutenant the camera angle could pick it up from across the kitchen prema said thats got to be his hes piled up a bunch of tickets for not putting on a front plate burns mumbled ooh major scofflaw blocking premas view with his own bulk milo placed his hand on burnss shoulder burns looked up at milo milos wolfgrin lowered his head a naughty child finally disciplined milo pulled out the pages hed received from dmv regs on donny raders sixteen vehicles four ferraris three porsches a lamborghini a maserati a stryker a pair of mercedeses an aston martin rapide a vintage jaguar etype two suvs both black a range rover and ford explorer go back lets see if we can figure out which it is three rewinds later the bet was on the explorer milo said now go forward sure lieutenant we didnt need to wait long fortynine seconds after the first suv had exited an identical set of wheels rolled through raders gate front plates on this one milo said freeze that and checked the tags against his notes yup wedds prema said mel was there any reason he would be she shook her head rested her chin in her hand and stared at nothing milo said why dont you relax somewhere ms moon its okay ive got nowhere to go low morose tone burns looked at her as if for the first time bland curiosity no sympathy milo prodded burnss shoulder with a fingertip keep going twentynine seconds after wedds exit a third vehicle smaller shaped like a car zipped through premas gate pinpointing the make and registration was easy brandnew hyundai accent banner rental it took several calls but milo finally reached a supervisor at the companys corporate headquarters in lodi and obtained the details adriana betts had rented the car three days prior from the banner office on santa monica boulevard in west la taking advantage of special weeklong rates poor deluded woman playing amateur detective milo took the laptop from burns fastforwarded through another ten minutes twenty nothing he handed the machine back to burns said lets go prema said its happening in a bit ms moon why the delay were organizing maam now i suggest you go and find a place where you can just as long as you do it before the tribe returns i cant have them exposed to bad things i thought if it were only that simple chapter we headed for premas acre of parking lot burns said fresh air finally i said you dont like actors dont try to shrink me doc milo said its a reasonable question morry whatever your bullshit is it came close to obstructing burns turned pale i its still a good question morry whatever said burns he began to walk ahead of us thought better of it stopped threw his hands up my sister was an actor did some crap offbroadway nothing serious she killed herself five years ago completely ruined my parents lives sorry i said the business was too much for her how would i know about the business said burns she ruined their lives by killing herself because she was a narcissistic drama queen always had been milo said morry stay in the van see if you can do anything else with the machines yeah sure ill get nothing but ill try as burns loaded his equipment tyler oshea emerged with sally he rubbed sallys scruff the dog looked rejuvenated milo said were a go ty lets do it on foot im gonna start with the soft approach nothing swatty because this jokers no genius he has drug issues and a closetful of guns im hoping the element of surprise will be enough plus hes famous said oshea what does that have to do with it more of a surprise el tee probably no one ever bugs him famous said milo if everything works out thatll change to infamous the walk from premas property to raders took six minutes sally wouldve preferred to run it in two milo had the gate code courtesy prema moon had to keep it simple lieutenant because he cant remember anything he pushed the buttons the gate cooperated we continued along asphalt in need of resurfacing longer steeper access than to premas estate an easy quarter mile with nothing visible other than greenery at some points the trees grew so thick that the sky disappeared and day turned to imposed dusk oshea said man likes his privacy milo lengthened his stride oshea took that as the shut up it was meant to be as we kept climbing sallys fur rippled in the breeze soft but acute eyes analyzed the world at hand her posture was erect her trot rich with pride workdog heaven then she stopped oshea said would you look at that the road ended abruptly at a mesa filled with cars enough parking space for a dozen vehicles positioned properly but i counted seventeen sets of wheels stacked within inches of one another some extending to the surrounding brown grass donny raders black explorer was positioned nearest to the road slightly apart from the automotive clog easy exit for the daily driver milo photographed the suv from several angles scribbled in his pad the other cars exemplars of highticket italian german and british coachwork were caked with dust splotched by birddirt fuzzed by leaves a few tilted on deflated tires sixteen matches to the dmv list the addition was a red convertible sandwiched in the center of the stack milo squeezed his way over to the bmw took more pictures made more notes oshea said can i ask why that one el tee victims wheels he kept it what an idiot lets hope he stays that way onward the house was a low long box that had been stylish in the fifties my guess was an expat architect from europeschindler or neutra or someone trying to be schindler or neutra the kind of siteconscious minimalist design that ages well if its kept up this one hadnt been a roof meant to be flat sagged and dipped stress cracks wrinkled white stucco grimed to gray windows were pocked with birdshit rain streaks and pits blemished the flat facade like premas property raders acreage was backed by forest but everything else was hardpack we approached the house internal shutters blocked off the view the architect had intended the door was a slab of ash in need of varnish solid though milos knock barely sounded he pushed the doorbell no chime or buzzer that i could hear louder knock the door opened on a girlwoman in a thong bikini her hair was a riot of white and black and flamingopink late teens or early twenties she stared at us with bleary heavylidded eyes white powder smudged the space between her perfect nose and her perfect lips the bikini was white barely qualified as a garment with the bra not much more than pasties on a string and the bottom a nylon triangle not up to the job of pelvic protection breasts the size of grapefruits heaved a split second after the rest of her chest moved the mammary equivalent of digital delay her feet were bare and grubby her nails bloodred talons she rubbed her eyes huh police maam is mr rader here she swiped at the white granules above her mouth milo said dont worry about your breakfast we just want to talk to donny rader the girls mouth opened a frogcroak emerged then a squeak then donnee no need to shout rader was already behind her materializing from the left wearing a red silk robe the robe was loosely belted exposing a hard tan body the pockets bulged a bottle of something with a boozetax seal around the neck poked from one the contents of the other were out of view maybe a bag of white powder or just a glass if he bothered with a glass he pushed the girl out of the way did the same eye rub whus happening big man larger and more muscular than he came across on the screen coarser with a nearneanderthal brow shelf grainy skin thickened nostrils that flared like a bulls long shaggy inkblack hair flew everywhere his eyes fought to remain open described in the fan mags as black they were actually deep brown just enough contrast to see the pupils widely dilated despite the bright afternoon light white powder on his face too a thick smear on his lips and chin snowy dust littered the red robes shawl collar the top seam of the other robe pocket milo said police mr rader whu the fuh throaty growl the iconic slur police fuh donny rader backed away milo said hold on wed just like to talk about whu wed like to come in mr rader whu the fuhey you aint cops youre some shit from her trying to mess with my mind sir i can assure assure my asshole get the fuh outta here mr rader we really are the police and we donny rader shook himself off hard hair billowing a hyena clearing its maws of blood the girl in the bikini had remained behind him clutching her face and hyperventilating milo stepped forward aiming to get his toe in the door howling rader jammed his hand into the robe pocket that didnt hold the bottle yanked out something metallic and shiny he faded back began to straighten his arm the last time milo had faced madness hed been caught offguard and id saved his life that didnt fit the script of seasoned cop and shrink and despite his acknowledgment it would scar him maybe thats why this time he was ready one of his hands clamped like a beartrap on the wrist of donny raders gunarm pushing down and twisting sharply as his foot shot between raders bare legs and kicked laterally to the left as rader lost balance milos other arm spun him around and by the time tyler oshea was ready with cuffs and a now snarling sally rader was down on the ground and the lay safely out of reach rader foamed at the mouth turned dirt to chocolate soda the girl in the bikini whimpered milo said ty take care of her oshea checked out the tight tan body youre a pal el tee he cuffed the girl displaying no particular reverence something to the left caught his eye el tee you better look at this something new in his voice fear milo hauled a struggling howling donny rader to his feet hold still and shut it fuh you oshea walked the girl out of the house he looked stunned you got to see this milo said check it out alex the house was a sty piles of trash blanketed the floor and the furniture the air was putrid with rotted food body odor weed a medicinal smell that mightve been poorly cut cocaine a caturine stench that mightve been cats or crystal meth oshea had seen and smelled worse so that wasnt it not wanting to disturb potential evidence i stepped carefully over the garbage then i saw it hanging from a low rafter the feet dangling a few inches from the floor a human skeleton wired and braced by a steel rod running parallel to the spine stripped and clean but for hair left on the head long hair dark curly fullsized skeleton i guessed it shorter than me by at least six inches the pelvic arch left no doubt female the jaws had been positioned to create a gaping cartoonish grin exaggerated glee that was the essence of horror i made my way through the slopheap got right up to the skeleton sniffed new smell pleasant sweet herbaceous honeybees buzzing in the hive chapter milo plastictied raders ankles and belted him into the brown vans second row tyler oshea positioned sally up front as a sentry she enjoyed snapping and growling at the now cringing weeping actor allowing himself the luxury of an unlit cigar clenched between tight jaws milo played the phone calling in jail transport crime scene techs the coroners the chiefs office almost as an afterthought the boss was out milo declined to leave a message tyler oshea continued to guard the girl in the bikini barbara brandi podesky selfdescribed as a performer and dancer had no wants but a warrant did pop out of the database failure to show up for community service on a firstoffense marijuana bust shed be heading to west la lockup the news stunned her and she began whining that she was cold oshea checked out her body said well get you something soon not a trace of sincerity milo went to look at the skeleton emerged seconds later and positioned himself in the doorway chewing his lip and wiping his face he got back on the phone as he waited for a connection his facial muscles relaxed and something aspiring to be a smile stretched his lips ms lemasters milo sturgis yeah i know it has been but not to fret howre your acereporter chops this beautiful day and are you still in love with your husband why because trust me kelly youre gonna dig me more than him do i have a scoop for you just as he clicked off the chief beeped in milo began to supply details i already knew so i left him there figuring to walk off some excess energy i circled right of the carcrush came facetoface with prema moon milo had instructed her to stay behind some leading women didnt take well to direction where is he she said in the van but you need to stay away why wouldnt i stay away so its over for the justice system it was just beginning i said yes no response for a second then she winked at me turned her back and tossed her hair and offered a frisky shake of her perfect rear laughinga giddy knowing brittle soundshe walked off the set chapter on tv it would have been a cinch the female skeletons dna tracked to qeesha dembo that of the baby in the park was linked to both qeesha and donny rader bloodstains bone fragments skin flakes and hair found in the double garage that rader had set up as his taxidermic workshop belonged to mother and child several of the women located through mel wedds little blue book confirmed that rader had often retired to the dark dingy space after partying demanding to be left alone with his projects the bullet pulled from mel wedds brain matched a in raders firearms closet raders collection consisted of thirtyseven poorly maintained weapons included an uzi and a russian assault rifle milo had hoped that the bullet pulled from adriana betts would match the gun hed taken from rader but it didnt couldnt be traced to any of raders armaments that lent credence to the notion that someone else most probably melvin jaron wedd had murdered her most probably at raders request but good luck proving that the more i thought about raders and wedds identical suvs the stronger the heroworship scenario got but deputy da john nguyen didnt like it was intent upon finding something more ominous and premeditated i need creepy psycho stuff alex give me manson bloodlust a folie a deux the works milo said seems creepy enough as is john never enough nguyen grinned maybe ill get a book deal out of it reality was the case would stretch on for months maybe years donny rader despite being buttressed by an army of highpriced legal talent had failed in his request for bail but the special cell he occupied at the mens jail put him safely away from the gangbangers and the lunatics and the trophyhunters and stories had begun to circulate about special privileges for the star mailbags overflowing with love letters sent by severely disturbed women all over the world female deputies charmed by the artfully slurring actor kelly lemasters got a serious book deal from a new york publisher and quit the times tough luck john n the smart money had rader avoiding trial via diminished capacity serving some time in a cushy mental hospital maybe eventually getting out i wasnt so sure then again id been wrong about so much at this point i could live with that one month and five days after raders arrest i drove to western pediatric medical center looked for salome greiner found her again in the doctors dining room late in the day for lunch just her and her jello cottage cheese and tea as if she never left the place i sat down across from her she said the prodigal psychologist returns i said jimmy asherwood was a wonderful man who led a tragic life i can see why youd want to protect him i have no desire to smear his memory he did nothing to deserve that quite the contrary she sighed for all her vitality an old woman i felt like a troublesome son continued anyway i know about his war injury know that any relationship you and he had wasnt sexual anger caused her mandible to jut from you she said softly id expect a bit more imagination that threw me she said what exactly do you want rather than answer i said jimmy respected the right of a woman to control her own body but he was aware that sometimes womengirlscould be pushed into decisions they really didnt want girls from a certain social caste whod created an inconvenience for their families enter swedish hospital goods and services for cash darling what could be more patriotic when the girls decided to terminate jimmy went along with it but unlike the other physicians he tried to find out what they really wanted stepped in when he felt they were being steamrolled howd he convince the parents youre the expert on human nature my guess is he told them the procedure could endanger their daughters life and ill bet some parents didnt care and found themselves another doctor because for a certain genre of alleged human being stigma trumps everything her response was to saw a cube of jello i said when the babies were born jimmys involvement didnt end just the opposite he took care of everything with the help of eleanor green a compassionate soul who loved kids exactly the type of person who should become a nurse ellie she said a liverspotted hand rose to her breast i said ellie and you maybe others army of the just she said we were a little battalion of idealistic meddlers she put down her fork after dachau i felt i needed to i touched her hand she pulled away are you satisfied alex sometimes jimmy delivered the babies sometimes you did when the infants were up to the journey they were transferred to ellies care in a big house in a nice neighborhood that jimmy rented for that purpose after being medically screened for a few months they were given to families who wanted them people whod been screened not official adoptions everything had to be off the record thirtythree she said thats how many we placed people all over the country thirtythree adults who have no idea thirtythree minus one i said what happened shaking her head she got up i expected her to leave but she walked to the hotwater urn filled a fresh cup unwrapped a tea bag watched it dangle when she returned to the table i said salome im sorry if crib death thats what we called it then later we got fancy the way we always do and it became sudden infant death syndrome that didnt explain what caused it but it sounded more scientific no nowadays we have our theories but we still dont really understand it we do know how to prevent a significant amount of it sleeping on the back never the stomach she smiled all those babies with flat heads parents get all exercised thinking their little gifts going to grow up looking funny and not get into harvard i tell them relax stop worrying about stupid things she shook her head no sleeping on the tummy so simple thats how shehow ellie found him on his belly not moving a boy boy babies are more vulnerable than girl babies maybe that never changes eh alex i said you live longer than we do thats why we get to postpone our maturity now her hand rested on mine you were always a witty one i got myself some coffee the two of us drank for a while before she said ellie thought it was her fault jimmy and i found her rocking the baby hed been dead for a full day shed sat with him all that time didnt want to let go of his body shivering i had to pry it from her so you allowed her to bury him in the backyard she gripped both my hands exerted astonishing pressure why not alex her grief was monumental and we couldnt exactly report it to the health department of course not i said we had a little ceremony at night nondenominational each of us offered a prayer whispering to avoid alerting the neighbors jimmy dug the hole i planted a little sycamore tree id purchased at the nursery and flowers clivia around the base theyre beautiful orange love the shade we wanted samwe gave him a name so hed be someonewe wanted to place him in a miniature coffin but we couldnt figure out where to find one without arousing suspicion so we used something else metal box from the hospital used to bring money to the bank its what we had the alternative was what an orange crate i assumed there was symbolism salome what he was seen as having great value she stared at me smiled i like that i will adjust my memories to include that now if youll excuse me did jimmy and the rest of you continue placing babies of course she said but ellie stopped nod what happened to her she moved to another city i will not tell you where married a man who loved her i will not tell you his name had a baby of her own died thats all you need to know alex i stood thank you you will tell the policeman no reason to then whyah of course you were always driven a little obsessive maybe i smiled it happens chapter ninety days after
