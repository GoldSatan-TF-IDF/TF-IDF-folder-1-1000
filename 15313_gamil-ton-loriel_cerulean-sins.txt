mentioned here books ago to darla without whom so much would go undone to sherry for keeping the place livable to sergeant robert cooney of the st louis city police mobile reserve unit for answering my lastminute questions he did not have time to read over this manuscript so all mistakes are mine and mine alone and as always to my writing group tom drennan n l drew rhett mcphearson deborah millitello marella sands sharon shinn and mark sumner it was early september a busy time of year for raising the dead the prehalloween rush seemed to start earlier and earlier every year every animator at animators inc was booked solid i was no exception in fact id been offered more work than even my ability to go without sleep could supply mr leo harlan should have been grateful to get the appointment he didnt look grateful truthfully he didnt have the look of anything harlan was medium medium height dark hair but not too dark skin neither too pale nor too tan eyes brown but an indistinguishable shade of brown in fact the most remarkable thing about mr harlan was that there was nothing remarkable about him even his suit was dark conservative a businessmans outfit that had been in style for the last twenty years and probably would still be in style twenty years down the road his shirt was white his tie neatly knotted his nottoobig nottoosmall hands were well groomed but not manicured his appearance told me so little that that in itself was interesting and vaguely disturbing i took a sip from my coffee mug with the motto if you slip me decaf ill rip your head off id brought it to work when our boss bert had put decaf in the coffeemaker without telling anyone thinking we wouldnt notice half the office thought they had mono for a week until we discovered berts dastardly plot the coffee that our secretary mary had gotten for mr harlan sat on the edge of my desk his mug was the one with the logo of animators inc on it hed taken a minute sip of the coffee when mary had first handed it to him hed taken the coffee black but he sipped it like he hadnt tasted it or it didnt really matter what it tasted like hed taken it out of politeness not out of desire i sipped my own coffee heavy on the sugar and cream trying to make up for the late work the night before caffeine and sugar the two basic food groups his voice was like the rest of him so ordinary it was extraordinary he spoke with absolutely no accent no hint of region or country i want you to raise my ancestor ms blake so you said you seem to doubt me ms blake call it skepticism why would i come in here and lie to you i shrugged people have done it before i assure you ms blake i am telling the truth trouble was i just didnt believe him maybe i was being paranoid but my left arm under the nice navy suit jacket was crisscrossed with scarsfrom the crooked crossshaped burn scar where a vampires servant had branded me to the slashing claw marks of a shapeshifted witch plus knife scars thin and clean compared to the rest my right arm had only one knife scar it was nothing in comparison and there were other scars hidden under the navy skirt and royal blue shell silk didnt care if it slid over scars or smooth untouched skin id earned my right to be paranoid what ancestor do you want raised and why i smiled when i said it pleasant but the smile didnt reach my eyes id begun to have to work at getting my smiles to reach all the way up to my eyes he smiled too and it left his eyes as unaffected as my own smile because you were smiled at not because it really meant anything he reached out to pick up the coffee mug again and this time i noticed a heaviness in the left front of his jacket he wasnt wearing a shoulder holsterid have noticed thatbut there was something heavier than a wallet in his left breast pocket it could have been a lot of things but my first thought was gun ive learned to listen to my first thoughts youre not paranoid if people really are out to get you i had my own gun tucked under my left arm in a shoulder holster that evened things up but i did not want my office to turn into the o k corral he had a gun maybe probably for all i knew it could have been a really heavy cigar case but id have bet almost anything that that heaviness was a weapon i could either sit here and try to talk myself out of that belief or i could act as if i was right if i was wrong id apologize later if i was right well id be alive better alive and rude than dead and polite i interrupted his talk about his family tree i hadnt really heard any of it i was fixated on that heaviness in his pocket until i found out whether it was a gun or not nothing else much mattered to me i smiled and forced it up into my eyes what is it exactly that you do for a living mr harlan he drew a slightly deeper breath settling into his chair just a bit it was the closest thing id seen to tension in the man the first real human movement people fidget harlan didnt people dont like dealing with people who raise the dead dont ask me why but we make them nervous harlan wasnt nervous he wasnt anything he was just sitting across the desk from me chilling nondescript eyes pleasant and empty i was betting hed lied about his reason for coming here and that hed brought a gun hidden on his person in a place that wasnt easy to spot i was liking leo harlan less and less i sat my coffee mug gently on my desk blotter still smiling id freed up my hands which was step one drawing my gun would be step two i was hoping to avoid that step i want you to raise one of my ancestors ms blake i dont see where my work has any relevance here humor me i said still smiling but feeling it slide out of my eyes like melting ice why should i he said because if you dont ill refuse to take your case mr vaughn your boss has already taken my money he accepted on your behalf i smiled and this time it held real humor actually bert is only the business manager at animators inc now most of us are full partners in the firm like a law firm bert still handles the business end of things but hes not exactly my boss anymore his face if it was possible went quieter more closed more secretive it was like looking at a bad painting one that had all the technicalities down yet held no feel of life the only humans id ever seen that could be this closed down were scary ones i wasnt aware of your change in status ms blake his voice had gone a tone deeper but it was as empty as his face he was ringing every alarm bell i had my shoulders were tight with the need to pull my gun first my hands slid downward without me thinking about it it wasnt until his hands raised to the arms of his chair that i realized what id done we were both maneuvering to a better position to draw down suddenly there was tension thick and heavy like invisible lightning in the room there was no more doubt i saw it in his empty eyes and in the small smile on his face this was a real smile no fake no pretense we were seconds away from doing one of the most real things one human being can do to another we were about to try to kill each other i watched not his eyes but his upper body waiting for that betraying movement there was no more doubt we both knew into that heavy heavy tension his voice fell like a stone thrown down a deep well his voice alone almost made me go for my gun i am a contract killer but im not here for you anita blake i didnt take my eyes from his body the tension didnt slacken why tell me then my voice was softer than his almost breathy because i havent come to st louis to kill anyone i really am interested in getting my ancestor raised from the dead why i asked still watching his body still treading the tension even hitmen have hobbies ms blake his voice was matteroffact but his body stayed very very still i realized suddenly that he was trying not to spook me i let my gaze flick to his face it was still bland still unnaturally empty but it also held something else a trace of humor whats so funny i asked i didnt know that coming to see you was tempting fate what do you mean i was trying to hold on to that edge of tension but it was slipping away he sounded too ordinary too suddenly real for me to keep thinking about drawing a gun and shooting up my office it suddenly seemed a little silly and yet looking into his dead eyes that humor never completely filled it didnt seem all that silly there are people all over the world who would love to see me dead ms blake there are people who have spent considerable money and effort to see that such a thing would happen but no one has come close until today i shook my head this wasnt close normally id agree with you but i knew something of your reputation so i didnt wear a gun in my usual manner you noticed the weight of it when i bent forward that last time didnt you i nodded if wed had to draw down on each other your holster is a few seconds faster than this inner jacket shit that im wearing then why wear it i asked i didnt want to make you nervous by coming in here armed but i dont go anywhere unarmed so i thought id be slick and you wouldnt notice i almost didnt thanks for that but we both know better i wasnt sure about that but i let it go no need to argue when i seemed to be winning what do you really want mr harlan if that is your real name he smiled at that as ive said i really do want my ancestor raised from the dead i didnt lie about that he seemed to think for a second strange but i havent lied about anything he looked puzzled its been a long time since that was true my condolences i said he frowned at me what it must be difficult never being able to tell the truth i know id find it exhausting he smiled and again it was that slight flexing of lips that seemed to be his genuine smile i havent thought about it in a long time he shrugged i guess you get used to it it was my turn to shrug maybe what ancestor do you want raised and why why what why do you want to raise this particular ancestor does it matter he asked yes why because i dont believe the dead should be disturbed without a good reason that small smile flexed again youve got animators in this town that raise zombies every night for entertainment i nodded then by all means go to one of them theyll do anything you want pretty much if the price is right can they raise a corpse thats almost two hundred years old i shook my head out of their league i heard an animator could raise almost anything if they were willing to do a human sacrifice his voice was quiet i shook my head again dont believe everything you hear mr harlan some animators could raise a few hundred years worth of corpse with the help of a human sacrifice of course that would be murder and thus illegal rumor has it that youve done it rumor can say anything it damn well pleases i dont do human sacrifice so you cant raise my ancestor he made it a flat statement i didnt say that his eyes widened the closest to surprise that hed shown you can raise a nearly twohundredyearold corpse without a human sacrifice i nodded rumor said that too but i didnt believe it so you believed that i did human sacrifice but not that i could raise a few hundred years worth of dead people on my own he shrugged im used to people killing other people ive never seen anyone raised from the dead lucky you he smiled and his eyes thawed just a little so youll raise my ancestor if you tell me a good enough reason for doing it you dont get distracted much do you ms blake tenacious thats me i said and smiled maybe id spent too much time around really bad people but now that i knew that leo harlan wasnt here to kill me or anyone else in town i had no problem with him why did i believe him for the same reason i hadnt believed him the first time instinct ive followed the records of my family in this country back as far as i can but my original ancestor is on no official documents i believe he gave a false name from the beginning until i get his true name i cant track my family through europe i very much wish to do that raise him ask his real name his real reason for coming to this country and put him back i made it a question harlan nodded exactly it sounds reasonable enough so youll do it he said yes but it aint cheap im probably the only animator in this country that can raise someone this old without using a human sacrifice its sort of a sellers market if you catch my drift in my own way ms blake i am as good at my job as you are at yours he tried to look humble and failed he looked pleased with himself all the way to those ordinary and frightening brown eyes i can pay ms blake never fear i mentioned an outrageous figure he never flinched he started to reach into the inside of his jacket i said dont my credit card ms blake nothing more he took his hands out of his jacket and held them fingers spread so i could see them clearly you can finish the paperwork and pay in the outer office ive got other appointments he almost smiled of course he stood i stood neither of us offered to shake hands he hesitated at the door i stopped a ways back not following as closely as i normally do room to maneuver you know when can you do the job im booked solid this week i might be able to squeeze you in next wednesday maybe next thursday what happened to next monday and tuesday he asked i shrugged booked up you said and i quote im booked solid this week then you mentioned next wednesday i shrugged again there was a time when i wasnt good at lying even now im not great at it but not for the same reasons i felt my eyes going flat and empty as i said i meant to say i was booked up for most of the next two weeks he stared at me hard enough to make me want to squirm i fought off the urge and just gave him blank vaguely friendly eyes next tuesday is the night of the full moon he said in a quiet voice i blinked at him fighting to keep the surprise off my face and i think i succeeded but i failed on my body language my shoulders tensed my hands flexed most people noticed your face not the rest of you but harlan was a man who would notice damn it so its the full moon yippeeskippy what of it my voice was as matteroffact as i could make it he gave that small smile of his youre not very good at being coy ms blake no im not but since im not being coy thats not a problem ms blake he said voice almost cajoling please do not insult my intelligence i thought about saying but its so easy but didnt first it wasnt easy at all second i was a little nervous about where this line of questioning was going but i was not going to help him by volunteering information say less it irritates people i havent insulted your intelligence he made a frown that i think was as true as that small smile the real harlan peeking through rumor says that you havent worked on the night of the full moon for a few months now he seemed very serious all of a sudden not in a menacing way almost as if id been impolite forgotten my table manners or something and he was correcting me maybe im wiccan the full moon is a holy day for them you know or rather night are you wiccan ms blake it never took me long to grow tired of word games no mr harlan i am not then why dont you work on the night of the full moon he was studying my face searching it as if for some reason the answer were more important than it should have been i knew what he wanted me to say he wanted me to confess to being a shapeshifter of some kind trouble was i couldnt confess because it wasnt true i was the first human nimirra leopard queen of a wereleopard pard in their history id inherited the leopards when i was forced to kill their old leader to keep him from killing me i was also bolverk of the local werewolf pack bolverk was more than a bodyguard less than an executioner it was basically someone who did the things that the ulfric either couldnt or wouldnt do richard zeeman was the local ulfric hed been my offagain onagain honeybun for a couple of years right now it was off very off his parting shot to me had been i dont want to love someone who is more at home with the monsters than i am what do you say to that what can you say damned if i know they say love conquers everything they lie as nimirra and bolverk i had people depending on me i took the full moon off so id be available it was simple really and nothing i was willing to share with leo harlan i sometimes take personal days mr harlan if theyve coincided with the full moon i assure you its coincidental rumor says you got cut up by a shifter a few months back and now youre one of them his voice was still quiet but i was ready for this one my face my body everything was calm because he was wrong i am not a shapeshifter mr harlan his eyes narrowed i dont believe you ms blake i sighed i dont really care if you believe me mr harlan my being a lycanthrope or not has no bearing on how good i am at raising the dead rumor says youre the best but you keep telling me the rumors are wrong are you really as good as they say you are better youre rumored to have raised entire graveyards i shrugged youll turn a girls head with talk like that are you saying its true does it really matter let me repeat i can raise your ancestor mr harlan im one of the few if not the only animator in this country that can do it without resorting to a human sacrifice i smiled at him my professional smile the one that was all bright and shiny and as empty of meaning as a lightbulb will next wednesday or thursday be alright he nodded ill leave my cell phone number you can reach me twentyfour hours a day are you in a hurry for this lets just say that i never know when an offer may come my way that i would find hard to resist not just money i said he gave that smile again no not just money ms blake i have enough money but a job that holds new interests new challenges im always searching for that be careful what you wish for mr harlan theres always someone out there bigger and badder than you are i have not found it so i smiled then either youre even scarier than you seem or you havent been meeting the right people he looked at me for a long moment until i felt the smile slide from my eyes i met his dead eyes with my own in that moment that well of quietness filled me it was a peaceful place the place i went when i killed a great white static empty place where nothing hurt where nothing felt looking into harlans empty eyes i wondered if his head was white and empty and staticky i almost asked but i didnt because for just a second i thought hed lied lied about it all and he was going to try and draw his gun from his jacket it would explain why he wanted to know if i was a shapeshifter for a heartbeat or two i thought id have to kill mr leo harlan i wasnt scared now or nervous i just readied myself it was his choice live or die there was nothing but that slow eternal second where choices are made and lives are lost then he shook himself almost like a bird settling its feathers back in place i was about to remind you that i am a very scary person all by myself but i wont now it would be stupid to keep playing with you like this like poking a rattlesnake with a stick i just looked at him with empty eyes still held in that quiet place my voice came out slow careful like my body felt i hope you havent lied to me today mr harlan he gave that unsettling smile so do i ms blake so do i with that odd comment he opened the door carefully never taking his eyes from me then he turned and left quickly shutting the door firmly behind him and left me alone with the adrenaline rush draining like a puddle to my feet it wasnt fear that left me weak but the adrenaline i raised the dead for a living and was a legal vampire executioner wasnt that unique enough did i have to attract scary clients too i knew i should have told harlan no dice but i had told him the truth i could raise this zombie and no one else in the country could do itwithout a human sacrifice i was pretty sure that if i turned it down harlan would find someone else to do it someone else that didnt have either my abilities or my morals sometimes you deal with the devil not because you want to but because if you dont someone else will lindel cemetery was one of those new modern affairs where all the headstones are low to the ground and you arent allowed to plant flowers it makes mowing easier but it also makes for a depressingly empty space nothing but flat land with little oblong shapes in the dark it was as empty and featureless as the dark side of the moon and about as cheerful give me a cemetery with tombs and mausoleums stone angels weeping over the portraits of children the mother mary praying for us all her silent eyes turned heavenward a cemetery should have something to remind the people passing by that there is a heaven and not just a hole in the ground with rock on top of it i was here to raise gordon bennington from the dead because fidelis insurance company hoped he was a suicide not an accidental death there was a multimillion dollar insurance claim at stake the police had ruled the death accidental but fidelis wasnt satisfied they opted to pay my rather substantial fee in the hopes of saving millions i was expensive but not that expensive compared with what they stood to lose i was a bargain there were three groups of cars in the cemetery two of the groups were at least fifty feet apart because both mrs bennington and fideliss head lawyer arthur conroy had restraining orders against each other the third group of two cars was parked in between the others a marked police car and an unmarked police car dont ask me to explain how i knew it was an unmarked police car it just had that look i parked a little in back of the first group of cars i got out of my brand new jeep grand cherokee which was partially purchased by money i got from my now deceased jeep country squire the insurance company hadnt wanted to pay up on my claim they didnt believe that werehyenas had eaten the country squire they sent out some people to take photos and measurements to see the bloodstains they finally paid up but they also dropped my policy im paying month by month to a new company that will grant me a full policy if and only if i can manage not to destroy another car for two years fat chance of that my sympathies were all for gordon benningtons family of course its hard to have sympathy for an insurance company that is trying to squirm out of paying a widow with three children the cars closest to me turned out to be those of fidelis insurance arthur conroy came towards me hand outstretched he was on the tall end of short with thinning blond hair that he combed over his bald spot as if that hid it silverframed glasses that circled large gray eyes if his eyelashes and eyebrows had been darker his eyes would have been his best feature but his eyes were so large and unadorned that i thought he looked vaguely froglike but then maybe my recent disagreement with my insurance company had made me uncharitable maybe conroy was accompanied by a nearsolid wall of other darksuited men i shook conroys hand and glanced behind him at the two sixfootplus men bodyguards i made it a question conroys eyes widened how did you know i shook my head they look like bodyguards mr conroy i shook hands with the other two fidelis people i didnt offer to shake hands with the bodyguards most of them wont shake hands even if you do offer i dont know if it ruins the toughguy image or they just want to keep their gun hands free either way i didnt offer and neither did they the darkhaired bodyguard with shoulders nearly as broad as i was tall smiled though so youre anita blake and you are rex rex canducci i raised eyebrows at him is rex really your first name he laughed that surprised burst of laughter that is so masculineand usually at a womans expense no i didnt bother to ask what his real first name was probably something embarrassing like florence or rosie the second bodyguard was blond and silent he watched me with small pale eyes i didnt like him and you are i asked he blinked as if my asking had surprised him most people ignored bodyguards some out of fear of not knowing what to do because theyve never met one some because they have met one and figure theyre just furniture to be ignored until needed he hesitated then said balfour i waited a second but he didnt add anything balfour one name like madonna or cher i asked voice mild his eyes narrowed his shoulders a little tense hed been too easy to rattle he had the stare down and the sense of menace but he was just muscle scary looking and knew it but maybe not much else rex intervened i thought youd be taller he made it a joke with his happytomeetyou voice balfours shoulders had relaxed the tension draining away theyd worked together before and rex knew that his partner was not the most stable cookie in the box i met rexs eyes balfour would be a problem if things turned messy hed overreact rex wouldnt i heard raised voices one of them a woman shit id told mrs benningtons lawyers to keep her home theyd either ignored me or been unable to withstand her winning personality the nice plainclothes policeman was talking to her his voice calm but carrying in a low wordless rumble as he apparently tried to keep her fifty feet away from conroy weeks ago shed slapped the lawyer and hed bitchslapped her back shed then put a fist to his jaw and sat him on his ass that was about the time the court bailiffs had had to step in and break things up id been present for all the festivities because i was part of the court settlement sort of tonight would decide the issue if gordon bennington rose from the grave and said hed died by accident fidelis had to pay if he admitted to suicide then mrs bennington got nothing i called her mrs bennington at her insistence when id referred to her as ms bennington shed nearly bitten my head off she was not one of your liberated women she liked being a wife and mother i was glad for her it meant more freedom for the rest of us i sighed and walked across the white gravel driveway towards the sound of rising voices i passed the uniformed cop leaning against his car i nodded said hi he nodded back his eyes mostly on the insurance people as if someone had told him that it was his job to make sure they didnt start coming over or maybe he just didnt like the size of rex and balfour both men had him by a hundred pounds he was slender for a police officer and still had that untried look in his face as if he hadnt been on the job long and hadnt yet quite decided whether he wanted to be on the job at all mrs bennington was yelling at the nice officer who was barring her way those bastards have hired her and shell do what they say shell make gordon lie i know it i sighed id explained to everyone that the dead dont lie pretty much only the judge had believed me and the cops i think fidelis thought my fee had insured their outcome and mrs bennington thought the same she finally spotted me over the cops broad shoulders in her high heels she was taller than the officer which meant she was tall and he wasnt very he was maybe five nine tops she tried to push past him yelling at me now he moved just enough so that he blocked her way but didnt have to grab her she banged against his shoulder and frowned down at him it stopped her yelling for a second get out of my way she said mrs bennington his deep voice grumbled ms blake is here by order of the court you have to let her do her job he had short gray hair a little longer on top i didnt think it was a fashion statement more like he hadnt had time to go to the barbershop in awhile she tried to push past him again and this time she grabbed him as if shed move him out of her way he wasnt tall but he was broad built like a square a muscular square she realized quickly that she couldnt push him so she moved to walk around him still determined to give me a piece of her mind he had to grab her arm to keep her away from me she raised a hand to him and his deep voice came clear in the still october night if you hit me i will handcuff you and put you in the back of the squad car until were all finished here she hesitated her hand raised but there must have been something in his face still turned away from me that said clearly that he meant every word his tone of voice had been enough for me id have done what he said finally she lowered her arm ill have your badge if you touch me striking a police officer is considered a crime mrs bennington he said in that deep voice even by moonlight you could see the astonishment on her face as if somehow she hadnt quite realized any of the rules applied to her the realization seemed to take a lot of the wind out of her she settled back and let her cadre of darksuited lawyers lead her a little away from the nice police officer i was the only one close enough to hear him say if shed been my wife id have shot myself too i laughed i couldnt help it he turned eyes angry defensive but whatever he saw in my face made him smile count yourself lucky i said ive seen mrs bennington on several occasions i held out my hand he shook like he meant business good solid lieutenant nicols and my condolences on having to deal with he hesitated i finished the sentence for him that crazy bitch i believe that is the phrase youre searching for he nodded that is the phrase i sympathize with a widow and children getting the money that is due them he said but she makes it awful hard to sympathize with her personally ive noticed that i said smiling he laughed and reached into his jacket for a pack of cigarettes mind not out here in the open i guess besides youve earned it dealing with our wonderful mrs bennington he tapped the cigarette out with one of those expert movements that longtime smokers use if gordon bennington rises from the grave and says he offed himself she is going to go ballistic ms blake im not allowed to shoot her but im not sure what else im going to be able to do with her maybe her lawyers can sit on her i think theres enough of them to hold her down he put the cig between his lips still talking theyve been fu freaking useless too afraid of losing their fee fucking useless lt fucking useless is the phrase youre searching for he laughed again hard enough that he had to take the cigarette out of his mouth fucking useless yeah thats the phrase he put the cig between his lips again and took out one of those big metal lighters that you dont see much anymore the flame flared orangey red as he cupped his hands around it automatically even though there was no wind when the end of his cig was glowing bright he snapped the lighter shut and slid it back into his pocket then took the cig out of his mouth and blew a long line of smoke i took an involuntary step back to avoid the smoke but we were outdoors and mrs bennington was enough to drive anyone to smoke or would that be drink can you call in more men they wont be allowed to shoot her either nicols said i smiled no but maybe they can form a wall of flesh and keep her from hurting anyone i could probably get another uniform maybe two but thats it shes got connections with the top brass because shes got money and may end up having a lot more after tonight but shes also been fucking unpleasant he seemed to relish saying the fword almost as much as smoking the cigarette as if hed had to watch his language around the grieving widow and it had hurt her political clout getting a little tarnished i asked the papers plastered her decking conroy all over the front page the powers that be are worried that this is going to turn into a mess and they dont want the mess to land on them so theyre distancing themselves in case she does something even more unfortunate i said he took a deep deep pull off the cig holding it almost like someone smoking a joint then let the smoke trickle out of his mouth and nose as he answered me distancing thats one word for it bailing jumping ship abandoning ship he was laughing again and he hadnt finished blowing out all the smoke so he choked just a little but didnt seem to mind i dont know if youre really this amusing or if i just needed a laugh its stress i said most people dont find me funny at all he gave me a look sort of sideways out of surprisingly pale eyes i was betting they were blue in sunlight i heard that about you that you were a pain in the ass and rub a lot of people the wrong way i shrugged a girl does what she can he smiled but the same people that said you could be a pain in the ass had no trouble working a case with you fact is ms blake he threw the cigarette on the ground most said theyd take you as backup over a lot of cops they could name i didnt know what to say to that there is no higher praise between policemen than that theyd let you back them up in a life or death situation youre going to make me blush lt nicols i didnt look at him as i said it he seemed to be gazing down at the stillsmoldering cigarette on the white gravel zerbrowski over at rpit says that you dont blush much zerbrowski is a cheerfully lecherous shit i said he chuckled a deep roll of laughter and stomped out his cigarette so that even that small glow was lost in the dark that he is that he is you ever met his wife ive met katie ever wonder how zerbrowski managed to nab her every damn time i see her i said he sighed ill call for another squad car try for two uniforms lets get this done and get the hell away from these people lets i said he went to make the call i went to fetch my zombieraising equipment since one of my main tools is a machete bigger than my forearm id left it in the car it tends to scare people i would try very hard tonight not to scare the bodyguards or the nice policemen i was pretty sure there was nothing i could do to scare mrs bennington i was also pretty sure there was nothing i could do to make her happy with me my zombieraising equipment was in a gray nike gym bag some animators have elaborate cases ive even seen one who had a little suitcase that turned into a table like a magicians or a street vendors me i made sure everything was packed tight so nothing got broken or scratched up but other than that i didnt see the point to being fancier than you needed to be if people wanted a show they could go down to the circus of the damned and watch zombies crawl from the grave with actors pretending to be terrified of them i wasnt an entertainer i was an animator and this was work i turned down halloween parties every year where people wanted zombies raised at the stroke of midnight or some such nonsense the scarier my reputation got the more people wanted me to come be scary for them id told bert i could always go and threaten to shoot all the partygoers thatd be scary bert had not been amused but he had stopped asking me to do parties id been trained to use an ointment spread over face hands heart the smell of rosemary like breathing in a christmas tree still held a great nostalgia for me but i didnt use the ointment anymore id raised the dead in emergencies without it more than once so it got me to thinking some believed it helped the spirits enter you so the powers that be could use you to raise the dead most in america anyway believed that the scent and touch of the herbal mixture enhanced your psychic abilities or helped open them so theyd work at all i never seemed to have any trouble raising the dead my psychic abilities were always on line for animating so i still carried the ointment just in case but i didnt use it much anymore the three things i did still need for animating were steel fresh blood and salt though the salt actually was to put the zombie back in the grave once we were finished with it id cut my paraphernalia to the absolute minimum and recently id cut it down even more and i mean that cut part literally my left hand was covered in little bandages i was using the clear ones so i didnt look like a tan version of the mummys hand there were larger bandages on my left forearm all the wounds were selfinflicted and it was beginning to piss me off i had been learning how to control my growing psychic powers by studying with marianne who had been a psychic when i met her but had become a witch she was wiccan now not all witches are wiccan and if marianne had been another flavor of witch i wouldnt have had to cut myself up marianne as my teacher shared some of my karmic debt or so her groupread covenbelieved the fact that i killed an animal every time i raised the dead three four times a night almost every night had made her coven rant rave scream and basically lose it blood magic is black magic to a wiccan taking a life for magical purposes any life even a chickens is very black magic how could marianne have tied herself to someone who was being so evil they demanded to know to help mariannes karmic burdenand mine the coven assured meid been trying to raise the dead without killing anything id done it in emergencies without an animal to sacrifice so i knew it was possible butsurprise surprisewhile it was true that i could do my job without killing anything i could not do it without fresh blood blood magic is still black magic to wiccans so what to do the compromise was that i would use only my own blood i wasnt sure it would work but it did for the recently dead at least id started out slicing up my left forearm but that had rapidly lost its appeal since i needed to do it three or more times a night then id taken to pricking my fingers just a little blood seemed to be enough for those dead under six months but id run out of fingers and my arm had enough scars already id also found that when i practiced lefthanded shooting that i was slower because the cuts freaking hurt i would not cut up my right hand because i couldnt afford to be slower with my right id pretty much decided that while i was sorry i had to kill a few chickens or goats to raise the dead the animals lives were not worth my own there ive said it a totally selfish judgment call id really hoped the tiny cuts would heal instantly thanks to my ties to jeanclaude master vamp of the city i healed fast very fast the little cuts didnt heal fast marianne said it was probably because i was using a magically charged blade to do the cutting but i liked my machete truthfully i wasnt a hundred percent sure that i could raise the dead with only a prick of blood without a magically charged blade it was a problem i was going to have to call marianne and tell her id failed the wiccan test of goodness why should they be any different most rightwing christian groups hated me too i glanced behind me at my audience two new uniformed police officers had joined lt nicols and the first officer the police stood in the middle of the two groups which had been allowed to come close enough to the grave to hear what the zombie would say it was way closer than fifty feet but both parties needed to hear gordon bennington or so the judge had ruled the judge in question had actually joined us along with a court reporter and her little machine hed also brought along two burly looking bailiffs which made me think the judge was even smarter than he looked and id been pretty impressed before not every judge will take zombie testimony for tonight lindel graveyard was court i was glad that court tv hadnt gotten wind of it it was just the kind of weird crap that they liked to televise you knowtranssexuals custody case female teacher rapes thirteenyearold boy student profootball players murder trial the o j simpson trial had not been a good influence on american television the judge said in his booming court voice which echoed strangely in the flat emptiness of the cemetery go ahead ms blake were all assembled ordinarily id have beheaded a chicken and used its body to help me sprinkle a blood circle a circle of power to contain the zombie once it was raised so it wouldnt go wandering all over the place the circle also helped focus power and raise energy but i had no chickens at the moment there was a chance that if id tried to get enough blood out of my body to walk even a small circle of power id be finished for the night too dizzy and too lightheaded to do anything else so whats a morally upright animator supposed to do i sighed and unsheathed the machete and heard several gasps behind me it was a big blade but id found that in beheading a chicken onehanded you needed a big sharp blade i stared at my left hand and tried to find a space that was bandage free i put the top edge of the blade against my middle finger the symbolism was not lost on me and pressed i kept the machete too sharp to risk drawing the blade down my finger it would be a bitch to need stitches because id cut too deep the cut didnt hurt immediately which meant id probably cut deeper than i wanted i raised my hand so the moonlight fell on it and saw the first dark welling of blood the moment i saw it the cut hurt why was it that everything hurt worse when you realized you were bleeding i began to walk the circle holding the steel point downward my bleeding finger flat to the earth so that occasional drops would hit the ground id never truly felt the machete carving the magic circle through the ground through me until i stopped killing animals it had probably always been like a steel pencil tracing my circle but id never ever been able to feel it over the stronger rush of the death i felt each drop of blood that fell felt the earth almost hungry for it like rain in a drought but it wasnt the moisture the earth drank it was the power i knew when id walked the entire circle around the headstone because the moment i touched the place where id begun the circle closed with a skintingling hairraising rush i turned to face the headstone feeling the circle around me like an invisible trembling in the air i went to the headstone which was at the far end of the circle i tapped the headstone with the machete gordon bennington with steel i call you from your grave i touched my bloody hand to the cold stone with blood i call you from your grave i moved back to the far edge of the circle at the foot of the grave hear me now gordon bennington hear and obey with steel blood and power i command you to rise from your grave rise from your grave and walk amongst us the earth rolled like heavy water and just spilled the body upward in the movies the zombies always crawl from the grave with reaching hands like the ground tries to keep them prisoner but most of the time the earth gives freely and the zombie simply rises to the top like something floating to the surface of a liquid there were no flowers to get in the way this time nothing for the body to trip over as the zombie sat up and looked around one thing i had noticed with not killing the animals was that my zombies werent as pretty with a chicken i could have made gordon bennington look like his photo in the paper with only my own blood he looked like what he was a reanimated corpse he wasnt awful id seen much worse but his widow screamed long and loud and began to sob there had been more than one reason i wanted mrs bennington to stay home the nice blue suit hid the chest wound that had killed him but you could still tell he was dead it was the odd color of his skin the way the flesh had begun to sink into the bones of his face his eyes left too round too large too bare so they rolled in their sockets barely contained by the waxy flesh his blond hair was patchy and looked like it had grown but that was illusion caused by the shrinking of the meat of his body hair and fingernails do not grow after death contrary to popular belief there was one more thing i had to do to help gordon bennington speak blood the odyssey speaks of blood sacrifice to get a dead seers ghost to give odysseus advice its a very old truism that the dead crave blood i walked across the now solid ground and knelt by his puzzled wizened face i couldnt smooth my skirt down in back because one hand was full of machete and the other was bleeding everyone got a nice long glimpse of thigh but it didnt really matter i was about to do the thing that disturbed me the most since i stopped sacrificing poultry i held out my hand towards gordon benningtons face drink gordon drink of my blood and speak to us those round rolling eyes stared at me then his sunken nose caught the scent of blood and he grabbed my hand with both of his and lowered his mouth to the wound his hands felt like cold wax with sticks inside his mouth was almost lipless so his teeth pressed close in my flesh as he sucked at my hand his tongue whipped back and forth on the wound like something separate and alive in his mouth feeding from me i took a deep steadying breath breathe in and out in and out i would not be sick nope i would not embarrass myself in front of this many people when i thought hed had enough i said gordon bennington he didnt react but kept his mouth pressed to the wound his hands clutching my wrist i tapped the top of his head gently with the side of the machete mr bennington people are waiting to talk to you i dont know if it was the words or the tap with the blade but he looked up and slowly began to pull back from my hand his eyes held more of him now the blood always seemed to do that fill them back up with themselves are you gordon bennington i asked we had to be all formal he shook his head the judge said we need you to answer out loud mr bennington for the record he stared up at me i repeated what the judge had said and bennington spoke i am was gordon bennington one of the upsides to raising the dead with only my blood was that they always knew they were dead id raised some before where they didnt know that and that was a bitch telling someone that they were dead and you were about to put them back in the grave real nightmare stuff that was how did you die mr bennington i asked he sighed drawing in air and i heard it whistle because most of the right side of his chest was missing the suit hid it but id seen the forensic photos besides i knew what a mess a twelvegauge shotgun makes at close range i got shot there was a tension behind me i could feel it over the buzz of the power circle how did you get shot i asked voice calm soothing i shot myself going down the stairs to our basement there was a cry of triumph from one side of the crowd and an inarticulate scream from the other did you shoot yourself on purpose i asked no of course not i tripped gun went off so stupid really so stupid there was a lot of screaming behind me mostly mrs bennington yelling i told you so little bitch i turned and called judge fletcher did you hear all that most of it he said he turned that booming voice on overdrive and shouted mrs bennington if you will be quiet long enough to listen your husband has just said he died by accident gail gordon benningtons voice was tentative gail are you there i did not want a tearful reunion on top of the grave are we finished judge can i put him back no this from fidelis insurances lawyers conroy stepped closer we have some questions for mr bennington they asked questions at first i had to repeat them for bennington to be able to answer but he got better at answering he didnt look any better physically but he was gathering himself up being more alert more aware of his surroundings he spotted his wife and said gail im so sorry you were right about the guns i wasnt careful enough im so sorry to leave you and the kids mrs bennington came towards us with her lawyers in tow i thought id have to ask them to keep her off the grave but she stopped outside the circle as if she could feel it sometimes the people that turn out to be psychically gifted surprise you i doubt if she was even aware of why she stopped moving forward of course she was holding her hands tight to her body she was not reaching out to touch her husband i dont think she wanted to find out what that waxy looking skin felt like i couldnt blame her conroy and the other lawyers tried to keep asking questions but it was the judge who said gordon bennington has answered all your questions in detail its time to let him get back to rest i agreed mrs bennington was in tears and gordon would have been too except his tear ducts had dried up months ago i got gordon benningtons attention mr bennington im going to put you back now will gail and the children get the insurance money now i glanced behind me at the judge he nodded yes mr bennington they will he smiled or tried to thank you then im ready he gazed back at his wife who was still kneeling on the grass by his grave im glad i got to say goodbye she was shaking her head over and over tears streaming down her face me too gordie me too i miss you i miss you too my little hell cat she burst into sobs at that hiding her face in her hands if one of the lawyers hadnt grabbed her shed have fallen to the ground my little hell cat didnt sound like a term of endearment to me but hey it proved gordon bennington had really known his wife it probably also proved that she would miss him for the rest of her life i could forgive her a few temper tantrums in the face of that much pain i squeezed on the wound in my finger and thankfully got a little more blood some nights i had to reopen a wound or make another one to get the zombie put back i touched my bloody hand to his forehead leaving a small dark mark with blood i bind you to your grave gordon bennington i touched him with the edge of the machete gently with steel i bind you to your grave i switched the machete to my left hand and picked up the open container of salt that id left inside the circle i sprinkled him with salt and it sounded like dry sleet as it hit him with salt i bind you to your grave gordon bennington go and rise no more with the touch of the salt his eyes lost their alertness he was empty as he lay back on the earth the ground swallowed him like some great beast had rippled its fur and he was just gone sunk back into the grave gordon benningtons corpse was back where it belonged and there was nothing to distinguish this grave from any other not so much as a blade of grass was out of place magic i still had to walk the circle backwards and uncast it normally i dont have an audience for that part the zombie goes back in the grave everyone leaves but conroy of fidelis insurance was arguing with the judge who was threatening to cite him for contempt and mrs bennington was not in a condition to walk yet the police were standing around watching the show lieutenant nicols looked at me and shook his head smiling he walked over to me as the circle went down and i began to clean my new wound with antiseptic wipes he lowered his voice so the truly grieving widow wouldnt hear him you could not pay me enough to let that thing suck my blood i halfshrugged holding gauze over my finger so it would stop bleeding youd be surprised what people pay for this kind of work it aint enough he said an unlit cigarette already in his hand i started to give some flip answer when i felt the presence of a vampire like a chill across my skin out there in the dark someone was waiting there was a gust of wind and there was no wind tonight i looked up and no one else did because humans never look up never expect death to fall upon them from the sky i had seconds to say dont shoot hes a friend before asher appeared in our midst very close to me his long hair streaming behind him his booted feet touching down he was forced to make a half running step to catch the momentum of his flight which brought him to my side i turned and put myself in front of his body he was too tall for me to cover all of him but i did my best moving us so that if anyone shot at him theyd risk hitting me every policeman every bodyguard had drawn a gun and every barrel was pointed at asher and at me i stared at the half circle of guns trying to keep an eye on everyone at once and failing because there were too many of them i kept my hands out from my body fingers spread universal sign for im harmless i didnt want anyone thinking i was going for my own gun that would be bad hes a friend i said voice a little high but otherwise calm whose friend nicols asked mine i said well he aint my friend one of the uniforms said hes not a threat i said pressing my body back enough that i could feel asher in a long line against me he said something in french everybody gripped their guns a little tighter english asher english he took a deep shuddering breath it was not my intent to frighten anyone not too long ago the police were allowed to shoot a vampire on sight just for being a vampire it had only been five years since addison v clark had made vamps alive again at least to the law they were citizens with rights now and shooting them without just cause was murder but it still happened now and then if you shoot with me in the way you can all kiss your badges goodbye i dont have a badge to lose it was balfour of course being tough but he had a big gun to go with his big talk i looked at him if you shoot you better kill me because you wont get a second chance nobodys shooting anybody nicols said and i was close enough to hear him mutter damn it under his breath hed moved his gun to point at the bodyguards put the guns down now the other policemen followed his lead and suddenly the circle of guns was pointed away from me and at balfour and rex i let out a breath i hadnt realized i was holding and sagged a little against asher he knew better than to have surprised a bunch of humans especially policemen by flying into their midst nothing freaked people out like seeing vampires do things that were impossible hed also spoken in french which meant he was scared enough or angry enough to have forgotten his english something was very wrong but i couldnt question him not yet first get out of the line of fire then fix the rest we were standing so close together that his wavy golden hair brushed against my own black curls he put his hands on my shoulders and i could feel the tension he was scared what had happened the police had convinced the bodyguards to put their guns away the uniforms divided up and walked the two interested parties back to their respective cars it left nicols the judge and the court reporter standing near us at least the court reporter wasnt still typing nicols turned to me his gun pointed downward tapping a little against the leg of his slacks he frowned eyes flicking to asher then to me he knew enough not to risk staring the vampire in the eyes they could bespell you with their eyes if they wanted to i was immune because i was the human servant of the master vampire of the city through jeanclaude i was safe from most of what asher could do not all but most nicols was obviously unhappy okay what was so damned urgent that he had to fly in here like that damn he was too good a cop even though hed probably dealt very little with vampires hed made the logic jump that only an emergency would make asher appear as he had his eyes flicked up to asher again then down to my face its a good way to get yourself shot mr asher i answered for him i didnt ask you ms blake i asked him i am asher he said in a voice that fell on the air like a caress he was using vampire powers to make himself more acceptable if nicols figured out what he was doing it would backfire but it didnt whats wrong mr asher just asher and the voice glided across my skin so soothing i had some immunity to the voice but nicols didnt he blinked then frowned puzzled fine asher what the hell is the rush ashers fingers tightened minutely on my shoulders and i felt him take a breath i had a second to hope that he wasnt going to try an obiwan on lieutenant nicols you know these are not the droids youre looking for nicols was stronger willed than that musette has been gravely injured i came to take anita to her side i felt the color drain from my face my breath caught in my throat musette was one of belle mortes lieutenants belle morte was the fountainhead le sourdre de sang of jeanclaude and ashers bloodline she was also a member of the council of vampires that had a home base somewhere in europe every time council members had visited us people had died some of them ours some of them theirs but belle morte had never sent anyone until now there had been some careful negotiations about musette coming over for a visit she was due three months from now just after thanksgiving so what the hell was she doing in town a month and some change before halloween i didnt for a minute believe musette was hurt that was ashers sneaky way of telling me how bad things were in front of witnesses i didnt have to pretend to be shocked or scared my face must have looked like someone whod just gotten bad news nicols nodded as if satisfied you close to this musette lieutenant can we please go i want to get there as soon as possible i was already looking around for my gym bag i was glad it was already packed my skin was cold with the thought of what musette might be doing right now to people i cared about the very mention of her name had always been enough to make jeanclaude and asher go pale nicols nodded again putting up his gun yeah go on i hope your friend is okay i looked up at him and didnt try to hide the confusion in my eyes i hope so too i wasnt thinking of musette i was thinking of everyone else so many people she could hurt if she had the blessing of the council or at least the blessing of belle morte id learned that council politics meant that having one member as an enemy didnt mean that the others hated you in fact many of the council seemed to believe the old sicilian adage the enemy of my enemy is my friend the judge murmured his thanks and hopes for speedy recovery of my friend the court reporter didnt say anythingshe was gazing at asher as if mesmerized i didnt think hed bespelled her more like shed never seen anything so beautiful maybe she hadnt his hair in the reflected glow of the headlights was truly gold a curtain of nearly metallic waves flowing like a shining sea across the right side of his face the hair looked even more gold against the dark brown of his silk shirt the shirt was longsleeved and untucked over blue jeans and brown boots he looked like hed dressed in haste but i knew that was how he usually dressed he made sure that the left side of his face that most perfect of profiles was what showed to the light asher was a master at using light and shadow to highlight what he wished seen and hide what he did not the one eye that was visible was a clear pale blue like the eyes of a siberian husky dog human beings just didnt have eyes like that even in life he must have been extraordinary you got glimpses of that full mouth the glimmer of his other blue blue eye what he was careful not to show to the light was that a few inches past his eye trailing in a line nearly to his mouth were scars rivulets of scars where holy water had been poured on that most beautiful of faces more scars ran down the right side of his body hidden under the clothes the court reporter stared at him so still as if shed stopped breathing asher saw it and stiffened beside me perhaps because he knew that with a flick of his head he could show her the scars and watch that adoration turn to horror or pity i touched his arm lets go he walked towards my jeep normally he sort of glided as if vampire feet never rolled on gravel but floated just above it tonight he moved almost as heavily as a human neither of us spoke until we were inside my jeep we had the privacy of the darkened car no one would overhear us i buckled myself in while i talked whats happened musette arrived an hour ago i put the jeep in gear and began to drive carefully over the gravel around the stillparked police cars i waved at nicols as we went past and he waved back a cigarette flaring in his other hand i thought we hadnt finished negotiating on how many people she could bring over with her we had not his voice held sorrow so thick you could have squeezed it out tears in your cup jeanclaudes voice was better at sharing joy seduction but asher was the master at sharing the darker emotions i glanced at him he was staring straight ahead his face very still hiding whatever he was feeling then didnt she break some treaty or law or something by invading our territory like this he nodded his hair sliding around his face hiding himself from me i hated to watch him hide his scars from me i found him beautiful scars and all but he never quite believed me i think he thought the attraction was part jeanclaudes memories in my head and part pity there was no pity but i couldnt deny jeanclaudes memories i was jeanclaudes human servant and that gave me all kinds of interesting side benefits one of those benefits was getting glimpses of jeanclaudes memories i remembered ashers skin like cool silk on my fingertips every inch of him flawless but it was jeanclaudes fingers that had done the touching not mine the fact that i remembered the touch of ashers skin so strongly that even now i had the urge to reach for his hand just to see if the memory was real was just one of those odd things i had to live with even if jeanclaude had been in the car he wouldnt have touched asher either it had been centuries since theyd been part of a ménage а trois with julianna ashers human servant julianna had been burned as a witch by the same people that had used holy water to cleanse ashers evil jeanclaude had been able to save asher but hed been too late for julianna neither of the men had forgiven jeanclaude for his tardiness if musette broke the law cant we punish her or kick her out of our territory i was at the edge of the cemetery now watching for nonexistent traffic if it were another master vampire come so rudely then we would be within our rights to slay her but it is musette as you are bolverk for the werewolves so musette is belles he seemed to be searching for the word i do not know the word in english but in french musette is the bourreau she is our bogeyman anita and she has been such for over six hundred years fine i said shes scary i accept that but that doesnt change the fact that shes invaded our lands if we let her get away with it shell try for more anita it is more than that she is the he seemed to grope for a word again that he was forgetting this many english words spoke to how frightened he was the vaisseau why can i not think of the english for it youre upset i am frightened he said but belle morte has made musette her vessel to harm musette is to harm belle literally i asked as i turned onto mackenzie non it is more like a courtesy than magic she has given musette her seal her ring of office which means musette in effect speaks for belle we are forced to treat her as we would treat belle morte herself this was most unexpected what difference does this vaisseau make i asked we were stuck at the light on watson staring at the mcdonalds and the union planters bank if musette were not belles vessel then we could punish her for coming early and breaking off negotiations but if we punish her now then it would mean that we would do the same to belle if she came here so why wouldnt we punish belle for entering our territory so rudely as you put it asher looked at me then but i couldnt hold eye contact because the light had finally changed you do not understand what you are saying anita explain it to me then belle is our sourdre de sang our fountainhead she is our bloodline we cannot harm her why not he looked at me full face letting his hair fall back so that his whole face showed at last i think he was too shocked at my question to worry about hiding himself it is not done that is all what is not done defending your territory against all encroachers attacking the head of your line your sourdre de sang your fountain of blood it is just not done and i say again why not belle has insulted us not the other way around jeanclaude has negotiated in good faith its musette thats been the bad little vampire and if she comes with belles blessing then belle is abusing her status she thinks well just take whatever she dishes out dishes out he made it a question whatever she does to us she thinks well just take it just suck it up and take it without complaining she is right asher said i frowned at him then turned still frowning back to the road why why shouldnt we treat any threat or insult the same he ran his hands through his thick hair pulling it back from his face the streetlights crisscrossed his face in light and shadow we were stopped at another light with an suv beside us so that their window was even with ours the woman behind the wheel glanced at us then did a double take her eyes went round and asher didnt notice i looked at her and she looked away embarrassed at being caught staring americans are taught not to stare at anything that isnt perfect its like to look at it is to make it more real ignore it itll go away asher never noticed as the light changed and we drove off he was exposing his face to strangers and not noticing the effect it was having no matter how angry no matter how sad no matter how anything he never forgot the scars they dominated his thoughts his actions his life for him to forget like this said more than anything how serious the situation was and i still didnt understand why i dont understand asher we defended ourselves when council members invaded our territory awhile back we hurt them did our best to kill them why is this different he let go of his hair and swung it back into place like a curtain i dont think he was any less upset it was just habit last time it was not belle morte what difference does that make mon dieu do you not understand what it means that belle is the mother of our line apparently i dont explain it to me were going to the circus of the damned right it will take awhile to get there youll have time oui he stared out the window of the jeep as if looking for inspiration in the electric lights the strip malls and fast food restaurants he finally turned to face me how do i explain to you what you have never understood you have never had a king or queen you are american and young and you do not understand the duty owed a liege lord i shrugged i guess i dont then how can you understand what it is we owe belle morte and how it would be treason to raise a hand against her i shook my head thats a great theory asher but ive dealt with enough vampire politics to know one thing if we let her push us around shell see it as a sign of weakness and shell push and push until she sees how weak or how strong we are we are not at war with belle morte he said no but if she thinks we are weak enough that might be next ive seen how you guys operate the big vampire fish eat the little vampire fish we cant afford for musette or belle to think were little fish anita dont you understand yet we are little fish compared to belle morte we are very little fish indeed i had a hard time believing we were very little fish indeed maybe not big fish but that wasnt the same thing as being very little but asher was so obviously convinced of it that i didnt argue i did call on my cell phone and leave messages around town about musettes early arrival richard may have been pissed at me but he was still the other third of our triumvirate of power ulfric to jeanclaudes master of the city and my necromancer richard was jeanclaudes animal to call and i was his human servant whether we liked it or whether we didnt i also called micah callahan who was my nimirraj and took care of all the shapeshifters when i was off doing other things i was so often embroiled in other things i needed the help micah was also my boyfriend along with jeanclaude neither of them seemed to mind though it still made me uncomfortable i was raised to believe that a girl didnt date two people at once at least not seriously i got only machines and left messages that were as succinct and calm as i could make them how do you leave phone messages like this hi micah this is anita musette has come to town early invading jeanclaudes territory asher and i are driving to the circus now if you dont hear from me by dawn send help but dont come down to the circus before that unless i call personally the fewer people in the line of fire the better i let asher leave the message on richards machine sometimes he erased messages from me without listening to them it depended on how bad a mood he was in that day though hed dumped me not the other way around he acted like the wounded party and blamed me for everything i gave him as wide a berth as i could but there were times like now when we were probably going to have to work together to keep all our people alive and healthy survival took precedence over emotional pain it had to i hoped richard remembered that the circus of the damned was a combination of a live action drama with frightening themes traditional if macabre circus performances a carnival complete with rides games corn dogs funnel cakes and a side show that would give even me nightmares behind the circus was dark and quiet the calliope music that blared out front was a distant dream back here once upon a time id only come to the circus to kill vampires now i used the employee parking lot oh how the mighty have fallen i was actually a few steps from the jeep when i realized that asher was still sitting in the car immobile i sighed and went back to the car i had to tap on his window to get him to look at me i half expected him to jump but he didnt he just turned his face slowly towards me like someone in a nightmare who knows if they move too fast the monster will get them i expected him to open the door but he just stared at me i took a deep breath and counted slowly i did not have time to hold his emotional wounds closed jeanclaude my sweetie was down under the circus entertaining the bogeyman of vampirekind asher had told me no harm had come to anyone yet but i wouldnt actually believe it until i saw jeanclaude touched his hand as much as i cared for asher i did not have time for this none of us did i opened the door for him still he did not move asher dont fall apart on me here we need you tonight he shook his head you must know anita jeanclaude didnt send me to you because i travel faster than anyone else he sent me to get me away from her are you not supposed to go back in i asked he shook his head again all those golden waves swimming around his face his eyes were their normal iceblue in the dome light i am his témoin his second i must go back inside then youre going to have to get out of the jeep i said he looked down at his hands limp in his lap i know but he still didnt move i put one hand on the door and the other on the roof leaning in towards him asher if you cant do this then fly to my house hide in the basement weve got an extra coffin he did look up then there was anger in his face let you go in there alone no never if something happened to you he looked down again his hair hiding his face like the curtain hed made of it i could not live with the knowledge that i had failed you i sighed again great thanks for the sentiment i know you mean it but that means you have to get out of the car now a gust of wind slapped against my back too much wind like the wind asher had raised in the cemetery i went for my gun as i dropped to one knee damian landed in front of me the barrel of the gun was aimed low at his body if hed been a little shorter than six feet it would have been chest high i let out a breath slowly and eased my finger off the trigger damn damian you startled me and that can be real unhealthy i got to my feet sorry he said but micah wanted you to have someone else with you he spread his hands wide showing himself both unarmed and harmless he might have been unarmed but harmless never that it wasnt just that damian was handsomea lot of men dead and alive are handsome his hair fell in a straight silken curtain scarlet like a spill of blood it was what red hair looked like after more than six hundred years of no sun he blinked green eyes into the lights of the streetlamps overhead a green that any cat would envy the eyes were three shades brighter than the tshirt that clung to his upper body black slacks fell over black dress shoes a black belt with a silver buckle completed the outfit damian hadnt dressed up hed just been wearing slacks and dress shoes most of the vamps that had recently come from europe didnt feel comfortable in jeans and jogging shoes yeah he was a treat for the eyes but that wasnt the danger the fact that i wanted to touch him to run my hands up the white white skin of his arms that was the danger it wasnt love or even lust through a series of accidents and emergencies id bound damian to me as my vampire servant which was impossible i mean vamps have human servants but humans dont have vampire servants i was beginning to understand why the council used to kill all necromancers on sight damian was glowing with good health which meant hed recently fed on someone but i knew it had been a willing victim because id forbidden him to hunt he would do exactly what i said no more no less he obeyed me in all things because he had no choice i knew i could get here before you went inside he said yeah flying does have its benefits i shook my head and put up my gun i had to rub my hand on my skirt to keep from touching him the palm of my hand ached to caress his skin he wasnt my lover or boyfriend yet i craved his touch when he was near me in a way that felt disturbingly familiar i took a deep breath that seemed to shake just a little i told micah not to send anyone until id found out what was up damian shrugged hands up micah said go so here i am he kept his face carefully blank there was a tension to him that said he was waiting for me to hurt the messenger touch him asher said his quiet voice from right behind me made me jump but at least hed gotten out of the jeep what touch him ma cherie touch your servant i felt heat climb up my face is it that obvious he smiled at me but not like he was happy i remember what it was like with julianna he said her name in a whisper that still carried on the cool autumn air it startled me a little to hear him say her name he avoided her name if he could saying it or hearing it im jeanclaudes human servant but i dont feel an overwhelming need to touch him every time i see him he looked up at me you dont i started to say no then had to think about it i did want to touch jeanclaude when i saw him but that was the sex the rush of being a relatively new couple wasnt it i frowned and concentrated on something else does jeanclaude feel the same need to touch me like i feel for damian went unsaid almost certainly asher said i frowned harder he hides it well because to expose such raw need to you would have made you run away he touched my elbow a light touch i did not mean to give away uncomfortable secrets but we must show a united front for her this night when you touch damian you gain power just as when jeanclaude touches you and richard he gains power i took a deep breath let it out slowly one thing i was almost certain of was that richard wouldnt be here tonight he hadnt come near the circus of the damned since we broke up it weakened us that onethird of our triumvirate was missing hed promised to come to the circus in three months time to greet musette but he wouldnt come early i would bet my life on that and maybe i was who the hell knew what was inside the circus waiting for us i glanced from one vampire to the other then shook my head we needed to get inside and i needed to stop being squeamish asher needed it too but i couldnt control what he did only what i did i touched damians arm and power flared between us like a breath of wind i slid my hand down the smoothness of his arm using everything but the tips of my fingers the tips of my fingers hurt when they brushed things too solidly his breath came out in a shudder as i slid my left hand into his right squeezing my fingers round his as long as i didnt squeeze too hard my bandaged fingers were fine it felt so right to touch him it was hard to explain because touching him didnt make me think of sex it wasnt like touching jeanclaude or micah or even richard richard and i were feuding but he could still affect me just by being present when i could be in the same room with richard and not feel my body tighten then id know that i was truly out of love with him i dont mind that micah sent backup i felt his hand his arm his body give up the tension i hadnt even realized he was holding he smiled and squeezed my hand back good youve mellowed a voice behind us called we all whirled to find jason walking towards us over the pavement he was grinning proud hed startled us i think damn quiet for a werewolf i said he was wearing jeans jogging shoes and a short leather jacket jason was as american as i was we liked the casual look his blond hair was still cut short like a young executive it made him look older more grownup somehow without the hair to trail around his face you noticed his eyes more blue the color of an innocent spring sky the color never matched the twinkle in his eye a little warm for a leather jacket i said he unzipped the jacket in one smooth motion and flashed his bare chest and stomach still walking towards us never missing a beat sometimes i forgot that jasons day job was as a stripper at guilty pleasures one of jeanclaudes other clubs then there were moments like this when he managed to remind me i didnt have time to dress when jeanclaude sent me out to wait for you why the hurry i asked musette has offered to share her pomme de sang with jeanclaude if hell share me with her pomme de sang meant literally apple of blood it was slang with the vamps for someone that was much more than simply a blood donor jeanclaude had once described it as a beloved mistress except instead of sex you got blood a kept woman or in jasons case a kept man i thought it was a faux pas to ask to feed on someone elses pomme de sang i said it can also be a great courtesy and honor asher said you may trust musette to turn custom into torment if she is able so shes not offering up her pomme de sang to honor jeanclaude shes doing it because she knows he wont want to share jason oui asher said great just great what other little vampire customs are going to come up and bite us on the butt tonight he smiled and raised my hand to his lips for a quick chaste kiss many i would think ma cherie very many he looked at jason in truth i am amazed that musette allowed you to leave her presence without sharing blood jasons grin faded her pomme de sang is illegal in this country so jeanclaude had to decline illegal i said in what way he sighed looking decidedly unhappy the girl cant be more than fifteen and its against the law to take blood from a minor i said jeanclaude informed her of this which is how i come to be standing out here in the cold its not cold damian said jason shivered that is a matter of opinion he huddled the still unzipped jacket around his bare body jeanclaude doesnt want you to be surprised anita but two of the vamps with her are children i could feel my face tightening with anger its not that bad they arent new at a guess id say several hundred years old minimum even in the united states theyd be grandfathered in under the current law i tried to ease some of the tension i was holding id let go of everyones hand because i had this urge to have my hands free for weapons there was nothing to fight not yet but the urge was still there damian touched my arm tentative afraid the anger would spill over onto him i think my usual theory was anybody to be angry at was better than nobody to be angry at i was trying to be better than that more fair but damn it was hard when i didnt jerk away or yell at him damian touched my hand and his fingers light across my skin made me feel calmer do you think musette brought an underage pomme just to see what wed do musette likes the young asher said voice still very quiet not a whisper but close as if he were afraid of being overheard and maybe he was i looked up at asher damians fingers were still moving lightly over the back of my hand shes not a pedophile please tell me shes not he shook his head no not for sex anita but blood yes she likes them young yuck she cannot take blood from anyone under eighteen while shes in this country doing that can get you an order of execution with your name on it and im the executioner i believe that musette was carefully chosen by belle morte belle has other lieutenants that have less objectionable habits i believe that musette is an ordeal in the traditional sense of the word she has been sent by belle to test us especially you i think you and perhaps richard why do we get special treatment i asked because belle does not know either of you of old she likes to test her blades before blooding them anita i am not her blade im not her anything asher had a patient look on his face she is le sourdre de sang the fountainhead of our bloodline belle is like an empress and all the master vampires that descend from her line are kings that owe her fealty to owe fealty means to owe so many troops to the cause what cause he let out an exasperated breath whatever cause the empress wishes i shook my head youre not really making sense to me here damians hand was still playing lightly over mine i think if he hadnt been touching me id have been more upset belle considers all who descend from her line hers thus through jeanclaude you and richard belong to her i shook my head and started to speak asher held up his hand please let me finish it does not matter anita whether you agree that you and richard belong to belle it matters only that she believes you belong to her she sees you as more weapons in her arsenal can you understand that i understand what youre saying i dont agree that i belong to anyone but i can see where belle morte might think so he nodded looked a little relieved as if he hadnt been sure what hed do if id continued to argue bon bon then you must agree that belle will want to test the metal of her two newest weapons test how i asked for one thing by bringing an underage pomme de sang to america and flaunting it in front of the executioner herself if musette has offered to share pomme de sangs then she may also offer to share human servants it is considered a great honor to do so share i asked instantly suspicious damians fingers had sped up but i didnt tell him to stop because anger was tightening my shoulders my arms share blood probably because most vampires take blood from their human servants do not worry about sex ma cherie musette is not a lover of women i half shrugged i guess thats a relief i frowned if she considers me and richard part of her whatever then what about his pack and my pard does belle consider our people her people asher licked his lips and i knew the answer before he said it it would be like her to assume that so musette and company will be testing not just me or richard but the rest of our people i made it a statement it is logical to assume so he said i closed my eyes and shook my head i hate vampire politics shes not yelling yet jason said ive never seen her this calm after this much bad news i opened my eyes and frowned at him i believe it is damians influence asher said jasons eyes flicked down to where damian was playing gently with my hand you mean just touching her like that is helping her hold her temper asher nodded i had an urge to make damian stop touching me but i didnt because i was furious how dare anyone come into our territory and test us how arrogant how typically vampire and i was tired already tired of the games to come if jeanclaude would just let me shoot everyone in musettes party tonight it would save a lot of trouble i just knew it would i did make damian stop playing with my hand by taking his hand in mine and holding it firmly the edge of my anger softened i was still angry but it was distant manageable damn asher was right i hated that hated that some new metaphysical bullshit had reached up to force me into closer personal contact with yet another vampire why couldnt metaphysics work just once without all the touchiefeelie crap jason was looking at us an odd expression on his face i think we should attach damian to anita for the night you think musette is going to piss me off that badly i asked shes not hurt anyone yet anita not raised a finger to anyone yet everyones terrified im fucking terrified and i cant figure out why shes this cute little blond thing and shes gorgeous like a life size barbie doll with smaller breasts but hey a man doesnt need more than a mouthful right youre oversharing i said he didnt smile at me his face was way too serious normally i wouldnt mind a gorgeous vampire sinking fang into me but anita i do not want this chick to touch me he looked scared all of a sudden scared and younger even than his twentytwo years i do not want her touching me he stared up at me with haunted eyes jeanclaudes promised me that musette isnt one of those vampires who rots all over you but it doesnt matter im still so scared of her that it makes my stomach hurt i reached out my free hand and jason came to me i hugged him and could feel a fine tremble running through him he was cold but not the kind of cold that extra clothes would fix well keep her off of you jason he hugged me so tight it was hard to breath and he spoke with his face against my neck dont promise things you cant deliver anita i opened my mouth to promise just that when asher interrupted no anita do not promise safe passage to any of us not yet not until you have met musette i drew back from jason and looked up at asher if i just shoot her dead when i walk in the room what would belle do he paled and thats a neat trick for a vampire even one thats fed you cannot you must not anita i beg of you you know that if i killed her tonight wed all be safer he opened his mouth closed it opened it anita ma cherie please jason stepped back from me and made a motion with his hands damian was at my back hands on my shoulders the moment he touched me i felt better not exactly calmer not even clearerheaded because i was right we should kill musette tonight in the short run it would save so much trouble but in the long run belle morte maybe even the whole council would come in force and kill us i knew that with damians hands kneading gently on the tight muscles of my shoulders i could even agree with it why does damians touch make me feel less like killing things i asked i have noticed that you seem to gain a measure of calm an extra layer of thoughtfulness before you pull the trigger when he is touching you jeanclaude isnt one bit less ruthless when im around him you can only gain from your servant what your servant has to offer asher said i would say that you have helped make jeanclaude more ruthless not less because that is your nature he looked at the vampire standing behind me damian survived for centuries with a mistress that tolerated no anger no pride her will and her will alone was allowed damian learned to be less angry less ruthless or shewhomadehim would have destroyed him long ago damians hands had gone very still against my shoulders i patted one of his hands the way youd pat a friend that was hearing bad news its alright damian she cant touch you now no jeanclaude bargained for my freedom from her and i will always owe him a great debt for that but that has nothing to do with blood oaths or vampiric bonds i owe him for bringing me out of a terrible bondage if you can keep anita from doing anything unfortunate tonight then you will have paid part of that debt asher said i felt damian nod then let us go down to the underground for i know musette of old and i do not fear her as much as i fear shewhomademe i turned so i could see damians face are you implying that you fear musette only a little less than shewhomadeyou he seemed to think about that for a second or two then slowly nodded i fear my old master more but yes i fear musette all fear her asher said damian nodded all fear her i laid the top of my head against damians chest shaking my head back and forth messing up my hair but i didnt care damn it if youd just let me kill her tonight now it would save so much trouble im right you know im right damian raised my face so i had to meet his eyes if you slay musette then belle morte will destroy jeanclaude what if musette does something really terrible damian looked behind me at asher i turned so i could watch the vampires exchanging glances asher finally spoke i would never want to tell you that under no circumstances are we to slay musette because there may come a time when she gives you no choice i would not have you endanger yourself by hesitating if that time comes but i think that musette will play the political game very well and will give you no excuse so awful as that i sighed if you dont handcuff damian to anita tonight shes never going to make it through musettes little show jason said i do not believe that will be necessary asher said will it anita i frowned how the hell should i know besides im fresh out of handcuffs jason drew a pair out of his jacket pocket you can borrow mine i frowned harder what are you doing carrying around a pair of handcuffs i held up my hand wait i dont want to know he grinned at me im a stripper anita i use all sorts of props on one hand it was good to know that jason didnt carry the handcuffs around for his own love life on the other hand i wasnt sure i wanted to know that handcuffs were part of his props as a stripper what kind of shows were they doing down at guilty pleasures these days wait i didnt really want an answer to that question either we all trooped to the back door of circus of the damned we didnt use jasons handcuffs but i did end up walking down all those stairs holding damians hand there was a growing list of people that walking hand in hand with i would have found romantic or titillating damian wasnt on the list mores the pity deep under the circus of the damned were what seemed like miles of underground rooms they had been the home of st louiss master of the city whoever that happened to be for as long as anyone could remember only the huge warehouse above ground had changed jeanclaude had modernized the underground redecorated some of it but that was all it was still room after room of stone and torches to soften the stone look jeanclaude had used huge gauzy drapes to make a sort of tent for his living room walls the outside was white but once you parted the first set of hangings the walls were silver gold and white jason had reached out to part the drapes when jeanclaude pushed through he motioned us all back a finger to his lips i swallowed my greeting he was wearing skintight leather pants tucked into thighhigh boots so it was hard to tell where the pants left off and the boots began the shirt was one of his typical shirts something sort of s with mounds of ruffles at sleeves and neck but the color of all that silk was something id never seen him in a vibrant blue somewhere between royal and navy the color made his midnight eyes bluer than ever his face was as always flawless breathtaking it was as always like some wet dream come to life too beautiful to be real too sensuous to be safe my heart was hammering in my throat i wanted to fling myself on him to wrap myself around him like a blanket i wanted all those black curls to sweep along my body like i was being caressed by living silk i wanted him i almost always wanted him but tonight i wanted him with everything that was happening and about to happen all i could think of was sex sex with jeanclaude he glided towards me and i held out a hand so he wouldnt touch me if he laid so much as a finger on me i wasnt sure what id do he looked puzzled and i heard his voice in my head what is wrong ma petite i still didnt have the trick of talking mindtomind down pat so i didnt try i just held up my left hand and pointed at my watch it was ten to midnight like cinderella i needed to be home by midnight every night id told my coworkers that it was a lunch break and it was sometimes i even got food but what i had to feed every twelve hours didnt have much to do with my stomach no lower places definitely lower places jeanclaudes eyes went wide in my head he said ma petite please tell me you have fed the ardeur already i shrugged twelve hours ago i didnt bother to whisper the vampires behind the curtains would hear it so i used a normal tone of voice it wasnt like i was going to be able to hide the ardeur from them anyway the ardeur was one of the side effects of being jeanclaudes human servant in another age jeanclaude would have been considered an incubus because he could feed on lust not just feed upon it but cause others to lust after him it was a way of making more of what you needed in an emergency he could feed off of lust and forgo blood for a few days it was very rare for a vampire to have a secondary power like this damians master had been able to feed off of fear shed been what they call a night hag or mora belle morte of course held the ardeur she had used it for centuries to manipulate kings and emperors jeanclaude was one of the few of her bloodline to inherit this particular power and i was to my knowledge the only human servant to ever inherit it from anyone when the ardeur first awoke in a vamp it controlled them just like the blood lust then gradually they learned to control it or that was the plan since id had it id fought like hell so that i only had to feed every twelve hours or so the feeling didnt have to involve intercourse but there did have to be sexual contact all those old stories about succubi and incubi killing people by loving them to death were true i could not feed off the same person every time micah let me feed off him jeanclaude had been waiting to share the ardeur with me for years though hed thought it would be him doing the feeding not me id been forced to make nathaniel one of my wereleopards into my own version of a pomme de sang embarrassing as hell but it beat the heck out of molesting strangers which was entirely possible if you fought the ardeur it was a hard taskmistress just like belle morte the plan for tonight had been to go to my house and meet with micah but instead i was here at the circus that wasnt bad in itself because jeanclaude was always willing unfortunately we had big bad vampires in the next room and i didnt think theyd wait while we had hot monkey sex call it a hunch but i suspected musette would be sympathetic the trouble was the ardeur wasnt sympathetic either the men were all standing around with that oh my god silence thick on the ground we were all looking at jeanclaude to solve this what do we do i asked he looked lost for a moment then he laughed that touchable caressable laugh it made me shudder and only damian grabbing me kept me from falling i waited for the ardeur to spread to him like the contagious disease it could be but it didnt the moment he touched me the ardeur receded like the ocean pulling back from the shore i felt light and clean clearheaded i could think again i clutched damians arm like it was the last piece of wood in the ocean i turned wide eyes to jeanclaude he was looking very serious i feel it too ma petite we knew through practice that if jeanclaude concentrated on controlling the ardeur he could help me control it as well but when he wasnt concentrating the fire burned through us both like some overwhelming force of nature i felt damians sorrow at my cool touch felt it like a taste across my tongue as if rain could have a flavor i knew that damian wanted me in that good olfashioned way that had very little to do with hearts and flowers and everything to do with lust he craved me the way he did blood because to be without me was to die damian was over six hundred years old but hed never be a master vampire which meant that literally his original mistress had made his heart beat his body walk then jeanclaude had been his animating force and then accidentally id stolen him from jeanclaude and now it was my necromancy that made his blood flow his heart beat id been horrified to find that i had in effect a pet vampire id tried to ignore what id done run from it id been running from so many things but i knew that damian wasnt one of those things that i could ignore if i cut myself off from damian he would first go mad then he would die in truth of course long before he faded away the other vampires would have had to execute him you couldnt have a sixhundredyearold vampire gone stark raving mad running around the city slaughtering people it was bad for business how did i know what would happen if i denied damian because i hadnt known he was my vampire servant for the first six months after it had happened he had gone mad and he had slaughtered innocents jeanclaude had imprisoned him waiting for me to come home waiting for me to live up to my responsibilities instead of running from them damian had been one of my object lessons that you either embraced your power or others paid the price i looked at jeanclaude he was still beautiful but i could look at him without wanting to swarm all over him this is amazing i said if you would have let damian touch you like this months ago we would have discovered it sooner jeanclaude said there was a time not that long ago that i would have resented being reminded of my own shortcomings but one of my new resolutions was not to argue about everything picking my battles that was the goal jeanclaude nodded walked over to me and held out his hand my apologies for the earlier indiscretion ma petite but i am master now no longer pawn of the fire that burns us both i stared at the hand so pale longfingered graceful even without the ardeur s interference he was always fascinating in ways that i had no words for i took his hand while still clutching damians arm jeanclaudes fingers closed around mine and my heart stayed calm the ardeur did not raise its lascivious head he raised my hand to his mouth slowly touched his lips to my knuckles nothing happened he risked a caress of his lips sliding along my skin it did make me catch my breath but the ardeur did not rise he stood upright my hand still in his he smiled that brilliant smile that i valued because it was real or as close to real as he could come hed spent centuries schooling his face his every motion to be courtly graceful and give nothing away he found it hard to simply react come ma petite come let us meet our guests i nodded sure he wrapped my arm through his and looked at damian take her other arm mon ami let us escort her inside damian settled my hand on the smooth muscled skin of his forearm with pleasure master normally jeanclaude didnt like his vamps calling him master but tonight wed be formal we were trying to impress people who hadnt been impressed by anything in centuries asher stepped forward to get the drapes jason went to the other side and they held the drapes aside for us so we could enter without having to bat at the drapes there are reasons that wallhangings over doorways fell out of favor the only downside to having an attractive vampire on each arm was that i couldnt go for my gun quickly of course if i had to draw a gun as soon as we went through the door then the night was going to be a bad one bad enough that we might survive this night but not the next musette stood by the white brick fireplace it had to be her because she was the only little blond barbie doll in the room and thats how jason had described her jason had a lot of faults but describing a woman inaccurately was not one of them she was indeed small shorter than me by at least three inches which made her barely five feet tall if she was wearing heels under the long white gown then she was tinier still her hair fell around her shoulders in blond waves but her eyebrows were black and perfectly arched either she dyed one thing or the other or she was one of those rare blonds where body and head hair didnt match which did happen but not often the blond hair pale skin dark eyebrows and eyelashes framed blue eyes like spring skies i realized that her eyes were only a few shades bluer than jasons maybe it was the dark eyebrows and lashes that made them seem so much more vivid she smiled with a rosebud mouth that was so red i knew she was wearing lipstick and once i saw that i knew she was wearing more makeup well done understated but there were touches here and there that helped a striking almost childlike beauty along her pomme de sang knelt at her feet like a pet the girls long brown hair was piled on top of her head in a complicated layer of curls that made her look even younger than she was she was pale not vampire pale but pale and the icy blue of her long oldfashioned dress didnt help give her any color her slender neck was smooth and untouched if musette was taking blood where was she taking it from did i want to know not really a man stood between the fireplace and the large white couch with its spill of gold and silver pillows he was the opposite of musette in almost every way well over six feet tall built like an overly large swimmer broadshouldered slimwaisted narrowhipped with legs that seemed longer than i was tall his hair was black black like mine was blackwith blue highlights it was tied in a thick braid down his back his skin was as dark as skin that hadnt seen much sun in centuries could be i was betting he tanned with very little effort he just hadnt had much opportunity to catch any rays his eyes were an odd blue green aqua like the waters of the caribbean they were startling in his dark face and should have added warmth and beauty but they were cold he should have been handsome but he wasnt the sour expression on his face stole all that he looked as if he were always in a bad mood maybe it was the clothes he was dressed as if hed stepped out of a centuriesold painting if i had to go around in tights i might be grumpy too though i had a man on either arm it was definitely jeanclaude who led us between the two overstuffed chairs one gold one silver with their piles of white pillows he stopped in front of the white wood coffee table with its crystal bowl of white and yellow carnations damian also stopped instantly standing very still under the touch of my hand jason flopped gracefully into the gold chair closest to the fireplace asher stood on the other side of the silver chair as far away from musette as he could get without leaving the room musette said something in french jeanclaude replied in french and i actually understood that hed told her that i didnt speak french she said something else that was a complete mystery to me then she switched to a heavily accented english most vampires have no accent at least in america but musette had a doozy thick enough in places that i knew if she spoke too fast english or not i wouldnt be able to understand her damian it has been long since you graced our court with your presence my old mistress did not care for the life of the court she is an odd one your mistress morvoren i felt damians body react to the name like hed been slapped i stroked the top of his hand the way youd sooth a worried child morvoren is powerful enough to compete for a council seat she was even offered the earthmovers old place she would not even have had to fight for it it was a gift musette was watching damian studying his face his body his reactions why do you think she refused such a bounty damian swallowed his breath shaky as i said he had to clear his throat to finish my old mistress is not one for court life she prefers her solitude but to give up a seat on the council without a battle to risk that is madness why would morvoren do that each time she said the name damian flinched damian answered your question i said his old master likes her privacy musette turned those blue eyes to me and the flat unfriendliness of the stare made me half wish i hadnt interrupted so this is the new one she walked towards us and it wasnt just gliding it was a sway of hips there were high heels under the skirt you didnt get that sashay without them the tall dark and scary man moved behind her like a shadow the young girl stayed sitting in front of the fireplace her pale blue skirts spread around her like theyd been arranged her hands were very still in her lap she looked arranged too as if shed been told sit here like this and she would sit there like that until musette told her to move definitely yucky may i present anita blake my human servant the very first i have ever called to me there is no other there is only she jeanclaude used his hand in mine to sweep me outward away from the coffee table and incidentally musette it was almost a dance move as if i was supposed to curtsy or something damian followed the movement making it look like a very graceful game of crack the whip the vampires bowed and caught between them i had little choice but to do what they did maybe there was more than one reason that jeanclaude had put me in the middle musette swayed towards us her hips making a dance of the billowing white skirt you know the one i mean ashers servant what was her name there was a look in those blue eyes that said she knew damn well what the name was julianna jeanclaude said voice as neutral as he could make it but neither asher nor he could say juliannas name without some emotion ah yes julianna a pretty name for someone so common shed come to stand in front of us the tall dark man stood behind her menacing by his very size he had to be damn close to seven feet tall why is it that asher and you choose such common women i suppose there is something comforting about good sturdy peasant stock i laughed before i could think jeanclaude squeezed my hand damian went very still under my other hand musette didnt like being laughed at that was plain on her face you laugh girl why jeanclaude squeezed my hand tight enough that it was just this side of pain sorry i said but calling me a peasant isnt much of an insult why is it not she asked and she looked genuinely puzzled because youre right as far back as anyone can trace my family tree i have nothing but soldiers and farmers i am good peasant stock and proud of it why would you be proud of that because everything weve gotten weve made with our two hands the sweat of our brows that kind of thing weve had to work for everything we have no one has ever given us anything i do not understand she said i dont know if i can explain it to you i said i was thinking it was like asher trying to explain to me what you owed a liege lord i had nothing in my life that prepared me to understand that sort of obligation i didnt say that out loud though because i didnt want to bring up the idea that i owed belle morte anything because i didnt feel i did i am not stupid anita i would understand if you would explain yourself clearly asher moved from behind to the other side of us still as far as he could stay from musette but it was brave of him to draw attention to himself i attempted to explain to anita earlier what one owes a liege lord and she could not understand it she is young and american they have never had the benefit of being ruled here she turned her head to one side disturbingly like a bird just before it takes a bite out of a worm and what has her lack of understanding of civilized ways to do with anything a human being would have licked their lips asher went still quiet hold still enough and the fox wont know youre there you lovely musette have never lived where you were not subject to a lord or lady or where you did not rule others you have never lived without knowing the duties one owes ones liege oui she made that one word cold so cold as if to say go on dig yourself a deeper hole to be buried in you have never dreamt of the possibility that being a peasant owing no one would be a freeing experience she waved a carefully manicured hand as if clearing the very thought from the air absurd freeing experience what does that mean i believe jeanclaude said that the fact that you do not understand what that means is ashers exact point she frowned at them both i do not understand thus it cannot be that important she dismissed it all with a wave of dainty hands then she turned her attention back to me and it was frightening i wasnt sure what it was about the mere gaze of those eyes but it chilled the marrow in my bones have you seen our present to jeanclaude and asher i must have looked as confused as i felt because she turned and tried to motion behind her but all i could see was her very large human servant angelito move so she may see angelito somehow the name little angel didnt fit him he moved and she finished the motion towards the fireplace it was only the fireplace with its painting above it then something about the painting caught my eye it was supposed to be a painting of jeanclaude asher and julianna in clothing a la the three musketeers but it wasnt if there hadnt been new and strange vampires in the room im sure i would have noticed it sooner oh yes i would have noticed it sooner it was a picture of cupid and psyche that traditional scene where cupid asleep is finally revealed to the candlewielding psyche valentines day has robbed cupid of what he was in the beginning he was not a chubby sexless baby with wings he was a god a god of love i knew who had posed for cupid because no one else had ever had that golden hair that long flawless body i had memories of what asher had looked like before but id never seen it not me myself i walked towards the painting like a flower pulled towards the sun it was irresistible asher lay on his side in the painting one hand curled against his stomach the other hand flung outward limp with sleep his skin glowed golden in the candlelight only a few shades lighter than the foam of hair that framed his face and shoulders he was nude but that word didnt do him justice the candlelight made his skin glow warm from the broadening of his shoulders to the curve of his feet his nipples were like dark halos against the swell of his chest his stomach was flat to the grace of his belly button as if an angel had touched that flawless skin and left a delicate imprint a line of hair dark gold almost auburn traced the edge of his stomach and ran in a line down down to curl around him where he lay swollen partially erect caught forever between sleep and passion the curve of his hip was the most perfect few inches of skin that id ever seen that curve drew the eye down to the line of his thigh the long sweep of his legs i remembered with jeanclaudes memories what the curve of that hip had felt like under my fingertips i remembered arguing about whose hip was the softest the most perfect belle morte had said that the lines of both their bodies were the closest to perfection shed ever seen on a man jeanclaude had always believed that asher was the more beautiful and asher had believed the same of jeanclaude the artist had painted white wings on the sleeping figure so detailed they looked as if theyd be soft if you could touch them the wings were huge and reminded me of renaissance pictures of angels they seemed out of place on that golden body psyche was peering around the edge of one wing so that it shielded her upper body yet revealed a shoulder the edge of her body down to that first curve of hip but most of her was lost behind cupids body i frowned up at the picture i knew that shoulder the curve of the ribs under that white skin though traced with golden candlelight i knew the line of that body id expected psyche to be belle morte id been wrong i looked past the long black curls that didnt so much hide the figure as decorate it and the face peering around the candles edge was jeanclaudes it took me a second to be sure because he seemed more delicately beautiful than normal until i realized that he was wearing makeupthat centuriesold version of it anyway things had been done to soften the line of his face make his lips more pouting but the eyes the eyes were unchanged with their black lace of lashes and that drowning deep color the painting was too large for me to stand next to the fireplace and see it all but there was something about the eyes of the cupid figure i had to move close to see that they were open a mere slit enough to show the cold blue fire that id seen when the hunger was upon asher jeanclaude touched my face and it made me jump damian had moved back giving us space jeanclaude traced the tears on my cheeks the look in his eyes said clearly that i was crying tears for both of us he couldnt afford to appear weak in front of musette and i couldnt help it we both turned to asher but he was standing as far away as the room would allow he had turned away so that all you could see of his face was that golden fall of hair his shoulders were slightly hunched as if hed been struck musette came to stand on the other side of jeanclaude our mistress thought since you are together again as of old that you would enjoy this little reminder of days gone by the look i gave her around jeanclaudes shoulder was not a friendly one i saw the girl who was her pomme de sang on the other side of the couch i hadnt even been aware shed moved away from the fireplace if the bad guys had wanted to take me out they could have done it because i had seen nothing for a few minutes but the painting the painting is our guest gift to our host but we have a more personal gift just for asher angelito moved up beside her like a dark mountain a much smaller painting in his hands there were remnants of the paper and twine that had covered it like a discarded skin on the floor it was half the size of the other but obviously in the same style realistic but in glowing colors hyperrealistic very titian the only light in the painting was firelight the glow of the forge ashers body was colored gold and crimson with the reflected firelight he was nude again the edge of the anvil hid his groin but the right side of his body was bare to the light even his hair was tied back in a loose ponytail so that the right side of his face couldnt be hidden his arms were still strong as they pretended to forge the blade that lay on the anvil but the right side of his face the right side of chest his stomach his thigh were a melted ruin these were not the old white scars that i was used to seeing these were raw red discolored angry lines like some monster had slashed and gouged at his body i was suddenly overwhelmed with a memory that was not mine asher lying on the floor of the torture room freed of the silver chains the men who had tormented him slaughtered around him in an explosion of blood he reached out to us his face his face i swooned and jeanclaude and i fell in a heap on the floor because i was experiencing directly what he was remembering damian and jason moved up beside us but asher stayed well back i didnt blame him in the least asher come and see your gift musette called damian was already on the ground beside me his hands on my shoulders fingers digging in i think he was afraid of what i would do he should have been ashers voice came strained but clear i have seen that particular gift before i know it well do you wish us to return to belle morte and tell her you did not appreciate her gift you may tell belle morte that i have gotten exactly what she wished me to get out of her gifts and what is that i am reminded of what i was and of what i am i got to my feet damian still with a death grip on my shoulders jeanclaude rose gracefully like a puppet pulled by invisible strings i would never be that graceful but tonight it didnt matter musette turned back to jeanclaude we have given our gift to you jeanclaude and to asher we await our guest gifts his voice was empty so bland it was like listening to silence i have told you musette our guest gifts are weeks away from completion im sure you can find something to stand in their stead she stared at me i found my voice and it wasnt bland how dare you come here three months early knowing we wont be prepared and make demands on us damian was clinging to my back a little frantically but i was polite for me after what she and belle morte had just done i was downright kind your rudeness will not be used as an excuse to force us to do anything we dont want to do damians arms slid over my shoulders so he was cradling me against his body i didnt fight it because without his presence i think i would probably have struck her or shot her which sounded like such a good idea jeanclaude tried to smooth things over but musette waved him aside let your servant talk if she has something to say i opened my mouth to call her a heartless bitch but it wasnt what came out did you believe that gifts worthy of such beauty could be hurried would you really take some poor substitute in the place of the magnificence we had commissioned i stopped talking all of our men were staring at me except damian who was hugging me for all he was worth ventriloquism jason said from the other side of jeanclaude its the only answer jeanclaude nodded a miracle indeed then he turned to musette all save one pales before your beauty musette how could i offer anything less than something beautiful to grace your loveliness her gaze turned back to me is she not a beauty to equal mine i laughed damians arms tightened enough that i had to pat his arm so i could keep breathing comfortably dont worry ive got this one covered i dont think anyone believed me but i did honest musette i know im pretty i can admit that but compared to the otherworldly triplets here i am not the most beautiful person on our side triplets jason said why do i think im not included in that threesome sorry jason but youre like me we clean up nice but with these three standing here we are out of our league you include asher in the three beauties musette said i nodded if you are cataloging beautiful people and asher is in the room then he always makes the list once oui but not now not for centuries she said i disagree i said you lie i looked at her youre a master vampire cant you tell when someones lying or telling the truth cant you feel it in my words smell it on my skin i watched her face those beautiful but frightening eyes she couldnt tell if i was lying or not id only met one other master vamp that couldnt tell truth from lie and that was because she was lying so badly to herself that truth would have gotten in her way musette was blind to truth which meant we could lie through our teeth to her that had possibilities she frowned at me and waved it all away with those tiny wellmanicured hands enough of this she was intelligent enough to realize she was losing part of this argument but she wasnt bright enough to know why so she was moving on to something she thought she could win even asher with his ruined beauty is more lovely than you are anita it was my turn to frown at her i think i already said that she frowned again it was like she had been sent with certain lines to say and i wasnt making the replies shed expected i was throwing her performance off and musette didnt seem to enjoy improvisation it doesnt bother you that you are not more beautiful than the men i had to make peace with being the homely one of the group a long time ago she frowned so hard it looked painful you are a very hard woman to insult i shrugged as much as i could with damians arms still wrapped around me truth is truth musette ive broken the cardinal girl rule and that would be never date anyone prettier than you are that made her laugh a surprised burst of sound non non the rule is never to admit it the smile faded you truly have no difficulty with me saying i am more lovely than you i shook my head nope she looked completely lost for a moment until her own human servant touched her shoulder she shuddered took a deep shaking breath as if remembering who and what she was and why she was there the last sign of laughter faded from her eyes you have admitted that your beauty cannot rival mine thus taking blood from you would not be a gift worthy of replacing the bauble that jeanclaude is having made for me you are correct also about your wolf he is charming but not as charming as the three of them i suddenly had a bad feeling about where this was headed damian is somehow yours i do not understand it but i can feel it he is yours the way angelito is mine and you are jeanclaudes as master of the city jeanclaude cannot be drink for the taking but asher belongs to no one give him to me for my guest gift he is my second in command my témoin jeanclaude said still in that empty meansnothing voice i would not lightly share him i have met some of your other vampires this night meng die has an animal to call she is more powerful than asher why is she not your second she is anothers second and will be going back to him in a few months why is she here then i called her why the real reason was that while i was off doing my soulsearching jeanclaude had needed more backup but i didnt think hed share that he didnt a master calls home his flock periodically especially if he thinks they will soon become masters of their own territory a last visit before he loses the power to call them belle was most perturbed that you rose to master of the city without that one last visit jeanclaude she woke speaking your name saying that you had struck out on your own none of us thought you would ever rise so high he gave a low sweeping bow and she was standing so close that his hair almost brushed her skirt it is not often that anyone so surprises belle morte i am most honored musette frowned you should be she was most unhappy he stood slowly why would my rise to power make her unhappy because to be master of the city is to be beyond the ties of obligation ties of obligation seemed to mean more to the vampires than it did to me because i felt them go all quiet damian was so still around my body that it was like he wasnt there at all only the weight of his arms let me know he was still clinging to me the beat and pulse of his body was gone tucked away somewhere deep inside but asher has not risen so high he could still be called home she said i glanced at jeanclaude but his face was utterly blank that polite nothingness that meant he was hiding his every reaction that is of course within her purview but i would need some notice before asher was called away america is less settled than europe and fights for territory are much less civilized his voice was still empty emotionless nothing mattered if my second were to simply vanish others would see that as a weakness do not worry our mistress is not going to call him home but she admits to being puzzled we all waited for her to go on but musette seemed content to let the silence stand even with damian hanging on to me i broke first puzzled about what why asher left her side of course asher moved up closer though still keeping a much greater distance between himself and musette than the rest of us i did not leave her side he said belle morte had not touched me in centuries she would not even watch entertainments where i was featured she said i offended her eye it is her prerogative to do with her people as she sees fit musette said true asher said but she bid me come to america with yvette as my overseer yvette died and i had no more orders and if our mistress ordered you home silence ours this time ashers face was as empty of emotion as jeanclaudes whatever he felt was hidden but the very blankness of both their faces said that it did matter and it was important belle morte encourages her people to strike out on their own jeanclaude said it is one of the reasons her bloodline rules more territories than any other especially here in the united states musette turned those beautiful pitiless eyes on him but asher did not leave to become a master of the city he left to have revenge on you and your human servant he wanted to extract payment for his beloved juliannas death see she had known the name all along yet here your servant stands strong well and unharmed where is your vengeance asher where is the price jeanclaude was to pay for his murder of your servant asher seemed to close in upon himself so very very still i thought if i blinked hed have vanished altogether his voice came distant empty i found that perhaps i had blamed jeanclaude in error that perhaps he too mourned her loss so she snapped her fingers like that all your pain your hatred is forgotten not just like that non but i have learned many things that i had forgotten such as the sweet touch of jeanclaudes body she asked the silence this time was so thick i could hear my blood roaring in my ears damian felt like a ghost against my body all the vampires i was sure were wishing themselves away either jeanclaude and asher had been doing it behind my back which was not impossible but if not to answer the question truthfully would be bad jason caught my eye but neither of us dared even shrug i dont think we were sure what was going on but that it would end some place painful was almost certain musette swayed around jeanclaude to stand closer to asher are you and jeanclaude a happy couple once more or here she looked at me is it a happy ménage а trois is that why you did not come home she pushed past asher and jeanclaude making them move back so she could stand in front of me how can the touch of such as this compare to the magnificence of our mistress i think shed just implied that i wasnt as good in bed as belle morte but i wasnt entirely sure thats what she meant and i didnt care she could insult me all she wanted insulting me was less painful than so many other things she could be doing belle morte is sickened at the sight of me asher said finally she avoids me in all things he motioned at the painting that angelito was still holding up this is how she sees me how she will always see me musette swayed her way back to stand in front of asher to be least among her court is better than ruling anywhere else i couldnt help myself are you saying its better to serve in heaven than rule in hell she nodded smiling seemingly oblivious to the literary allusion oui precisement our mistress is the sun the moon the all to be parted from her only that is true death musettes face was rapturous glowing with that inner certainty usually reserved for holy rollers and television evangelists she was indeed a true believer i couldnt see damians face but i was betting it was as carefully blank as the rest jason was staring at musette as if she had sprouted a second head an ugly spiky second head she was a zealot and zealots are never quite sane she turned to asher with that radiance still suffusing her face our mistress does not understand why you left her asher i did i think everyone in the room did except maybe for angelito and the girl who was still standing on the other side of the couch where musette had put her look at the painting of me as vulcan musette see what our mistress thinks of me musette didnt bother to look behind her she gave that gallic shrug that meant everything and nothing anita does not see me that way he said jeanclaude cannot look at you without seeing what was lost she said the time when you could speak for me musette is long past you do not know my heart or my mind you never truly did jeanclaude said she turned to him are you truly telling me that you would touch him as he is now be careful how you answer jeanclaude know that our mistress has seen deep into your heart and mind you may lie to me but never to her jeanclaude was quiet for a time but finally he told the truth we are not currently together in that way see you refuse to touch him as she refuses to touch him i loosened damians arms enough so i could move more easily not exactly i said sorry but its my fault that they arent a couple she turned to me what do you mean servant you know even if i was like a maid i know enough about polite society to know that you dont call a maid simply maid you dont call a servant servant not unless you truly have never interacted with servants i folded my arms across my stomach looking puzzled on purpose damians hands stayed lightly on my shoulders is that it musette are you not an aristocrat after all is it all pretend and you simply dont know any better jeanclaude gave me a look that she couldnt see how dare you musette said then prove you are noble address me at least like someone who has truly had servants she opened her mouth to argue then she seemed to hear something that i couldnt hear she let out a long breath as you like blake then blake is fine i said and what i mean is that im not entirely comfortable with this bisexual thing i wont share jeanclaude with another woman and definitely not with a man musette did that head to the side movement again as if shed spied the worm she intended to eat very good then asher has no tie to any of you he is merely your second i looked from one vampire to another only jason looked as confused as i felt the vamps were acting like a trap had been sprung and i didnt see it yet whats going on i asked musette laughed and it wasnt anywhere near as good a laugh as jeanclaude or asher were capable of it was just a laugh a vaguely unpleasant one at that i am within my rights to ask for him as my gift for tonight she said wait i said and damians hands tried to pull me back in against him but i wasnt moving this time i thought you agreed with belle that asher isnt pretty enough to have sex with anymore whoever said anything about sex musette asked now i really was puzzled why else would you want him for the night she laughed then head back very unladylike a bray of sound like a hound baying i hadnt said anything that funny had i jeanclaudes quiet voice came into the silence that followed that laugh musettes interests run to pain more than sex ma petite i looked at him you dont mean dominance and submission where you have safe words do you there is no word in any language that i have ever heard screamed that would dissuade musette from her pleasures i licked my suddenly dry lips they lie about that moisturizing lipstick your lips still dry out when you get scared let me test my understanding if asher was your lover or mine or anyones then hed be safe from her non ma petite asher would only be safe if he belonged to you or me lesser powers cannot protect those they love but because were not doing him hes free meat i asked he seemed to think about that for a time that is accurate enough oui fuck i said oui ma petite oui a thread of tiredness had finally broken through his empty voice i looked at asher and he was hiding behind that shining hair again what was i supposed to say that if i hadnt been so squeamish this wouldnt be happening im sorry i have issues with my boyfriend doing other men im sorry i have issues with me doing other men why was i always being made to feel guilty because i wasnt having sex with more people wasnt it supposed to be the other way around musette held her hand out to asher he stood there for a second or two then he took her hand he looked back once at jeanclaude a shine of eyes in all that hair jeanclaude never reacted as if he were trying to pretend he wasnt there i moved forward only damians fingers digging into my shoulders brought me up short we are not letting her do this i said she is musette and belle mortes lieutenant jeanclaudes voice had gone small and distant musette didnt take him through the drapes into another room she stopped a few yards away not even that close to the walls she turned asher to face her then she drew a knife from her white skirts and plunged it into his stomach before anyone could react asher could move faster than the eye could follow but he made no move to protect himself he just let her sink the knife home grinding it until the hilt met his skin and she couldnt push it in any farther i had my gun out of the holster and jeanclaude grabbed my hand the knife is not silver ma petite when it is removed he will heal almost instantly i looked up at him straining to raise the gun and making some progress thanks to his own vampire marks i was stronger than i should have been how do you know its not silver because i have played this game with musette before that made me stop trying to bring the gun up i went quiet in his hands their hands i should have said because damians hands were plastered to my shoulders only jason hadnt joined in trying to hold me back from the look on his face i think he wanted to help me not hinder me i looked past jeanclaude to see asher still standing his hands to his stomach where blood blossomed across the skin of his hands the brown of the shirt was dark enough to hide the first rush of blood musette put the knife to her delicate mouth and licked down the blade i knew through jeanclaudes memories that vampire blood gives no sustenance you cannot feed from the dead not in that way asher looked at us it is not silver ma cherie it will not kill me his breath was cut off in his throat as musette plunged the knife in a second time the world swam in streamers of colors i closed my eyes for a second and spoke in a low careful voice let go of me damian the hands at my back dropped away instantly because id given a direct order i opened my eyes and met jeanclaudes gaze we stared at each other until his hand dropped slowly away his voice echoed like a whisper in my mind you cannot kill her for this i put my gun back in its holster yeah i know i couldnt kill her because she wasnt trying to kill asher but i would not stand here and watch him be tortured i would not could not do it id once thought that arm wrestling vampires was a bad idea she was stronger than me even with jeanclaudes marks but i was also betting she wasnt trained in handtohand fighting if i was wrong i was about to get my ass kicked if i was right well wed see musette made no move to protect herself angelito stayed with the other men across the room it was as if neither of them saw me as a threat youd think with my reputation vampires would stop underestimating me but dead or alive there are always fools i could feel myself smiling and i didnt need a mirror to know that it wasnt a nice smile it was the smile i got when id been pissed off too much and id finally decided to do something about it musette made a big show of licking the knife clean while asher stood in front of her and bled she licked it like a kid with a popsicle on a hot daygot to lick carefully but quickly or it drips down your hand and you lose some of it her eyes were all for me the show was all for me it was as if asher didnt matter at all to her maybe he didnt she had actually turned back to plunge the blade home a third time when i was within touching distance i dont know what she thought i planned to do because she seemed totally surprised when i grabbed her hand maybe she expected me to fight like a girl whatever the hell that means i pushed my shoulder into her and she tottered backwards on her high heels i hooked my heel behind hers and foot swept her leg out from under her she fell backwards because i helped i rode her body down to the ground turning the knife in her hand with mine and when she hit the floor i plunged the knife home i leaned my knee into the back of our hands and felt the blade come out the back of her body i whispered to her its not silver youll heal she screamed i didnt so much hear angelito move as feel him if you come over here angelito i will force this blade up into her heart and it wont matter if its silver or if its not ill shred her heart before you can cross the room the far drapes opened and vampires spilled into the room some ours some hers i dont know what would have happened but i heard the far door open behind the drapes i heard a lot of movement and i almost tore the blade up through her not at all sure the metal was strong enough to take the strain with a better blade i could have dug for her heart with this one i wasnt sure a split second before i tried it i heard a sound that raised the hair on my arms the sound of hyenas hunting its a hell of a lot creepier than the howl of a wolf but that joined with it i knew the moment i heard the noises that it was our calvary coming not musettes i didnt look behind because i didnt dare take my eyes off the vampire i had pinned to the floor but i felt the crowd surge behind me felt the neckruffling power of shapeshifters filling the room like an electric cloud the touch of so many of them with such tension called my own beast like a snake in my gut to writhe and flow inside my body i wasnt a shapeshifter but through richard and my tie to the wereleopards i had the closest thing a human being could have to their very own private beast it was bobby lee who was actually a wererat that came forward enough for me to see him his southern drawl always sounded so out of place in a fight you planning to kill her im thinking about it he knelt on one knee beside us you think thats the smart thing to do he glanced up at the vampires on the other side of the room probably not then maybe you should oughta ease up there before you gut her micah send you i asked eyes still on musettes painfilled face i was happy to see her hurting i didnt usually enjoy causing pain to anyone but i just didnt mind hurting musette he didnt send any of your leopards cause you told him not to but he contacted the other leaders and here we are if youre not going to kill her girl you should probably let her go not yet i said he didnt ask again but stood up near us like the good bodyguard he was i spoke directly to musette but i made sure my voice carried no one comes into our territory and harms our people no one not the council not even le sourdre de sang of our bloodline everyone tells me that when i speak to you im speaking to belle herself well heres the message the next one of her people to harm one of our people is dead i will take their heads their hearts and ill burn the rest musette found her voice at long last though it was strained and a little afraid you would not dare i leaned into the blade a little bit more made her grunt with the force of it try me the pain in musettes face faded vanishing like someone wiped it away and her blue eyes began to darken i rode the knife into her while belles pale brown eyes swirled to the surface the dark overwhelming all that blue until musettes eyes were the color of poisoned honey id seen belle do this trick once before but it had been in a mirror and my own eyes fear drove through me like a blade chilling my skin bringing my heart into my neck like a trapped thing fear can either chase back the beast or call it this fear calmed it dampened it so that that rising power sank away leaving me alone and scared it wasnt a vampire trick that made me want to let her go and run away id felt belle move through my own body and i never wanted her to be able to do it again if i took musettes heart with belle inside her could i kill them both probably not but god it was tempting belles voice came without a trace of fear or strain if the knife hurt her too it didnt show jeanclaude have you taught her nothing the voice was not musettes it was deeper richer a low contralto the irreverent thought that shed give really good phone sex crossed my mind jeanclaude started gliding towards us he motioned for damian to follow and the redhaired vampire fell into step behind him jeanclaude came to kneel beside us and motioned damian to do the same they both bowed their heads carefully out of reach musette overstepped the bounds for a visitor to my lands you would not tolerate such treatment of one of your own people i have learned well the lessons you taught me belle morte what lesson is this she asked tolerate nothing no hint of disobedience no breath of revolution no insult is tolerated i admit that i forgot this in the rush of fear that musette brought with her the thought of insulting you even indirectly was unthinkable but i am no longer your creature i am a master of the city now i am my own creature and asher is mine now i will be what you brought me up to be belle i will truly be your child i will let ma petite be as ruthless as she likes and musette will either learn better manners or she will not be coming home to you ever again she sat up with the knife plunged through her body she sat up and i could not keep her pinned down the movement pushed me backwards enough to brush against damian he touched my back and when i didnt tell him not to he touched my shoulder belle even dropped musettes hand away from the knife so that my hand held it in place but she showed no pain in fact she ignored me to look at jeanclaude i began to feel silly with my bloody hands and the knife still stuck in musette no not silly superfluous you know what i would do to you if you harmed her belle said i know that according to our own laws the laws you helped enact that no one is allowed to simply enter a territory without negotiating safe passage musette and her people are here three months before we gave them permission to enter which means in effect they are outlaw and have no rights no safety i could slaughter them all and council law would be on my side you have too many people on the council that fear you belle they would think it a good joke you would not dare she said i will not allow you to harm asher not anymore he is nothing to you jeanclaude you are the most beautiful thing i have ever seen magnificent in your lust i am humbled by your power awed by the political maneuvering that you do so effortlessly but i have been long away from you and i have learned that beauty is not always what it seems that lust is not always better than love that power alone is not enough to fill the bed or the heart and that i dont have your patience for the politics she reached out a slender hand towards him i showed you love such as no mortal ever could you showed me lust mistress sexual appetite oui amour she said her voice sultry enough to cause goosebumps on my arms jeanclaude shook his head non lust not love never love a look passed over her face like a badly designed mask moving liquid under musettes skin it reminded me uncomfortably of watching the beast glide under the skin of a shapeshifter before it springs forth if she changed into belle completely i was trying for her heart while i had the chance you loved me once jeanclaude oui with all my heart and all my soul but you do not love me now her voice was soft there might even have been a trace of loss i have learned that love can grow without the touch of sex and that sex does not always lead to love i would love you again she whispered non you would possess me again and love is not about possession you speak in riddles she said i speak truth as i have come to know it he said those pale honey brown eyes turned to me you have done this somehow you have done this i was beginning to feel positively silly with the knife still in musette but i was afraid to take it out because i was half expecting belle to stand up and say aha that was what i was waiting for so i kept the blade in and tried to think what to do staring into those pale brown eyes it was hard to think hard not to either run away or try and kill her if i cant run from my fears i have a tendency to try and kill them its a strategy thats worked so far what have i done i asked and my voice showed the strain damians hands kneaded gently at my shoulders not so much a massage as a reassurance that he was there i think you have turned him against me she said no i said you did that all on your own centuries before i was born that liquid mask moved under musettes skin again if i touched her face i thought id feel things underneath that should not have been there i took him to my bed what more does anyone desire of belle morte you showed him what your love was worth when you cast asher out of your bed what does ashers fate have to do with jeanclaudes love that anyone who knew the two of them could ask that was amazing that the vampire that brought them together could ask that was both frightening and sad you need to leave now belle i said why what have i said to upset you i shook my head the list is too long belle we dont have all night let me hit the highlights go away for now please just leave im tired of trying to explain color to the blind i do not understand what that means no i said you dont she stared up at me her hand came up as if to touch my face if you touch me i said ill see if musette can survive without her heart why is the touch of my hand worse then the touch of our bodies one against the other call it a hunch but i dont want you touching me on purpose besides its not your body its musettes although im not sure about that so call me cautious and just dont touch me i will see you again anita i promise you that yeah yeah i know you dont seem to believe me oh i believe you i just cant get too worked up over it worked up she made it a question she means she cannot get too upset about your threat jeanclaude said belle looked back at me why can you not ive had a lot of vampires threaten me i cant panic every time i am belle morte member of the council on high do not underestimate me anita tell that to the earthmover i said hed been a council member that had come to town once upon a time hed died i have not forgotten that jeanclaude slew a council member actually id slain him but why quibble just go belle please just go and if i choose to stay what will you do what can you do i thought about several options most of them fatal to one or both of us finally i said if you want to keep this body fine its not my body its not even my vampire you want it knock yourself out i leaned back from her and jerked the knife out there was no way i was leaving a weapon on musette she was too likely to take the blade out and stick it in me the blade pulling out brought a gasp from belle that plunging it in hadnt she grabbed my wrist as if to keep me from hurting her but i should have known better some small screaming part of me knew i was still kneeling on the carpet in jeanclaudes living room but the rest of me was in a dark candlelit room the bed was large and soft mounded with pillows as if it would rise up in a soft cushioned wave and engulf me the woman pressed into all that softness lay in a bed of her own dark hair her eyes a solid golden brown fire like staring at the sun through a piece of colored glass belle morte stared up at me her pale body naked the glory of her spread before me nothing hidden i wanted her wanted her as id never wanted anything else in my life i came back to myself with a gasp jeanclaude held my other hand in a death grip damian was a weight against the back of my body jason stood over the rest of us as we knelt his hands were on jeanclaudes shoulder and against the side of my neck above damians hand i could feel the pulse in my neck pounding against the pulse in the palm of jasons hand i could smell the musty scent of fur the rich almost eatable smell of the forest it was the smell of the pack the werewolves that had come to guard our back had stepped up through the crowd i could feel the wolves ranged behind me feel them like there was an invisible thread between jason me and them jeanclaudes ties to the wolves were direct they were his animal to call he didnt need richards beast to call the wolves i needed a surrogate wolf to bind me to them richard should have been at our back but he wasnt if jason had not been there to be our third then belle might have raised the ardeur drowned us in memories of her sweet flesh flung us out into the room and turned my mexican standoff into an orgy but jeanclaude gave me his control through the press of his hand damian gave me his desperate reserve through his body molded against my back jason fed the pulse of the pack into the bend of my neck we were not merely a triumvirate of power through damians addition we were more and that more was stronger than belle morte trapped in musettes body if shed been here in person it might have been a different story but she wasnt she was way the hell in europe somewhere a howl broke out behind me and another and another jason threw his head back making a long clean line of his throat a howl trembled from his mouth to join with the chorus behind us the sound rose and fell one wolfs note dying off another taking up the call until the sound rose and fell like musiclonely trembling amazing music i met belles pale brown eyes and found them full of fire like staring at flames through brown glass it did remind me of her eyes in the memory she had chosen but it was just a memory there was no bite or pull to it now the ardeur lay quiet held behind the bars we had forged for it from sheer force of will and months of practice the last time you rolled the ardeur over us it was new to me its not new anymore i said something flowed under musettes skin it was like watching a second face roll underneath her skin again i half expected belle to burst out through musettes body like some kind of shapeshifter but the rolling shape stopped and those dark fire eyes stared into mine there will be other nights anita she said in that low almost purring voice of hers i nodded i know with that she vanished musette fell back onto the floor into a dead faint her vampires rushed forward the wolves stayed at my back the werehyenas stepped up the wererats drew guns and bobby lee said dont queer our shot gentlemen the werehyenas hesitated forming two groups one to either side of the vampires our vampires peeled off from musettes and eased through the crowd of wereanimals nobody moves nobody gets hurt bobby lee said let them fetch their mistress jeanclaude said some of the shapeshifters looked his way none of the wererats did we had this much backup not because jeanclaude had a tie to any other animal except the wolves but because id made friends the wererats and werehyenas were here for me not him ease down bobby lee let them get musette i certainly dont want to have to take care of her the men and women wererats all with their guns nicely pointed moved back in two lines so the vampires had to walk between them to reach musette angelito had joined them but bobby lee motioned him back with a wave of his gun barrel angelito was imposing but he was also one of the few humans among them i wasnt sure the big man was the most dangerous person on their side a little girl of seven or eight with dark curls cut short around an angelic face flashed dainty fangs and hissed at me an older boy who looked like a young twelve or an old ten picked musettes shoulders up raising her limp figure off the ground as if she weighed nothing he didnt flash fangs he just looked at me with dark unfriendly eyes a male vamp in a dark conservative suit got musettes feet though he made no move to take the small woman from the boy i knew the male vamp could have carried her easily but he didnt argue with the boy the boy didnt lack strength just height and leverage they carried her back to angelito who took her from the others musette looked tiny held in his long arms there were people in the room who had thicker arms than angelito the werehyenas were bodybuilders but there was no one on our side that had the length and size of musettes little angel jeanclaude stood drawing me to my feet damian moved as i moved jason too we have rooms prepared for all of you you will be escorted to them then we will leave guards outside your doors for the protection of all concerned bobby lee was still holding his gun nice and steady on the vamps anita he made my name a question i dont want them wandering around without guards on them so yeah sounds like a good idea to me you guys able to stick around that long honeychild i would follow you to the ends of the earth course we can he laid the southern accent on thick enough to walk across thanks bobby our pleasure meng die faust you know the way to the rooms show our guards where to go meng die was lovely delicate with perfectly straight black hair cut just above her shoulders her skin was like pale porcelain she would have looked like a perfect china doll if she hadnt liked wearing skintight black leather most of the time the leather sort of ruined the image she was a master vampire and her animal to call id been surprised to learn was the wolf strangely this didnt make her any more attractive to the wolves or me she was just too damn unfriendly faust was not much taller than meng die but he didnt make you think delicate just short he was cheerfully attractivelike the boy next door if he happened to be a vampireand had dyed his hair a dark wineburgundy his eyes were the color of new pennies as if the brown had a touch of fresh blood in it he was a master vampire but not strong enough to ever be master of the city or at least not hold on to it a weak master of the city is usually a dead one meng die and faust led the way through the drapes and the far corridor beyond musettes vamps went next the wererats and the werehyenas brought up the rear the drapes swished closed behind them we were left alone with our thoughts i hoped everyone elses thoughts were more useful than mine because all i could think was that belle wouldnt like being given her hat and shown the door shed find a way to make us eat the insult if she could maybe she couldnt but she was over two thousand years old according to jeanclaude you didnt survive that long without knowing things things that would make your enemies run screaming the council member wed killed had been able to cause earthquakes simply by thinking about it i was pretty sure belle had her own special tricks i just hadnt seen them yet less than an hour later jeanclaude and i were in his room alone damian was one of the guards outside our door wed split our vamps up among the wereanimals so that hopefully the bad vampires couldnt use mind tricks on the wereanimals without the vamps knowing it wed done the best we could do which had actually been pretty damned good the ardeur was still in hiding i wasnt questioning it just grateful jeanclaudes large fourposter bed was draped in blue silk mounded with pillows in at least three vibrant shades of blue he traded the drapes and pillows to match whatever color the sheets were so i knew without looking that the sheets would be blue silk jeanclaude did not do white sheets no matter what they were made out of he was sitting in the rooms only chair slumped down hands crossed over his stomach i was sitting on the rug that hed put beside the bed the rug was actually fur thick and soft and somehow just by touch you knew it had once been alive wed both been strangely reluctant to go to bed i think we were both afraid the ardeur would rise and we werent ready for it let me test my understanding i said jeanclaude looked at me moving only his eyes tomorrow night if asher is still nobodys will they be within their rights to ask for him not as they did tonight no you have made that impossible now unless they can take him by force i shook my head ive been around enough vamp politics to know that if you stop them from doing one thing theyll do something else not because they want to but because it will cause you pain he frowned at me i sighed let me try that again heres the deal what are they within their rights to ask from us while theyre here hunting rights or willing donors loversthe basic needs to be met sex is a basic need he just looked at me sorry sorry so i understand the willing donor part theyve got to eat but the lovers what does that mean exactly it would be déclassé to demand lovers for the servants so musettes ladys maid and butler are not to be worried over the two children are special cases the girl is physically too young she does not think of such things the boy is a problem bartolomé was precocious which is why belle sent musette to take him i stared at him please tell me that musette never had sex with the kid he seemed suddenly tired rubbing his eyes with his fingertips do you wish the truth or a more pleasant lie the truth i guess belle morte can smell sexual appetite it is one of her gifts bartolomé may look like a child but he does not think like one nor did he when he was human and a true boy of eleven going on twelve he was the heir to a great fortune belle wanted to control that fortune he was also notorious in an age when noble sons were allowed almost any indiscretion with women who were not of noble blood explain that i said he looked like a child anita and he would use that innocent face to maneuver women into compromising situations by the time they realized that they were in danger of abuse it was often too late more than that he threatened to accuse them of being the aggressor there was no such phrase as child molestation in that century but everyone knew it happened children were often married as young as ten or eleven so the people who had such tastes could satisfy their needs within the marriage bed until their spouses became too old for their tastes then they would look outside their marriage or by that time their own children might be old enough i stared at him i dont think i wanted to know that last part that is beyond disgusting oui ma petite but it is still true a fortune as large as bartolomés would normally be belles task she would never leave such monies or lands or titles to anyone else but she is not a lover of children no matter how grownup they may be so she cast it to musette who as you now realize will do anything our mistress bids her do i got that impression so yes she seduced or allowed herself to be seduced by the boy belle gave her a touch of the ardeur and bartolomé was enraptured belle did not mean to bring him over to us as a boy she meant to wait until he grew older but bartolomé was thrown from his horse he had crushed his skull and was dying his next brother was only five and belle would have no hold on him she needed bartolomé and so she bid musette finish him how did he feel when he woke up he was happy to be alive howd he feel when he finally realized hed be a little boy forever no matter how precocious jeanclaude sighed he was unhappy bringing children over is forbidden for a reason musette did not make valentina one of us belle found that one of her master vampires was a pedophile and had brought over children to be his permanent companions his voice went soft at the end i felt ill i breathed deep and slow sweet jesus i said he had broken our prohibition against bringing over children and when belle morte found out why he had done it she slew him with full permission of the council she slew him they destroyed most of the children he had made they were vampires trapped in childrens bodies and they had been abused he shook his head their minds did not survive not whole so how did valentina escape i asked she was his newest and had yet to be touched she was a child and a vampire but she was not mad belle took her in and found her people to care for her she had human nannies for many years she had human playmates i must say that belle did her best for valentina i think she blamed herself for not realizing what a true monster sebastian was why do i think this ideal picture doesnt stay ideal you know us too well ma petite valentina tried to turn some of her playmates into vampires so she would not be the only one when her nanny discovered her valentina slit her throat that was the end of human nannies and human playmates thats why the vampire nanny i said he nodded she does not truly need one in the traditional sense of a childs need but she is forever eight years old and even today she cannot catch a taxi by herself register in a hotel without people wondering some wellmeaning human will call the police to report the poor abandoned child thats staying in their hotel she must hate it it her existence i said he gave half a shrug i do not know i do not speak to valentina youre afraid of her non ma petite but i am unnerved by her the few children that survive for centuries are twisted things it cannot be otherwise how did she end up with musettes entourage valentina was taken before her body grew large enough for much physical pleasure she has turned such energies into other he licked his lips avenues of interest i sighed musette is belles torturer which means that valentina is what her little assistant in the torture he nodded head resting against the chair back eyes closed valentina has been a very apt pupil shes tortured you he nodded eyes still closed i told you that the price for belle saving ashers life was my servitude for a century among them but belle wished to punish me for leaving her and for a long time she gave me to pain rather than pleasure i went to him crawling on the floor by his chair smoothing my skirts down automatically though there was no one there to see so valentina wont be asking for a lover non will she try for a what submissive oui can we just refuse oui can we make the no stick he opened his eyes and looked down at me i believe so but to say absolutely would be too close to a lie i shook my head if musette left tonight and returned in three months would we have less ground to stand on she will not leave ma petite no thats not what i mean what i mean is if she had come in three months after good faith negotiations had gone through would i still have been allowed to get away with what i did tonight or would we have faced the councils wrath we would have chosen a victim for musette or chosen a lover for her or both before she arrived it would have been settled and not a surprise you know most human guests dont expect their hosts to supply them with sex partners nor do most of the bloodlines that descend from the council but belles line is built upon sex and it has become custom to offer any of belles line sex when they visit you it is assumed that we all carry a touch of her succubus within us thats not true i said non but no one of her line has ever wished to dissuade others of the lie i smiled thought about laughing and was too tired we can keep willie and hannah safe because theyve got to be in charge of the two clubs weve already negotiated that our businesses are not to be disrupted by the visit i said belle was always one to keep her mind on where the money was coming from so yes willie is my manager for the laughing corpse and hannah is temporary manager of danse macabre the two weakest of my flock are safe away damian is my vampire servant im your human servant youre master of the city jason is your pomme de sang nathaniel is my pomme de sang micah is my lover and my nimirraj richard is ulfric and the bodyguards cant guard our bodies if theyre screwing other people we have made everyone as safe as we can ma petite theres one name thats conspicuously absent from that list jeanclaude three actually ma petite four if you count gretchen gretchen is crazy jeanclaude you got a special pass for her from belle because shes still ill right gretchen had tried to kill me once as punishment she got locked up in a coffin for a while the isolation had driven her even crazier oui gretchen will keep to her room for musettes visit but that does not protect meng die or faust faust likes men and to my knowledge nobody in musettes party is gay right oui but that is not always a barrier we laid down the law tonight that no one was to be hurt again forcing someone to have sex with a partner they find repugnant is a form of rape and thus its harm he looked at me surprised ma petite you are becoming devious i shook my head nope just practical so faust is safe because he only likes men and none of musettes men likes men torture is out because thats just harm meng die will fascinate bartolomé but again meng die doesnt like children so bartolomé would have to rape her to get his way with her thus she is safe from his advances he seemed to think about that for a second or two but what of angelito isnt he a couple with musette arent they doing each other when they wish to yes i frowned at him not a hot pair musettes true love is not sex which is why she and valentina have been so close for so long not our problem if everyone has access to someone they can fuck or we have no suitable partners for them outside of rape then everyones covered or have i missed something he thought about it quietly for a few minutes non ma petite your machinations are worthy of belle herself if her intention were to keep her people safe then he looked at me except for one problem musette has had sex with asher in the past so you cannot make a charge of rape having sex in the past doesnt mean it cant be rape in the present i said he waved that away with his hand i know that you believe that ma petite i will not even disagree but musette will not be dissuaded by the argument asher likes both men and women he has had sex with her and enjoyed it in the past you have made sure she cannot physically harm him so it would be merely sex merely fucking he would not be harmed by that i raised eyebrows at him you believe that that thered be no harm to it non nor does musette in truth musette knows belle knows that to have sex with musette again after all these years will be painful for asher it will harm him but not in a way that belle will let us negotiate around to belle morte if a man has an orgasm then he must have enjoyed himself it is her reasoning she really doesnt understand that theres a difference between lust and love does she non ma petite trиs non why is it always asher that we cant protect asher that we cant save he shook his head i have asked that for a very very long time ma petite i have yet to find an answer i laid my cheek against his knee this is the longest ive ever been able to go between feedings i glanced a my watch its almost two dawn will come in three almost four hours i must rescind the control i have lent you for the ardeur before then you must feed it its not only your control is it no it is fear and exhaustion and thinking too hard and your own growing abilities in a few more months you will be down to one feeding a day or a night you will be able to store up the feedings and go longer my head is practically in your lap and i dont feel the least stirrings he stroked my hair and it was a comforting touch i wanted to be held more than i wanted sex i wanted him to hold me while i drifted off to sleep that sounded better than anything else i could think of right now once dawn comes my tie with you will weaken and you will not be able to keep the ardeur at bay i am sorry ma petite but we must feed it youre as tired as i am i said i want nothing more than to climb between the silk sheets and wrap our nude bodies around one another i want to hold and be held sex is a wondrous thing but tonight i wish to be comforted more than pleasured i feel like a child in the dark who knows the monsters are under the bed i want to be told it will be alright but i am far too old to believe such comforting lies maybe it was because i was tired maybe it was because jeanclaude had just said out loud almost exactly how i felt i remembered other nights when wed all been this tired this frightened this unsure of what the next nightfall would bring i remembered asher and julianna and i we jeanclaude holding each other simply holding each other the feel of bare skin and warmth like a grownup version of a teddy bear hold me tonight julianna used to say and unspoken between the two men had been how often her fears allowed them to be as close and frightened as they truly were julianna had been the bridge between the two men they would never have been able to be so close for so long without her i had the memories i knew how many times her needs had brought them together her love for each of them had bound them close jeanclaude had been the brains asher the charm though both were charming and both intelligent but julianna had been their heart one living beating heart for all three of them i could never be julianna i didnt have her kindness her gentleness her patience we were so unalike but here i was centuries later with the same two men i let out a long breath took in another let it out listened to it shake is something wrong ma petite i mean more wrong than i know i raised my face from his knee if asher was truly a ménage а trois with us then musette would have to leave him alone wouldnt she some expression passed over his face quickly swallowed away hidden behind that beautiful polite mask he wore when he was not sure what expression would help and what would hurt if we had been able to answer truthfully tonight that asher was in our bed then musette could not have asked for him this is true if he joined us tonight then tomorrow hed be safe my voice sounded so matter of fact as if i were proposing we go shopping or get dinner his voice was even more careful than mine that would be true if i had just let you and asher be a couple when i wasnt around then he would have been safe but i cant i shook my head in theory i dont have a problem with it i like men i see men as attractive so i understand everyone seeing them as attractive that men are attracted to men makes perfect sense to me but in practice i cant bring myself to share my man with another man i cant do it if i found out you and asher had been doing it behind my back id dump your ass i know its amazingly unfair im sleeping with micah and damn near sleeping with nathaniel and was having sex with richard until a few months ago yet you have to be with just me its monstrously unfair i know that i am not alienated from your bed when the others are with you except for richard who would never share i know you get blood from the men because i still wont donate blood to you but its not the same i want no one but you ma petite i have made that clear i looked up at him then youve made it clear but i know that you do want someone else besides me ive felt what you feel when you look at asher i see the way you two look at each other it hurts sometimes just to watch you be in a room together i am sorry ma petite i tucked my knees to my chest and hugged them there let me finish this thought jeanclaude please he motioned for me to go ahead i cant let you take asher to your bed and i cant take asher to mine but i remember what it was like for the three of you i remember how safe it felt there are moments when i forget that these arent my memories and i long for what the three of you had it seems a hell of a lot more peaceful than what were doing i hugged my legs so tight my arms trembled with the force of it i dont know if i can go through with it but id like to try try what ma petite his voice was very careful i want asher safe jeanclaude had gone very still i do not understand ma petite yes you do he shook his head non i will have no misunderstandings here you must be precise in your meaning i couldnt look at him while i said it bring asher in here for the night i dont promise but i want him warm and nude beside us i want to chase that hurt from his eyes i want to show him with my hands and my body that i find him lovely i looked up at him then and found his face unreadable i dont know at what point im going to scream foul and bail on you both im sure theres going to come a point there usually is but if we bring him into our bed tonight in whatever way then hes safe for tomorrow right what will your nimirraj say he assumed that you and i were intimate with asher when he got to town a lot of people assume it you have told him the truth yes and wont he be angry about sharing you with yet another man i shook my head micah is more practical than i am jeanclaude its not just love or lust that brings me back to asher tonight its securing our power base if asher is safe then were all safer his pain cant be used against us how very practical of you ma petite ive learned from the best he gave me a look one eyebrow raised if i were truly practical in matters of the heart things would have gone more quickly between us maybe or maybe not you knew if you pushed too hard id have either run or tried to kill you he gave that graceful shrug perhaps but i should ask so there are no misunderstandings do you mean to bring asher to our bed only for tonight would it make a difference i asked it may to him i tried to wrap my head around it all and failed i dont know i know that i dont want to give up alone time with you just you i know that i dont want to always have company julianna and asher managed alone time even though we were a threesome for the first time in a long time my personal life is as close as its ever been to working i dont want to screw that up i understand i guess i want asher safe i want to chase that flinching out of his eyes but in the real world we are just running this up the flagpole if it works great but if it doesnt work then what will asher have to leave will you lose your second will it hurt you and asher more will he touched fingertips to my lips shhh ma petite i have called asher he comes even now i felt my eyes go big my breath freeze in my throat while my pulse beat like a crazed thing what had i done nothing yet the ten thousand dollar question was what was i about to do and could i live with it later asher came through the door slowly his face carefully hidden behind a fall of golden hair hed changed to a fresh unbloodied shirt it was white and the color did not suit him you called he said i froze still hugging my knees my pulse suddenly pounding in my throat yet my breath stopped for a second or two we did jeanclaude said in that careful voice asher looked up then a glimpse of face through all that hair i think it was the we that brought the reaction jeanclaude had sat up very straight before asher came to the door he was elegant poised in his leather and silk i was still huddled on the rug at his feet staring at asher like he was the fox and i was the rabbit jeanclaude touched my shoulder and i jumped i looked up at him and he was staring down at me it must be your decision ma petite why is everything always my decision i asked because you will not tolerate anything else oh i remembered now great i whispered he squeezed my shoulder gently nothing has been said we can go on as we are i shook my head no i wont be the one responsible for tomorrow night if it goes all wrong i wont risk him because of my moral outrage as you like ma petite he said in that careful voice that said nothing what has happened now asher asked and his voice wasnt quite empty there was a thread of fear in it with what was sleeping down the hall i couldnt blame him i eased my arms from around my knees they were stiff from holding on too tight i tried to smooth my numb hands down my legs to touch my skirt and found only my hose the navy skirt was too short for me to have been sitting the way i was if thered been anyone in the room to see theyd have been able to tell my underwear matched it i got my knees under me moving slowly stiffly my body tight with tension what has happened asher asked and this time his voice was bland nothing mon ami jeanclaude said or rather nothing more its my fault i said i got to my feet still moving slowly what is your fault asher was looking from one to the other of us trying to read something from our faces i stepped off the fur and my high heels made a sharp sound on the floor that youre in danger from musette you have done all you can to protect me anita more than i had ever dreamt no one challenges musette for fear of belle morte you have done what many council members would fear to do ignorance is bliss i said he gave me a quick look through the shine of his hair what does that mean i walked towards him where he still stood just inside the door it means that maybe i can be brave because i dont know any better ive never seen belle in person dont get me wrong shes impressive enough from a distance but ive never met the real thing i was standing in front of him now he had turned his face so that only the perfect half showed he hadnt hidden himself from me this completely in months i reached up to touch the side of his face hed turned away and he flinched jerking back hard enough to make the door rattle non non ive touched you before i said and my voice was low soft the voice youd use to talk to a skittish animal or a man on a ledge he turned his whole face away from me you saw the paintings you saw what i once was and you have seen now what i looked like when the wounds were fresh he turned his back hands on the door shaking his head you have seen what belle morte saw i shook my head realized he couldnt see it and touched his shoulder he flinched i glanced back at jeanclaude and his face was empty only his eyes shown the barest glimpse of a pain so deep it had nearly destroyed three people i pressed my body against ashers back moved my arms up his sides hugging him from behind he froze under my touch so still folding himself away going deep inside where it wouldnt hurt i pressed my cheek against his back and held him while his body went quiet under my touch i swallowed past tears that i would not shed my voice was steady though i have seen you through jeanclaudes memories long before tonight i remember the glory of you under my hands against my body i molded my body against his clung to him i needed no painting to show me your beauty a shudder ran through his body and he tried to turn to throw me off but i held on and he couldnt move away without hurting me let me go anita let me go no i said no not tonight he made small struggling motions trapped against the door like a man trying to pace a room that was only an inch wider than his own body what do you want from me there was something close to tears in his voice join us tonight thats what i want join us he stopped his restless movements and went still again but not like before i could feel his heart beating against my cheek id have sworn it hadnt been beating a second before join you how his voice was a strangled whisper i grabbed his shirt and used it to turn him around he moved slowly like trying to turn the earth against its axis he pressed his back to the door and showed me only what remained of that perfect profile i pulled on the shirt trying to lead him into the room but he would not be moved this far he looked past me to jeanclaude i cannot do this his voice held such pain what do you think she is asking jeanclaudes voice was still so carefully empty she will do anything to keep her people safe even take a cripple to her bed for one night i wadded the shirt in my hands and was forced to go to him because he would not come to me i do want to keep you safe from musette and this will do it but thats not why not really he looked down at me and there was a world in his eyes a world of pain and need and horror so big so lonely the first hot tear grazed my cheek i spoke softly to him in french and i understood some of what i said asher grabbed my wrists and forced me away from him non jeanclaude not like this it is either her desire or it is not to be i will not divide you from what remains of your triumvirate i would rather spend a night in musettes bed than weaken your power so you must be strong while they are here or we will all perish i took a deep breath and it was as if something had pulled back from me like a veil being lifted i turned and glanced at the vampire behind me did you do that on purpose he hid his face in his hands and said spoke voice no longer empty i cannot help wanting what i want ma petite forgive me i turned back to asher it isnt my desire you want asher you know im attracted to you he tried to look away but i touched his face and this time he didnt flinch away he let me turn him to face me again my fingers on the edge of his chin the skin was still smooth there even though it was on the right side where most was ruined it was almost as if the people that had done this to him couldnt bring themselves to ruin the perfect curve of his lips its not lust you want from me his gaze dropped he almost closed his eyes the expression on his face like a man bracing for a blow he whispered no i went up on tiptoe put my hands on either side of his face one so smooth like satin and silk but softer the other rough pitted hardly feeling like skin at all i do love you asher his eyes opened and they were so raw so full of so many things that could be used to hurt i dont know how much was jeanclaudes memories at first but whatever it began as i do love you me no one else yet you have not taken me to your bed i love a lot of people that i dont sleep with okay that i dont have sex with the expression in his eyes began to die i realized what id said i want you to come to bed tonight please asher and not just for sleeping he put his hands on either side of mine only to keep me safe from musette i couldnt argue that but thats true but does that matter so very much does it matter that thats why he smiled gently and moved my hands away from his face yes anita it does matter why you will take me to your bed tonight but tomorrow you will feel guilty and you will run away again i frowned at him you talk like ive done this before with you and i havent he patted my hands between his you took four men into that bed over there four of us yet you have sex with only jeanclaude you feed the ardeur from nathaniel but you have not fucked him he let go of my hands and shook his head laughing only you could have the strength of will to sleep night after night beside such beauty and not take all that nathaniel had to offer i have met saints and priests over the centuries that had not your will to resist temptation i dont seem to be resisting all that much anymore i said hands on hips he laughed again smile fading as he did it jason you have put firmly back into the box marked friend but what of me i do not wish to join you in that bed again if tomorrow i will be merely another friend i cannot bear it i frowned up at him id done my best to forget what happened when belle morte caused the ardeur to rise months ago thanks to her id participated in the closest thing i hoped to ever get to an orgy no intercourse but a lot of hands and bodies touching where they shouldnt have been asher was right id done my best to ignore the whole thing ignore it hard enough and it never happened but of course it had happened and id not dealt with it what do you want me to say im sorry that im a little squeamish about having been in bed with four men at the same time yeah it embarrassed me so sue me tonight will embarrass you too a lot of things embarrass me asher i cant help that you cannot help but be who and what you are anita i would not change you but i also will not be just a night of charity in your bed i tell you i could not bear being cast out again i knew in that instant that he didnt mean me casting him out from our bed after the ardeur he meant what belle had done to him all those centuries ago she had thrown him away like a damaged toy after all you can always buy more toys i started to pace back and forth in front of him not looking at either of them but doing something anything for the nervous energy that was building up what do you want from me asher a guarantee yes he said at last that is exactly what i want from you i stopped pacing and looked at him what kind of guarantee that i wont freak out about this tomorrow i shook my head im sorry i cant promise because i dont know how ill feel what will micah say if he finds out youve been with me micah is okay with it asher looked at me i know i know i keep waiting for him to pitch a fit about something hes fine with sharing me with jeanclaude and nathaniel and i quote anyone else that you need to include unquote asher widened eyes at me my isnt he understanding you have no idea i said when he came into my life he said hed do anything to stay with me anything to be my nimirraj so far hes meant it he seems perfect for you asher said voice full of a soft irony i know makes me wonder when the other shoe will drop and hell turn on me asher touched my face which made me look at him he was looking full at me now those ice blue eyes so sincere i would never want to do anything that would damage what you have built in your life if we do this and you run away then jeanclaude will have damaged his relationship with you and i will leave i felt my eyes go wide what do you mean youll leave i mean if you take me to your bed tonight and cast me out tomorrow i will leave i will no longer watch jeanclaude be in love with others while i wait it will take time to find another master who will want me and probably not as a second i know that i am weak for a master i have no animal to call he shook his head so many of my powers are useless except in intimate situations and once he almost touched the scarred side of his face but let his hand fall away once this happened no one would let me get close enough to use my powers on them he licked his lips sighing at the same time and that one gesture made me catch my breath i did want him id wanted him the way a woman wants a man for a long time but lust alone had never been enough for me youre saying that if we take you to our bed tonight but i freak tomorrow and its only this one time that youll leave us i asked he nodded he didnt even need to think about it youre giving me an ultimatum asher im not good at ultimatums i know that but i have to protect myself anita i cannot live this close to heaven and not be allowed inside i think it will drive me mad in the end he leaned back against the door and looked past me to jeanclaude i have been thinking for some months now that i should go it is too hard on all of us know that it has healed some of the wounds to be with you as a friend again jeanclaude he turned and smiled at me and seeing the way you watch me has helped more than its hurt anita he turned put his hand on the doorknob i put my hand flat on the door holding it asher looked at me let me go anita you know you dont want this what am i supposed to say to that asher that youre right that if musette hadnt come today that i wouldnt be making this offer now youre right i wouldnt be i pressed myself against the side of the door but the thought of you leaving of never seeing you again i shook my head and damn it if i was going to cry again dont go please dont go i have to go anita he touched my shoulder tried to move me out of the way so he could open the door i shook my head no he frowned at me ma cherie you do not love me not truly if you do not love me and you do not want me then you must let me go i do love you and i do want you you love me as a friend you want me but you want many men yet you do not give yourself to them i have all eternity but my patience is not good enough to out wait you ma cherie you have defeated me i would have tried to seduce you but again he almost touched the scarred side of his face but his hand fell away as if he could not bare to touch himself i have seen the men you have turned down such perfection and you walk away without so much as a regret he frowned as if he didnt understand it but he knew it to be true what could i offer that they could not he put his hands against my shoulder and gently tried to move me out of the way i pressed my back into the doorframe my hand on the doorknob no was all i could think to say yes ma cherie yes it is time i shook my head no i pressed my back into the door so hard that i knew id be bruised in the morning i couldnt let him go i knew somehow that if he opened that door we would never get another chance i prayed for words i prayed to be able to speak my heart and not to be afraid i let richard walk out on me i think hed have gone anyway but i just sat on the floor and watched him go i didnt stand in his way i figured it was his choice and you cant hold someone if they dont want to be held if someone really wants to be free of you you have to let them go well fuck that fuck that all to hell dont go asher please dont go i love the way your hair shines in the light i love the way you smile when youre not trying to hide or impress anyone i love your laughter i love the way your voice can hold sorrow like the taste of rain i love the way you watch jeanclaude when he moves through a room when you dont think anyones watching because its exactly the way i watch him i love your eyes i love your pain i love you i closed the distance between us wrapped my arms around him pressed my cheek to his chest dried tears on the silk of his shirt and was still whispering i love you i do love you when he raised my face and kissed me really kissed me for the very first time we broke from that gentle kiss and i led asher to the bed by the hand he pulled back coming like a reluctant child jeanclaude stood by the bed his face as blank as he could make it there is one thing i must say before we begin i am controlling ma petites ardeur but there will come a point in all this where i will lose control i cannot guarantee what will happen when that control is lost asher and i stood beside him holding hands he was clinging to my hand with a fierceness that was almost painful his voice did not show the tension i felt in his body if i thought it was only the ardeur which made anita want to take me to her bed then i would say no because when the ardeur had cooled she would cast me aside as she did before he raised my hand to his lips and laid the softest touch across my knuckles i believe anita wishes me in her bed the ardeur may rise or fall it is all the same to me now jeanclaude looked at me ma petite i would rather do as much of this as possible before the ardeur but i understand that its going to be hard on you i shrugged i dont know i know im committed to this so i guess its okay he raised an eyebrow at me you are never convincing when you lie ma petite now thats just not true i said i lie very well thank you not to me i shrugged im doing the best i can here jeanclaude i looked up at the ceiling as if i could see the sky through all the rock above us i know one thing i want whatever were doing done before dawn i do not want you guys to fade in the middle ma petite still finds it unnerving that we die at dawn jeanclaude said what time is it asher asked i looked at my watch were down to about two and a half hours barely enough time asher said and something about what he said or the way he said it made jeanclaude do that masculine chuckle that only men do and only about women or sex i wasnt sure id ever heard that sound from jeanclaude i was suddenly very aware that i was the only girl and they were both men i know that sounds silly i mean i knew that already but i suddenly felt it it was like walking into a bar and feeling all those eyes follow you as you walk like lions watching gazelles if either of the men had turned that same look to me i think i would have bolted but they didnt jeanclaude crawled onto the bed still fully clothed and held out his hand to me i stared at that longfingered pale hand graceful even in that small movement ashers hand squeezed more gently on my other hand i realized in that moment that if i chickened out that would be the end of it there would be no pressure from either of them but asher would be gone not tonight but soon i didnt want him to be gone i took jeanclaudes hand and he pulled me gently onto the silk bedspread silk is slippery when youre wearing hose their hands on mine kept me from slipping off the edge of the bed they half pulled me onto the bed why is it i said that you never slide off the bed when youre wearing silk centuries of practice jeanclaude said i recall when you werent so practiced remember the duchess vicante said asher jeanclaude blushed a faint hint of pink i hadnt even known he could blush what happened i asked i fell he said trying for dignity and failing because he smiled what he will not say is that he cut his chin on a silver mirror that he broke when he fell off the duchess and her silk sheets blood everywhere and the cuckold husband on the stairs i looked at jeanclaude he nodded shrugged what happened i asked the duchess cut herself on one of the shards of glass and told her husband it was her own blood she was a very enterprising woman was the duchess vicante so you both knew each other when you werent perfectly suave jeanclaude said no asher watched me learn my lessons but he had five years with belle before i came to court if he had rough edges they were worn away by the time i arrived i had them mon ami asher said and he smiled i was overwhelmed with a flood of images of that smile that smile when his hair was in long locks and the hat on his head graceful with feathers that smile by candlelight that smile while we played chess and julianna sewed by the fire that smile in a spill of clean sheets and juliannas laughter it had been a long time since wed seen that smile we drew him to the bed and the smile vanished jeanclaude swept the bedspread aside to reveal sheets a little bluer than ashers eyes blue as the daytime sky cerulean blue but asher stayed on his knees as if afraid to lay upon the bed i could see his pulse thudding in his throat and it had nothing to do with vampire or shapeshifter powers only fear i think asher was afraid i could taste his fear on the back of my tongue i could swallow it enjoy the bouquet of it like a fine wine to whet the appetite the fear called to that piece of me that was richards beast it roiled inside me like a cat stretching exploring the space it was trapped in a thin growl trickled from my lips control ma petite do not lose it so soon it was hard to think let alone talk i came to my knees and raised ashers shirt my fingers playing along his skin i wanted to rip his shirt off and put my mouth to that tender skin but it wasnt sex i was thinking of vampires may not feed off each other but a werewolf will eat a vampire i closed my eyes forced my hands away from his body im trying but you know what happens if i push the ardeur off too long the other hungers rise oui ma petite i have not forgotten you cant help control richards beast my voice sounded hoarse non i looked into ashers wide blue eyes so afraid so very afraid and not of my beast it helped steady me but i knew it wouldnt last long whatever we were going to do had to be done quickly i want to see you nude for the first time without the ardeur riding me asher but there isnt much time i tried to draw him down onto the bed but he wouldnt come jeanclaude propped himself up on the pillows and held out his arms almost the way youd reach for a baby he spoke softly in french but i couldnt catch it all most of it was a plea to hurry asher crawled onto the bed completely though every movement was slow reluctant he let himself be settled down against jeanclaudes body but they were both fully clothed and the way they were sitting they could have been in any club it wasnt so much sexual as comforting i looked at the two of them and knew someone was going to have to take off some clothes fine i stripped off my jacket and tossed it to the floor jeanclaude raised eyebrows if we keep going this carefully itll be dawn and nothing will have changed i had to slide off the bed to get the skirt off and left it in a pile with my blouse the panties and bra were a matched pair a shiny navy satin when id found them they had reminded me of the color of jeanclaudes eyes i expected to feel embarrassed standing there in my underwear but i didnt maybe id spent too much time around the shapeshifters and their casual nudist policy or perhaps it just didnt seem wrong to be undressed in front of asher i dont know but i didnt question it i climbed carefully back onto the cerulean silk so that i didnt slide off again you have truly decided to do this asher said in a voice that was soft uncertain i nodded as i crawled in my thighhigh hose and high heels across the bed to them i kept the heels because i knew jeanclaude liked it and hed worn enough boots to bed for me turn about can be fair play i tapped ashers ankles and he opened his legs a little i crawled between his legs having to force my body up between his calves his knees jeanclaudes legs on either side of his seemed to hold him tight against me i was left to worm my way between his thighs using my hips my legs and finally impatient my hands to spread him wide before me it left me finally kneeling between his legs my knees pressed up against him which was actually a lot less erotic than it sounds because he was still wearing his pants and the angle was odd i reached for the buttons on his shirt asher grabbed my hands slowly ma cherie i raised eyebrows at him we dont have time for slow he rolled his head back so he could see jeanclaude is she always this impatient she begins like an american man but she does foreplay like shes french whats that supposed to mean i asked let us help you undress mon ami and you will not need to ask questions for you will know ashers hands dropped away from mine and i unbuttoned his shirt i did do it quickly because time was not on our side i did not want to be in the bed with them when they died at dawn i was still unnerved when jeanclaude did it with me i did not want to see it done in stereo jeanclaude raised asher up and between the two of us we peeled the longsleeved shirt off of his upper body i would love to linger on every piece of your body asher but i want to see you nude before dawn next time if we start earlier we can take our time he smiled next time you have not seen all there is to see do not promise until you have seen as they say the whole show i leaned into him our faces only inches apart i dont believe there is anything you could show me that would make me not want you i almost believe that ma cherie almost i leaned back enough on my knees to cradle his face between my hands the difference in texture wasnt jarring it was just part of touching asher i kissed him long slow exploring him softly with my lips i drew back enough to see his face believe it i drew my fingers down the edge of his jaw on either side tickling nails across the smooth line of his neck one hand mirroring the other until i came to his chest it wasnt hands i wanted to use there i kissed along the scarred edge of his collarbone but the scars made the skin too thick i had to move to the other side to nibble along his collarbone to give him that safe edge of teeth he shuddered for me i moved back to the right side and kissed down until i found his nipple stranded in all that hardness i wasnt sure if his nipple had the sensitivity it had had before there was only one way to find out i licked his nipple a quick flick of tongue and felt the skin move contract i used my hands to help mound that side of his chest so that i could find a mouthful of him the scars were harsh to my mouth but his nipple drew tight under my tongue my mouth and lightly teeth only when id thoroughly explored the right did i turn to the left his left nipple was easier to take into my mouth easier to tease i used more teeth and he groaned as i marked him lightly nothing that wouldnt fade within moments i licked down the left side of his chest his stomach then moved back to the right and explored the scarred flesh as i had the other because i knew now that scarred or not it worked he could feel my mouth on his skin my fingers trailing lower if he could feel then i wanted to give him everything i could my mouth came to his waist the belt the top of his pants i licked from one side of his waist to the other then came back to the right side and licked along the front of his flat stomach so the tip of my tongue eased inside the very top of his pants even with the belt ashers voice came breathy harsh you have taught her well i can take little credit for it mon ami she enjoys her work i rolled eyes up at them please stop talking about me like i cant understand you our most sincere apologies jeanclaude said oui asher said it was not an insult no but you assume that if im any good it has to be because a man taught me thats so sexist we can only apologize again ma petite i undid the buckle on ashers belt and he didnt stop me this time i got the top fastener undone but ive never been good at unzipping a man when hes sitting down i think im always a little afraid ill get him caught in the zipper some help here i said jeanclaude lifted asher helped and the zipper came down revealing that he was wearing royal blue bikinis in silk what else there is no way to get real pants off of anyone gracefully i peeled the pants down ashers long legs slipped off the shoes that he was still wearing there were no socks to bother with he lay back cradled against jeanclaude wearing nothing but the tiny blue silk undies i wanted to snatch them away from him i wanted to see him completely nude it seemed more important than anything else to finally see if the scars went all the way across i crawled forward and licked the edge of his stomach so that my tongue dipped just below the waistband of the silk an echo of what id done to his pants i could feel him pressed against the thin cloth the hardness of him brushing against my chin as i moved around his waist i went back to the right side and the scars that dribbled down to midthigh i licked kissed and bit along them until he cried out then i did the same to his other thigh going lower until i licked the back of his knee and he whimpered jeanclaudes voice came almost strangled ma petite please i looked up the tip of my tongue still playing lightly on the very edge of the bend of ashers knee ashers eyes were rolled almost back into his head i knew things through jeanclaudes memories that only a lover would know such as the fact that he loved having the backs of his knees licked please what i asked please finish it i knew what he meant i crawled back up until i was kneeling between their legs again the blue silk was stretched tight and this time it was very erotic i slid my fingers in the top of the silk and it was ashers hands that spilled eager helping slide the silk down his hips i pulled the silk down his thighs but was only half paying attention because i was staring at what had been revealed scars dribbled from his thigh towards the groin like white worms frozen under the skin but they stopped a few inches short of the groin and he lay thick and long and straight and perfect i had a confused image of him with the scars fresh and he was misshapen unable to become fully erect twisted to one side unable to perform i had to shake my head to clear the memory i met jeanclaudes gaze id never seen him look so utterly lost shocked amazed i had never seen so many different emotions flow across his face he was finally caught between laughter and tears mon ami what there was a doctor only a few years ago who thought that most of the scarring was in the foreskin and it was jeanclaude laid his head on ashers shoulder lost in that golden hair and he wept and cried all this time all this time and i thought it was my fault you were ruined and it was my fault asher reached back and stroked jeanclaudes hair it was never your fault mon ami if you had been with us when we were taken they would have done to you what they did to me and that i could not have borne if you had not been free to save me i would be dead now along with our julianna they held each other and cried and laughed and healed and i was suddenly superfluous kneeling on the bed in my lingerie and for once i didnt mind in the least jeanclaude released the ardeur with less than an hour to go before they would die i did not want to be trapped underneath anyone when that happened but the ardeur had been denied longer than id ever denied it and it was like a force of nature a storm that broke over us washed away jeanclaudes clothes and what was left of mine i took asher into my mouth and explored the perfection of him found the one thin scar that trailed down his scrotum i sucked the ridge of scar tissue into my mouth and made him cry out above me it was chance more than planning that put jeanclaude underneath me inside me with asher at my back his weight beating into both of us but without an opening to claim or without an opening i was willing to share i could feel the length of asher pressed along my back every time jeanclaude pushed himself up inside me asher pushed himself against my back wedged between the cheeks of my buttocks they echoed each other perfectly when one moved the other moved until somewhere in the middle of it all i begged asher to enter me take me jeanclaudes voice came as if from a great distance non mon chardonneret we have done no preparation she has never had it done before dimly i realized what id asked and was happy someone could think well enough to stop me from letting others hurt me but part of me was angry the ardeur wanted asher inside wanted to drink him in i rode jeanclaudes body while ashers body rode mine jeanclaudes hands were on my waist holding me in place steadying me directing me the way you lead a dance partner one of ashers hands propped him up on the bed but the other had spilled up to cup my breast his hand kneading pulling just this side of pain i felt the building pressure inside me that feeling that preceded the explosion and i didnt want it yet not yet i wanted asher the way i wanted jeanclaude i wanted needed him to pierce my body please asher please be inside me please he drew my hair to one side and bared my neck the ardeur flared through me yes asher yes that warm deep well was filling up up inside me there were only seconds to have him join us i wanted his release with ours i wanted him with us there seemed like there was something else i should have been remembering but it was lost in the pounding of jeanclaudes body the rhythm of my hips the feel of his hands on my waist ashers hand on my breast tight enough for pain now the feel of him so solid so wet from his own body so that he moved in a channel of his own moisture yet i knew he had not come he raised the hand from the bed and cupped my head to one side holding it straining my neck in a long clean line it was as if they knew they both knew what my body was about to do as if they could smell it or hear it or taste it at the moment that that warmth spilled over the edge as the first drop of it spilled over my skin tightened my body asher struck there was one moment of sharp pain and the pain fed into the pleasure and i remembered what i had forgotten ashers bite was pleasure i rode that pleasure over and over and over until i screamed out wordless soundless skinless boneless i was nothing but the warm spilling pleasure there was nothing else jeanclaude came screaming his nails digging into my skin and that brought me back reminded me i had a body that skin contained me that bones and muscles rode the body underneath me asher came in a scalding wave against my back as his mouth stayed locked on my throat we fed on one another my ardeur drank jeanclaude up through the warm moistness of my body through the skin wherever it touched his his ardeur drank me down pulling down the long shaft of him like a hand inside my body taking things away my ardeur drank asher down absorbed him where he lay on my skin sucked him in as he pulled at me the feel of his mouth locked on my neck was like a trap the ardeur sucking him down through his mouth and he sucking my blood feeding swallowing drinking me down as long as he fed he brought orgasm in one crashing wave after another wave after wave of pleasure and it wasnt until jeanclaude cried out underneath me that i realized through his own marks he was able to feel what i was feeling asher rode us both rode us and brought us rode us and brought us until when he drew back there was blood pouring from his mouth and i knew hed taken more than he needed merely to feed it wouldnt kill me but in that one shining moment i wasnt sure it mattered it was the kind of pleasure youd beg for kill for maybe maybe even let yourself die for i collapsed on top of jeanclaude twitching unable to control my body unable to do more than shiver jeanclaude lay trembling underneath me asher collapsed on top of us i felt him tremble against my back we lay shaking trembling waiting for one of us to be able to move enough to walk or scream or anything then dawn came and i felt their souls slip away felt their bodies go slack and empty i was pressed between the frantic pulse and warmth of their bodies the fluids not even cooled on our skin and suddenly asher was heavy and jeanclaude was totally limp under all the weight i struggled to get out from between them but my arms and legs werent working yet i did not want to lie here while their bodies cooled i couldnt get up i couldnt get asher off of me i couldnt make my body work how much blood had i lost too much how much i was dizzy lightheaded and i couldnt tell if it was from the sex or if asher had truly taken too much blood i tried to push him off of me i should have been able to do that and i couldnt the first edge of nausea hit me and i knew it was blood loss i touched my neck and found that blood was still seeping from the puncture wounds that shouldnt have been happening should it i never donated blood voluntarily i didnt know how long the wounds should bleed i tried to lift with my arms like doing a pushup and the world swam in streams of colors dizziness threatened to engulf the world i did the only thing i could think ofi screamed the door opened and it was jason i dont think id ever been so happy to see him i managed to say help me my voice sounded weak and scared and i hated it but i also was feeling nauseous and dizzy and that wasnt postcoital languor it was blood loss now that i could see again i realized i was drenched in bloodand other thingsbut it was mainly the blood that was worrying me because it was all mine jason rolled asher off of me he moved with that boneless ease that only a truly dead body has i dont know what the difference between sleep and death is but you know instantly when you move even an arm whether its death or whether its sleep asher lay there on his back his hair spilled around his face like a halo crimson blood glittered on his chin his neck his upper chest the scars didnt take away from the beauty of him nude they werent the first thing you noticed or even the third he lay drenched in my blood like some fallen god come down to death at last even sick from loss of blood i could not find him anything but beautiful what the fuck was wrong with me jason had to help me slide off of jeanclaude catching me in his arms holding me like youd hold a child i was nude hed just dragged me from a bed where id obviously had sex with two men yet jason hadnt made a single quip or joke when jason had this much ammunition but didnt tease things were bad i laid my head against jasons shoulder and that helped the dizziness made the world a little less shaky he started to turn me away from the bed but i said wait not yet he stopped moving what i want to remember this what he asked again the way they look together they both lay on their backs but whereas asher looked like some fallen death god jeanclaude looked like a god of a different kind his thick black hair lay in a heavy mass around his head carelessly arranged like a dark frame for that pale pale face his lips were halfparted his lashes thick as lace upon his cheeks he lay as if he had fallen asleep after some great passion one hand across his stomach the other at his side one knee bent so that he seemed almost displayed only jeanclaude could die and look this pretty while he did it anita anita i realized that jason had been talking for awhile how much blood did they take my voice came out hoarse my mouth was dry not they only asher he settled me closer in his arms almost like he was hugging me his leather jacket creaked as he moved his bare chest was very warm against my naked skin he didnt just feed jason sounded disapproving which you didnt hear much he got caught up in the moment i think he shifted me so that he could free up a hand to touch my forehead which seemed silly since i was nude but we often fall into habit when were stressed you check someones temperature on their foreheads even if theyre naked you dont feel feverish if anything you feel a little cool that made me remember something and the fact that id forgotten said i was feeling worse than i knew is my neck still bleeding a little should it be he carried me towards the bathroom have you never been bitten this badly before he opened the door with his knee and one hand and carried me through not without passing out afterwards non i frowned did i just say non instead of no yep he said shit i said yeah he said he sat on the edge of the huge black marble tub balancing me in his lap while he turned on the water the water spilled out of a silver swans mouth which id always thought was ostentatious but hey it wasnt my bathroom the nausea had passed the dizziness was waning down put me down the marble is cold he said i sighed i need to find out how well my bodys working just try sitting up in my lap without me holding you if youre okay ill fetch towels and you can sit on them but trust me you dont want to sit naked on this marble practical i said dont tell anyone i actually made sense itll ruin my image i smiled secrets safe with me i tried sitting up while jason fidgeted with the water trying to get the right temperature i could sit up great i tried to stand and only jasons arm around my waist kept me from falling on the marble steps leading down from the tub he tucked me safely back in his lap dont try and do so much so fast anita i leaned back against him his arm like a safety belt around my waist why i am so weak how can you have been around vampires this long and ask me that i dont let them feed i said i do and trust me when youve donated this much it takes a little while to recover he seemed satisfied with the water temperature at last he turned the faucets on harder and had to talk louder over the sound of the water well get you cleaned up and see how you feel i could feel myself frowning and i wasnt sure why i felt like i should be angry i should be something and i wasnt now that i wasnt trapped between jeanclaude and asher anymore i was strangely calm no not just calm i felt good and i shouldnt have i frowned harder trying to chase this wonderful lassitude away it was like trying to wake from a bad dream when it didnt want to let you go except instead of fighting to wake from a nightmare i was fighting to destroy a good dream that seemed wrong too everything seemed wrong i felt vaguely like id missed something important but for the life of me i couldnt place it i felt out of sorts and wonderful at the same time it was as if my natural grumpiness was fighting some warm happy thought the warm happy thought was winning but i wasnt sure that that was necessarily a good thing whats wrong with me i asked what do you mean jason asked i feel good and i shouldnt i feel wonderful a few minutes ago i was terrified dizzy sick and scared but once you got me out of the bed it all seemed better just better he asked he was slipping out of his leather jacket one arm at a time while he took turns holding me with the other arm youre right not just better once i wasnt scared it was wonderful again i frowned and tried to think and was still having trouble doing it why cant i think through this he rearranged me in his lap so he could unzip his boots and push them off with his feet it finally hit me that he was undressing himself while still holding me in his lap who says that the skills you learn at work dont come in useful in your everyday life why are you undressing you cant move around without falling down id hate for you to drown in the tub i tried pushing this wonderful feeling farther away but it was like trying to fight a warm comforting mist you could strike out but there was nothing solid to hit the mist just moved and reformed and stayed stop i said the one word was firm enough though i didnt feel very firm inside what he asked as he moved me enough forward so that he could unfasten the tops of his jeans this should bother me you trying to get naked while im naked in a tub that should bother me right but it doesnt does it he said he was unbuttoning his button fly jeans with one hand that took talent no it doesnt i said frowning again why doesnt it bother me you really dont know do you he asked no i said not even sure what i was saying no to hed gotten his jeans unbuttoned i can either lay you down on the very cold tile or i can throw you over my shoulder for a few seconds while i take the pants off ladys choice the decision seemed too hard for me i dont know he didnt ask a second time just tossed me as gently as he could over his shoulder sort of half a firemans carry being upside down made the world spin again and i wondered if i was going to be sick all over his back he balanced me there while he wormed out of his jeans i was now staring down his bare back as the jeans slid down the top of his butt the nausea had passed and i giggledi never gigglenice ass he choked or laughed i never knew you noticed underwear i said what you had underwear i caught a glimpse of it i had this horrible urge to run my hands over his butt just because it was there and i could it was like i was drunk or high yeah i had underwear on what about it can you put it back on you dont really care if i have underwear on or not do you and there was something in his voice that was almost teasing nope i shook my head which made the world spin again oh god i think im going to be sick stop moving itll pass you wouldnt be sick at all if you hadnt fought to get out from between the two of them too much physical exertion right afterwards will make you sick as a dog sink into the feeling just ride it and it feels wonderful i felt a little silly talking to his ass but it didnt seem nearly as silly as it should have what feels wonderful guess he said that made me frown dont want to guess god what was wrong with me tell me lets get you in the tub a bath will help clear your head he moved me back to his arms and stepped over the edge of the tub youre naked i said so are you he said that had a certain logic to it that i couldnt quite argue with though i felt i should have argued with it werent you going to put something back on the underwear is silk im not going to ruin it by wearing it in the tub because you think i should put it on besides you dont really care if im naked or not remember a headache was beginning just behind one eye no i said but i should care shouldnt i i mean jason lowered us both into the water it felt wonderful so warm so smooth so good against my skin jason moved me gently in the water until i was sitting in front of him cradled against his body the water was so warm so warm and i was so tired it would feel so good to just sleep jasons arm on my waist jerked me back anita you cant sleep in the bathtub youll drown you wont let me drown i said and my voice was thick with warmth and sleep no i wont let you drown he said i frowned as i halffloated in the water what is wrong with me jason i feel drunk you have been well and truly rolled by a vampire anita jeanclaude cant his own marks protect me my voice seemed to be coming from a long way away i never said it was jeanclaude asher i whispered the name ive shared blood with him before and it is the most amazing thing jeanclaude says he always holds back because he knows im not his pomme de sang im just a loaner loaner i said i dont think asher held back with you tonight the ardeur we were doing the ardeur each word was thick with effort the ardeur could have made him careless jason said his hands were very solid on me cradling me in the water more than against his body careless i said go ahead and pass out anita when you wake up well talk bout what things he said and his voice was sinking away into the candlelit dark i didnt remember him lighting the candles that jeanclaude usually kept around the tub i started to ask what things but the words never made it out loud i fell into a warm soft darkness where there was no fear no pain so warm so safe so loved i woke to the phone ringing i huddled in the sheets trying not to hear it god i was tired the bed moved someone else rumbling for it it wasnt until jasons voice said hello softly as if he were afraid of waking me that i woke completely why was jason in my bedroom that question was answered as soon as i opened my eyes i wasnt in my bedroom in fact i didnt know where the hell i was the bed was a kingsize but it was only pillows and a bed no headboard no footboard only a bed very modern very normal the only light was from a small door directly across from the foot of the bed i could catch a glimpse of a bathtub or shower i followed the dim light out and found bare stone walls and knew i was still inside the circus of the damned somewhere shes sick jason said he was quiet for a second shes asleep id rather not wake her i tried to remember why i was here and came up with nothing just a blank i started to roll over i think to ask who it was when i realized i was naked i pulled the sheets up over my breasts and turned over to see jason he was laying on his side his back to me the sheet pulled down enough that i could see the top of his buttocks what the fuck was i doing naked in a bed with jason where was jeanclaude okay probably in his coffin or his bed i never shared the bed when he was stone cold but why hadnt i gone home i dont think shes going to be well enough to come out today i tried to sit up and found that the world wasnt quite steady maybe sitting up wasnt such a good idea i stayed on my back sheet clutched to my chest and had to try twice to say im awake my mouth was incredibly dry jason turned towards me the movement pooled the sheet into his lap and left the backside of his body bare he covered the receiver with his hand how do you feel how did i get here why am i here i asked in a voice so hoarse it barely sounded like me do you remember anything i frowned and that hurt my throat hurt i raised a hand and found a large bandage on the right side of my neck there was a vampire bite under the bandages i knew that and with that knowledge i remembered i remembered everything and it wasnt just my mind that remembered it my body convulsed against the bed my spine bowing hands clawing at the sheets a moan tore from my throat before my body stole all the breath from me and i bucked against the bed caught in a sensory memory it wasnt as good as the original but damn it was close i dug my fists into the sheets balling the cloth up trying to find something to hold on to jason was suddenly beside me he grabbed my upper arms tried to hold me still anita whats wrong my hands came up automatically grabbing his forearms holding on my eyes rolled back into my head my body convulsed and my hands tore down his forearms i felt my nails sink into his flesh felt his skin give under me jason cried out somewhere between a scream and a moan i lay back against the bed panting eyes unable to focus i held onto jasons arms because it was the only solid thing i had anita he said his voice strained are you alright i tried to say yes but finally was reduced to nodding he pried my fingers from his arms gently folding my hands across the sheet and my stomach i felt the bed move as he moved i realized my eyes were shut i didnt remember shutting them what the hell was that he asked i started to say i didnt know but i did know i remembered asher sitting at a long banquet table with his hair in golden ringlets dressed in gold and crimson the wife of our host crushed her wine glass in her gloved hand her mouth halfparted her breath making the white mounds of her breasts rise and fall a small sound escaped her and when she could speak she asked for her maid and to be helped to her room for she was ill she wasnt ill asher had seduced her the night before on belles orders he had complained to jeanclaude that the woman simply lay there eyes rolled back in her head true but with almost no other reaction it had been most disappointing shed experienced a flashback of the orgasm the night before at the dinner table but she was a quiet sex partner which meant that her flashbacks could be explained away in public sort of i lay there staring up at jason seeing him now instead of candlelit rooms long deserted and people long gone to dust i found my voice and it was more hoarse than before as if the screaming had taken the rest of my voice it was a flashback i coughed to what he asked water please he hopped off the bed and knelt by a small refrigerator next to the bed he got out a small bottle of some athletic juicer it helps replace the electrolytes better than water i dont like this shit trust me youll feel better if you drink it than if you drink water water can make you nauseous suddenly the neon blue drink looked a whole lot better he opened it and handed it to me blood had filled the scratches on his forearms and was slowly seeping down his skin in red rivulets jesus jason im sorry i didnt mean to cut you up i took a sip of the neon bright liquid the taste was as bad as i remembered but a few small sips and i did feel a little better when i talked my voice didnt sound like id been in the desert for a month he held his arms up its okay though normally when i get this cut up its because i did a wonderful job entertaining a friend he smiled i shook my head and i wasnt dizzy this time good you said this was a flashback a flashback to what he asked to what happened with jeanclaude and asher he raised eyebrows at me you mean that was a flashback to what the orgasm i felt heat creep up my face something like that i muttered he laughed youre joking i dont think so i drank some more of the vile drink and avoided looking at him ive served as refreshment for jeanclaude for years and ive never had any reaction like that its something asher can do what he asked youre bleeding all over the place i said ill doctor myself in a minute first i want you to finish this explanation you know ashers bite can be orgasmic he finished for me yeah i said ive experienced the mild version of it jason said so have you once in tennessee when asher was dying he rolled your mind if i remember right you didnt like it much it wasnt that i didnt like it jason it was that i liked it maybe too much so yeah it scared me jeanclaude said that asher always holds back unless he can keep the person whatever that means i nodded took a drink nodded again i think no i know that asher didnt hold back last night how do you know he asked ive got some of jeanclaudes memories im reacting like a woman that belle had asher seduce once acting how he asked slicing people up i said i was sorry he sat down on the edge of the bed one knee tucked up the other down so that he was pretty much flaunting himself at me generally i dont have trouble making eye contact with a man but it was sort of eye catching im just teasing anita he seemed totally unaware of his nudity like most of the shapeshifters i knew i handed him an edge of sheet please cover up a little he grinned why we slept for he glanced at the bedside clock four hours naked together why should i dress now i frowned at him and suddenly it was easy to have eye contact it usually is when i glare how are you acting like this other woman he asked echoes flashbacks to the pleasure that happened when asher took blood is that going to keep happening he asked i blushed again off and on fuck what he asked the woman im remembering was quiet in bed she didnt jump around a lot not according to asher so she could hide it better than i can he laughed out loud are you telling me that all this jumping around is normal for you i glared at him you should know youve seen me in bed once you helped bring me remember i was blushing so hard my head was beginning to hurt his smile faded it had taken me months to be comfortable around jason after that the ardeur was riding all of us he said we were all a little jumpier than usual i shook my head not looking at him tucking my knees and the sheet to my chest except for wanting to tear out your throat that was about normal for me he coughed laughed and finally said no way i kept my eyes firmly on the sheets fine make fun he took the bottle from me i need a drink i hugged my knees to my chest huddling in the sheet you are so not funny he slid to his knees beside the bed so id see his face im sorry really but he gave a small shrug you cant blame me you cannot tell me that you have these violent amazing orgasms then expect me not to tease you its me anita you know i cant really help it he looked so boyish so innocent it was all an act by the time id met jason hed been ridden hard and put up wet and his innocence had been long gone he handed the drink back to me forgive me okay maybe its just envy dont go there i said not of you he said but hell if ashers bite is that good why didnt i get the full treatment i tried to frown at him and only halfsucceeded you said it yourself youre not his pomme de sang youre only a loaner and youre jeanclaudes human servant not ashers so why do you rate the full orgasmic blowout he had a point a good point i shrugged i think the ardeur overrode things i dont know i guess ill have to ask them when they wake up why would asher do this to me had it been on purpose i knew only asher could do with the mere taking of blood what most men couldnt do with their whole bodies asher had done something to me that jeanclaude alone couldnt duplicate the memory of it tightened my body and i had just enough time to shove the bottle at jason before i threw myself back on the bed it wasnt as violent as the last time and jason made no move to try and touch me i guess hed had enough scratches when i was done panting on the bed with the sheet down around my stomach and my vision clearing jason asked from the far side of the bed is it safe now shut up i managed he laughed and bounced back on the bed he raised me up with one hand and offered the bottle with the other lean against the pillows drink this slowly im going to put some bandages on my arms antiseptic cream too i said im a werewolf anita i dont get infections oh fine then why bother with bandages at all i dont want to bleed all over my clothes and i cant let the police see me like this police why police that was who was on the phone when you woke up that is whos been calling for about the last hour lieutenant storr and detective zerbrowski have both called and have requested your presence the lieutenant made noises about coming to find you and drag you out of my bed how did he know i was in your bed he grinned at me in the door of the bathroom opening it wide so the light framed his body i dont know maybe he guessed jason you did not tease dolph please tell me you didnt he put a hand to his chest me tease someone sweet jesus you did id call him back asap if i were you id hate to have the swat team crash our little party we are not having a party i dont think your lieutenant friend will believe that if he finds us naked in the bedroom together he held his arms up especially if he sees this hes not going to see your arms or any other part of you just give me my clothes and ill get out of your hair and if you have another flashback while youre driving what then and let me just add that ive been donating blood to vampires a lot longer than you have i know how hard it can be when you lose as much as you lost you may feel fine but if you overdo it youll get dizzy again and nauseous that wouldnt be good at a crime scene would it dolph does not let civilians at his crime scenes ill sit in the jeep but i cant let you drive yourself around today call micah or nathaniel theyll come pick me up he shook his head nathaniel passed out at the club last night what micah thinks that feeding the ardeur at least once a day for three months has taken its toil on nathaniel is he alright he just needs a day off jeanclaude only takes blood from me every other day usually i switch off with micah and jeanclaude for the ardeur i said yeah but jeanclaude only needs to feed once a day you need to feed twice a day lets face it anita you need a larger stable of pomme de sangs what you volunteering an expression of delight crossed his face oh hell yes id love to be on the receiving end of one of those spine cracking orgasms jason i said and the one word was warning enough fine be that way but who else are you going to put in nathaniels place while he recovers i sighed damn it see you dont know do you i can feed on asher now yes but hes not going to wake up for hours and hours you need some more daywalking donors anita it doesnt have to be me but it has to be somebody think about it but today i am your escort because you cant go out alone not with the blood loss and whatever the hell asher did to you you could call micah but by the time he drove out here and the two of you drove out to wherever the police want to be i think your police friends would be having fits fine youve made your point have i its always so hard to tell with you sometimes i think ive won the argument then you get a second wind and beat me all to hell with it just go jason put some bandages on the scrapes scrapes hell if i were human youd be taking me to the emergency room remember anita you have some of the strength of both a vampire and a werewolf we can punch our finger through someones ribs are you really hurt i asked all joking aside i didnt want him hurt not permanently but itll heal almost human slow im sorry jason i remembered enough to say and thanks for taking care of me his grin faded and something close to a serious look spilled through his eyes then it was gone hidden behind another smile all in a days work maam he tipped an imaginary hat and started to shut the door id turn on the lamp before i close the door its damn dark without windows i reached over and switched on a small lamp beside the clock on top of the little refrigerator the glow seemed unnaturally bright your cell phone is on the floor on my side of the bed i dropped it when you started convulsing i was not convulsing i said oh sorry i dropped it when you had your raging overwhelming screaming orgasm was that better it sounded better didnt it go clean up i said sounding grumpy when i said it he was laughing as he closed the door i was left alone with the little lamp the big bed and no clothes in sight i was about to debate on whether to try and find some clothes before hunting up my phone when it rang again i scrambled across the bed jerking the sheets off so they wouldnt tangle me i half slid half fell to the floor and found my phone by sitting on it it was dolph and he wasnt happy while hed been waiting for me there had been a second call to a second crime scene he was pissed with jasons antics on the phone with both crime scenes and especially it seemed with me the first crime scene was in wildwood that new bastion of money and social climbing the hot addresses used to be ladue clayton creve coeur but theyve all become passé nope the hot new place to be is wildwood the fact that its in the middle of freaking nowhere doesnt seem to dissuade the nouveau riche or wannabe rich personally the only reason i lived in the middle of nowhere at a much less fashionable address was the fact that i didnt want to get my neighbors shot up by the time jason had driven through all the windy roads that led to the murder scene wed found out several things first my eyes were light sensitive so my sunglasses were my friends second my stomach didnt like the twisting roads we hadnt had to stop so i could throw up which was good since unless we pulled into someones drive there was no shoulder to the road it was bordered by woods hills tame wilderness where real wolves no longer roam and even the black bears have found deeper holes to hide in normally i love a drive through the country today all the bright greens meant was that when my vision swirled it did it in technicolor green like a frog smeared across my vision which actually made the nausea worse how can you endure this i asked if youd slept the day away like a normal pomme de sang or human servant you wouldnt be sick at all forgive me for having a day job also if asher had taken enough for just a feeding then you might be a bit sick he negotiated a turn but i think that whatever asher did to you along with taking blood made it worse he paused truthfully you shouldnt be this sick at all we crested the rise and the soft hills stretched out for miles shades of green with a hint of gold here and there at least im not nauseous anymore when i look at the trees thats good but i mean it anita after youd slept and then gotten up and around you should have been fine he took the next curve carefully a lot slower than hed taken the first one so what went wrong i asked he shrugged and slowed even further trying to see the address on a cluster of mailboxes dolph said the crime scene was on the main road you wont miss it jason how can you be sure trust me he flashed me another grin his own blue eyes hidden behind mirrored sunglasses i do trust you what went wrong i asked again what were you doing when dawn broke he asked speeding back up and taking the next curve a little faster than i would have liked the ardeur asher was feeding and i hesitated only for a second having sex with both of them at once he said voice mock serious i am so disappointed in you anita disappointed why that i wasnt invited you are so lucky youre driving right now he grinned but didnt turn away from the road this time why do you think i said it while i was driving he slowed i see what you meant about not missing it i turned my attention from jasons face to the road police cars marked and unmarked were everywhere two emergency vehicles were parked on the edge of the road which effectively blocked traffic if wed been planning to drive farther on wed have had to find another way around but lucky us we were stopping here jason pulled the jeep over driving into the grass in a vain attempt to leave some space for anyone else that might be coming behind us a uniformed officer started walking towards us before jason had turned off the engine i got my badge out of my suit jacket pocket i anita blake vampire executioner was technically a federal marshal all vampire hunters that were currently state licensed in the united states had been grandfathered in to federal status if they could qualify on a shooting range id qualified and now i was a fed they were still arguing in washington dc about whether theyd be able to give us anything more than the pittance that each state pays us per kill which is not enough so you could afford to do it as a day job but then luckily the vampires havent gotten so out of hand that any state needed a vampire hunter full time i wasnt getting any more money so why had i wanted the badge because it meant i could chase the vampires or other supernatural bad guys across state lines different law enforcement jurisdictions and not have to ask anyones permission i also wouldnt be up on murder charges if i killed a vamp on the wrong side of a state line where i wasnt licensed but for me more than most vampire hunters there was an extra benefit to having a badge of my very own i no longer had to rely on policemen friends to get me into crime scenes i didnt know the uniformed officer that was about to knock on our jeep window but it didnt matter he couldnt keep me out of the crime scene i was a federal marshali could stick my nose into any preternaturally related crime i wanted to a real federal marshal could have intruded into any investigation and technically my badge didnt specify that i was relegated to preternatural crime but i know my limitations i know monsters and monsterrelated crime a regular cop i am not what im good at im very good at but what i dont know shit about i dont know shit about take me away from the monsters and i wasnt sure how much use id be i was out of the jeep and flashing my badge before the uniform got to us he sized me up the way men will do from shoes to facein that order any man who starts at my feet and then goes up has lost pretty much any chance he has to impress me i read his name tag officer jenkins im anita blake lieutenant storr is expecting me storr isnt here he said arms crossed over his chest great he didnt recognize my nameso much for being a celebrityand he was going to play dont want the feds pissing in my pond jason had gotten out on his side of the jeep maybe i looked a little disreputable in my slightly wrinkled suit with a run in my hose that went from toe to thigh but jason didnt look like a fed or a cop he was dressed in blue jeans that had faded through enough washings to be comfortable a blue tshirt that almost matched his eyes still hidden behind the mirrored shades and white jogging shoes it had turned out to be one of those unusually warm fall days we get sometimes too warm for his leather jacket so he hadnt bothered with anything else the white gauze and tape on his forearms were very noticeable he leaned on the hood of the jeep smiling pleasantly and looking so not like a federal anything officer jenkinss eyes flicked to jason then back to me we didnt call the feds in standing there in my threeinch heels on the slightly uneven road was making me feel lightheaded again i did not have the patience or the strength to debate officer jenkins i am a federal marshal do you know what that means nope he said making the word longer than it was it means that i dont need your permission to enter this crime scene i dont need anybodys permission so it doesnt matter if the lieutenant is here or not i told you who alerted me to this crime out of courtesy but if you dont want to be courteous officer then we dont have to be i turned and looked at jason normally i would have left him at the car but i wasnt a hundred percent sure i could make it up the rest of the hill without falling over i genuinely didnt feel well enough to be here but here i was and i was going to see this crime scene i motioned jason to me he came around the jeep his smile fading around the edges maybe i looked as pale as i felt lets go hes not a fed jenkins said id had enough of jenkins if id been feeling better i would have bullied our way through but there were other ways to bully i waited until jason was there to steady me then i moved my hair to one side showing the white gauze and tape on my own neck i pulled on one side of the tape until it peeled down and i could flash the bite at jenkins it wasnt a neat puncture wound asher had gotten carried away because the edges of the wounds were torn shiiit jenkins said i let jason tape the wound back up while i talked to the other man i have had a hard night officer jenkins and i have the authority to go into any preternaturally related crime scene that i see fit to enter the tape was smoothed back into place and jason was standing very close to my left arm as if he knew how unsteady i was feeling jenkins didnt seem to notice it isnt a vampire attack jenkins said am i not speaking english here jenkins did i say it had anything to do with vampires no sir i mean no then either escort us to the crime scene officer or step aside and well find our own way flashing the vampire bite had thrown him but he still didnt want a fed messing with his crime probably his boss wouldnt like it but that wasnt my problem i had a federal badge in theory i had the right to the crime scene in actuality if the local police barred my way there wasnt much i could do i could go get a court order and force the issue but that would take time and i didnt have that kind of time dolph was already pissed at me i didnt want to keep him waiting that long jenkins finally stepped aside we started walking up the hill i had to take jasons arm about halfway up my goal in life for that moment was not to fall down throw up or faint while jenkins was still puzzling over whether hed done the right thing letting us get past him my badge on its little cord around my neck got us past most of the cops the few that questioned us recognized my name or had worked with me before always good to be known they questioned jasons presence i finally told them that id deputized him a big statie with shoulders wider than either of us was tall said ive heard it called a lot of things but deputy isnt one of em i turned on him slowly because i couldnt move fast and the very slowness of the turn helped the menace its hard to be menacing to someone when you barely reach their waist but i have had lots of practice jason must have been afraid of what id say because he said youre just jealous the big man shook his head in his smokey the bear hat i like my women bigger funny i said thats what your wife says it took him a minute to get it then he unfolded those beefy arms and took a step towards us why you trooper kennedy a voice said from behind us dont you have some speeders to go catch i turned to see zerbrowski walking towards us he was dressed in his usualsloppy as hell as if hed slept in the brown suit a yellow shirt with the collar on one side pointing up and a tie at halfmast already stained with something even though he probably hadnt had breakfast his wife katie was always neat as a pin id never figured out how she let him go out looking like that im on my own time here detective trooper kennedy said and this is my crime scene trooper i dont think we need you here she says that she deputized him shes a federal marshal kennedy she can do that the big man looked perplexed i didnt mean anything by the comment sir i know you didnt kennedy just as marshall blake here didnt mean anything by hers did you anita i dont know his wife so no just pulling your leg officer kennedy sorry about that kennedy frowned thinking harder than was good for him i think no offense taken and none meant maam he couldnt quite bring himself to call me officer or marshal which was fine with me the federal status was so new that i didnt always look up when someone called marshal i kept forgetting they meant me when the big trooper had wandered away to his car zerbrowski called over one of the other detectives on the regional preternatural investigation team affectionately know as rpit if you wanted to piss them off call them rip see if you can clear out some of the personnel we dont need you got it sarge and the man went to talk with all the nice policemen from all the many jurisdictions sarge i said i knew dolph made lieutenant finally i didnt hear your news he shrugged running a hand through his already messy curls katie would make him go in for a haircut soon when they moved dolph up he needed a second whip i got tapped they throw you a party yet he adjusted his wirerimmed glasses they didnt need adjusting yeah if id been a man id have let it go but i was a girl and girls poke at things more than men i was invited to dolphs party for making louie but not yours i like micah anita but dolph didnt expect you to bring micah i dont think he could take seeing him at my shindig too he just cant handle the fact that my main squeeze is a shapeshifter zerbrowski shrugged katie gave me strict orders to invite you and micah over for dinner the next time i saw you so here it is and when can you come over there are points where you stop pushing i didnt ask if katie had really told zerbrowski that she probably had but whatever he was trying to offer a social peace pipe and i was going to take it ill ask micah what our schedule looks like his eyes flicked to jason and he grinned the grin reminded me so much of jasons grin that it made me wonder what zerbrowski had been like in college when katie and he met unless youve changed guys again no i said jasons just a friend the friend speech jason clutched his heart with his free hand the other still wrapped around mine it cuts so deep yeah ive been trying to get into her pants for years she just wont come across tell me about it jason said both of you stop it right now i said they both laughed and the laughs were so similar that it was kind of unnerving i know you have the right to make him a deputy but i know what mr schulyer here is and where his primary residence is zerbrowski leaned in close enough to us that no one else would hear dolph would kill me if i let him into the crime scene you catch me if i pass out and he can stay out here pass out zerbrowski said youre joking right i wish i was i had both hands on jasons arm now fighting the urge to totter on my high heels dolph said that youd said you were sick did he know how sick he didnt seem to care just wanted me to get my ass out here zerbrowski frowned if hed known you were this shaky he wouldnt have insisted pretty to think so i said i could feel the blood draining from my face i needed to sit down soon just for a few minutes i would ask if its the flu but i see the bandage on your neck what did it vampire i said you want to report a crime its been taken care of you kill his ass i looked at him through the dark lenses of the glasses i really need to sit down for a few minutes zerbrowski and you know i wouldnt ask if i didnt need it he offered me his arm ill escort you through but schulyer there cant come he looked at jason sorry man jason shrugged its okay im really good at entertaining myself behave yourself i said he grinned dont i always i would have stayed there and made sure he promised me how good he would be but i had only about enough energy to walk into the house and sit down before my legs gave id leave the police officers and emergency crews to jasons mercy he wouldnt do anything bad just irritating i stumbled on the steps leading up to the small front porch if zerbrowski hadnt caught me id have fallen jesus anita you should be in bed thats what i told dolph he eased me through the door and found me a small straightbacked chair in the hallway ill tell dolph how sick you are and let the kid take you home no i said though i did lay my forehead on my knees while the world steadied around me jesus anita youre as stubborn as he is dolph wont take no for an answer so you drag your ass out of a sickbed to come down here i give you an out where ill take the heat from dolph but nooo youre going to show dolph that youre just as stubborn and bullheaded as he is you planning to faint in his arms thatll really show him shut up zerbrowski fine you sit there for a few minutes ill come back and check on you and ill escort you through the crime scene but youre being stupid i spoke with my face still in my lap if dolph were sick hed still be here that doesnt prove youre right anita that just proves youre both stupid with that he walked away farther into the house it was good that he left because for the life of me i couldnt have argued with him when zerbrowski first led me into the room i thought theres a man levitating against that wall he did look like he was floating i knew that wasnt true but for just a moment my eyes my mind tried to make that what i saw then i saw the dark lines where blood had dried on the body it looked as if hed been shot a lot and bled but bullets wouldnt have kept him pinned to the wall strangely i wasnt faint or nauseous or anything i felt light and distant and more solid than id felt in hours i kept walking towards the man on the wall zerbrowskis hand slipped away from mine and i was steady on my high heels in the soft carpet i had to be almost underneath the body before my eyes could make sense of it and even then i was going to have to ask someone who was more tooloriented if i was right it looked like someone had taken a nail gun one of those industrial size nail guns and nailed the man to the wall his shoulders were about eight feet off the ground so either theyd used a ladder or theyd been close to seven feet tall the dark spots on the body were at both palms both wrists forearms just above the elbows shoulders collarbones lower legs just below the knees just above the ankles then through each foot the legs were apart not pierced together they hadnt tried to imitate the crucifixion if you went to this much trouble it was almost odd to not echo that longago drama the very fact that they hadnt tried seemed strange to me the mans head slumped forward his neck showed pale and whole there was a dark patch of blood on his nearly white hair just behind one ear if the nails were as big as i thought they were if that blood had been caused by a nail the tip should have protruded from the face but it didnt i stood on tiptoe i wanted to see the face the white hair and the face slack with death said he was older than the rest of him looked the body was well cared forexercise probably weights runningonly the face and white hair said he was probably over fifty all that work to maintain health and wellbeing and some nutcase comes along and nails you to a wall it seemed so unfair i leaned forward too far and had to put my fingertips out to catch myself my fingers touched dried blood on the wall only then did i realize id forgotten my surgical gloves fuck zerbrowski was there with a hand on my elbow to steady me whether i needed it or not how could you let me come in here without gloves on i didnt expect you to touch the evidence he said he fished a bottle of hand sanitizer out of one of his pockets katie makes me carry it i let him pour some into my hands and i scrubbed them it wasnt that i was really worried about catching anything from that one small touch i did it more out of habit you didnt take pieces of the crime scene home if you didnt have to the gel evaporated against my skin making my hands feel wet though i knew they werent i looked around at the crime scene taking in what else was there colored chalk had been used on the offwhite walls there were pentagrams of varying sizes on either side of the body pink blue red green almost decorative any fool thats trying to fake a ritual murder knows enough to use a few pentagrams but there were also nordic runes drawn among the candycolored pentagrams not every nutcase knows that nordic runes can be used in ritual magic id had one semester of comparative religion with a professor who had really liked the norse it had left me with a better knowledge of runes than most christians had it had been years but i still recognized enough to be confused this makes no sense i said what zerbrowski asked i pointed at the wall while i spoke its been awhile since i studied runes in college but the perps used all the runes in a pretty standard order if youre really doing ritual you have a specific purpose you dont use all the norse runes because some of them are contradictory i mean you dont want to use a rune for chaos and a rune for order i cant think of a true ritual where you would use them all even if you were doing a working where you wanted to invoke polarity healing harming chaos order god goddess you still wouldnt some of them arent easily made to fit any true polarityopposite sort of thing and theyre also in a pretty standard textbook order i backed up taking him with me because he was still holding on to my elbow i pointed to the left side of the body as we looked at it it starts with fehu here and descends straight through ending with dagaz at the other side someone just copied this zerbrowski i know this sounds funky but do you feel any magic he asked i thought about that do you mean was this a spell he nodded yeah can you feel a spell no theres been nothing of power in this room how can you be so sure he asked magic power of any kind of a metaphysical nature leaves a residue behind sometimes its just a tingling at the back of your neck goosebumps on your skin but sometimes its like a slap in the face or even a wall that you run into but this room is dead zerbrowski im not psychically gifted enough to pick up emotions from what happened here and im glad but if this had been some big spell thered been something left of it and the room is just a crime scene nothing else so if no spell why all the symbols he asked i havent the faintest idea from the looks of things he was shot behind the ear and nailed to the wall the body isnt arranged to imitate any mystical or religious symbolism that im familiar with then they threw some pentagrams around and copied runes out of a book which book there are a lot of books on the runes everything from college textbooks to the occult to new age youd probably have to go to a college store or one of the new age shops or you could probably special order it through any bookstore so this isnt a ritual murder he said there may be ritual to it from the killers point of view but was it done with magical purpose no he let out a deep breath good thats what reynolds told dolph detective tammy reynolds your one and only witch on staff i asked he nodded why didnt dolph believe her he said he wanted confirmation i shook my head and it didnt make me dizzy to do it great he doesnt trust her does he zerbrowski shrugged dolphs just careful bullfuckingshit zerbrowski he doesnt trust her because shes a witch shes a christian witch for heavens sake a follower of the way you cant get more mainstream in your occult expert than a christian witch hey dont get mad at me i didnt drag you out of bed to doublecheck reynoldss work and would he have dragged her down here to check my work if id been first on the scene youd have to ask dolph about that maybe i will i said zerbrowski went a little pale anita please dont go after dolph angry he is in a bad bad mood why he shrugged again dolph doesnt confide in me is he just in a bad mood today or for the last few days what the last few days have been worse but two murders in one night have sort of given him a reason to be grumpy and hes taking full advantage of it great just great i said my anger helped me stomp off towards the bank of windows that took up most of the other wall i stood there and stared off at the amazing view nothing but hills trees it did look as if the house sat in the middle of some vast wilderness zerbrowski came to stand beside me nice view huh whoever did this had to have scouted the house i motioned at the windows they had to know for sure that there was no neighbor out there that could see what they were doing shooting him you might take your chances but putting him up on the wall and all the symbols no they had to be sure they wouldnt be seen thats pretty organized for a wacko zerbrowski said not if its really someone wanting you to think theyre a wacko what do you mean dont tell me that you and dolph havent thought of that what that its someone near and dear to the dead man someone who stands to inherit all this i looked around at the living room which was as large as the entire downstairs of my house i was too sick to really notice when i came in but if the rest of the house is as impressive as this then theres money to be had you havent seen the pool yet have ya pool indoors with a jacuzzi big enough for twelve i sighed like i said money follow the money find out who stands to gain the ritual is only window dressing a smoke screen that the murderers hope will throw you off he stood staring off at the beautiful view hands behind his back sort of rocking on his heels youre right thats exactly what dolph thought once reynolds said there was no magic to it im not going over to the other scene just to check her work again am i because if thats the case im headed home i may not always like detective tammy but shes pretty good at what she does you just dont like that shes dating larry kirkland your animator in training no i dont like that she and larry are dating shes his first serious girlfriend so forgive me but i felt protective funny i dont feel protective of reynolds at all thats because youre weird zerbrowski no he said its because i see the way reynolds and kirkland look at each other they are dead gone anita in love i sighed maybe if you havent noticed its because you didnt want to see it maybe ive been busy for once zerbrowski stayed quiet i looked at him you never answered my first question am i going to the next murder scene to check tammys work he stopped rocking on his heels and stood quiet face serious i dont know probably some im going home then he touched my arm go to the second scene anita please dont give dolph any more reason to be more pissy that is not my problem zerbrowski dolph is making his own life hard on this one i know but the couple officers that have been at both scenes say the second one is a bad one more up your alley than reynoldss up my alley how violent real violent dolph doesnt want to know if its magic he wants to know if something that wasnt human did it dolphs a fanatic about not giving details away to his people before theyve seen a crime scene zerbrowski what youve just told me would piss him off mightily i was afraid you wouldnt go if i didnt add a little why do you care if dolph and i are feuding were here to solve crimes anita not fight each other i dont know whats eating dolph but one of you has to be the grownup he smiled yeah i know things have come to a sorry state when youre the one but there it is i shook my head and slapped his arm you are such a pain in the ass zerbrowski its good to be appreciated he said the anger was fading and with it the spurt of energy i leaned my head against his shoulder get me outside before i start feeling bad again ill go see the second crime scene he put his arm around my shoulders and gave me half a hug thats my little federal marshal i raised my head dont push it zerbrowski cant help myself sorry i sighed youre right you cant help yourself forget i said anything keep saying witty irritating things as you walk me back to jason he started me across the room arm still across my shoulders how did you end up with a werewolf stripper as your driver for the day just lucky i guess the second scene was in chesterfield which had been a hot address for the upandcomers before most of the money moved even farther out to wildwood and beyond the neighborhood that jason drove us through was a sharp contrast to the big isolated houses wed just seen this was middleclass middle america backbone of the nation kind of neighborhood there are thousands of subdivisions exactly like it except in this one not all the houses were identical they were still too close together and had a sameness about them as if a hive mind had designed them all but some were twostory some only one some brick some not only the garage seemed to be the same on all of them as if the architect wasnt willing to compromise on that one feature there were medium sized trees in the yards which meant the area was over ten years old it takes time to grow trees i saw the giant antenna of the news van before i saw the police cars shit what jason asked the reporters are already here he glanced up how do you know have you never seen a news van with one of those big antennas i guess not lucky you i said probably because of the news van the police had blocked the street when someone had time theyd probably bring up those officiallooking sawhorses right now they had a police cruiser a uniformed officer leaning against it and yellow donotcross tape strung from mailbox to mailbox across the entire street there were two local news vans and a handful of print media you can always tell print because they have the still cameras and no microphones though they will shove tape recorders in your face we had to park about half a block away because of them when the engine shut off jason asked how did they hear about it so quickly one of the neighbors called it in or one of the news vans was close for something else once something hits the police scanners the reporters know about it why werent there reporters at the first scene the first one was more isolated harder to get to and still make your deadline or there could be a local celebrity involved here or its just better copy better copy he asked more sensational in my own head i wondered how you could get much more sensational than having someone nailed to their living room wall but of course those kinds of details werent released to the media not if it could be kept under wraps i undid my seat belt and put a hand on the door handle getting through the press is going to be the first hurdle here im something of a local celebrity now myself whether i like it or not the master of the citys lady love jason said smiling i dont think anyones been that polite i said but yeah though today theyll be more interested in the murder theyll be asking me questions about that not jeanclaude you seem to be feeling some better jason said i am not sure why maybe whatever caused the bad reaction is fading i nodded maybe are we going to get out of the car or are we going to watch from here i sighed getting out getting out jason opened his door and was around to my side before i could get more than one foot on the ground today i let him help me i was feeling better but i still wasnt at my best id hate to refuse help and then fall flat on my face i was really trying to tone down the machismo today mine not jasons i put my hand on jasons arm and we started down the sidewalk towards the crowd there were lots of people and most of them werent reporters the first murder scene had been isolated no neighbors close enough to walk out their doors and see the show but this neighborhood was thick with houses so we had a crowd i had my badge around my neck on its little cord i hadnt taken it off from the last scene now that i was feeling better it occurred to me that jasons arm was in the way if i had to go for the gun under my left arm i didnt want him on my right side because that was my gun hand but even on my left he was in the way a little at least i was feeling better if i could be worrying this much over my gun good to know feeling bad sucks and nausea is one of the great evils of the universe i think because i had jason on my arm it took the reporters longer to realize who i was and that we werent just part of the growing crowd of gawkers we were actually working our way through the crowd almost to the yellow tape before one of the reporters spotted me the tape recorder was shoved at me ms blake why are you here was the murdered woman a vampire victim fuck if i just said no comment theyd be printing possible vampire kill all over this one im called in on a lot of preternaturally related crime mr miller isnt it not just vampires he was happy id remembered his name most people love to have you remember their names so it wasnt a vampire kill shit i havent been up to the crime scene yet mr miller i dont know any more than you do the reporters closed like a fist around me there was a big shoulder cam on us now wed make the noon news if nothing more exciting happened the questions came from all directions is it a vampire kill what kind of monster is it do you think theyll be more victims one woman got in so close that only a death grip on jasons hand kept us from being separated anita is this your new boyfriend have you dumped jeanclaude that a reporter would ask that question with a fresh body only yards away said just how bad the media interest in jeanclaudes personal life had gotten once the question was raised several more asked similar questions i did not understand why my personal life was more interesting or even as interesting as a murder it made no sense to me if i said jason was a friend theyd misconstrue it if i said he was a bodyguard theyd plaster the fact that i needed a bodyguard all over the papers i finally stopped trying to answer questions and held my badge up so the uniformed officer could see it he raised the tape to let us inside and then had to push back the press of bodies that tried to follow us through we walked towards the house to a hail of questions that i ignored god knew what theyd do with the few things id said it could be anything from the executioner says vampire attack to the executioner says not a vampire to my love life id stopped reading the papers or watching the news if i thought i might be on first i hate to watch myself on a moving camera second it always pissed me off i was not free to discuss an ongoing police investigation no one was so the press were left to speculate on what few facts they had and if jeanclaude and our love life was the topic of choice i never wanted to see or read the coverage for some reason being caught in the media feeding frenzy had made me feel shaky again not as bad as earlier but not as good as id felt when i first got out of the jeep great just great there were fewer cops here and most of them were faces i recognized members of rpit no one questioned my right to be at the scene or jasons presence they trusted me the uniform on the door looked pale his dark eyes flashing too much white lieutenant storr is expecting you ms blake i didnt correct the title to marshal marshal blake made me feel like i should have been gueststarring on gunsmoke the uniform opened the door for us because he was wearing rubber gloves id left my crime scene kit at home because when i raised a zombie for the higherend clients bert liked me to not be covered in a baggy overall he said it didnt look professional once hed agreed to reimburse me for all dry cleaning incurred from this little rule id agreed i told jason dont touch anything until i get us some gloves gloves surgical gloves that way if they find a latent print they wont get all excited and then find out it was yours or mine we were standing in a narrow entryway with stairs leading straight up from the door a living room to the left and an opening to the right that led into what looked like a dining room there was an opening beyond that where i caught a glimpse of countertop and sink i couldnt see the color scheme clearly because i was still wearing sunglasses i debated whether taking them off would make the headache come back i slipped them off slowly i was left blinking painfully but after a few seconds it was okay if i could stay out of direct sunlight id probably be all right it was detective merlioni who walked into the living room and saw us first blake thought youd chickened out i looked up at the tall man with his curling gray hair cut short the neck of his white longsleeved shirt was unbuttoned his tie tugged down crooked as if hed loosened everything without caring what it looked like merlioni hated ties but he usually tried to be neater than this it must be a bad one i said he frowned at me what makes you say that youve tugged your tie all crooked like you needed air and you havent called me girlie or chickie yet he grinned flashing white teeth its early days chickie i shook my head do you have some gloves we can borrow i wasnt expecting to do a crime scene today he glanced at jason then as if seeing him for the first time but i knew hed seen him cops see almost everything around a crime scene whos this my driver for the day he raised eyebrows at that driver woowoo coming up in the world i frowned at him dolph knew i was too shaky to drive so he gave me permission to bring a driver with me if there werent enough press outside to cover an entire city block id have had him leave me at the door but i dont want him going back out in that theyll never believe hes not involved in the investigation merlioni stepped to the big picture window in the living room and lifted the edge of the drape enough to peek out they are damned persistent today howd they get here so quick neighbor called them probably everyone wants to be on fucking television these days he turned back to us whats your drivers name jason schulyer he shook his head name doesnt mean anything to me i dont know who you are either jason said with a smile i frowned you know merlioni i dont know your first name i cant introduce you he flashed those pearly whites at me rob rob merlioni you dont look like a rob my mama doesnt think so either shes always after meroberto i give you such a nice name you should use it roberto merlioni i like it i introduced them more formally than i think id ever introduced anyone to anyone at a crime scene merlioni was stalling he didnt want to go back inside theres a box of gloves in the kitchen on the counter help yourself im going outside for a smoke i didnt know you smoked i said i just started he looked at me and his eyes were haunted ive seen worse blake hell weve waded through worse together you and me but im tired today maybe im gettin old not you merlioni never you he smiled but not like he meant it ill be back in a few then the smile widened dont let dolph know i didnt make your driver wait outside mums the word i said he went out closing the door softly behind him the house was very quiet only the rushing hush of the air conditioning it was too quiet for a fresh murder scene and too still there should have been people all over the place instead we stood in the small entryway in a well of silence so thick you could almost hear the blood in your own ears thrumming filling the silence with something anything the hair at the back of my neck stood at attention and i turned to jason he was standing there in his baby blue tshirt his peaceful face behind the mirrored shades but the energy trickled off of him raised the skin along my arms in a nervous creep he looked so harmless pleasant but if you had the ability to sense what he was he was suddenly not harmless or pleasant whats with you i whispered dont you smell it his voice was a hoarse whisper smell what meat blood shit no i said but of course his creeping energy along my skin raised my own beast like a ghost in my gut that phantom shape stretched inside me like some great cat waking from a long nap and i did smell it not just blood jason was right meat blood smells sort of sweet and metallic like old pennies or nickels but a lot of blood smells like hamburger you know its going to be bad really bad when a human being is reduced to the smell of so much ground meat my head lifted and i sniffed the air drew in a great breath of air and tested it my foot was on the bottom step of the stairs before i came to myself its upstairs i whispered it yes jason said and there was the thinnest edge of growl to his voice if someone didnt know what they were listening to theyd have thought his voice was just deeper than normal but i knew what i was hearing whats happening i asked and i was still whispering i think because i didnt want to be overheard maybe that was why jason was whispering or maybe not i didnt ask if he was fighting the urge to run upstairs and roll around in the murder scene i did not want to know i hugged my arms trying to rub away the goosebumps lets go get those gloves i said he looked at me and even through the glasses i could feel him struggling to remember what i was saying or rather what the words meant dont go all preverbal on me jason i need you here with me he took a deep breath that seemed to come from the soles of his feet and slide out the top of his head his shoulders hunched then straightened like he was trying to shake something off im okay you sure i asked i can do it if you can i frowned at that am i going to have more trouble i dont have to go up into that room you do i sighed i am so tired of this shit which shit he asked all of it he smiled come on marshal lets go get those gloves i shook my head but i led the way through the dining room towards the kitchen i could see the box of gloves sitting beside an open nearly full trash bag thered been a lot of personnel through here to fill up one of those large bags so where was everyone and where was dolph dolph found us in the kitchen while i was helping jason with the gloves theres an art to putting them on and it was jasons first time so he was like a small child with his first set of gloves too few fingers and too many holes dolph came in through the dining room the same way wed come though he almost filled the doorway whereas jason and i had walked through together with plenty of room to spare dolph is built like a prowrestler wide and hes six eight im sort of used to him by now but jason did what most people do he looked up and up other than that he behaved himself which for jason was a minor miracle whats he doing here dolph asked you said if i wasnt well enough to drive i could bring a civvie driver jasons my driver he shook his head his dark hair so freshly cut that his ears looked pale and stranded dont you have any human friends left he asked i concentrated on helping jason into the gloves and counted to ten yeah but most of them are cops and they dont like playing chauffer he doesnt need gloves anita because he is not staying we had to park too far back for me to walk without someone to catch me if i needed it i cant send him back through that pack of reporters yeah you can dolph said i finally got the last finger in place jason stood there flexing his hands inside the gloves how come it feels wet and powdery all at the same time i dont know but it always does i said he is out of here anita do you hear me if he sits on the front stoop theyre going to have pictures of him what if someone recognizes him do you really want the headlines to read werewolves attack suburbia i slipped into my own pair of gloves with practiced ease gosh jason said that was nifty you made that look easy anita it was almost a yell we both looked up at dolph you dont have to shout dolph i can hear you just fine then why is he still standing here i cant send him back to the car he cant sit out front where would you like him to be while i check out the crime scene he balled his big hands into even bigger fists iwanthimoutofhere every word was squeezed out through gritted teeth i dont care where he fucking goes i ignored the anger because it didnt get me anywhere to pay attention to it he was in a bad mood it was a bad scene and dolph wasnt too fond of the monsters lately merlioni came into the kitchen he stopped in the doorway between kitchen and dining room as if hed picked up on the tension whats going on dolph pointed a finger at jason he is out of here merlioni glanced at me you do not fucking look at her you look at me the anger was hot in his voice he wasnt yelling but he didnt really need to merlioni walked around dolph carefully and reached out to take jasons arm i stopped him with one gloved hand on his hand merlioni glanced back at dolph then moved a little farther down the kitchen out of the line of fire i think is there a backyard i asked why dolph asked his voice gone low and growling not with the edge of any beast but with anger merlioni can take him out back hell be out of the house and still safe from the reporters no dolph said hes out of here gone completely gone my headache was coming back a flutter of pain behind one eye but it had the promise of great things to come dolph i do not feel well enough for this shit what shit your shit with anyone not lilyhuman i said and i sounded tired not angry get out i looked up at him what did you say get out take your pet werewolf and go home you bastard he gave me that look that had been making grown policemen cringe for years i was too tired and too disgusted with it all to flinch i told you i was too sick to drive when you woke me up you agreed i could bring a driver even a civilian you didnt say he had to be human now after dragging my ass down here youre going to send me home without having seen the crime scene yes dolph said that one word almost choking in its brevity no i said youre not this is my murder anita and i say who stays and who goes i was finally beginning to get angry you can only cut even your friends so much slack i stepped in front of jason closer to dolph im not here on your sufferance dolph im a federal marshal now and i have the right to investigate any preternatural crime that i see fit are you refusing my direct order his voice was very quiet now not heatedemptyand that should have scared me more but i wasnt scared of dolph i never had been if i think your direct orders are jeopardizing this investigation then yes i am he took one step towards me he loomed over me but i was used to that a lot of people loomed over me never question my professionalism again anita never when you act like a professional i wont his hands were clenching and unclenching at his sides you want to see why i dont want him at this scene you want to see it yeah i said i want to see it he grabbed me by the upper arm i dont know if dolph had ever touched me before it caught me off guard and it wasnt until hed halfmarched halfdragged me across the kitchen to the dining room door that i unfroze i looked behind me and shook my head at jason he probably didnt like it but he settled back against the cabinets i caught a glimpse of merlionis shocked face before we were into the dining room he dragged me to the stairs and when i stumbled he didnt give me time to get to my feet but literally dragged me up the stairs the door opened behind us and i heard a man say lieutenant i thought i recognized the voice but i wasnt sure and there wasnt time to look i was too busy trying not to get rug burns from the stairs i couldnt get my feet under me long enough to stand in the heels the headache burst fullblown behind my eye and the world was a trembling thing i found my voice dolph dolph damn it he opened a door and jerked me to my feet i staggered while the world ran in streamers of dark color he held me with one of his big hands on each of my arms only his grip kept me on my feet my vision cleared in pieces as if the scene were some sort of video puzzle there was a bed against the far wall i glimpsed white pillows against a lavender wall then a womans head and some of her shoulders it didnt look real as if someone had propped a fake head against the pillows from about collar bones down there was only a red ruin i dont mean a body i mean it was as if the bed had been dipped in dark fluid the blood wasnt red it was black a trick of the light or the fact that it wasnt just blood the smell hit me thenmeat everything smelled like hamburger i saw the pile of bedclothes black and red and sodden soaked in gore gore not just blood gore i looked back at the womans head i didnt want to but i couldnt help it i looked and i finally could see it was all that was left of her all that was left of an adult woman it was as if shed exploded with her head on the pillows and her body everywhere i felt the scream building in my throat and knew i couldnt do it i had to be stronger than this better than this i swallowed the scream and my stomach tried to come up my throat i swallowed that too and tried to think what do you think dolph said and he pushed me trapped between his big hands towards the bed pretty enough for you because one of your friends did this he pressed me too close to the bed and my legs squeezed against the goresoaked bed clothes the blood was cool to the touch and it helped keep my beast from curling up my body what good was blood if it wasnt hot and fresh dolph stop this i said and my voice didnt sound like me lieutenant a voice came from the open door dolph turned with me still gripped between his hands detective clive perry stood in the doorway he was a slender african american man dressed conservatively neatly but well dressed he was one of the most softspoken men id ever met and the most softspoken policeman what is it perry perry took a deep breath that moved his shoulders and chest up and down lieutenant i think ms blake has seen enough of the crime scene for now dolph gave me a little shake that sent my head rattling and my stomach churning not yet she hasnt he jerked me around to face back into the room he dragged me towards the headboard which was painted a lavender so close to the walls color i hadnt seen it he pushed me forward until my face was inches from it there was a fresh claw mark like a pale scar in the wood and paint what do you think did that anita he jerked me around until he was holding me facing him his big hands still wrapped around my upper arms let go dolph my voice still didnt sound like me no one else could have done this to me id have fought back by now or been scared or pissed i still wasnt any of those things what do you think did that and he gave me a little shake it made my head rattle my vision stream lieutenant storr i must insist that you let ms blake go detective perry was behind him to one side so i could see his face dolph turned on him and i think only the fact that his hands were already full kept him from grabbing perry she knows she knows what did this because she knows every fucking monster in town let her go lieutenant please i closed my eyes which helped the dizziness his hands on my arms let me know where his body was i rammed the pointed heel of my shoe into his instep he flinched his hands loosened i opened my eyes and did what id been trained to do i brought my arms up between his and swept outward downward it broke his hold on me and i drew my right arm back and hit him a short uppercut into his gut if hed been shorter id have tried for the solar plexus but the angle was bad so i hit what i could get the air went out of him in a grunt and he bent double hands over his stomach i still havent quite come to terms with being more than human strong i had a second where i hoped i hadnt hurt him more than i meant to then i stepped back away from him the world was trembling like i was looking at everything through wavy glass i kept backing up and my heels hit something slick and thicker than just blood and down i went i landed hard on my ass and blood spattered upwards it soaked through my skirt and i struggled to my knees to keep it from soaking into my panties the blood was cool to the touch and then my knee smeared in something that wasnt blood i screamed and scrambled to my feet if perry hadnt caught me id have fallen again but he was moving too slow for the door i didnt want to throw up in here i pushed away from him and halfstaggered halfran through the doorway when i hit the hallway i fell to all fours and threw up on the pale carpet my head roared with pain and my vision exploded with starbursts of white white light i crawled towards the head of the stairs not sure what i planned to do the floor came up to smack into my body and there was nothing but a soft gray nothingness then the world was black and my head didnt hurt at all the tile felt so good against my cheek so cool someone was moving around i thought about opening my eyes but it seemed like too much effort someone put a cool cloth against my neck it made me shiver and i opened my eyes my vision took a second to focus then i saw the knee beside my face was wearing hose and a skirt i knew it wasnt one of the men unless they had hobbies i didnt know about anita its me tammy how you feeling i rolled my eyes but some of my own hair was in the way and i couldnt see up that far i tried to say help me sit up but it didnt come out i tried again and she had to lean close to hear me she pushed a piece of her straight brown hair behind her ear as if that would help her hear better help me i swallowed sit up she got an arm under my shoulders and lifted detective tammy reynolds was five ten and she worked out at least enough to keep the otherread malecops from giving her grief she didnt have much trouble getting me up my back against the bathtub staying there was my job and that was a little more trouble i propped myself on one arm and leaned against the tub she picked the rag up from the edge of the sink where shed laid it and put it against my forehead the rag was cold and i jerked away from her i felt cold that was a new symptom i thought of something have you been i coughed to clear my throat putting cool rags on me yes it helps me when im sick cold rags dont seem to be helping me i didnt tell her that it was probably one of the worst things she could have done for me ever since i had inherited richards beast or whoevers beast cold didnt seem to help me when i was sick i healed like a lycanthrope now and that meant that my temperature ran hot when i was sick like my body was cooking itself a wellmeaning doctor had almost killed me with ice baths for what they thought was a dangerously high fever i started to shiver she got up rinsing the washrag out and spreading it out to dry on the edge of the sink i threw up in the yard she said she put her hands on the sink head bowed i hugged myself trying to stop the shivering but it didnt really help i was cold i hadnt been cold earlier today was a new symptom good or bad its a bad scene i said im sure you werent the only cop who lost their breakfast tammy looked at me through a trailing edge of her hair she had to keep her hair above her collar just like the male policemen but she kept it as long as she could maybe but im the only one who passed out except for me i said yeah you and me the only women at the scene she sounded so tired tammy and i werent actually friends she was a follower of the way christianitys version of witches most of the followers of the way were zealots more christian than the rightwingers as if they had to prove they really were worthy of salvation tammy had mellowed since shed been dating larry kirkland my fellow animator but this was the first time id realized how much of that bright and shiny exterior had been worn away police work will eat you up and spit you out as women we needed to be tougher just to be accepted today hadnt helped either of us its not your fault i said the shivering was beginning to get a little worse no its my damn doctors fault i looked up at her excuse me he gives me a prescription for birth control pills then prescribes antibiotics and doesnt warn me that while im taking the antibiotic the pill wont work my eyes went wide im sorry are you saying that im pregnant yes i know the surprise showed on my face i couldnt help it does larry know she nodded yes what i tried to think of something good to say and gave up what are you going to do get married damn it something must have showed on my face because she knelt by me i love larry but i didnt plan on marrying now and i certainly didnt plan on having a baby do you know how hard it is to get ahead in this job as a woman of course you do sorry no i said its not the same for me police work isnt my entire career the shivering had started up again no amount of astonishment could keep me warm she took her own jacket off showing her gun in its front holster she wrapped the jacket around me i didnt argue but clutched it closed with my hands is the shivering from the pregnancy she asked someone said you said you were sick are you it took me a second or two blinking at her sort of stupidly to understand what shed said did you just say pregnancy she made a face at me anita please i havent told anyone either but theyre going to guess i threw up at the murder scene ive never done that i didnt pass out cold like you did but i came close perry had to help me out into the yard so i could be sick it wont take them long to figure it out this is not the first scene ive thrown up at not even the fourth i said i havent done it in a while but ive certainly done it before surely theyve told you the story about me throwing up on the body zerbrowski loves that one sure but i thought he was exaggerating you know how zerbrowski is he wasnt exaggerating you can lie to me if you want to but unless youre planning to abort theyll all figure it out sooner or later i am not pregnant i said though i had a little trouble saying it because i was shivering so badly it was hard to talk im just sick youre freezing anita you dont have a fever how could i explain to her that i was having a bad reaction to a vampire bite and the fact that i shared richards beast odd metaphysics werent easy to explain pregnancy was nice and simple compared to that she grabbed my arms a lot like dolph had i am three months pregnant how far along are you please tell me tell me i havent been a fool tell me i havent ruined my life by not reading the fine print on a bottle of medicine i was shivering so hard it was hard to talk but i managed to get out iamnot pregnant she stood and turned her back on me damn you for not sharing i tried to say something i wasnt even sure what but she left leaving the door open behind her i wasnt sure being left alone was a good thing the shivering was getting worse like i was freezing to death from the inside larry kirkland was off being trained to be a federal marshal he didnt have four years as a vamp executioner yet so he couldnt get grandfathered in i wondered if the pregnancy was making it harder for him to be away from tammy or easier damn it anyway perry brought jason up to me he touched me god youre cold he picked me up in his arms like i weighed nothing im taking her home well give you an escort through the press perry said jason didnt argue he carried me down the stairs we waited for a few minutes while perry rounded up enough warm bodies to act as a sort of living gauntlet to try and keep the press at bay the door opened the sunlight hit my eyes and the headache roared to life i buried my face against jasons chest jason seemed to know what was wrong because he raised an edge of tammys jacket across my eyes are you ready perrys voice lets do it jason said normally id have felt humiliated to be carried out of a murder scene like a wilting flower but i was working too hard on keeping the shivering under control it took all my concentration not to let my body shake itself apart what the hell was wrong with me we were outside and moving at a good pace i could judge how close we were to the press by how loud the yelling was getting whats wrong with ms blake what happened to her who are you where are you taking her there were more questions lots more they all melded into a noise like the ocean against the shore the crowd surged around us there was a moment when i felt them closing like a fist around us but merlionis voice rose to a shout back up back up now or well clear this area jason got me inside the jeep leaning his shoulder into me so he could fasten the seat belt the jacket was across my face now and strangely it felt claustrophobic close your eyes he said i was already doing what hed asked but i didnt say anything the jacket moved away and the sun was bright against my closed eyelids i felt the sunglasses slip over my eyes and i opened them cautiously better there was a line of detectives and uniforms in front of the jeep keeping the pack of reporters back so we could make our getaway every camera they had was pointed our way god knew what the captions would read once they were done with it jason gunned the engine and backed up with a screech of tires he was a ways down the street before i could chatter out youll get a ticket ive called micah hes waiting you and nathaniel can share the bathtub i managed to get out what i dont know exactly whats wrong anita but youre acting like a shapeshifter thats been badly hurt like your bodys trying to heal some deep wound you need heat and the touch of your group i teeth chattering so hard i couldnt finish havent i stopped trying for a sentence and settled for not hurt i know that youre not hurt that badly but even if it was the vampire bite youd be warm to the touch hot cooking to heal yourself you shouldnt feel cold my ears started ringing it sounded like someone was hitting a chime over and over the ringing drowned out jasons voice the sound of the engine and finally everything i passed out for the second time in less than two hours this was not turning out to be one of my better days i was floating in water warm warm water arms held me in place a mans body brushed against mine in the water i opened my eyes to the flickering light of candles was i back at the circus of the damned two things happened to let me know exactly where i was pale tile gleamed on the edge of the bathtub and the arms around my shoulders tightened drew me closer the moment the back of my body settled firmly against the front of his i knew it was micah i knew the curve of his shoulder the way my body seemed to slide into every line and hollow of his body his tanned arms were delicate for a mans but as he snuggled me against him muscles moved under his skin i knew how much strength there was in his slender body he was like me a lot more than met the eye how are you feeling he asked voice so close to my ear that a whisper seemed loud my voice came distant and hollow the way id been feeling all day better at least youre warmer he said jason said you were sick dizzy has that passed i thought about it trying to feel my body and not just the comforting warmth and closeness yeah i do feel better what the hell was wrong with me he turned me in his arms so that he held me across him and we could look at each other he smiled down at me the tan that hed come with had started to fade a little but he was still dark and that darkness framed his most startling feature his eyes were kittycat eyes id originally thought they were yellow green but they were yellow or green or any combination of either depending on his mood the light the color of shirt he wore his pupils had spread like black pools and the thin line of color that chased round them was a pale true green human eyes werent really green not really grayish green maybe but a true clear green rarely but micahs eyes were those eyes sat in a face that was beautiful in the way a womans face was beautiful delicate there was a line to the jaw a chin that was male but gently so his mouth was wide with the bottom lip thicker than his upper giving him a permanent pout i wanted to feel his lips on mine feel the brush of his skin under my hands he affected me as hed affected me almost from the first moment i saw himlike he was a missing piece of myself that i had to bring as close to my body as i could as if wed meld together someday he didnt argue as i brought him down for the kiss he didnt tell me that i was hurt and needed to rest he just leaned in and pressed his mouth against mine kissing him was like breathing automatic something your body did so that it wouldnt die there was no thought to wanting to touch micah no waffling indecision like with every other man in my life he was my nimirraj and from the moment we had been together it had been deeper than marriage more permanent than anything words or paper could bind my arms slid over his back his shoulders the slick wetness of his skin and our beasts rose his energy was like a hot breath along my skin shimmering everywhere we touched my beast rose up through the depths of my body and i felt micahs beast echoing mine they moved in our two separate bodies like two swimming shapes up and up each racing the other with only our skin to keep them apart then it was as if the skin was not enough to contain them and our beasts swam through each of us it bowed my back brought micahs voice in something near a scream our beasts writhed between our bodies the energies intertwined more than our bodies ever could they wove and danced like some invisible rope knotting tying gliding in and out of us until i raked my nails down micahs body and he set teeth into my shoulder i dont know if it was the pain the pleasure the beasts or all of it together but suddenly i could think again suddenly i knew why id been sick all day i felt that long metaphysical cord that bound me to jeanclaude saw him in his bed at the circus of the damned with asher still beside him there was a shadow sitting on jeanclaudes bare chest a dark shape the longer i looked at it the more solid it became until it turned a misshapen face to me snarling and showed me eyes burning with dark honey flame i looked at the hungry shadow of belle mortes power that had been trying to leech life from jeanclaude all day but the master vampires failsafe systems had kicked inhis human servant and probably his animal to call richard had refused to help us directly but he was probably paying the price for it today the thing hissed at me again like some great demonic cat and i decided to treat it like one i threw my beast down the long line of metaphysical cord what i hadnt planned for was that micahs beast would follow mine that when we attacked it would be together ripping the thing to smoky tatters it fled through the wall i wondered where it had gotten to and the thought was enough i saw it in the guest room wed prepared for musette the shadow sat on her chest for a second then seemed to melt into her body there was a moment when that swimming thing moved underneath the vampires dead skin then all was quiet angelitos voice mistress are you there then i was back in the warm water and micahs arms what was that he asked voice soft strangled the shadowy thing was a piece of belle mortes power that she gave to musette it was like it was trying to feed on jeanclaude but it couldnt im his human servant micah i think when musette tried to steal jeanclaudes strength the attack deflected to me shes been sucking on me all day did jeanclaude do that on purpose he asked no hes truly dead to the world its just the way the system is set up if she could have sucked jeanclaude dry then she could have taken the energy of all of his vamps everyone that had a blood tie to him instead shes been feeding off of you yeah and probably richard i bet he called in sick to school today micah held me tight against him how do we keep it from happening again i patted his arm you know thats one of the things i like most about you most people would spend time worrying about what could have happened how bad it could have been you go straight to the practical we need to do something before it hops back through the wall is my cell phone in here anywhere in the pile with your clothes he said can you reach it he stretched out one long arm his arms were longer than they looked he used fingertips to move the phone close enough to pick up he handed it to me without a single question micah didnt make me waste time explaining myself i called the circus of the damned the special number that wasnt in the phone book ernie who was jeanclaudes human errand boy and sometimes appetizer answered i asked if bobby lee was still there when i described him ernie said yeah cant get rid of him seems to think hes in charge since i sort of thought he was in charge too that worked for me bobby lee came on the line anita whats happening ask ernie to find you some crosses and put them on the doors to the guest rooms can i ask why to keep the bad vampires from doing any more metaphysical tricks today that explains absolutely nothing to me just do it dont you need to put crosses on the coffins to keep vampires from using their powers theres only one exit from each room its like a bigger coffin trust me itll work youre the boss at least until rafael tells me otherwise he asked ernie for the crosses i could hear ernies voice protesting in tone though not the words bobby lee came back on line hes worried that the crosses being in plain sight on the doors will impede our vampires when they wake maybe but im more worried about what our guests are doing right now when night falls well worry about it until then just do it are you ever going to explain to me why im doing it you want to know fine the new vamps are using vampire wiles to suck energy from jeanclaude and through him me i have felt like shit all day you know i like you anita you explain things when i ask i almost never understand what the hell youre talking about but you talk to me like im bright enough to understand it and know enough about magic to follow all the big words im hanging up now bobby lee yes maam i handed the phone to micah so he could put it close to the pile of clothes which i had no chance of reaching without dribbling water all over the place i leaned back against micah and he sank deeper into the water so that even the tip of my chin was submerged i wanted to sink in against his body be held and drowse now that the shadow was off of jeanclaude i was tired it was almost as if now i had permission to sleep but there was one other crisis to talk about jason told me that nathaniel collapsed at work last night hes tucked into his room sandwiched between zane and cherry hes fine micah kissed the side of my head is it true that he collapsed because the two of you cant keep feeding my ardeur twice a day micah went very still around me and his silence said it all did you know that the two of you couldnt sustain me you feed on jeanclaude too he said fine did you know that the three of you couldnt sustain me jeanclaude keeps saying that your appetite should go down soon the three of us could feed you if you only needed to be fed once a day twice a day is harder why didnt you tell me i asked he hugged me and i let him but i wasnt happy because i know how hard it is for you to take new people to your bed i was hoping you wouldnt have to that reminded me i sort of did did what he asked took someone else to my bed i felt like i should be squirming with embarrassment but my ability to be embarrassed wasnt what it used to be who he asked voice soft asher you and jeanclaude he made it more statement than question yeah he cuddled me against him why now i told him my reasoning you are going to make those vampires very unhappy tonight i hope so i turned in his arms enough to see his face he looked peaceful enough by candlelight does it bother you about asher he seemed to think about it for a second or two yes and no explain the yes i said while you need the ardeur fed theres plenty of your time to go around im a little worried about what happens if you get a string of men now with the ardeur rising then the ardeur goes away youre going to have some unhappy people if you get too many of them i frowned i hadnt thought about that i mean i havent had intercourse with anyone but you and jeanclaude ill say what jeanclaude would say if he were here ma petite you are splitting hairs fine fine i dont plan on kicking nathaniel out of my bed just because the ardeur is quiet no but will you be willing to touch him the way hes come to expect i turned so i wouldnt have to meet those honest eyes of his i dont know thats the truth i dont know and asher one step at a time with him okay and richard i shook my head against micahs chest thats moot richard can barely stand to be within twenty feet of me are you seriously saying that if he showed up today and asked to come back youd say no it was my turn to go quiet in his arms i thought about it tried to think about it clearly levelheaded the trouble was that richard was never a topic i was logical on i dont know but im leaning towards no really micah i still have feelings for richard but he dumped me he dumped me because im more comfortable with the monsters than he is he dumped me because im too bloodthirsty for him he dumped me because im not the person he wants me to be i will never be the person he wants me to be richard will never be the person he wants himself to be micah said softly i sighed it was true richard wanted more than anything else to be human he didnt want to be a monster he wanted to be a junior high science teacher marry a nice girl settle down have children and maybe a dog he was a science teacher but the rest richard was like me he would never have a normal life i had accepted that but he was still fighting fighting to be human fighting to be ordinary fighting not to love me hed succeeded on that last if richard comes back to me it wont be for good hell come back because he cant help himself but he hates himself too much to love anyone else thats harsh he said but true i said micah didnt argue with me he didnt when he knew he was wrong or knew i was right richard would have argued richard always argued richard seemed to believe that if he pretended the world was a nicer place than it really was that that would change the world it didnt the world was what it was and no amount of anger or hatred or selfloathing or stubborn blindness would change it maybe richard would learn to accept himself but i was beginning to believe that he would learn that lesson without me in his life i hugged micahs arms around me like a warm coat but i was tired now achingly tired if richard knocked on the door today and asked to come back what would i do truthfully i didnt know but one thing i knew richard wouldnt let me feed the ardeur off of him he thought it was monstrous and he wouldnt share me physically with anyone but jeanclaude even if he wanted to come back unless hed let me feed the ardeur off of others it wouldnt work pure practicality the ardeur had to be fed richard wouldnt feed it richard wouldnt let me feed it off of anyone but jeanclaude jeanclaude alone couldnt sustain my appetite hell micah jeanclaude and nathaniel together werent sustaining it if richard came back today what would i do offer him onethird of my bed on the other side from micah richard had consented to dating me at the same time i dated jeanclaude but never to sharing a bed with him and me at the same time richard would try to go back to what we had i couldnt do that what would i do if richard knocked on the door right now offer to let him join us in the bathtub watch his face show all the hurt and rage watch him stomp out again what would i do if richard wanted to come back the only thing i could do say no the question was was i strong enough to say it probably not i didnt so much wake as come to the surface of sleep enough to hear voices micahs voice first what did gregory say that his father tried to contact him cherrys voice why is that bad his father is the one that pimped him and stephen out when they were children every time i think ive heard the worst of people im wrong micah said i fought to open my eyes and it was as if my eyelids weighed a hundred pounds apiece i blinked and found micah still curled against me but propped up on one elbow cherry was standing beside the bed she was tall slender longwaisted with blond hair cut boyishly short she wasnt wearing any makeup which meant she was in a hurry and she was actually wearing clothes which was unusual for one of the wereleopards they usually only got dressed if i insisted either she was going out or something was wrong but of course something was wrong i fought to wake up enough to say something and it took more effort than was pretty my voice came out thick whatd you say bout gregory cherry bent closer and it took almost everything i had to keep her in focus as she moved in towards me you knew that gregory and stephen had been abused as children she made it half question i managed to say yeah i frowned up at her did you say their father pimped them out as children maybe i was dreaming either that or id misunderstood you didnt know cherry said her face was so serious i was suddenly more awake no zane came through the bedroom door with nathaniel in his arms zane was six feet tall stretched a little too thin for my tastes but since he and cherry were living together it wasnt my tastes that counted his very short hair was whiteblond now it was the first color occurring in nature that id ever seen him dye his hair i had no idea what his true hair color was zane carried nathaniel tucked in against his chest like he was a sleeping child nathaniels nearly anklelength auburn hair in its heavy braid was clutched in one of zanes hands if you tried carrying nathaniel without controlling all that hair you had a tendency to trip on it on either side of the braid his body was bare hes wearing underwear zane said we know the rules no sleeping naked with you he moved the hair enough to flash a pair of the satiny jogging shorts that nathaniel was fond of wearing for jammies i tried to prop myself up on my elbows but that seemed too hard i settled for lying on my back with both eyes solidly open hows he doing hes fine micah said i looked at him i tried to make the look skeptical but i failed so i had to say out loud he looks comatose say something to her you lazy cat zane said nathaniel turned his head slowly almost painfully slow as zane carried him around to the other side of the bed he blinked lavender eyes at me and gave me a lazy smile he looked almost as tired as i felt and why not hadnt he collapsed for the same reason i hadbecause some vampire had been feeding off of him the ardeur didnt take blood but it was still a type of vampirism micah crawled out from the covers flashing the perfectly tanned line of his body mercifully he kept most of his assets hidden from my view i think i was too tired to be tempted but i knew i was too tired to want to be tempted he pulled clothes on with his back to me but when he turned around pants safely zipped the look on his face said plainly that he knew id been watching him his dark dark brown hair curled around his shoulders one movement of his head sent all that heavy hair sliding to one side of his face the dark hair framed those extraordinary eyes gleaming yellow and green at the same time now if you dont move out of her line of sight well be here all bloody day zane said you sound jealous cherry chided him well he said you dont watch me like that i dont watch anybody like that cherry said zane grinned at her i know they had one of those laughs that is a couple laugh and you know that you are on the outside of an inside joke zane was right about one thing i was delaying it wasnt until i tried getting out of bed that i realized i was still naked id sort of known that but in a distant floaty kind of way i need clothes i said micah had pulled a polo shirt out of the communal drawer it was one id bought with him in mind a deep rich forest green it brought out the green in his eyes but the shirt fit both of us as most of our shirts did our casual clothes had become common propertyonly the dressup clothes were strictly his and hers micah didnt so much make me lie back down as touch my shoulder so id stop trying to sit up i didnt seem to be coordinated enough to sit up in bed keep the sheet over my breasts and chew gum at the same time it was as if my body just wasnt listening to me yet anita if you dont rest youre not going to be any good to anyone gregorys my leopard im his nimirra micah smoothed his hand down the side of my face and im his nimirraj go back to sleep ill take care of it thats what you hired me for right i had to smile at him but i didnt like not going to gregorys rescue it must have shown on my face because he knelt beside the bed taking my hand in his gregory is having hysterics because his fathers in town im going to go and see how hes doing maybe bring him back here so his father cant find him through the phone book i was having trouble focusing on micahs face id crawled out of sleep but it was sucking at me again yes i said voice starting to sound distant even to me bring him back here he kissed me gently on the forehead my hand still in his i will now sleep or youre going to make yourself sick a sick nimirra cant protect anybody since i couldnt keep my eyes from giving long blinks it was hard to argue him kissing my hand was the first hint i had that hed stood up that had been a long blink the bed moved and nathaniel cuddled up against me his arm across my stomach one leg across my thigh it was one of his favorite sleeping positions but something wasnt right with it clothes i said and i frowned harder cant feed off nathaniel again micah reappeared in my line of sight youve only been asleep about two hours thats why youre so tired if you fed the ardeur at dawn youve got at least six hours before you need to feed again were just putting him in here so he wont be alone the last few words floated out of the dark and it wasnt until hed been quiet for a long time that i opened my eyes to an empty room nathaniel was tucked in against me his face hidden against my shoulder he snuggled in tighter leaving me with about an inch of bed to spare i started to move him over and get out of bed to find the pajamas no one had given me but i fell back to sleep the wereleopards were having a bad influence on how comfortable i was being nude i dreamed belle morte sat at her dressing table her long black hair fell in waves freshly brushed gleaming in the candlelight she wore a gown of deep yellow gold and i knew before she turned those honey brown eyes to me that the color of the robe brought out the gold in them her lips were red and moist as if shed just licked them she held out her white hand towards me come ma petite come sit with me she smiled with that red red mouth and i wanted nothing more than to go to her to take that outstretched hand and be held i actually started forward a step and found i was wearing a gown similar to hers i could feel the layers of petticoats the metal of the stays digging in forcing my posture absolutely straight the gown was a rich crimson a color that made my own skin gleam white my hair blacker for the contrast my own lips redder than they truly were my dark eyes nearly black i touched the unfamiliar clothes and it helped me to think helped me to hesitate i shook my head no and my whisper echoed oddly through the room she waved that pale hand at me as you like ma petite but come closer so i may know you better i shook my head again forcing my fingers to touch the heavy unfamiliar fabric of the gown i am not your ma petite of course you are for everything that belongs to jeanclaude is mine no i said it seemed like i should have been saying more but i couldnt think with her sitting there wrapped in candlelight a bowl of oldfashioned roses on the table by her elbow the roses were her rose created and named for her centuries ago she stood in a swish of skirts that rustling sound that made my pulse beat faster and my body tighten run run i screamed it in my head but my body wasnt moving she walked slowly towards me her breasts mounded by the tight clothing i had a sudden flash of memory of what it was like to kiss along that gleaming skin i took two handfuls of the long skirt turned on my highheeled shoes and ran the room vanished as i ran and it was a long endlessly long corridor that i ran down it was dark but it was the dark of dreams where even without light you could always see the monsters though what lurked in the alcoves along the hallway werent exactly monsters couples entwined on either side of me glimpses of flesh pale and dark images of carnal delights i didnt see anything clearly i didnt want to i ran and tried not to see but of course i couldnt not see everything breasts like ripe fruit spilling out of oldfashioned dresses full skirts lifted to prove that there was nothing underneath but flesh a man with his pants around his thighs and a woman bending over him blood gleamed down the pale flesh vampires raised fangs to the light and humans clung to them begging for more i ran faster and faster struggling against the heavy skirts and the tight upright corset it was hard to breathe hard to move and no matter how fast i ran the door that i could see at the end of all these carnal nightmares never seemed to get closer there was nothing too terribly frightening happening in the alcoves nothing i hadnt either seen or participated in in one form or another but somehow i knew that if i stopped running theyd get me and more than anything else i didnt want them to touch me the door was suddenly in front of me i grabbed the handle tugged on it and it was locked of course it was locked i screamed and knew before i turned around that the things in the corridor werent in the alcoves anymore belles voice come to me willingly ma petite i put my forehead against the door eyes closed as if if i didnt turn around didnt see them they couldnt get me stop calling me that she laughed and it felt like sex sliding along my skin jeanclaudes laugh was amazing but this this the sound made me spasm against the hard wood and metal of the door you will feed us ma petite it will happen your choice is only in how i turned slowly the way you do in nightmares you turn knowing that the hot breath on your skin really is the monster belle morte stood in the center of the vast echoing space of the corridor and through jeanclaudes memories i knew it was a real place this corridor the people from the alcoves crowded to either side of her and behind her a huge hungryeyed halfnaked mob i offer you my hand come take it and it will be pleasure beyond your dreams refuse me she motioned and that one small movement seemed to take in all the eager leering faces it can be a dream or a nightmare the choice is yours i shook my head you dont give choices belle you never did then your choice is pain the mob at her back rushed me and the dream shattered i was left gasping in nathaniels worried face you cried out in your sleep were you having a nightmare he said my heart was beating so hard i could barely swallow past my pulse i managed a breathy oh yeah then i smelled roses thick cloying oldfashioned almost sickly sweet belles voice echoed through my head you will feed us the ardeur poured through me raising heat along my skin nathaniel jerked his hands back as if hed been burned but i knew it hadnt hurt he knelt in the tangle of sheets eyes wide the little satin jogging shorts stretched tight over his thighs they werent stretched tight over the front of him yet he wasnt excited yet and i wanted him to be i rolled onto my side reaching for him one pale hand outstretched come take my hand the moment the words left my mouth i was back in my nightmare except that i was playing belle nathaniel was reaching out towards me to touch my hand and i knew if he did the ardeur would spread to him and i would feed nathaniel had collapsed last night because id taken too much from him what would happen if i fed again this soon stop i said and it was almost firm if it had been almost anyone else they wouldnt have stopped but it was nathaniel and he did what he was told he stayed on his knees those tiny shorts stretched so tight across his body he let his hand fall back into his lap he was only inches away from me all i had to do was close that small distance i needed to get out of the bed to walk away but that strong i was not i couldnt seem to take my eyes away from him so close so eager so young that thought wasnt mine i frowned and the confusion helped me push back the ardeur long enough to sit up long enough to look at the mirror on the dresser against the far wall i was trying to see if my eyes were shining with honeybrown fire but they were my eyes belle hadnt possessed me like she had once upon a time but shed done somethingawakened the ardeur hours ahead of time the bed moved and my head swiveled back like a predator hearing the mouse in the grass nathaniel was exactly where id left him but he must have made some small movement and that one small movement had been enough my pulse was in my throat my body tight and swollen with need a need like nothing id ever experienced i couldnt breathe past it couldnt move around it it was as if need had taken me over and there was nothing left of me this wasnt right this wasnt me i managed to shake my head to let out the breath id been holding i was being messed about with i even knew who was doing it but i didnt know how to stop it the door to the bedroom opened it was jason he stood in the doorway rubbing his hands on his bare arms hed pulled on his jeans but hadnt bothered to zip or button them i caught a flash of a new pair of silk undies pale blue to match the shirt he wasnt wearing anymore what are you doing in here anita the power is crawling over my skin i tried to talk around the ripeness of my own pulse and failed twice before i managed to say ardeur he came farther into the room still rubbing his arms trying to get rid of the goosebumps its hours too early i wanted to tell him about the dream about belle but all i could concentrate on was the glimpse of silk through his open jeans i wanted to go to him to pull his pants down around his ankles to take him in my mouth the visual was so strong i had to close my eyes had to hug myself tight to keep myself on the bed there was another small movement from nathaniel he had lain down on the bed his braid trailing behind him like rapunzel his face was peaceful he would let me do anything i wanted to him even love him to death i drew my legs in against my body wrapped my arms around myself so tight and held on get out nathaniel get out i felt the bed move but didnt dare look i kept my eyes tight shut get out you heard her nathaniel jason said leave now i heard small sounds as he crossed the room then the door shut you can look now anita hes gone i opened my eyes and the room was empty except for the play of sunlight and jason standing beside the bed his hair was very yellow in the light the color of butter his eyes so blue i followed the line of his body to the broad shoulders the muscled edge of his arms his chest with its pale nipples there was no hair on his chest or stomach a lot of strippers shaved their body hair id seen jason nude often enough to know that he was mostly shaved i just hadnt really noticed how shaved he was my friend so even nude he was still my friend you dont stare at your friends crotch to see how much body hair there is now sitting on the bed holding myself tight i didnt feel friendly i felt crazed i wanted to fling myself off the bed onto him i wanted him naked what do you need jason asked i looked up at him and didnt know whether to cry or scream but finally i found words a hoarse voice squeezed past my pulse i have to feed i know he looked so solemn what do you need me to do i wanted to tell him to leave too but i didnt micah wasnt here the vampires were still dead to the world nathaniel was offlimits for today there were others outside this room but no one i wanted to touch no one who was even my friend i looked up at jason a square of sunlight splashed across his chest painting him gold and warm what do you want me to do anita my voice came out barely above a whisper feed me blood flesh or sex his face was careful as he asked solemn my ardeur was always mixed with other desires but not today today there was only one need sex that one word low soft while i kept myself from going to him his soserious face split into a sudden grin ill take one for the team i slid off the bed to stand for a moment nude before him i wanted to run to him to jump on him to fuck him there was no other word for what my body was wanting but i didnt want to do that i wanted to avoid intercourse if i could id managed to avoid it with nathaniel for months surely just this once with jason i could manage it i closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths then i dropped to the floor on all fours i crawled towards him feeling like i had muscles in places that i shouldnt have my beast curled through my body like a cat on its back stretching in the sunlight but the ardeur roared over my beast as if the desire were some great hand smashing down every other need arent you going to complain about being naked in front of me no i whispered it not trusting anything louder his feet were bare i lowered my face to the smooth skin on top of his foot licked along it his breath came out in a shiver god i used my hands to crawl up his legs tugging on the jeans until i knelt in front of him id managed to pull the jeans lower on his hips without meaning to exposing a wide triangle of the blue silk undies my face was almost level with his groin i could see him pressed tight and firm under the cloth the tip of him straining against the elastic of the underwear trapped i wanted to lower that cloth to help him i slid my hands around behind him digging fingers into his jeans gripping his butt it drew a sound from low in his throat but it kept me from ripping off his clothes i pressed my face against his thigh turning it away from his groin my control hung from a rapidly fraying thread id learned through long practice with nathaniel that the only way to keep from doing more was to do everything carefully slowly but i didnt want to be careful and i felt anything but slow i wanted to beg him to take me damn it i could do better than this jason stroked my hair and that one gentle touch brought my face back up i gazed up the line of his body to his face there was that look that comes on a mans face when hes sure of you sure of what will happen i never thought to see that look on jasons face not for me that look in his spring blue eyes brought a sound low in my throat he touched my cheek dont stop he said voice soft dont stop i lowered my face towards him still gazing up i licked him through the silk and watched his face while i did it i licked along the length of him until he threw his head back his eyes closed he was so hard so firm against my mouth under the cloth i wrapped my mouth around the head of him through the silk bringing one hand round to hold him solid and thick he made a noise halfway between a word and a shout as if id surprised him he looked down at me and his eyes were wild i drew back from him and the silk had turned dark blue where my mouth had touched him his hands went to the back of his pants and it was jason that slid the silk and the jeans down his hips him that revealed himself to me while i knelt in front of him he was smooth the head wide and rounded graceful straight and fine running slightly to the side so that he nestled in the hollow of his own hip i took him in my hand and his breath quickened i lifted him away from his body just enough so that i could spill my mouth over the head of him rolling my tongue along that graceful curve he shuddered under my touch i drew more of him into my mouth sliding my hand down to cup lower things he was smooth to the touch everywhere i could touch with hand or mouth there was nothing but the smooth perfection of him he was shaved smooth id been with men who trimmed and shaved some but never one that was perfectly smooth i liked it it made so many things easier to take into my mouth to roll and explore every touch every caress every lick seemed to bring some new noise from himwhimpers soft cries breathless words it became a game to see how many sounds i could draw from him i drew his pants down farther so that i could spread his legs lick between them along that thin line of skin between testicles and anus he cried out and i moved up his body one lick one nibble at a time i took him into my mouth again as much as i could from this angle wrapping my fingers in a ring around the rest of him my other hand cupping his testicles playing along that line that ran between his legs his breath was coming quick and quicker his body quivered against me he grabbed a handful of my hair drew me back from him he looked down at me like a drowning man up he said i frowned at him what he bent down grabbed my upper arms drew me to my feet he kissed me and it was like he was trying to crawl inside me through my mouth lips tongue teethsomething between a kiss and eating me his hands slid down my back following the curve of my spine then lower over the swell of my hips until his fingers found my thighs he lifted me with just his hands on my thighs our mouths still locked together the movement of his hands spread my legs pressed me against him the feel of him so hard so ready pressed against my body drew small sounds from me and he ate those sounds straight from my mouth as if he were tasting my screams he used his hands to draw my lower body away from his my arms still locked around his shoulders one hand sliding through the baby silkiness of his hair he moved one hand to my butt supporting all my weight on one hand while he moved the other hand between us i had a second to realize what he was going to do i fought the ardeur i fought the feel of his mouth on mine the feel of him in my arms to rear back enough to try and say something i managed to say jason and he drove his hips forward upward but the feel of him inside me was exactly what the ardeur wanted exactly what i wanted he entered me and it wasnt hesitant or gentle he fought against the wet tightness of my body both hands on the backs of my thighs pulling me to him as he pushed himself inside me it drew small screams out of my throat one after the other he walked us backward until he collapsed me on the edge of the bed most of my lower body still held in his hands trapped against him he stayed standing his body pinning me to the edge of the bed his hands holding me as if i weighed nothing he stared down at me with eyes that were no longer human but wolf he drew himself out of my body slowly an inch at a time until i was almost free then he shoved himself back and made me scream again it wasnt a scream of pain he found a rhythm that was fast and deep and hard as if he were trying to shove himself out the other side of me he beat his body into mine with a thick meaty sound the orgasm caught me unprepared one moment i was caught in the rhythm of his body in mine and the next i was screaming writhing underneath him i raked nails down his body anywhere i could touch him and when that wasnt enough i clawed my own body jasons screams echoed mine and his body tightened against me spine bowing head thrown back and a howl spilled from his lips the ardeur drank him down his skin his sweat his seed he collapsed on top of me his breath came in a painful struggle and his heart pounded like a trapped thing against my skin he scooted us more solidly onto the bed his body still deep within mine when we were both lying on the bed breathing hard pulses quieting he looked down at me and there was something in his eyes something serious and very unjason his voice was still breathless hoarse when he said i know that this may be the only time i get to do this when i move let me hold you for just a little while my own voice wasnt much better than his since i cant move from the waist down yet sure he laughed then and because he was still inside me and partially erect the movement caused me to writhe underneath him tightening setting nails into his back he screamed and his hips ground himself against me again when he could breath again he whispered oh god dont do that again then get off me i said voice almost as breathless as his he raised up on his arms almost like doing a pushup and drew himself out of me feeling him pulling out made me writhe again he collapsed beside me halflaughing when i could talk again i said whats funny god youre amazing not bad yourself i said not bad he said and gave me wide eyes i had to smile fine youre amazing too dont say it if you dont mean it he said i finally managed to turn onto my side so i could see his face better i do mean it you were amazing he turned on his side so we lay there facing each other but not touching if i never get to do this again i wanted it to be good i had to close my eyes to fight off another urge to writhe on the bed i let out a long steadying breath then opened my eyes again oh it was that i had a really good time but are you always this vigorous not every girl likes to be pounded into the mattress ive seen the men youve been sleeping with anita i knew i could be as hard and fast as i wanted to be and not hurt you i frowned at him are you implying that youre small no im saying that im not huge im good sized but some of the men in your bed are more than goodsized i blushed i hadnt blushed the entire time wed been making love and now i blushed i dont know what to say jason i feel like i should defend your ego but but inch for inch i know where i stand anita he laughed and slid an arm under my shoulders i let him bring me into the curve of his shoulder i slid my hand across his stomach my other arm underneath the small of his back my leg sliding over his thigh we cuddled almost as close now as we had been earlier you were wonderful i said i noticed how wonderful you thought i was he raised his free arm up so i could see the fresh bloody scratches id put down his arms i widened eyes at him does your other arm look that bad yes i frowned and he touched my forehead dont frown anita im going to enjoy every mark ill miss them when they heal but he touched fingertip to my lips to keep me from finishing no buts just amazing sex and i for one want to feel the aches and pains of it as long as i can he touched my arm where it lay across his stomach raised it so i could look at it there were nail marks some of them seeping blood some just red and raised these arent my marks of course once i saw them they started to hurt why is it that small wounds dont hurt until you see them actually i said they are your marks or at least a sign of a job well done i dont remember ever marking myself up this badly he gave that low masculine chuckle with an edge of laughter that was pure jason thanks for the compliment but i know that whatever i did it cant be half as wonderful as what asher and jeanclaude did a few hours ago no amount of inches or talent will put a man in that league i shivered hugging him thats not necessarily a bad thing how can you say that ive felt a fraction of what asher did to you and its he seemed to be searching for just the right word he finally said wondrous mindblowing yeah i said the kind of pleasure youd do almost anything to experience again my voice sounded less than happy jason touched my chin raised me to look at him are you thinking of not going back for more i tucked my face against his shoulder lets just say that im not completely happy about it why not he asked i dont know exactly i shook my head as much as i could pressed against him truth is that it scares me what scares you sex is great jason but this what asher can do with his bite i tried to put it into words and knew that whatever i said would fail to describe it asher feels like a master vampire in my head his level of power but he has no animal to call he can do the voice trick like jeanclaude but thats a minor power i was a little puzzled i mean he feels like a master but wheres his power i shivered again i found out jason rested his chin on the top of my head and said what do you mean i mean that his power lies in seduction sex intimate play he cant feed off lust the way jeanclaude can and he doesnt cause lust in those around him the way jeanclaude does but damn once the preliminaries are out of the way he can cause such pleasure it really is something that people would kill for sign their fortunes away for do whatever belle morte wanted them to do just as long as asher would keep visiting their beds so hes like this amazing lay jason said no youre an amazing lay micah is an amazing lay im not a hundred percent sure that jeanclaude is as good as i think he is because im not sure anymore how much of it is true talent and how much is vampire powers i did not have intercourse with asher we just shared blood jason moved so he could frown down at me im sorry but the wolf knows these things it wasnt just jeanclaude i smelled when i walked into the room i blushed again i didnt say asher didnt have a good time i just said we didnt have intercourse and your point is what he asked my point is that if that was only taking blood im afraid to have real sex with him i mean how much better could it be he gave a laugh that held an edge of giggling almost a giddy sound id love to find out i raised up on one elbow are you telling me youd do asher he frowned the laughter still glinting in his eyes i was a little confused for awhile about exactly what my preferences were i mean ive been jeanclaudes pomme de sang for about two years now its amazing when he feeds anita afuckingmazing enjoying being with him this much made me think i might be gay he traced his hand down my shoulder but i like girls im not saying that with the right person bisexual isnt a possibility but not if it means never being able to do this again i like girls he drew like out into a multisyllabic word it made me laugh and i like men i noticed he said still with a trace of laughter in his voice i sat up i think weve cuddled enough he touched my arm face serious again are you really not going to bed asher i sighed you know how you said jeanclaude is so amazing when he takes blood yeah jeanclaude says that ashers bite is orgasmic literally so that means that ashers bite is more pleasurable than even jeanclaudes okay he said he propped himself up on pillows hands folded across his stomach as he listened to me i was sitting indian fashion still nude and it didnt seem to matter it wasnt sexual now just comfortable ive had sex with jeanclaude but never allowed him to take blood with it never he said never he shook his head you are the strongest willed person ive ever met no one else would have refused the double pleasure not this long you havent done both with him i said he grinned its considered bad form to fuck your pomme de sang unless they initiate it if they initiate it then its an extra treat and only if theyve been good you sound like you asked him about this i did i raised eyebrows at that oh come on anita ive slept with him longer than you have youd have to be more of a flaming heterosexual than i am to not wonder he turned you down very politely but yeah i was frowning did he say why jason nodded you i couldnt frown any harder so i tried to stop but i was puzzled why me youve been his pomme longer than ive been his girlfriend and a hell of a lot longer than ive been his lover by the time i asked you were dating he seemed to think that you would dump his ass if you found out he was doing another man youre making my head hurt i said sorry but if you dont want the truth dont ask he settled the pillows more comfortably at his back but youve managed to avoid answering my original question what was it i asked he looked at me dont try to be coy anita youre so bad at it fine asher what to do about asher i made sort of promises to them both that wed find a way to be a ménage а trois or would that be a ménage a quatre whos your fourth micah i said darn he said i frowned at him couldnt help myself sorry if i go back on that promise well lose asher what do you mean lose i explained about ashers plans to leave so if you dont come across hes gone yeah he frowned laughed then shook his head let me think this through his bite is overwhelmingly orgasmic mindblowing pleasure you think that if you fuck him while he takes blood that it will be even more amazing yes i said why is this a problem jason asked i hugged myself im afraid jason he sat up beside me afraid of what afraid of being i hesitated tried to find a the words and finally im afraid of being consumed he frowned consumed i know what the word means but i dont understand what you mean by it arent you afraid of wanting one of them so badly that youd do anything to have him with you do you just mean vampires or people in general i rested my chin on my knees vampires of course no you dont mean just vampires youre afraid of wanting anybody completely arent you i wouldnt look at him i dont know what you mean he pushed my hair back behind my ear but it was too thick to stay dont lie to uncle jason you didnt mean just vampires i looked at him hugging my legs to me maybe not but the point is the same i dont want to want anyone so much that if they arent with me i die a look passed through his eyes that i couldnt read you mean youre afraid of loving anyone more than life itself yes he smiled and it was gentle and a little sad i would give one of my less favorite body parts for a woman to care for me as deeply as you do for nathaniel i started to protest that i didnt love nathaniel jason touched a finger to my lips stop i know you havent given yourself over heart and soul to nathaniel but then you havent given yourself over heart and soul to anybody have you i looked away because watching that patient grownup look in his eyes was uncomfortable to say the least one of my goals in life is just once to have a woman look at me the way you watch jeanclaude the way you and jeanclaude watch asher the way you watch nathaniel the way nathaniel looks at you you left micah off the list you and he have this comfort level that you dont have with any of the others but its almost as if the comfort comes at the expense of something else what i asked i dont know ive never been in love how should i know so what im not in love with micah that is not my question to answer i cannot be in love with four men at once why not i looked at him its not a rule he said it would be ridiculous i said you fought jeanclaude because you were afraid of him then richard came along and i think you loved him really loved him and that scared you so you backed off i think you dated them both to keep from falling in love with either of them thats not true isnt it originally jeanclaude said hed kill richard if he didnt get a chance to woo me too and why didnt you just kill jeanclaude then you dont tolerate ultimatums anita so why tolerate that one i didnt have an answer for that or at least not a good one richard grows more distant more caught up in his own personal angst which leaves the field open for jeanclaude so suddenly you have nathaniel bunking with you i know i know hes your pomme de sang your house leopard but it was still interesting timing i wanted to tell him to stop to not say anymore but he didnt he kept on id never thought of jason as relentless before somewhere in all this asher comes up on the radar maybe its jeanclaudes old memories maybe not but whatever caused it youre drawn to him but hes so full of anger that its not a threat hes almost as full of selfloathing as richard is then suddenly richard walks away for real this time youre left with just jeanclaude and nathaniel but nathaniel isnt enough of a romantic threat to keep jeanclaude at bay and suddenly theres micah out of the blue instant lust instant housekeeping you have micah and now jeanclaude is back to sharing you with someone else and youre safe again you cant fall madly in love with jeanclaude or anyone else because youve divided your world up into different parts with each of them because no one man has your whole world no one man can rock your whole world i got out of the bed tugging the sheet around me like a robe i suddenly didnt want to be naked in front of jason anymore i thought it was all accidental and it was and it wasnt youre terrified of belonging to just one person arent you i shook my head not of belonging to just one person jason of wanting to belong to just one person why why is that so frightening to you most people spend their lives wanting exactly that i know i do i loved someone once with my whole heart and he stomped on it please not the fiance in college anita that was years ago and he was an asshole you cant spend the rest of your life nursing one bad experience i was at the foot of the bed now wrapped shoulders to feet in the sheet i was cold and it had nothing to do with the temperature its not only that i said voice soft what is it then i took a deep breath in let it out slow i loved my mother with my whole heart and whole soul she was my world she died and it nearly destroyed me i thought about everything hed said and i couldnt argue with it and i couldnt pretend it didnt make sense i never want to put my whole world in any one persons hands again jason if they die i wont die with them so youll hold a little of yourself back from everybody no i said ill hold back a piece of myself for myself no one gets all of me jason no one except me he shook his head so jeanclaude gets sex but no blood nathaniel gets intimacy but not intercourse asher gets blood but not intercourse micahs getting intimacy and intercourse what are you holding back from him i dont love him yet liar i lust after him but i dont love him yet and richard what did you hold back from richard i stood there wrapped in the damned sheet feeling the world sinking away to a small screaming thing nothing i said i held back nothing and he dumped my ass jason just sat there for a second or two then he got off the bed i think he meant to hold me comfort me i put out a hand to stop him if you hug me im going to cry and richard has gotten the last tear out of me that hes going to get im sorry anita not your fault no but it wasnt any of my business either i dont have the right to psychoanalyze you youre just jealous i said and i tried to make it light joking and failed about what he asked that i have so many people that i could be in love with if id only give that one last inch he sat back down on the edge of the bed youre right damn it but youre right i am jealous but i didnt mean to hurt you i didnt understand until the moment you said how afraid you were of being consumed i want to be consumed anita i want someone to come along and burn me up youre a romantic i said you make that sound like a dirty word not dirty jason just useless i started for the door im going to get cleaned up help yourself to the upstairs shower if you want jason called to me but i kept walking id had all the pillow talk i wanted for one day i loved the new shower that id had installed in the downstairs master bathroom one of the bear lycanthropes in town turned out to be a plumber id still paid full price but at least i knew he wouldnt be asking stupid questions about my living arrangements i liked a good long bath when the occasion called for it but at heart i was a shower girl i set the showerhead on hard so that the water beat against my neck head shoulders i hadnt been embarrassed about having sex with jason and maybe that was wrong but it hadnt felt sinful maybe because it was just another way for him to take care of me but the little talk afterwards that had bothered me that hard emotional truths bothered me more than having intercourse with someone i wasnt in love with probably said something about how far down the well of moral decay i had fallen i stood in the hot hot water steam foaming against the glass doors of the stall and was happy that i didnt owe my heart to anyone it was mine damn it and i was keeping it in one piece if i could richard had broken some part of me some last bit that had been trying to hang onto a softer more romanticized view of love he had left dumped me because i wasnt human enough for him my fiance in college had dumped me because i wasnt white bread enough for his mother my stepmother judith had never let me forget that i was small and dark and she and her children and my father were tall and blond and blueeyed people had spent my lifetime rejecting me for things i could not change about myself so fuck them fuck them all i was sitting on the bottom of the shower i hadnt meant to i hadnt meant to huddle in the water hiding why was i always chasing after the love of people who i could never be enough for there were plenty of others who wanted me exactly as i was small dark hard bloody thick with metaphysical shit people who loved me just as i was unfortunately none of them were me there was a knock on the door and i realized that someone had been knocking for a while i always locked the door when i went in out of habit i turned the water down so i could hear better what is it anita its jamil i need to come in why that one word held a universe of suspicion if his reason had been something i wouldnt hate hed have already said why he needed to come in i actually heard him sigh through the door its richard hes hurt and we need to use the big bathtub no i said i turned off the water and reached for the oversized towel anita since the pack sold rainas house we dont have any body of water big enough to soak him and other pack members in i found him unconscious on his bedroom floor hes ice cold i wound a smaller towel around my wet hair you are not bringing him in here jamil theres got to be some place else to take him jeanclaude would let you use the tub at his place anita hes icy if we dont get him warm soon i dont know whatll happen i leaned my head against the door are you telling me that hes going to die im telling you i dont know ive never seen another werewolf this bad without some kind of wound to show for it i dont know whats wrong with him i did unfortunately belle hadnt only fed her people off of me shed been feeding off of richard too id thought about that earlier in the day but i hadnt dreamed that he wouldnt call his pack and have some of them near him to strengthen himself on their collected energy i hadnt known that he would just let himself die because long before he got that bad hed have known something was very wrong did he call you for help i asked still leaning against the door no i needed to ask him about pack business and i tried him at the school but hed called in sick then i called his house and got no answer anita please let us in mother fucking son of a bitch i could not believe that i was having to do this the man that had broken my heart called me a monster was about to get soaked in my bathtub for god knew how long i unlocked the door and opened it with me behind hiding so i couldnt be seen or see jamil eased through the door with richard in his arms it wasnt weight that made it hardjamil could have benchpressed the entire bathroomit was that richard was broadshouldered and jamil wasnt small himself i tried not to look at either of them getting only a brief glimpse of jamils cornrowed hair bright red beads intertwined his shirt was a red to match the beads his suit jacket black i didnt take the time to see if his pants matched the jacket i just started for the door towels clutched to me can you turn on the water for me anita jamil asked no i said and i fled i got dressed i couldnt remember if id gotten around to using shampoo on my hair or only gotten it wet and i didnt care i had an image of richards face burned in my mind eyes closed that perfectly square jaw with its dimple but there had been no spill of that glorious hair around his shoulders that wonderful hair that was brown shot with gold and copper so that it almost glowed in the sunlight hed cut his hair hed cut his hair i remembered the feel of it in my hands the silken slide of it over my body the spill of it around his face when he rose over me richard lying underneath my body his hair like a rich cloud on the pillow as his eyes lost focus and his body thrust into mine i was sitting on the bed crying when there was a knock at the door i had jeans on but had only gotten to my bra just a minute my voice was only a little thick i slipped the red tshirt on over the black jeans i started to say come in then realized it could be richard unlikely since he was unconscious minutes ago but i couldnt take the chance who is it nathaniel come in i scrubbed at my eyes and had my back to the door while i looked at my shoulder holster and tried to figure out what id done with my belt i needed the belt to slide through the shoulder holster where the hell was my belt the police are on the phone he said voice quiet i just shook my head i cant find my belt ill find it for you he said i knew from his voice that he was farther into the room now i hadnt heard him move it was like i wasnt hearing everything like i was losing pieces of things whats wrong with me i hadnt actually meant to say it out loud richards here nathaniel said as if that explained it all i kept shaking my head trying to run my hands through my wet hair it was tangled i hadnt used shampoo let alone conditioner it was going to be a mess when it dried fuck he touched my shoulder and i jerked away no no dont be nice to me if youre nice ill cry do you want me to be cruel would that make you feel better it was such an odd question that it made me look at him he was still wearing the jogging shorts hed left the room in but hed unbraided his hair and brushed it into a shining auburn curtain a stray bit of sunlight gleamed in his hair i knew what all that hair felt like rushing over my body it was so thick so heavy that it made a sound like dry water when it cascaded around me id always denied myself everything that nathaniel could offer id always backed off from enjoying every part of him jasons words came back to haunt me that i hadnt really given myself completely to anyone that i held back something from everyone id held back huge chunks of myself from nathaniel more than any of the other men in my life he was the one that id held back from the most because i didnt believe i was keeping him once i had the ardeur under control i wouldnt need a pomme de sang every day once i could feed the ardeur from a distance like jeanclaude could id stop using a pomme de sang wouldnt i he looked worried whats wrong anita i shook my head he took a step towards me and that small movement sent his hair swirling over one shoulder he gave a negligible flip of his head sending it sliding back behind him i had to close my eyes and breathe in and out concentrate on just breathing i would not cry i would not fucking cry again every time i thought richard had gotten the last tears hed ever get from me i always seemed to be wrong every time i thought there was no other way he could tear me up he found a new way nothing turns to hate so bitter as what once was love i opened my eyes and found nathaniel close enough to touch i stared into those compassionate lilac eyes that soft caring face and i hated him i dont know why but i hated him just a little i hated him for not being someone else i hated him for the hair that fell to his knees i hated him because i didnt love him or maybe i hated him because i did but it wasnt what i felt for richard i hated him and i hated me in that one instant i hated everyone in my life everyone and everything and me most of all we are out of here i said he frowned what you me jason were out of here i need to take jason back to the circus before jeanclaude wakes up anyway well pack a bag and well give the house over to richard nathaniel widened his eyes you mean to leave this house until richard is gone i nodded maybe a little too fast maybe a little too often but i had a plan and i was sticking to it what will micah say i shook my head he can join us at the circus nathaniel looked at me for a second then he shrugged how long will we be there i dont know i said and looked away from him he hadnt protested hadnt accused me of cowardice he just stuck to the facts we were going how long would we be gone ill pack for a couple of days if we need other things ill come back for them you do that i said he moved towards the door leaving me to stare around the room your belt is at the foot of the bed that made me look at him there was something in his eyes something older than he was something that made me want to squirm and look away but i was already running from richard i couldnt run away from anything else one act of extreme cowardice per day was about all my ego could handle thanks i said and my voice sounded too soft too hoarse too something do you want me to pack a bag for you too his face had fallen back into neutral lines as if hed realized the look in his eyes was too raw for me right now i can pack i said i can pack for both of us anita its not a problem i started to argue then stopped id spent the last twenty minutes trying to find a belt that id probably walked over twice if i packed in the state i was in id probably forget to bring underwear fine what do you want me to tell sergeant zerbrowski he asked ill talk to him while you pack nathaniel nodded okay i took the time to tuck my shirt in put my belt on and thread my shoulder holster i checked that the clip in my gun was full automatically i started to say something to nathaniel and those old eyes in that young face but i didnt have anything worth saying we were fleeing the house until richard was gone with that decision i didnt know what to say i left nathaniel and went into the kitchen to get the phone wondering if zerbrowski would still be on the other end or if his patience would have faded before my confusion had i entered the kitchen and found the phone on the hook and caleb sitting at the kitchen table caleb was my least favorite of the new leopards who had come in when micah and i merged our pards he was cute enough in a young boyhooker mtv sort of way curly brown hair with the lower part shaved short and the top a crown of thick curls that flopped over his eyes artfully his tanned skin was dark not quite as dark as his hair the tan had faded a little in the few months hed been in town his eyes were a nice solid brown with a silver hoop piercing one eyebrow his smooth upper body was naked so i could see his belly button piercing i also noted that hed added two new piercingsboth nipples were pierced with tiny silver dumbbells he routinely went around with the top button of his jeans unfastened his explanation was that the waistband irritated the belly piercing i didnt believe him but since i had never even pierced my ears i couldnt really call him a liar he kept one hand on the coffee cup but the other one traced over his chest and rolled one of the little silver dumbbells between his fingers i had them done a couple weeks ago like them what are you doing here i asked and i didnt care that it sounded hostile i was having a hard day and having caleb in my kitchen wasnt going to improve it taking messages for you he hadnt risen to my grumpy bait it wasnt like caleb to miss an opportunity to bitch what messages he held out a small sheet of paper to me his face was as neutral as he could manage only that faint gleam in his eyes that he never quite lost that look that said im thinking wicked thoughts about you i took a breath let it out slowly and went over to him to get the paper i recognized the notepaper it was one of the sheets we kept near the phone caleb held on to it for a second too long making me pull a little but he let it go and didnt say anything irritating that was almost a first i looked at the note i didnt recognize the writing which probably meant it was calebs it was surprisingly neat all block letters no ones dead when you have time call me dolph is on a twoweek leave of absence love zerbrowski i must have raised an eyebrow at the end part because caleb said i wrote down exactly what the policeman said i didnt add anything i believe you zerbrowski thinks hes a wit i met calebs brown eyes why are you here caleb micah called me on his cell phone told me to stay close to you today he didnt look particularly happy about it did he mention why he wanted you to stay close to me today caleb frowned no and you dropped everything you had planned today to come babysit me out of the goodness of your heart he tried to keep frowning then gradually that smile of his that matched the wicked light in his eyes emerged it was an unpleasant smile as if he was thinking unkind thoughts and those thoughts amused him very very much merle told me hed hurt me if i failed micah on this merle was micahs chief bodyguard six foot of muscle and attitude that would make a hells angel think twice caleb was about five six and soft in ways that said he had nothing to do with muscles i had to smile merles threatened you before and it hasnt impressed you much that was before chimera died he liked me better than he liked merle or micah i knew hed protect me no matter what merle said chimera had been their old pard leader in a way hed been like the godfather of lycanthrope groups but he was dead now and wed divided his people up among ours most of them thought it was an improvement because chimera had been a sexual sadist a serial killer and an allround very bad man but a few who had enjoyed helping him mete out his little blood fantasies seemed to miss chimera since chimera had been one of the scarier things id ever run into in a list that included wouldbe gods and millenniaold vampires i didnt trust any of his people that were nostalgic for the good ol days caleb was one of those great fine glad youre beginning to take orders like a good soldier tell micah when he comes back that ill be at the circus of the damned ill go with you he was already getting to his feet he was barefoot but of course because it was caleb he was wearing a toe ring i shook my head no you are staying here give my message to micah merle was pretty explicit i am to stay near you today all day i frowned i had the beginnings of an awful idea youre positive that neither micah nor merle told you why they wanted you to be glued to my side today he shook his head but he looked worried i wondered for the first time if merle had done more than just talk to him what did merle say would happen if you didnt stay close to me he said hed cut all my piercings with a knife especially the newest one his voice didnt sound the least bit like teasing he sounded tired newest one the nipples i said and made it half question no he shook his head his hands went to the top of his jeans and the already partially unbuttoned line he undid a second button i held up my hand stop thats plenty i get the idea youve pierced something there i thought why not ill heal in a matter of days instead of weeks or months for a human i wanted to ask didnt it really hurt but since silver burned a lycanthropes skin you had to be masochistic to get anything pierced id asked one of the other leopards that was pierced why not use gold answer their bodies grew over the gold healing over the wound but they didnt heal over silver thanks for oversharing there caleb there was a shadow of his usual smile but mostly his eyes looked worried almost scared im trying to do what i was told to do thats all i sighed one thing i hadnt expected was to feel sorry for caleb damn it i didnt need another person to take care of right now i was having enough trouble taking care of myself fine but nathaniel and i are taking jason back to the circus so hell be there in time for jeanclaude to wake up ill go with you i just looked at him the worry bloomed to outright fear anita please i know ive been a pain in the ass but ill be good i wont cause any trouble had micah really sent caleb here in case the ardeur rose early i disliked caleb intensely did micah really think id use him like that of course the first time id met micah id fed off of him it had also been the very first time the ardeur rose and my control had been nonexistent i was better now but what id done with jason proved not that much better id complain to micah about his choice of babysitters later and hed probably argue if not caleb then who for that i didnt have a good answer hell i didnt even have a bad answer when more wolves arrived from richards pack and the screams started i left he had a half dozen babysitters he did not need me hell he didnt even want me i didnt know what to do for richard anymore i could help the pack as a whole but helping richard seemed beyond me he needed healing and i didnt know how to do that if you needed someone killed or threatened or even hurt i was your girl i did selfdefense murder wasnt beyond me in a good cause but suicide i did not do that richard had let himself grow cold his energy sucked away and he hadnt called for help that was suicide passive suicide maybe but the intent was the same jason drove he pointed out that id had weird physical reactions all day and it would be bad to have one of the fainting spells behind the wheel of the car i replied that id fixed the reason for the fainting spells by putting crosses at the circus hed countered with the fact that we werent one hundred percent sure that was the only reason id been fainting wouldnt caution be better with that i couldnt argue my pride was not worth crashing the jeep with three other people in it if it had only been my skin at stake id have probably taken my chances i was usually more cautious of other peoples safety than my own the fact that all three were lycanthropes and would probably survive a wreck better than i would had nothing to do with it if you throw the furry through a windshield do they not still bleed we were on highway turning onto when i smelled roses do you smell that i asked jason glanced at me his hair still damp from the shower his white tshirt dark in spots from water as if hed dried in a hurry and missed places what did you say roses i smell roses he glanced behind us at nathaniel and caleb nathaniel id invited caleb had nearly cried when i didnt want to bring him whatever merle had said to him had well and truly scared him i could taste the sweet cloying perfume on the back of my tongue and no one could smell it but me shit belle mortes voice whispered through my head did you truly believe you could escape me i did escape you what jason asked i shook my head concentrating on the voice in my head and the thickening scent of roses you did not escape you fed me and you will feed me again and again until i am sated jeanclaude says youre never sated she laughed in my head and it was like having the inside of my skull rubbed with fur as if she could touch things with her voice that no one should have touched with their hands that purring contralto laugh rolled through my body raising goosebumps along my skin i had an image a memory in my head there was a huge bed and a mass of bodies on it it was a jumble of arms legs chests groins all male then one man raised up only his upper body and i glimpsed belle underneath him he lowered his body and she vanished from view it was like watching a nest of snakes so much movement disconnected in the candlelit dark as if each limb were something separate and alive without the body belles arm rose above the mass of bodies then she swam her way to the top peeled the men from her naked body until she stood in the midst of them their hands reaching up to her pleading with her she had released the ardeur upon them and fed and fed and fed until she rose from the mass of flesh glowing with power her eyes so bright with dark flames that they cast shadows as she half stepped half floated from the bed one mans body had fallen to the floor forgotten he lay very still as she stalked nude and ripe with curves glowing with power she walked over the body of the man who had given everything to satisfy her needs while the other men reached for her begged for her not to stop the men began to rise to their knees or fall off the bed in an effort to follow at least two other bodies lay on the bed forever still forever gone three of them dead loved to death and still the others begged her for more still they tried to stand and follow her i knew it was jeanclaude that she had tied to a chair and made watch i knew it was him and not me that watched her with fearful hungry eyes but when she walked past him without so much as a caress i choked on his despair part of his punishment for daring to leave her anita anita the voice seemed distant someone touched my shoulder i gasped and was brought back blinking breath harsh in my throat i was still seatbelted into the jeep we were still on about to turn onto i wasnt tied to a chair i wasnt in belles lair i was safe but the sweet scent of roses clung to me like some kind of evil perfume jason had been calling my name but it was nathaniels hand on my shoulder are you alright jason asked i nodded then shook my head belles messing with me nathaniel squeezed my shoulder i had opened my mouth to say maybe you shouldnt be touching me right now when the ardeur roared through me the heat rushed over my skin in beads of sweat brought my pulse pounding rising like some ripe fruit to fill my throat stop my breath so for a moment i was drowning in the beat and pulse of my own body i could hear my blood like a roaring flood i could feel every pulse every drop to the tingling tips of my fingers and toes i had never been so aware of how very much blood was coursing through my veins as in that one heartstopping moment i put my hand over nathaniels where it still gripped my shoulder his skin was so warm almost hot i turned towards him i looked into those lavender eyes and just the intensity of my gaze drew him closer close enough to rest his cheek against my seat i had enough left of me inside my head to think dimly he must have undone his seat belt but there wasnt enough left of me to care for his safety all i could think was that it brought him closer to me and i wanted him closer anita jasons voice anita what the hell is happening my skin is crawling with whatever it is it feels like the ardeur but its not i never took my gaze from nathaniels face jasons voice was like a buzzing insect noise something i heard but didnt really listen to i lifted nathaniels hand from my shoulder and pulled it gently against my lips his hand cupped the lower part of my face my breath was warm against him and the heat of it brought the scent of him to me his hands smelled not only of warmth and blood but of everything hed touched that day faint traces that soap could not erase completely his hands smelled of life and i wanted it anita talk to me jason said whats happening caleb asked why is it hard to breathe in the car power jason said i dont know what kind yet i pulled nathaniels hand past my face until my lips glided over his wrist and there there just under the skin was a new warmth i flicked my tongue across the skin of his wrist and he shuddered anita jason said i could hear him but it was utterly unimportant the only thing that was important was the warmth of skin and that faint pulse just below i opened my mouth wide lips pulled back to taste that pulse the jeep swerved violently throwing nathaniel backwards and to one side tearing his hand from me he landed in calebs lap i looked at jason then really looked at him in the back of my mind i knew it was jason but in the front of my mind all i could really see was the pulse in the side of his neck it beat against his skin like a trapped thing i knew i could free it make it rush red and hot into my mouth i unbuckled my seat belt that froze me for a second because i was fanatic about seat belt safety my mother would be alive today if shed used hers i never rode in a moving car without one never so deep rooted was that fear it pushed belle back pushed back the blood lust shed raised in me i found my voice hoarse and strange but mine i thought it was the ardeur she raised but its not blood lust jason said i nodded my hands still frozen on the unbuckled seat belt blood lust feels like the ardeur but not sometimes you dont know which lust it is until you find out if hes going for your neck or your groin i blinked at jason what did you just say i never heard the answer if there was one belle roared back through me and i was suddenly more concerned with the beating of his pulse in his neck than the fact that his mouth was moving i heard no sound except that overwhelming thunder of my own blood my own heart my own throbbing pulsing body i was sliding over the front seat towards him and hadnt remembered moving or wanting to he hit the wheel again sending me back across the car against the far door the moment my back hit the door i could hear the angry honking of horns as the jeep slid through traffic sideways then it evened out going straight again jason was giving me wide eyes i cant drive with you feeding on me my voice was thick i dont think i care i sat up my hands on the seat to keep him from throwing me against the door again nathaniel caleb keep her away from me until i can find a safe place to pull over i was awkwardly straddling the gearshift when nathaniel put his arm in front of my face he didnt try and touch me but held his wrist close enough for me to smell the warmth of his skin then he slowly drew his arm back into the backseat and i followed sliding between the seats following the pull of his flesh like there was a line tied from him to me i spilled into the backseat nathaniel was sitting on his side of the seat now i knelt over his body straddling him i could feel him stretched tight inside his shorts even through my jeans but today that wasnt nearly as important as the smooth line of his throat hed braided his hair before we left so that his neck was bare the jeep swerved again and i fell onto the floorboard at calebs feet wed been lucky so far to avoid an accident or the concrete median on the road our luck would run out and i wasnt sure i cared if you cant take sex from nathaniel yet i dont think you should take blood hes still weak i heard jasons voice as though it were coming from far away i stared up at what sat above me his jeanclad legs brushing my body for sex caleb wasnt desirable but for blood i came to my knees between his legs and began to pull myself up calebs body fingers digging into the jeans feeling the flesh underneath my hands slid under his untucked buttonup shirt with its loud comic book pictures his skin was so warm my fingers slid upward touching the ring in his belly button i hesitated there tracing the edge of the metal ring pulling on it gently feeling the skin stretch until he made a small sound of protest i stared up into his face and whatever he saw there widened his eyes made his lips part in a small ooh of surprise i traced my fingers up his stomach his chest my arms lost under the oversized shirt until when my hands slid over his shoulders the shirt began to raise exposing his stomach the sight of that bare skin began to raise other hungers for flesh instead of merely blood but belle roared down that metaphysical leash shed attached to me and the beast receded before it had truly risen she wanted me to want what she wanted and in that moment i knew that though she had animals to call she did not share their beast their craving of flesh the thought was too rational and the leash loosened and i could think for myself why do you care if i take blood or flesh you can feed off both energies youve been feeding on richard all day i asked perhaps i am tired of flesh i had a flash as if i read her thought you couldnt make richard feed he fought you all day let you suck him dry but you couldnt make him attack anyone else her anger was like hot metal shoved against my skin it bowed my back brought a gasp from my throat caleb grabbed my arms or i would have collapsed belles voice purred through my head the loup was surprisingly strong but he is not my animal to call nor is he attracted to the dead but you are ma petite oh yes you are her power poured over me but it wasnt the heat of blood lust it was cold the coldness of the grave the moment the energy touched me my own power flared to life that part of me that raised the dead it flared inside me as if belles cold energy was some sort of fuel for my own cool fire you are mine ma petite mine in ways that the loup cannot imagine his connection to the dead is accidental yours was fated from the moment you were born her power was the power of the grave of death itself but so was mine she meant to prove a point but shed wakened my necromancy and she was just another kind of dead i knew how to handle the dead i drew a breath drawing in my own magic getting ready to cast her out id done it before but her chill changed to heat before i could finish that breath the blood lust washed my magic away drowned it in a flood of need her voice dripped across my skin like warm honey as if the darkpower of her eyes had melted across my skin the power of the grave is yours to control but not the power of desire desire in all its forms is mine to control if id had air to breathe i would have screamed but there was no air and no sight for a swimming dizzying moment but i was drowning in sounds blood rushing through my body my heart wet and thudding my pulse like a second heartbeat in a thousand places under my skin i could hear and i could feel i could feel calebs chest under my hands feel the roughness of the hair that traced the edge of his nipples and finally the nipples themselves growing hard and firm under my fingers the tiny metal barbells that pierced them were a distraction i wanted to roll his nipples between my fingertips and the metal interfered like a toothpick in your sandwich they got in the way i had a moment where belle thought about ripping them out and that was so not my thought that it helped me crawl back into my own head at least a little when my vision cleared calebs eyes were unfocused his lips halfparted through me it was almost as if belle herself touched him and her touch spread lust lust of every kind i was in my own head my own skin but belles hunger was inside me too and i couldnt push it out she was right the blood hunger was not death i tore my arms through calebs shirt popping the buttons loose baring his upper body when i channeled jeanclaudes blood lust i was always attracted to neck wrist bend of the arm sometimes the inside of the groin all nice major arteries or veins but belle didnt look high or low she gazed at calebs chest like it was a prime piece of steak cooked just right my own logic tried to argue there were other places where there was more blood much closer to the surface the sheer surprise of not going for someplace more usual helped me push her back calebs voice came heavy why did you stop i dont think its sex shes wanting nathaniel said voice quiet his voice turned my gaze to him if what was driving me had been the ardeur it might have been enough to have me crawl to him but nathaniel was right this wasnt about sex this was about food and nathaniel wasnt food did that mean that caleb was food not a pretty thought what do you mean caleb asked i gazed up at calebs bare chest that young halffinished face he looked so puzzled i said it out loud though i wasnt talking to anyone in the car he doesnt understand belles whisper he will soon enough it looks like its your turn to take one for the team jasons voice from the front what youre going to get munched on jason said the combination of my own moral dilemma with the fact that belle had picked an odd spot for taking blood one that just didnt make sense to me was helping me swim to the surface i knelt back in the floorboard pulling a little free of calebs body no i said out loud and none of the men answered me as if theyd all caught up to the fact that i wasnt really talking to any of them belles voice in my head i have been gentle until now ma petite i am not your ma petite so stop fucking calling me that if you will not take kindness from me then i will cease to offer it if this is your idea of kindness then id hate to see i never finished the thought because belle showed me that indeed she had been kind she didnt roll over me she crashed into me in a mindnumbing breathstealing heartstopping swat of power for an instant or for an eternity i hung suspended the jeep was gone caleb was gone i couldnt see or feel or be it was neither light nor dark nor up nor down id had neardeath experiences id fainted before passed out but that moment when belles power fell through me that was the closest to true nothingness that id ever experienced into that nothingness that void belles voice fell jeanclaude has begun the dance but he has left it unfinished between you the wolf and himself he has allowed sentiment to cloud his judgment it makes me question how well i taught him i tried to speak but couldnt remember where my mouth was or how to draw a breath i couldnt remember how to answer her i discovered this with the wolf but could not mend it for he is not my animal to call i do not understand dogs and a wolf is very much a dog her voice whispered through me low and lower trembling through my body but for her voice to dance through my body i had to have a body for her to use i fell back into my body as if falling from a great height i was left gasping on the floorboards eyes staring up at calebs startled face and nathaniels worried one belles voice glided through my body like a knowledgeable hand i suddenly knew who had trained jeanclaude to use his voice as a tool of seduction but you ma petite i understand you i drew a deep quaking breath and it hurt all the way to my chest as if id gone a long time without breathing my voice came hoarse what are you talking about the fourth mark ma petite without the fourth mark you are not truly jeanclaudes it is like the difference between engagement and marriage one is permanent the other not necessarily so i understood what she meant a second before i saw two dancing honeycolored flames appear in the air over me i knew it was the second mark because id had the second mark three times before twice from jeanclaude and once from a vampire id killed id never been able to protect myself from it before i knew from experience that nothing physical would save me it wasnt something you could hit or shoot i hated things you couldnt hit or shoot but i had other skills now that werent exactly physical i reached down that long metaphysical cord to jeanclaude belles voice floated over me she was delaying her moment drawing out her pleasure and my fear jeanclaude is hours dead he cannot help you the dark flames of her eyes began to descend like some evil angel coming to eat my soul i did the only thing i could think to do i reached down the other half of our metaphysical cord i reached out to a place that hadnt helped me for months i reached out to richard i had an image of richard in the hot bath water cradled in jamils arms richard looked up as if he could see me he whispered my name but either he was too weak to push me away or he didnt try for a moment it was as if it was meant to be then i was yanked back shoved into my own head my own body again richard hadnt cast me out this time dark honey flames hovered over my face and there was a vague outline a ghost of long dark hair the mist of a face caleb was yelling whats in the car with us i cant see anything but i can feel it what the fuck is it nathaniels voice came hushed and strangely loud belle morte i had no time to look up to see the others because those phantom lips were speaking i will not allow you to gain strength from your wolf i have given you the first mark and you did not even know it i will give you the second mark here and now and tonight with musette as my proxy i will give you the third when jeanclaude and i are equal within you three for three then you will come to me ma petite you will travel the world if i ask it do anything simply to taste my sweet blood that phantom mouth lowered towards mine i knew somehow that if she laid a ghostly kiss on me that i would be hers i did what i always did i tried to hit at that face and there was nothing to touch i screamed wordlessly and sent out a metaphysical cry help me suddenly i could smell forest trees freshturned earth wet leaves underfoot and the sweet musk of wolf belle could stop me from reaching out to richard but she couldnt keep him from reaching out to me richards power rose like a sweetscented cloud above me pushing back those glowing eyes that phantom mouth she laughed and it slid over my body made me shudder my breath catch in my throat it felt so good so good even while my head screamed that it was bad did you hear someone laugh caleb asked it jason said no nathaniel said yes belle whispered along my skin and even richards power breathing against my body couldnt keep her voice out with the touch of your wolfs flesh you might keep me at bay but not from a distance the closer the flesh the closer the ties and the more powerful you are already mine ma petite you cannot win free of me those eyes began to float lower again richards power rose above me like a soft shield belles power floated on the surface of that energy like a leaf on a pond then she began to push into it through it help me i screamed it out loud to everyone anyone and no one i felt nathaniels hand on mine and that phantom kiss did hesitate did turn and look at nathaniel i felt her call him like a deep thrumming down my bones leopard had been her first animal to call if she owned me shed own my pard nathaniel reached out his free hand as if he could see her no i jerked free of him and the moment i broke physical contact it was as if nathaniel was less real to her she turned those darkhoney eyes back to me i will have them all ma petite eventually no i said it but my voice was soft because i believed she was right you will give them to me all of them fear poured through me as if id been plunged into ice water the thought of what belle would do to my pard my friends no i could not let this happen fuck you fuck you belle and the horse you rode in on my anger my fear seemed to feed richards power the sweet nosewrinkling musk of wolf was so thick it was like being wrapped in invisible fur the jeep slewed to one side the angry honking of horns and squealing brakes followed it jason had given up on finding a safe place and just stopped against the concrete median nathaniel and caleb were thrown across the seat and into the passenger side doors i didnt have time to worry about the fact that no one seemed to be wearing their damn seat belts belles eyes pushed through richards power it wasnt effortless he made her work for every inch but those burning eyes that ghostly outline got closer closer until i held my breath as if afraid if i breathed in too hard it would bring her against my mouth i caught movement from the corner of my eye jason was between the seats hed stopped the jeep thrown off his seat belt he shoved his hand through the ghost thing above me as if he couldnt see it he grabbed my shoulder and the moment he touched me richards beast welled up inside me id always thought it was my beast that moved through me but this whatever this was was richard not me his wolf poured into me like scalding water rushing into a cup filling me to the brim emptying my skin of leopard or death until my spine bowed my hands flailed my mouth opened in a soundless scream i could feel fur rubbing inside my body strong nails digging the wolf was struggling to find some way out of my body belle hissed at me like some great ghostly cat the eyes retreated hovering in the air near the jeep roof as jason pulled me into the front seat and cradled me against his body his closeness seemed to quiet the wolf so that i felt it sit panting eagereyed staring up at the shape by the ceiling with hungry arrogant eyes jasons eyes were his wolfs eyes and today they seemed perfect for his face but it was richards power the power of the thronnos rokke clan that wrapped around both of us i had never felt richards beast so thick inside me it was as if i was a purse a bag holding his beast feeling it pace inside me as if my flesh were a cage it could not escape from belles voice floated down upon us and this time it stung hot with her anger you can ride all day in the arms of your wolf but there is still the banquet tonight musette will be there and through her ma petite i will be there my voice came out with a low edge of growl i am not your ma petite you will be she said and the eyes slowly faded until only the lingering scent of roses remained to remind me that wed won this round but there would be others jeanclaudes memories knew belle too well to think otherwise she would never give up not once she decided to own something or someone belle morte had decided that i would be hers jeanclaude had never known her to change her mind about something like that that was so unfair wasnt it a ladys prerogative to change her mind of course belle wasnt exactly a lady she was a twothousandyearold vampire and they werent known for changing their minds their habits or their goals the last time a master vamp had come to town and tried to steal me from jeanclaude id ended up in a coma for a week richard had gotten his throat torn out and jeanclaude had nearly died for real vampires were always either trying to kill me or own me god i hated being popular nathaniel had gotten one of the extra crosses out of the glove compartment i always carried spare crosses just like spare ammo when you hunt vampires running out of either one is really bad it was sheer stupidity on my part to have put crosses around the circus of the damned but not on me some days im just slow i was back in the front seat but i was shaking no that didnt quite cover it there was a fine tremble in my hands small muscles in my body kept twitching at odd moments i was cold and it was one of those glorious end of summer days sunwarmed sparkling bright and soft at the same time we drove through a wash of blue sky and sunshine and i was colda cold that no amount of blankets was really going to help nathaniel was curled over my lower body like a living blanket wedged between my legs and the floorboard id bitched about how dangerous it was but i hadnt complained too much i didnt have any real blankets in the car i was spending so much time in shock lately id have to remedy that the trees along had given way to houses and an occasional old school being rehabbed into apartments churches buildings of no discernible use but old tired ok maybe that last was just me i stroked my hand over nathaniels head over and over on the warm silk of his hair his head in my lap his arms wrapped around my waist his body wedged between my legs sometimes nathaniel made me think about sex but sometimes like now it was just comfort just closeness you cant have that with most people because theyre busy thinking about sex i think thats why dogs are so damn popular you can cuddle a dog as much as you like and the dog never thinks about sex or pushing your social boundaries in any way unless you happen to be eating dogs will invade your social boundaries for table scraps unless trained to do otherwise but hey its a dog not a person in a fur suit right now what i needed was a pet not a person nathaniel could be both an uncomfortable but truthful fact jason drove caleb had the backseat to himself no one spoke i dont think anyone knew what to say i wanted jeanclaude awake i wanted to tell him what belle had done i wanted him to tell me there was a way to keep her from doing anything else short of giving me the fourth mark the fourth mark would make me ageless and immortal as long as jeanclaude didnt die theoretically he could live forever and with the fourth mark so could i so why had i refused it so far one it scared me i wasnt sure as a christian how i felt about living forever i mean what happened to heaven and god and the judgment thing theologically what would it mean on a more mundane level how much closer would it bind me to jeanclaude he could already invade my dreams what would it mean if i took that last step or was refusing the fourth mark just another way to not give myself completely to anyone maybe but if the only way to keep belle from taking me was to let jeanclaude have me i knew which choice i was making i wondered if i called my priest now could he get back to me on the theological implications of the fourth mark before full dark tonight father mike had answered questions equally as weird for me over the years anita jason said and his voice held a note of anxiety i glanced at him and realized hed probably been trying to get my attention for a while sorry thinking too hard i think were being followed that raised my eyebrows what do you mean when i nearly caused the fourcar pileup so i could touch you i caught a glimpse of a car in the rearview it was close like tailgating close it was one of the cars that nearly hit us when i slammed on the brakes so were in heavy traffic a lot of people tailgate yeah but everyone else that was close to us when i stopped got away from us as fast as they could this car is still behind us i glanced in the side mirror and saw a dark blue jeep are you sure its the same car i didnt get a number but its the same make same color and there are two men in it one darkhaired one blond with glasses i studied the jeep that seemed to be following our jeep two men one dark one light it could have been a coincidence of course maybe it wasnt lets go on the theory that it is following us i said what jason said i lose them no i said cut across traffic and take the first exit as long as it doesnt take us to the circus i dont want to lead them to jeanclaude almost every monster in st louis knows that the master of the citys lair is under the circus of the damned jason said but he changed lanes moving us a little closer to the exit row but the guys behind us dont know that thats where were headed he shrugged and moved over two more lanes setting up for the exit the blue jeep waited until we were actually exiting with two cars between us before it crossed over if we hadnt been watching for it or there had been a taller car between our jeep and theirs i wouldnt have seen them exit but i was and there wasnt and i did shit i said but i was feeling warmer nothing like action to ground and center a person who are these guys jason asked out loud what i was wondering caleb glanced behind why would someone be following us reporters jason made the word a question i dont think so i said id lost sight of everything but the top of the jeep floating above the car roofs behind us which way do i turn hed come to the bottom of the exit ramp i shook my head i dont know dealers choice who were they why follow us usually when people start following me i know that im into something today i had no clue neither of the current cases that i was helping rpit with should have had people following me i wished they were reporters but the situation didnt have that feel to it jason turned right one car turned left one turned right and the jeep pulled in behind it there were little flags on the street signs italian flags with the words the hill on them people on the hill always let you know you were there and they loved their italian heritage even the fire hydrants were painted green red and white like the flags nathaniel raised his head off my thigh enough to say is it belle what i asked vision still glued to the side mirror are they daytime help for belle he asked in his quiet voice i thought about that id never run into a vamp that had more than one human servant but id run into several that had more than one renfield renfield is what most american vamps called humans that served them not through mystical connections but because they acted as blood donors and wanted to be vampires themselves back when i hunted vampires and didnt sleep with them id called all humans associated with vamps human servants now i knew better they could be renfields i guess whats a renfield caleb asked he was turned in the seat looking directly back at the car between us and the blue jeep turn around caleb when that car turns off i dont want the jeep to know weve noticed them he turned around immediately without arguing which was unusual for caleb i didnt approve of threatening people to gain their obedience but there were some that nothing else seemed to work with maybe he was one of them i explained what a renfield was like the guy in dracula who ate insects caleb said exactly i said cool he said and seemed to mean it id once asked jeanclaude what they called renfields before the release of the book dracula in jeanclaude had said slaves hed probably been kidding but id never had the heart to ask again the car behind us pulled into one of the narrow driveways the blue jeep was suddenly revealed i forced myself to not look directly at it and only use the side mirror but it was hard i wanted to turn around and stare knowing that i shouldnt made it all the more tempting there was nothing ominous about the jeep or even the two men visible in it they both had short hair clean well groomed the jeep was even shiny and clean the only thing ominous was the fact that they were still behind us then it turned into a narrow driveway just like that not a threat shit i said ditto jason said but i saw his shoulder sag as if tension drained away with that one word are we becoming too paranoid i asked maybe jason said but he was still spending almost as much time staring back in the rearview mirror as straight ahead as if he couldnt quite believe it neither could i so i didnt tell him to watch the road he was watching forward okay and i too was expecting the blue jeep to pull out and start after us again just a ruse guys not really harmless after all but it didnt happen we drove down the long carcrowded street until the jeeps driveway was hidden by trees and parked cars looks like it was just driving our way jason said looks like i said nathaniel rubbed his face against my leg you still smell scared like you dont believe it i dont believe it i said why not caleb asked leaning in between the seats from the backseat i finally turned around in the seat but i wasnt looking at caleb i was staring past him at the empty street experience i said i smelled roses and a second later the cross around my neck began to glow softly jesus jason whispered my heart was thumping painfully in my chest but my voice came solid she cant roll me while im wearing a cross you sure of that caleb asked it as he moved back away from me into the far reaches of the seat yeah i said im sure of that why he asked eyes wide i blinked at him as the soft white luminosity grew brighter in the tree shadows almost invisible in full sunlight over and over again because i believe i said voice soft as the glow around my neck and as sure id seen crosses burst into a whitehot light so bright it was blinding but that was when id been facetoface with a vamp that meant me harm belle was far away and the glow showed that i kept waiting for the scent of roses to grow stronger again but it never did it stayed faint definitely there but didnt grow on the air i waited for belles voice in my head but it didnt come every time she had spoken directly in my mind the smell of roses had been thick the sweet perfume stayed faint and belles voice was gone from me i squeezed the cross with my hand feeling the heat the power of it skin prickling up my arm thrumming like a continuous heartbeat against my hand caleb asked how could i believe what i always wanted to ask is how can you not believe i felt belles anger like warmth on the air power filled the jeep in a neckruffling breathstealing tide so much effort and all she could send was an image of herself sitting in front of her dressing table her long black hair was unbound like a cloak around a dressing gown of gold and black she watched herself in the mirror with eyes full of honeyfire like the eyes of the blind empty except for the color of her power i whispered out loud you cannot touch me not now she looked into the mirror as if i were standing behind her and she could see me rage changed her beauty into something frightening a mere mask of pale beauty that looked as false as any halloween mask then she turned and looked past me beyond me and the look of fear on her face was so real so unexpected that i turned too and i saw something darkness darkness like a wave rising up up over me over us like a liquid mountain towering to the impossibly tall sky the room that belle had constructed of dreams and power collapsed shredded like the dream it was and what ate at the corners of that bright candlelit room was darkness darkness absolute darkness so black that it held shines of other colors like an oil slick or a trick of the eye as if this blackness was a darkness made up of every color that had ever existed every sight that had ever been seen every sigh every scream since time began i had heard the term primordialdarkness but until this moment i had never understood what it meant now i understood i truly understood and i despaired i stared up up at an ocean of darkness that rose above me as if the earth and sky had never existed this was darkness before the light before the word of god it was like a breath of an older creation but if this was creation it was nothing i could understand nothing i wanted to understand belle screamed first i think i was too awestruck to scream or even to be afraid i looked into the primordial abyss the first darkness and knew despair but not fear my mind kept trying to find words to describe what it was it did loom over me like a mountain because it had weight and that claustrophobic feel of a mountain poised to come crashing down but it was not a mountain it was more like an ocean if an ocean could have risen up taller than the tallest mountain and stood before you waiting defying gravity and every other known law of physics like with an ocean i knewcould sensethat i only saw that wide glimpse from shore that i could only begin to guess at the depth and width the unthinkable fathoms of darkness that lay before me did strange creatures swim inside it were there things within the dark that only nightmares or dreams could reveal i watched the flickering liquid dark and felt the numbness of despair begin to wear away it was as if the despair had been a shield to protect me to numb me so that my mind wouldnt break for a few moments i had been intellect thinking what is it how can i make sense of it the numbness began to recede as if that huge blackness sucked it away fed on it i was left standing before her her trembling shaking my skin running cold and i felt that darkness sucking at me feeding off my warmth in that moment i knew what i faced it was a vampire maybe the very first vampire something so ancient that to think of human bodies or flesh to contain this darkness was laughable she was the primordial dark made real she was why humans feared the dark just the darkness not what lies in the dark not what hides there but why we fear the darkness itself there was a time when she walked among us fed on us and when darkness falls somewhere in the back of our skulls we remember the hungry dark that shining ocean of blackness reached out towards me and i knew that if it touched me i would die i couldnt turn away couldnt run because you cant run from the dark not really the light does not last that last thought wasnt mine wasnt belles i stared up at the darkness as it began to bend over me and knew it lied its the dark that doesnt last dawn comes and slays the darkness not the other way around if i could have found enough air i would have screamed but i was left with only a whisper the darkness bent towards me and i couldnt shoot it or hit it and i didnt have enough personal psychic power to keep her at bay i did the only thing i could think of i prayed i whispered hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee the darkness hesitated blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb the faintest of shivers ran through the liquid dark holy mary mother of god pray for us there was suddenly light in the darkness my cross was around my neck in the dreamscape the metal shone like a captive star shining and white and unlike in real life i could see beyond the brilliance of it i watched that pure white light chase back the dark i was suddenly aware of the car seat the seat belt across my chest nathaniels body wrapped around my legs the cross around my neck was glowing hot white even in sunlight so that i had to look away from it and still the white white light blurred my vision the cross wouldnt have still been burning if the danger had past i waited for the mother of all darkness to make her next move the air in the jeep was suddenly soft sweet like the perfect summer night when you can smell every blade of grass every leaf every flower like a scented blanket that wraps you in air softer than cashmere lighter than silk a sweet blanket of air my throat suddenly felt cooler as if id taken a sip of cold water i could feel it coating my throat and there was a faint undertaste like jasmine nathaniel buried his face in my lap to protect his eyes from the light it was like wearing a white sun around my neck shit jason said im having trouble seeing the road can you tone it down the world was full of white halos and i didnt dare turn my head to look at him the scent of night was all i could smell as if everything else had vanished i could almost redrink the cool perfumed water that coated my throat so real so overwhelmingly real i managed to whisper no i kept waiting for words in my head but there was nothing but silence and the smell of a summer night the taste of cool water and the growing sense that something large was drawing nearer it was like standing on the train tracks when you feel that first vibration down the metal lines and you know you should get off but you cant see anything as far as you can look the tracks are clear theres only that metallic vibration like a pulse beat against your feet to let you know that several tons of steel are hurtling towards you people die every year on train tracks and often their dying words are i didnt see the train ive always thought that trains must be magical that way or otherwise people would see them and get the fuck off the tracks i could feel the vibration of her rushing towards me and i would gladly have gotten off the tracks but the tracks were inside my head nailed across my body and i couldnt figure out how to run from that something rubbed against my skin like some large animal pressing its body along the length of mine i felt nathaniel draw back but i couldnt see him through the white light his voice came breathless frightened what is that i opened my mouth not even sure what id say when that roll of invisible animal hit my chest and the cross the cross flared so bright that most of us screamed cried out jason had to hit the brakes and stop the jeep in the middle of the street blinded by the light unable to see to drive i think the light began to dim for a second i wondered if the brilliance had fried my retinas then my vision began to clear through a veil of spots i could still feel it her pressing against me pinning me to the seat pressing over the cross as if she were eating the light nathaniel stared up at me his lavender eyes gone leopard a deep deep gray that had a hint of blue in the sunlight shes a shifter he whispered and i knew why shapeshifters could not be vampires or vice versa the lycanthropy virus seemed to be proof against whatever made you a vampire you could not be both it was a rule but whatever pressed against me now was animal not human i couldnt get a sense of what kind of animal but animal it was how the mother of all darkness happened to be both a vampire and a shapeshifter at the same time was a problem for another day right then i didnt care what she was i just wanted her to leave me the fuck alone the cross was still glowing but only the metal itself as if it were hollow and candles burned inside it the light was white and flickering now id never seen a cross look so much like fire before but it was a cold fire the shape pushed and rolled like it was trying to climb inside me but the cross kept glowing acting as a metaphysical shield to keep her out of me what can we do to help jason asked the jeep was still stopped in the middle of the street a car trapped behind us was honking its horn there were cars parked on both sides of the residential street leaving the car with no way to get past us the neighborhood was nothing but small neat houses none with driveways jason hit the blinkers and the car began to back away trying to turn around i was almost afraid to open my links to richard and jeanclaude what if the primordial dark could spill down the ties and take them too jeanclaude had no faith to fall back on richard did but whether he was actually wearing a cross or not was debatable it had been a long time since id seen richard wear a cross while i was still considering jason grabbed my hand the scent of night didnt fade it was added to like a layer of color painted over another the clean musk of wolves filled the night the cool water that seemed to have passed down my throat now tasted more of loam and forest than perfume i had an image in my mind of a huge animal head with long teeth like the largest fangs id ever seen the fur on the head was gold and tawny and reddish shaded rather than striped more lion than tiger eyes like golden fire stared into mine and that huge mouth opened wide and screamed its frustration in a sound like a panthers scream but octaves lower pioneers were always mistaking panther screams for a womans cries no one would have mistaken this for a womana man maybe a man being tortured and screaming for his soul i screamed back as if that head were truly right in front of me and not thousands of miles across the world my scream was echoed by two others nathaniel snarled up at me from the floorboard his mouth showing teeth that were fast becoming fangs caleb had slid in between the seats and his eyes were yellow cat eyes he started to rub his cheek against my shoulder as if he was going to scent mark me then stopped snarling as if hed touched that other phantom cat jason didnt scream he growled that low furstandingonend sound that has nothing to do with hunting and everything to do with fighting not for food but for survival it was a sound for guarding territory chasing out interlopers getting rid of troublemakers the sound that says get out or die she screamed back a sound that should have frozen the blood in my veins and reminded me that my ancestors had huddled around their small fires and watched in terror for the shine of eyes outside that flame but i wasnt thinking like a person i wasnt even sure thinking was the word for what was moving through my mind it was more like i was in the moment completely utterly i could feel the leather seat cupping my body nathaniel pressed against my legs his hands tracing higher caleb at my shoulder his cheek against my face his jaw straining as he snarled jasons hand on my arm like it had taken root become a part of me i could smell calebs skin the soap hed used that morning and the fear like something bitter under that clean skin nathaniel moved up on his knees higher so that his face was superimposed behind the sabertooths head for a moment but i could smell the vanilla scent of his hair and there was nothing from the phantom cat jason moved in closer putting his face close to mine sniffing the air i smelled soap shampoo and the smell of jason a scent that had begun to mean home to me the way the vanilla scent of nathaniels hair or jeanclaudes expensive cologne or once the warm bend of richards neck affected me i didnt mean in a sexual way but the way fresh baked bread or your mothers favorite cookies make you feel safe and smell like home i turned my head to caleb so that my nose touched his skin and under the fear the soap the soft skin he smelled of leopard faint in his human form but there a nosewrinkling skinprickling smell i turned to the weight pressing against the stillglowing cross i looked into those yellow eyes gazed upon those fangs that were like nothing that walked the earth today and it had no scent jason was snuffling the air in front of me his pale wolf eyes met mine and i knew that hed figured it out too as a vampire she smelled of cool evenings and sweet water vaguely like jasmine as a wereanimal she had no scent because she wasnt here it was a sending a psychic sending it had power but it wasnt real not really real not physical no matter how much power you put into it a psychic sending has limits to what it can do physically it can frighten you into running into traffic but it cant push you it can try to trick you into doing things but it cannot hurt you without a physical agent when she was a vampire the cross and my faith kept her at bay as a wereanimal she wasnt real nathaniel had literally crawled up through the image i could still see hovering over my chest he was the one who said it out loud it has no scent its not real i said calebs voice came with an edge of growl so deep that it was almost painful to hear i feel it some great cat like pard but not but do you smell anything jason asked caleb sniffed along my body any other time i would have accused him of getting too close to my breasts but not now he was as serious as id ever seen him as he sniffed along my chest pushed his face almost into that evil face he stopped staring into those yellow eyes from inches away he hissed like any startled cat i cant smell it but i see it seeing isnt always believing i said what is it he asked a psychic projection a sending the vampire couldnt get past the cross so it tried another form but the kittycat doesnt travel as well as the whatever the hell she is i looked into those yellow eyes and watched that massive mouth roar up at me you have no scent you arent real only a bad dream and dreams have no power unless you give it to them i give you nothing go back to where you came from go back to the dark i had a sudden image of a dark dark room not pitch black but as if the only light were reflected from somewhere else there was a bed with a black silk cover and a figure lying under that cover the room was oddly shaped not square not circular almost hexagonal there were windows but i knew somehow that they did not look out upon the world windows to gaze down upon the darkness that never lifted never changed i was drawn towards the bed drawn the way youre drawn in nightmares i didnt want to look but i had to look didnt want to see and had to see i reached out towards that shining black silk i could tell it was silk because of the way it reflected the light from down below far down below outside the windows the light flickered and i knew it was firelight nothing electric had ever touched the darkness of this place my fingertips brushed the silk and the body under the sheet moved in its sleep moved the way someone will when they dream but are not yet awake i knew in that instant that i was a dream to her too and i couldnt truly be standing in her inner sanctum that no matter how real or exact it was i could not send myself to her and pull the sheet away dreams could not do that but i also knew in that same moment that all she had done to me today had been done in a sleep that had lasted long and longer so long that the others sometimes thought she was dead hoped she was dead feared she was dead prayed she was dead if they had the courage of prayer left in them who do the soulless dead pray to a sigh moved through that close airless room and on that first breath of air came a whisper of sound the first sound that that room had heard in centuries me it took me a moment to realize that it was the answer to my question who do the soulless dead pray to me the whisper said the figure under the sheet shifted in its sleep again not awake not yet but she was swimming upwards filling in herself coming closer to wakefulness i jerked my hand back from that sheet i stepped back from that bed i did not want to touch her more than anything else i did not want to wake her but since i didnt know how id gotten into her room i couldnt figure out how to get out of it id never been someone elses dream before though people had accused me of being their nightmares how do you stop being in someone elses dream that whisper echoed through the room again by waking them shed answered my question again shit i was beginning to have an awful idea could the darkness become lost in sleep could the dark become lost in the dark could the mother of all nightmares be trapped in the land of dreams not trapped the whisper in the dark said then what i asked it out loud and the body under the sheet rolled all the way over feeling the silence with the hissing glide of silk over skin my throat closed around the words and i cursed myself for not thinking waiting still the air breathing around me not a voice not really i thought really hard waiting for what there was no answer from the dark room but there was a new noise someone beside me was breathing deep even breathing as if they slept though i would have sworn that the figure on the bed hadnt been breathing a second ago i did not want to be here when she sat up i so did not want to be here for that what had she been waiting for all this time this time the voice came from the bed the same voice as the wind faint long unused so hoarse and soft that i couldnt tell if it were male or female something of interest with that last i finally felt something from that body id been prepared for malice evil anger but was totally unprepared for curiosity as if she wondered what i was and she hadnt wondered about anything in a millennia or two or three i smelled wolf musky sweet pungent so real i could feel it gliding over my skin i suddenly had a cross around my neck and the white glow filled the room i think i could have seen the figure on the bed clearly by the light of the cross but either i closed my eyes without remembering or some things you shouldnt see even in dreams i woke in the jeep with nathaniel and calebs worried faces hovering over me there was a huge wolf sitting in the drivers seat its long snout snuffling against my face i reached up to touch that soft thick fur then saw the shine of liquid all over the drivers seat where jason had shapeshifted on the leather jesus mary and joseph you couldnt have shapeshifted in the back in the cargo area you had to shapeshift on the leather seats itll never come clean jason growled at me low and rumbling and i didnt have to speak wolf to know what he was saying i was being an ungrateful wretch but it was so much easier to concentrate on my ruined upholstery than to think about the fact that id been in the presence of the mother of all vampires the mother of all darkness the primordial abyss made flesh i knew through jeanclaudes memories that they called her mother gentle marmи a dozen different euphemisms to make her seem kind and well motherly but id felt her power her darkness and finally at the end an intellect as cold and empty as any evil she was curious about me the way some scientists are curious about a new species of insect find it capture it put it in a jar whether it wants to go with you or not its just an insect after all they could call her mother gentle if they wanted to but mommy dearest was a hell of a lot more accurate caleb had climbed into the back of the jeep to get the plastic id started carrying for when i transported something messier than chickens and spread it on the seat so nathaniel could drive id tried to insist on driving but jason had growled at me he had a point i wasnt feeling my steadiest nathaniel his eyes bled back to their normal lilac had told me you passed out you stopped breathing jason shook you and you did this sort of gasp nathaniel shook his head face very serious we had to keep shaking you anita you kept not breathing if theyd been human i might have argued with them that they only thought id stopped breathing but they werent human if a bunch of shapeshifters were unable to hear or see me breathe i had to believe them had mommy dearest tried to kill me or had it been accidentalor incidental she wouldnt have meant to kill me but she might have done it by accident and id touched enough of her thinking to know it wouldnt bother her she wouldnt be sorry she would feel no guilt she didnt think like a person or rather she didnt think like a nice normal civilized human she thought like a sociopathno empathy no sympathy no guilt no compassion in a strange way that must be a very peaceful existence did you need more emotions than she possessed to be lonely id think so but i really didnt know lonely was not a word i would have applied to her if you didnt understand the need for friendship or love could you be lonely i shrugged and shook my head what is it nathaniel asked if you dont feel love or friendship can you be lonely he raised eyebrows at me i dont know why do you ask weve all just brushed up against the mother of all vampires and shes more like the mother of all sociopaths human beings are rarely pure sociopaths its more like theyre missing a piece here and there true pure sociopathy is really pretty rare but mommy dearest qualifies i think it doesnt matter if shes lonely caleb said i glanced back at him his brown eyes were very large and underneath his fading tan he was pale i sniffed the air before i could think and the car was a playground of scents the sweet musk of wolf the clean vanilla of nathaniel and caleb caleb smelled young i wasnt sure how to explain it but it was as if i could smell how tender his meat would be how fresh his blood he smelled clean the scent of some lightly perfumed soap coated his skin but underneath was another scent bitter and sweet all at the same time the way blood is salty and sweet at the same time i turned as far as the seat belt would allow and said you smell good caleb all tender and scared he was the true predator not me but the look he flashed me was all preyhuge eyes face soft lips opened just a breath i watched his pulse beat against the skin of his neck i had an urge to crawl into the backseat and run my tongue over that frantic pulse set teeth into that tender flesh and set that pulse point free i had this image of calebs pulse like a piece of hard candy that would come free all in one piece and be sucked and rolled around in my mouth i knew it wasnt like that i knew that if i bit down the pulse would be destroyed that it would die in a spill of red blood but the candy imagery stayed with me and even the thought of blood spraying in my mouth didnt seem terrible i closed my eyes so i couldnt see calebs neck beating and concentrated on my own breathing but with every breath i drew in more of that bitter sweetness the taste of fear i could almost taste his flesh in my mouth whats wrong with me i asked that out loud i want to tear calebs pulse out of his throat its too early for jeanclaude to be awake besides i dont usually want blood or not only blood its close to full moon nathaniel said its one of the reasons jason lost enough control to change all over your seats i opened my eyes turned my face to look at him and away from calebs fear belle tried to get me to feed off caleb but she couldnt so why suddenly does he smell tasty nathaniel had finally found another exit back onto he eased in behind a large yellow car that needed a major paint job or maybe was in the middle of getting one because half of it was covered in gray primer i caught movement in the rearview mirror it was the blue jeep it was at the end of the narrow street with cars on either side it hadjust cleared the corner and seen us and now it was hanging back hoping i think that we hadnt seen it shit i said what nathaniel asked that damned jeep is at the end of the street nobody look back everyone stopped themselves in midmotion except for jason he hadnt even tried to look back maybe wolf necks didnt work that way or maybe he was staring at other things i realized that he was looking at caleb i looked at that huge shaggy head are you thinking about eating caleb he turned and gave me the full force of that pale green gaze people say that dogs are descended from wolves but there are moments when i doubt that there was nothing friendly or sympathetic or even remotely tame in those eyes he was thinking about food he met my gaze because he knew id caught him thinking about eating someone that was under my protection then he turned back to gaze at caleb and think of meat dogs never look at people and think food hell they dont even look at other dogs and think that wolves do the fact that there is no recorded account of a north american wolf attacking a human being for food has always amazed me you look into their eyes and you know that there is no one home that you can talk to i knew that lycanthropes want fresh meat when they first change shape new lycanthropes are deadly but jason wasnt new anymore and he could control himself i knew that but i still didnt like the way he was looking at caleb and i liked even less that he was projecting his need onto me what do you want me to do about the jeep nathaniel asked i jerked my attention back to nathaniel and away from the hunger it was an effort to think past it but if the jeep was full of bad guys then i needed to be concentrating on them not some metaphysical craving hell i dont know i dont get followed that much usually people just try and kill me i have to either pull out onto the highway or turn the other way just sitting here theyre going to know we saw them he had a point a good one highway he moved us forward angling for the ramp once were on it where are we going the circus i think do we want to lead the bad guys there nathaniel asked jason said it earlier most people know where the master of the city bunks during the day besides the wererats are still there and most of them are exmercenaries or something in that ballpark i think im going to call ahead and ask bobby lees opinion opinion about what caleb asked from the backseat his eyes were still too wide and he still smelled of fear but he wasnt looking at the wolf on the seat beside him whatever he was afraid of wasnt something that close about whether we catch them or turn around and try to follow them catch them caleb said catch them how not sure but i know that i know a lot more about catching bad guys than about following people to see where they lead me im not a detective caleb not really i can spot a clue if it bites me on the ass and give an opinion about monsterrelated crime but at heart im in a more direct line of work than detective he looked puzzled im an executioner caleb i kill things sometimes you have to track things in order to kill them nathaniel said i looked at him that serious profile his eyes searching the traffic his hands on the wheel at exactly two and ten he hadnt had his license a year yet if i hadnt insisted im not sure hed have ever had one true but i dont want to kill them i want to question them i want to know why theyre following us i dont think they are nathaniel said what i asked the blue jeep didnt follow us onto the highway knew we spotted them maybe or like everyone else knows where the master sleeps so its not hard to find his girlfriend nathaniel said voice quiet eyes on the road but he knew i hated being the masters girlfriend or at least being called that truthfully he had a point if you knew who someone was dating and where they lived eventually you could locate them again i hated being predictable jasons great shaggy head came around my seat and rubbed against my shoulder the ruff of his face tickling along my cheek i reached up and petted that great head without thinking the way i would have done if hed been a dog the moment i touched him the hunger thrilled through me from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet the hair on my body stood to attention and it felt like something was trying to crawl up the back of my skull because the nape of my neck was prickling so badly the wolf and i turned as one to stare at caleb if my eyes could have bled to wolf theyd have done it then caleb looked terrified i think if hed just stayed still wed have been okay but he didnt he unfolded his arms from his nearly bare chest and eased across the seat jason growled and i was out of my seat on the floorboards in the back before i had a chance to think unseatbelted in a speeding car bad idea i think that would have put me back in my own head space but caleb ran he spilled over the backseat and jason and i spilled after him it was like being water following the natural course we didnt pin caleb so much as kneel and sit around him caleb was pressed tight in the corner of the cargo area his hands tight against his chest he tried to take up as little space as possible i think caleb knew that touching either of us would be bad jason sat on his haunches flashing fangs and letting the trickle of growl slide out you didnt need words to know what it meant dont move dont fucking move caleb didnt move i was on my knees in front of caleb and all i could see was the pulse in his neck thudding thudding against the skin trying to break free i wanted to help it i could suddenly smell forest trees and the scent of wolf fur that wasnt jason richard breathed through my mind like a sweetscented cloud i saw him in my bathtub all those miles away an arm darker than the tan richard carried most of the year was across his chest propping him up in the water holding him jamil being a good hati making sure his ulfric didnt drown it was what jason had done for me earlier minus the sex richard was a little homophobic he didnt like men who reminded him they liked men especially if that man was himself i couldnt throw stones on that one i was pretty much the same way around women no matter how sophisticated i was supposed to be i kept forgetting that another woman could find me attractive always caught me by surprise jamils face hovered on the edge of richards but it was as if in this dream vision all that was truly clear was richard i caught glimpses of his body through the water and the faint candlelight lycanthropes sometimes had light sensitivity problems so there were no bright overheads but the candles made the water dark and hid more of richard from view than i wanted i felt like a metaphysical peeping tom but the hunger was so easily turned to a different kind of hunger it always had been richard looked up at me and the sight of his face shorn of hair caught at my throat i wanted to ask why but he spoke first it was the first time wed spoken mindtomind like this and it startled me id known jeanclaude and i could do it but not richard and me the hungers mine anita im sorry something that creature did to me stripped most of my control for a second i thought he meant the mother of all darkness then realized he meant belle i gazed down at calebs frightened eyes and my eyes were drawn again to his neck then down the line of his chest to his stomach he was breathing hard enough scared enough that there was a pulse low in his belly vibrating through that line of hair that led down into his pants the stomach was soft and tender lots of flesh there anita richard said anita hear me i had to blink the image of calebs quivering flesh away and i was suddenly seeing richards image more clearly than what actually lay in front of me what i knew that one word wasnt said out loud only in my head you can turn the hunger to sex anita i shook my head i think id rather eat caleb than fuck him youve never eaten anyone or you wouldnt say that richard said i couldnt really argue with that are you seriously saying youd be okay with me fucking caleb he hesitated the water flickering in the flame light as his body moved restlessly i caught a glimpse of knee and thigh if its a choice between eating him or screwing him yes you didnt even like sharing me with jeanclaude were not dating anita ouch sorry forgot that for a moment i said the momentary flare of pain like a halfhealed wound helped me think a little more clearly jason is in wolf form richard i dont do furry that i can do something about i saw his beast like some golden shadow leap out of him and into me it was like being on the receiving end of a metaphysical knife until that power stabbed through me and into jason and i was suddenly in the middle of all that power all that pain all that rage the beast feeds on pain and rage sort of the ultimate id i was left kneeling gasping too breathless to scream jason screamed for me and i felt his beast slide away from him no into him like stuffing something impossibly huge into a suitcase that was already full but this suitcase was jasons body and it hurt i felt the bones twist the muscles pop and reattach fuck it hurt i caught a distant thought from richard that it was hurting so much because it was forced when you fight the change it hurts more it was as if the fur was absorbed back into the pale flesh that rose through it like something caught in ice melting back to the surface jasons body melted back and the fur sank into him the longer bones the muscles it just all sank into him until he lay pale and shivering on a bed of clear liquid the fluid had soaked my jeans from the knees down jason had changed but not fed now hed been forced to change again less than a halfhour later maybe if hed been allowed to feed hed have been alright but now he lay shivering curling into a ball to hold himself and to keep in what warmth he had left and to take up as little space as possible i think jason like caleb knew touching me would be bad jason wasnt a danger to caleb anymore until he rested he wasnt a danger to anyone in fact i stared down at the curve of his butt so smooth so firm so tender i gazed on him nude and didnt think about sex at all all richard had done was give me a choice of meals i looked at richard down that vision that held him crystalline and everything else hazy all i can think about is sinking teeth into his flesh youve made him helpless and i still need to feed because you still need to feed ill find something here to eat i will feed but you dont have anything safe to hunt anita you dont want to hurt either of them i screamed loud and long letting the frustration fill the jeep pour out of my mouth scald up my throat ball my hands into fists and lash out smashing the side of the jeep i heard the metal groan and that made me blink look at what id done id dented the metal a rounded dimple the size of my fist fuck caleb made a small sound and i looked down at him and all i could see was the soft flesh of his stomach i could almost feel it under my teeth i was crouched over caleb my face sniffing along his stomach i didnt remember getting this close richard called to me anita i looked up as if he were really in front of me he pushed jamils arm away and leaned back against the side of the tub he ran his hands over his chest fingers tracing his nipples one hand trailing lower as he pushed himself out of the water it cascaded down his body in silver flame shot lines and that hand traced lower lower over his stomach down the line of hair and finally to cup himself play with himself i watched him grow larger and the hunger changed like turning a switch but the moment the hunger became sex the ardeur flared to life it came from the center of my being like a flame spreading spreading and richards hand richards body fanned the heat brought it in a roaring sheet over my skin but jeanclaude wasnt here to help us this time and richard couldnt shield today the ardeur ran down that metaphysical cord and hit richard like a truck at full speed it bowed his back convulsed his hand where it gripped his body made him fall back on the edge of the tub his legs trailing into the water i looked into those big brown eyes that face so empty without its mane of hair and watched terror fight with desire i dont think hed ever felt the full force of the ardeur before it overwhelmed him left him breathless immobile but that wouldnt last i knew it wouldnt last i told him what hed told me you can turn the ardeur to hunger but were going to have to feed on something or someone richard its too late for anything else even his voice in my head seemed strangled i feel better and worse i think i can hunt now i couldnt have moved that much before everything has its upside richard and its down i was angry with richard a fine hot rage that helped keep me treading the water of the ardeur that was trying so hard to engulf me drown me in desire but i held my anger to my chest and treaded water for all i was worth i felt his hunger change felt his belly tighten with need for flesh and blood and tearing and only distant very distant was the thrill of sex ill hunt an animal and ill be fine i think that wont help me much richard and i let the anger trail down the binding between us i am sorry anita i didnt understand i knew in that moment that i could force his hunger back into the ardeur that just as he forced jason to change form i could force richards hunger to be the form of my choosing i knew i could run magic down his skin and force him to feed the way i was going to have to feed but i didnt hed done what hed done in innocence i couldnt return the favor not deliberately go hunt your animal richard anita i am sorry youre always sorry richard now get out of my head before i do something well both regret he pulled away but it wasnt a clean break normally his shields were solid like metal doors clanging down today it was like taffy pulling apart clinging to each other huge tendrils of sticky melting candy that even when pulled apart was still two halves of a whole i wanted to pull us together to melt into the heat until we were one big hot sticky mess and today richard couldnt stop me he didnt have the control to keep me out of him jeanclaude woke i felt his eyes flash wide felt him take that first gasping breath felt life fill him he was awake jason was gazing at me with his sky blue eyes hes awake i nodded i know nathaniel spoke as if hed understood way more of the unheard conversation than he should have were almost to the circus anita how long five minutes less make it less i said the jeep leapt forward accelerating i crawled into the backseat and fastened the seat belt tight across me it wasnt to keep me safe in case we had an accident it was to remind me not to let myself loose until we got to the circus and jeanclaude i fought the ardeur on the drive to the circus i fought the ardeur when i ran through the parking lot and banged on the door i ran past bobby lees surprised face and managed to say ask nathaniel about the jeep then i was past him and running for the stairs that led down down to the underground richard was running too he was running through the trees limbs and leaves slashing at him but he was never quite there dodging moving like water made flesh flesh made speed he ran through the trees and i heard something large crashing ahead of him his head came up and the chase was on i hit jeanclaudes bedroom door as richard was catching glimpses of the deer that darted just ahead of him sprinting for its life there were other wolves in the forest most of them in true wolf form but not all i flung the door open and the guards on the door closed it firmly behind me i dont know what they sensed or what they saw and that was probably just as well there were still blue silk sheets on the bed and asher was still framed in them motionless dead only the master of the city was awake only he moved i sent a questioning thought and felt all the vampires asnooze in their coffins tucked in their beds i touched angelito for a moment and found him restless and pacing confused wondering why his mistress hadnt succeeded in her diabolical plan he looked up as if he saw me or felt something then i was back at the bathroom door richard had his deer down and struggling a hoof caught him across the stomach tore the skin but there were other wolves there now and the doe had no chance a black furred wolf tore into her throat and i felt richard riding the deer in human form holding her as the struggles grew slower spasmodic involuntary the deers fear faded like champagne opened and left to go flat the bathroom door flung open hitting the wall and i didnt remember touching it i was through the door before it slammed shut behind me and again i didnt remember touching it jeanclaude was in the black marble tub he was kneeling his long black hair clinging to his shoulders hed cleaned up feeling me coming towards him like a storm of need hed run a bath of course hed felt me like a storm of desire before it didnt always mean the storm would fall on him i could smell the fresh hot blood as richard leaned down towards the deers throat the wolf that had actually made the kill had backed off so the ulfric could feed the deers skin smelled acrid almost bitter as if the fear had bled out of the skin i did not want to be in richards head when he put his mouth to that flesh i climbed into the bathtub in my clothes the hot water soaking my jeans almost to the tops of my thighs help me it came out in a whisper that id meant to be a scream jeanclaude stood up water streaming down the perfect whiteness of his skin drawing my eyes down the length of his body finding him soft and not ready for me i screamed and richard sank teeth into skin that was covered in hair jeanclaude caught me or i would have fallen into the water i suddenly couldnt feel richard anymore it was as if a door had slammed in my face and there was a second of blessed silence a quietness that went all the way to my soul jeanclaude spoke into that silence i can shield you from our richard ma petite and he from you but i cannot shield us both from the ardeur i stared up at him where id halfswooned in his arms his hands at my back my body bowed down towards the water my legs soaked with the hot liquid i opened my mouth to say something then he was as good as his word and the ardeur came roaring back i convulsed in his arms and he nearly dropped me trailing my hair in the water pulling me upwards pressing our bodies against one another my hands my mouth my body swarmed over him traced that slick perfect skin caressed the faint tracery of whip scars on his back which were just another part of his perfection he drew back from my mouth enough to gasp ma petite i have not fed there is no blood to fill my body i gazed up at him and found his eyes as normal as they ever got midnight blue lashed with black lace but there was no power in them usually by the time weve gotten this much foreplay in his eyes had bled to pure pupilless blue i had to swim up through the ardeur through the need to finally understand what he meant i pushed my hair to one side and said feed feed then fuck me i cannot roll your mind ma petite it will only be pain i shook my head eyes closed my hands tracing over the skin of his shoulders and arms please jeanclaude please feed feed on me if you were in your right mind you would not offer this i pulled the red tshirt out of my pants but had trouble pushing the straps of my shoulder holster down as if i couldnt remember how i screamed my frustration wordless maybe because of that or because jeanclaude was trying to fight off too many things at once i suddenly felt richard feeding hot flesh going in great gulps down his throat i choked stumbled collapsed against the edge of the tub letting the hot water come up to my waist i was going to be sick jeanclaude touched my back and i couldnt sense richard anymore i cannot shield us from our wolf fight both your ardeur and mine and fight my own bloodlust it is too much i sat on the edge of the tub hands flat trying to keep myself steady on the marble then dont fight it all pick your battles what battle should i choose he asked voice soft the ardeur rose like a gentle wave chasing back the nausea cleansing me of the sensation of meat and flesh going down my throat i hadnt realized the ardeur had any gentleness to it as if hed read my thoughts jeanclaude said if you do not struggle against the ardeur it is not so terrible like the beast if you accept it it doesnt beat the hell out of you he gave a small smile oui ma petite the ardeur drew me to my feet and i wasnt shaky anymore i was steady in my desire i moved through the hot thighdeep water my jeans clinging to me like a second skin my jogging shoes sliding through the thickness of the water i stood touching him only with my gaze the strength of his thighs the loose swelling of his groin skin there slightly darker in color than the rest of him the line of black hair that traced upward around his belly button to the smooth lines of his chest with the pale circles of his nipples and the flat whiteness of the crossshaped burn scar i came to the grace of his shoulders the line of his neck and finally the face i was never sure how to look upon his face and not be overwhelmed if it had just been the dark glory of his hair i could have borne it but his eyes his eyes the darkest blue they could be and not be black they were the richest blue id ever seen his eyelashes were so thick they were like black lace the bones in his face were delicate small and finely chiseled as if whoever had made him had paid attention to every curve of his cheek every turn of his chin every sweep of brow and finally the mouth his mouth was simply beautiful so red against the whiteness of his skin i touched his face traced the edge of it from temple to chin and my fingers clung to the beads of water on his skin sticking so that touching him wasnt smooth or easy the ardeur was still inside me like a great warm weight but id welcomed it this time welcomed it chasing back richards beast and i could think though only about the man in front of me i stared up into that face and said what i was thinking was this the face that launched a thousand ships i slipped my hand behind his neck and began gently to bring him closer as if for a kiss and burnt the topless towers of ilium i turned my face and swept my hair aside exposing my neck sweet helen make me immortal with a kiss he spoke why this is hell nor am i out of it thinkest thou that i who saw the face of god and tasted the eternal joys of heaven am not tormented with ten thousand hells in being deprived of everlasting bliss the quote made me turn and look at him thats from dr faustus too isnt it oui i only know the one quote i said let me give you another i kissed thee ere i killed thee no way but this killing myself to die upon a kiss thats not marlowe i said one of his contemporaries jeanclaude said shakespeare i said you surprise me ma petite you gave me too big a clue i said marlowe and shakespeare are about the only contemporaries that people still quote i frowned up at him why are you fighting me on this today with the ardeur riding you you say feed when your mind has cleared you will call foul and i will be punished by your regret a look of such longing and frustration crossed his face i want more than almost anything to share blood with you ma petite but if i take it now when you are intoxicated you will refuse me later more adamantly than ever i would have liked to argue with him i would have liked to find another quote from someone to help persuade him but my control over the ardeur wasnt as good as his yet just staring up at all that beauty was making me forget forget what little poetry i knew forget logic reason restraint forget everything but his beauty forget everything but my own need i didnt so much kneel as fall down his body the hot water soaked through my shirt my bra my body holding me in the heat of it as i gazed up the length of jeanclaude he looked down at me and still his eyes were human normal lovely to look at but i wanted more i leaned my face in towards him slowly for a kiss on the mouth ma petite there is nothing you can do until i have fed i laid a gentle kiss on his groin he closed his eyes and his breath came out in a careful sigh i am not saying it is not pleasurable but i will be of no use to you i took him in my mouth and he was small and soft so i didnt have to fight to get all of him inside i loved the sensation of him when he was small not just because i wasnt fighting the erection to breath and swallow but the difference in texture there was nothing on a womans body that had this feel to it i rolled him gently around in my mouth and he shuddered i sucked gently pulling with my lips rolling my eyes upward to watch him throw back his head his hands convulse grabbing at empty air i pulled back enough to whisper so that my breath caressed the wet skin of his groin feed so we can both feed he shook his head and looked down at me and there was a look i hadnt seen much on his face stubbornness pleasure i will take from you ma petite but not blood not while the ardeur rides you if you still wish to be embraced after the ardeur is fed then i will gladly joyfully comply but not like this i slid my hands up the smooth wetness of his hips i need to feed now jeanclaude please please non and he shook his head at me again the ardeur had been ready to be gentle as gentle as id ever felt it but being denied didnt make it or me feel gentle angry stubborn cheated i tried to think past it and couldnt id been good so good for so long i hadnt fed on caleb and no one would have screamed at me for it i hadnt fed on nathaniel and he was my pomme de sang i wanted him to go another day before he got munched on i didnt like that hed passed out at the club i hadnt bothered jason who had been too weak to argue once i felt jeanclaude wake i knew what i wanted i hadnt even seen the other men i passed to get to this room they hadnt existed for me now he was denying me refusing me rejecting me some small distant part of me knew that wasnt true it wasnt even fair but that was a distant voice the voices in the front of my head were screaming fuck him feed on him take him id fought until there wasnt enough of me left to fight there was nothing but the need and the need had no mercy i covered him with my mouth again and i did something that i could only do when he was at his smallest i drew his balls gently into my mouth so that i held all of him inside my mouth it was the most amazing sensation to be able to hold him to flick my tongue on the loose skin between his testes to roll the delicate eggs of his body against my teeth and cheeks he filled my mouth this way so wide impossibly wide but because there was no length to match it i wasnt choking or fighting to breathe it was as if i could have held him inside me like this for days i sucked on him the shaft the balls all at once fitting my mouth around the base of him so that my lips formed a seal against his body and i sucked him licked him rolled him explored him i looked up and found his eyes had bled to blue at last but i didnt care anymore i closed my eyes wrapped my hands around the smooth tightness of his buttocks and gave myself over to the joy of it i heard his cries felt his body shudder and quiver under my touch but it was distant his flesh filled my mouth rolled so easily under my tongue id always enjoyed the sensation of him when he was loose but id never been able to indulge myself because after a few touches like all men he didnt stay small i wrapped my mouth close and closer to the base of him and grazed my teeth ever so lightly there there the base of all of him so that to bite too hard would take it all i knew what an act of trust this was for him i bit just hard enough to make him cry out then pulled gently against his body using mostly lips for pressure i let his balls slip out and sucked the rest of him back in my mouth hard and fast pulling harder than i should have sucking him as hard and fast as i wanted no control now no waiting just the feel of him rolling in and out of my mouth as i pulled on him he screamed my name half pleasure half pain and the ardeur burst over both of us the heat spread upward through me and i felt it spread thrust itself into jeanclaude so hot so hot so very hot as if the water around us should boil i had enough left of me somewhere in all that to let go of him with my mouth so i didnt get too carried away i convulsed against his legs my nails digging into his butt hips thighs as he rocked above me and fought to keep his feet he finally halfsat halfcollapsed to the edge of the tub and sat there propped on his arms breathing too hard and that he was breathing at all meant hed fed his ardeur as id fed off of him sometimes it was just an exchange of energy sometimes it was a true feeding i climbed out of the tub enough to sit beside him but didnt touch him sometimes right after the ardeur had been fed touching of any kind could reignite it especially between people who both held the ardeur so it had been between jeanclaude and belle so it was sometimes between us his eyes were still solid blue like midnight skies when the stars have drowned his voice was breathy when he said you are getting better at feeding the ardeur without true orgasm ma petite i have a good teacher he smiled the smile a man gives a woman when theyve just finished such things and it isnt the first time theyve done them and it wont be the last an apt pupil as they say i looked at him and he was pale alabaster with that black black hair those blue eyes the folds and hollows of his body exposed to the overhead lights were as beautiful and familiar to me as a favorite path that i could walk forever and never tire of i stared at jeanclaude and it wasnt the beauty of him that made me love him it was justhim it was a love made up of a thousand touches a million conversations a trillion shared looks a love made up of danger shared enemies conquered a determination to keep the people that depended on us safe at almost any cost and a certain knowledge that neither of us would change the other even if we could i loved jeanclaude all of him because if i took away the machiavellian plottings the labyrinth of his mind it would lessen him make him someone else i sat on the edge of the tub with my jeans and jogging shoes soaking in the water looking at him laugh watching his eyes bleed back to human and i wanted him not for sex though that was in there but for everything you look serious ma petite what are you thinking about so solemnfaced you i said voice soft why should that make you look so solemn the humor began to leak away from his face and i knew without being a hundred percent sure that he was thinking i was about to run away again hed probably been worried about that from the moment i shared a bed with him and asher i usually ran after id made some big breakthrough or would that be breakdown a surprisingly wise friend told me that i hold back some part of myself from all the men in my life he said that i do it to keep myself safe to keep myself from being consumed by love jeanclaudes face had gone very careful as if he were afraid for me to read his expression i wanted to argue but i couldnt he was right jeanclaude looked at me face still empty but there was a tightness around his eyes a wariness that he couldnt quite hide he was waiting for the blow to fall id taught him to expect it i took a deep breath let it out slowly and finished what i hold back from you is sharing blood we fed the ardeur off each other now but i still wont let you take blood jeanclaude opened his mouth as if to say something then closed it hed sat up straighter hands clasped in his lap it wasnt just his face he was fighting to keep neutral even his body language was so very careful i asked you to feed off me a few minutes ago and you said not while the ardeur was riding me not while i was intoxicated i had to smile at the choice of words because intoxicated was a good description of the ardeur metaphysical liquor ive fed the ardeur we both have im not intoxicated any more hed gone very still that utter stillness that the old vampires could do it was like if i looked away he wouldnt be there when i looked back we have both fed the ardeur that much is true then im still offering blood he took a deep breath i want this ma petite you know that i know but why now i told you i had a talk with a friend i cannot give you what asher gave you gave us yesterday with my marks upon you i may not be able to roll your mind at all it will be only pain then do it in the middle of pleasure weve proven more than once that my painpleasure sensors get a little confused when im excited enough that made him smile as do mine that made me smile lets fool around and then he asked voice low when its time take blood and then lets fuck he gave a surprised burst of laughter ma petite you are such a sweettalker how can i refuse i leaned into him pressed a gentle kiss upon his lips and said her lips suck forth my soul see where it flies come helen come give me my soul again here will i dwell for heaven is in these lips and all is dross that is not helena he gazed into my face with such longing i thought you said you could not remember more of the play i remembered more i whispered do you he shook his head and we were so close that his hair brushed against mine so that you couldnt tell where one blackness left and the other began not with you this close to me no good i smiled but promise some night well get the whole play and take turns reading it to each other he smiled and it was the smile id come to value more than any other it was real and vulnerable and i think one of the few things left of the man he might have been if belle morte had not found him i swear it and gladly then help me peel off these wet jeans and leave the poetry for another night he cupped my face in his hands it is always poetry between us ma petite my mouth was suddenly dry and it was hard to swallow past my pulse my voice came breathy yeah but sometimes its dirty limericks he laughed as he kissed me then he helped me out of the wet jeans and the wet socks and the wet shoes and the wet everything when my cross spilled out of my shirt it didnt glow it just lay there glinting in the overhead lights jeanclaude averted his eyes as he always did when he saw a holy object but that was the only hint i had that the cross bothered him i realized with a start that id never worn a cross around jeanclaude and had it glow at him what did that mean im usually pretty straightforward except in emotional areas but i was trying to be different change that so i asked does it really hurt you to look at my cross he looked determinedly at the edge of the bathtub no then why look away because it will start to glow and i do not want that how do you know that itll start to glow because i am a vampire and you are a true believer he was still staring at the water the marble of the tub anywhere and everywhere except at my chest with the cross still hanging around it ive never had a cross glow when you were the only vampire around he glanced up at that then quickly down that cannot be true i thought about it some more i cant ever remember it happening you look away then i take the cross off and we go on about our business but it doesnt glow he shifted in the water enough to send little splashes against my legs does it matter his voice held just how unhappy he was with the line of conversation i dont know i said if you do not wish me to feed then i will go its not that jeanclaude honest he put a hand on the edge of the tub and stepped out jeanclaude i said non ma petite you do not want this or you would not cling to your holy object he took a vibrant blue towel that matched the sheets on the bed and began to dry off my point is oh hell i dont know what my point is just dont go i put my hands back to unfasten the clasp of the chain and the door opened asher stepped inside coated in dried blood all of it mine that should have bothered me but it didnt his hair still fell around his shoulders like spun gold and with asher it wasnt a euphemism for blond his hair was like gold spun to thick soft waves his eyes a blue so pale it was like winter skies but warmer more alive he walked towards us his long body nude and perfect the scars didnt make him less perfect they were simply a part of asher and nothing marred the godlike grace as he moved into the room he was so beautiful it stopped my breath in my throat made my chest ache to see him i wanted to say come to us but my voice was gone in the sheer wonder as he glided towards us on narrow bare feet the cross flared to life not the whitehot glow it had had in the jeep but bright enough bright enough to leave me blinking bright enough to help me think asher was still beautiful nothing could change that but now i could breathe move talk though i had no idea what to say id never had a cross glow around him either until now it was jeanclaude who said it what have you done mon ami what have you done he had his back to the glow of the cross and was using the towel to help shield his eyes asher had thrown up an arm to protect his own pale blue gaze i tried to roll her mind just enough for pleasure but the ardeur was too much what have you done jeanclaude asked again i watched them both in the light of the cross one hiding behind the blue towel the other his own arm and i answered for him he rolled me he rolled my mind completely and utterly even as i said it i knew hed done more than that id been rolled before id even been rolled once upon a time by jeanclaude when first we met but vampire powers to cloud the mind are a dime a dozen most of them can do it most of the young ones have to capture you with their gaze but the old ones can simply think at you i was immune to most of it partly natural ability as a necromancer and part jeanclaudes marks but i wasnt immune to asher the cross kept glowing the vampires kept shielding their eyes and even with them hiding away from the white light i still wanted them both of them but now i had to wonder how much of it was me and how much of it was ashers mind tricks damn it we ended up in the bedroom but not for anything fun id dried off and thrown on extra clothes that i kept at the circus i had to put the wet shoes back on though my cross was safely underneath my shirt again once it went under the shirt it stopped glowing but there was still a pulsing warmth to it jeanclaude had knotted the blue towel around his waist where it draped nearly to his ankles hed put a smaller towel on his hair and the blue of the cloth brought out the blue of his eyes seeing his face free of all hair made him look more like a boy to me it was the bones of his cheeks that saved his face from being utterly feminine he was still beautiful but an inch closer to handsome without that black veil of hair asher was still clothed in nothing but the dried blood and the spill of all his own hair he was pacing the room like some kind of caged beast jeanclaude had simply sat down on the edge of the bed with the blue sheets still stained with blood and other fluids he looked discouraged i stood as far from them as i could arms clasped across my stomach id left my shoulder holster off so that i wouldnt stroke my gun while i argued i was hoping to tone the hostility down not ramp it up jeanclaude laid his face in his hands all pale skin and blue cloth towels and sheets surrounding him why did you do it mon ami if you had only behaved yourself we would even now be together as we were meant to be i wasnt sure i liked how sure jeanclaude was of me but i couldnt really argue without lying so i let it go shutting the fuck up is seldom a bad move on my part asher stopped pacing and said anita has felt me feed she knew that i could roll her mind completely she did not say not to do it she said for me to take her to feed from her so i did i did what she told me to do and she was aware of how i would do it because she has fed me once before jeanclaude raised his face from his hands like a drowning man coming up for air i know that anita fed you when you lay dying in tennessee she saved me asher said hed come to the end of the big fourposter bed i watched the two of them framed against the blue sheets where so recently wed had a very good time i stood there wanting them both and my arms clung to me as if by holding on tight i could keep it from happening oui she saved you but you did not roll her mind completely then because i would have felt your touch upon her mind and heart and it was not there i tried to roll her mind because it seems to me that every vampire that takes blood from her is in some way under her sway her power it is almost as if when a vampire feeds from her it is she who controls them not the other way around i stayed where i was but this i couldnt let go trust me asher it doesnt work that way ive had vamps bite me and have me under their sway before he looked at me with those pale pale eyes but how long ago was that i think that your powers have grown since then my gaze kept sliding down his body tracing the blood pattern on that pale slightly golden tinged skin i closed my eyes to say the next because i needed to stop watching them do you feel like you have to do what i say he hesitated and i fought the urge to look at him to watch him think no his voice was soft i took a deep breath let it out slowly opened my eyes and fought like hell to stare at ashers face and nothing else see youre not in my power or anything he did a small frown are you in my power then i cant stop watching the two of you i cant stop thinking about what we did what we could still do he gave a harsh laugh and it hurt to hear it as if it had struck a blow along my skin how can you not think about us while we stand here in front of you like this oh youre not arrogant i said arms clinging to myself like it was the last safe place for them to be anita i am thinking of you too the pale spill of your back the curve of your hip the mound of your ass underneath me the feel of me rubbing along the soft warmth of your skin stop i said and had to turn away because i was blushing and it was suddenly hard to breathe why stop its what were all thinking ma petite does not like to be reminded of pleasure mon dieu why not i looked in time to see jeanclaude give that allpurpose gallic shrug which meant everything and nothing usually he made it look graceful today it looked tired anita asher said i looked at him and this time i could make eye contact except that staring into those amazing eyes wasnt much safer than looking at his amazing body you told me you wanted me inside you as i remember and when i bared your neck you said yes asher yes i remember what i said then how can you be angry at me for doing what you asked he took three strides closer to me and i backed up the movement stopped him how can you blame me for this i dont know but i do how thats unfair or maybe not unfair i dont know but i do jeanclaude spoke then his voice like the sigh of the wind outside a lonely door if you had but restrained yourself mon ami we might even now be together in the bath i dont know about that i said my voice sounded angry and i was glad jeanclaude gazed at me with those blue black eyes are you saying that you could refuse such bounty once having tasted it i didnt blush this time i paled well its moot now isnt it because he cheated i pointed at asher for dramatic emphasis he stared at me openmouthed how did i cheat jeanclaude was back to holding his head in his hands ma petite does not allow vampire trickery to be played upon her his voice came muffled but strangely clear asher looked from one to the other of us ever jeanclaude answered without moving head still in his hands for the most oui then she has never tasted you as you are meant to be tasted asher said and his voice held a soft astonishment that is her choice jeanclaude said he raised his face up slowly so i could meet that blue gaze and there was something of anger in his eyes i didnt understand all of this conversation and i wasnt sure i wanted to so i ignored it ive always been damn good at ignoring what makes me uncomfortable the point is that asher used vampire wiles on me hes done something to cloud the way i think about him now i wont know wont ever know if what im feeling is real or a trick there i felt sure of moral high ground on this one at least jeanclaude did a sort of voilа gesture with his hands as if to say see i told you ashers face began to lose its anger and work towards that blankness they both did so well so it was just a lie i looked at both of them what was a lie that you wanted me to be with you and jeanclaude i frowned no it wasnt a lie i meant it then this faux pas changes nothing he said youve messed with my mind i dont think thats just a faux pas i think thats damn serious my hands were on my hips better than clinging to myself to keep from touching anybody i embraced my anger because it made them less beautiful of course it made everything less beautiful so you did lie asher said his face almost empty of any expression i hated watching him shut himself away like this but i didnt know what to do to stop it damn it no i didnt lie youre the one who changed the rules asher not me i changed nothing you said we would be together you offered me your bed you begged me to be inside you jeanclaude said that your sweet ass was not to be touched and the deep pleasure of your body was full where was i supposed to go i fought not to blush and failed it was the ardeur talking and you knew it he backed up until he came to the edge of the bed and he halfcollapsed on the blue sheets grabbing the post to keep from sliding off the silk his face was blank but the rest of him acted as if id struck him and i knew id said the wrong thing i said that once the ardeur was cooled you would find a way to reject me to reject this and he gestured at jeanclaude at the far end of the bed and the bed itself and you have done just as i said you would do he pushed himself up from the bed clinging to the wooden post for a moment as if he wasnt sure his legs would hold him he took a tentative step away from the bed almost staggered then another and another each step was steadier than the last he was going for the door wait a minute youre not just going to walk out i said he stopped walking but didnt turn around as he answered giving a clear view of the perfection of the back of his body i cannot leave until musette is gone i will give her no excuse to take me back to the courts with her if i belong to no one she will do it and i will have no grounds to refuse he rubbed his hands over his arms as if he were cold when musette is gone i will petition for another master of the city there are those who would take me in i walked towards him no no you have to give me some time to think about what you did its not fair to walk off like this i was almost to him when he whirled around and the rage on his face stopped me like id hit a wall fair what is fair in being offered everything you ever wanted and thought never to have again only to have it torn from your grasp torn from your grasp because you did exactly what you were told you could do what was asked of you he didnt yell but his anger filled his voice so every word was like a redhot poker flung at my face i didnt know what to say in the face of that anger i will not cannot stay and watch you and jeanclaude i would rather be without the sight of either of you then so very close but cast from your bed your arms your affections he covered his face with his hands and gave a low scream to be with us as our lover is to be seduced by our powers he tore his hands away from his face and let me see his eyes drowning blue his anger making up for the lack of blood i had never dreamed that jeanclaude had not done so he looked at the other man still sitting on the edge of the bed how could you be with her for so long and resist the temptation she is most adamantly against such things jeanclaude said at least you have had her willing blood i have never been so blessed asher frowned and it sat badly on that lovely face like an angel frowning that astounds me still though i knew that but she has bestowed her charms upon you and now i will never know them this was all happening way too fast for me jeanclaude understands the rules and we both live by them of course id been just about ready to change the rules but i didnt think asher needed to know right now asher shook his head sending that foam of gold hair gliding over his shoulders even if i understood the rules anita i could not abide by them that made me frown what do you mean anita we arent human no matter how much some of us pretend but not all of what we are is bad you have entered our world but you deny yourself the best of us while only seeing the worst but most horrible of all you deny jeanclaude the best of his own world whats that supposed to mean he is celibate save for you but he does not pleasure himself fully with you or anyone else he made a gesture that i didnt understand i see that look upon your face anita that american look sex is not just intercourse or even just orgasm and that is especially true for us why because youre french he gave me such a serious look that my attempt at humor died in my chest like a cold weight we are vampires anita more than that we are master vampires of belle mortes line we can give you pleasure that no other can give and we can take pleasure as no other can experience it by agreeing to limit himself jeanclaude has denied himself a great deal of what makes this existence bearable even enjoyable i looked at jeanclaude how much have you been holding back he wouldnt meet my gaze how much jeanclaude i cannot make my bite true pleasure as asher can i cannot roll your mind completely as he can he still wouldnt look at me thats not what i asked he sighed there are things that i can do that you have not seen i have tried to abide by your wishes in all things well i will not asher said we both looked at him anita will always find some reason to keep her from openly taking both of us she cannot even allow her one vampire lover to truly be vampire how could she possibly endure the full touch of two of them asher i said but didnt know what else to say all i knew was that my chest hurt and it was hard to breathe no you will always find something in your men that is not good enough not pure enough you come to us out of need even out of love but it is never enough you will not allow us to be enough even for ourselves he shook his head again in a flurry of brightness that shattered the lights like golden mirrors my heart is too fragile to play these games anita i love you but i cannot live let alone love like this i dont even get an hour to digest that you used vampire wiles on me he put a hand on either of my shoulders and the weight of his hands made my skin run warm if its not this it will be something else i have watched you with richard jeanclaude and now micah micah wins his way through your maze by simply agreeing to everything you ask jeanclaude wins his place on the edges of your labyrinth by cutting himself off from unbelievable pleasure richard will not walk your maze because he has his own and only one person can be this confusing in a relationship at one time someone has to be willing to compromise and neither you nor richard will compromise enough he let me go and the absence of his hands almost staggered me as if hed taken away a shelter and i was lost in the storm he began to walk backwards towards the door i thought i would do anything to be with jeanclaude and his new servant i thought i would do anything to be back in the safety of the arms of two people who loved me but i understand now that your love will always come with conditions and that no matter how good your intentions something holds you back anita something will not allow you to give yourself completely to the moment to that shining thing called love you hold yourself back and you hold back those who love you i cannot live being offered your love one moment and denied it the next i cannot live being punished for what i cannot change its not punishment i said and my voice sounded strange strangled he gave a sad smile and flung his hair over the scarred side of his face so he stared at me with nothing but that perfect profile showing to quote you ma cherie the hell it is not he turned and strode for the door i called after him asher please but he didnt stop the door closed behind him and the room filled with a profound silence jeanclaude spoke into that silence and his soft voice made me jump gather your things anita and go i looked at him then and my pulse was in my throat and i was afraid really afraid are you kicking me out my voice didnt even sound like me non but at this moment i need to be alone you havent fed yet are you saying you would willingly feed me now he didnt look at me as he asked it he was staring at the floor actually im sort of not in the mood anymore i said and my voice was fighting to get back to normal jeanclaude wasnt kicking me out of his life but i didnt like that he wouldnt look at me i will feed but it will be only for food and you are not food so please go jeanclaude just go anita go i need you not to be here right now i need to not have to look at you right now the first stirrings of anger had trickled into his voice like a fuse freshly lit and running with fire but not truly burning up not yet would saying im sorry help my voice was small when i asked that you understand that you have something to apologize for is a beginning but it is not enough not today he looked at me then and his eyes glistened in the lights not with power but with unshed tears besides it is not me that you owe the apology to now go before i say something that we will both regret i opened my mouth drew a breath to reply but he held up a hand and said simply no i gathered my gun and shoulder holster from the bathroom the wet clothes i left on the floor of the bathroom i didnt look back and i didnt try to kiss him goodbye i think if id tried to touch him hed have hurt me i dont mean struck me but there are a thousand ways to hurt someone you love that have nothing to do with physical violence there were words trapped in his eyes a world of pain shining there i didnt want to hear those words i didnt want to feel that pain i didnt want to see it or touch it or have it rubbed in the wounds in my own heart right that moment i believed i was right and a girls got to have some standards i dont let the vamps fuck with my mind they just get my body it had seemed a good rule an hour ago i shut the door behind me leaned into it and fought to take a breath that didnt shake my world had been more solid an hour ago i was still leaning against the door shaking when nathaniel came up to me i didnt see him at first even though he was standing right in front of me i was staring at the floor and i saw his jogging shoes his legs his shorts before i looked slowly up and found his face it felt like it took a long time to look up his body and find that familiar face with those lilac eyes anita his voice was soft i held out a hand because if anyone was nice to me i was going to fall apart i couldnt afford that right now if asher was up then probably so was musette normally the thought would have been enough to let me check on a nearby vampire today it was empty i was empty i was what marianne my psychic teacher called head blind it happens sometimes if youve had a shock physical emotional whatever i wouldnt be worth shit for metaphysical stuff until this wore offif it wore off right that second it felt like the world should open up at my feet and swallow me down the great black hole that was eating through my heart what is it nathaniel my voice was a bare whisper i cleared my throat sharply to repeat it but hed heard the two men that were following us in the blue jeep are outside watching the back parking lot theyve got a different car but its still them i nodded and the black hole at my feet began to close i still hurt and i was still head blind but for this it didnt matter guns dont care if youre psychically gifted guns dont care about anything they dont bitch at you about the rules in your personal life either of course neither does a dog but i dont have to use a pooperscooper after im through shooting my gun sometimes a body bag is needed but thats not usually my job i was feeling better steadier this i could do find bobby lee i want the best people hes got for car work car work nathaniel made it a question were going to box them in and find out why theyre following us what if they dont want to tell us he asked i looked at him as i slipped into the shoulder holster and unthreaded my belt so i could rethread the holster i didnt say anything as i readied the gun got it exactly where i wanted it i had to carry the butt of the gun a little lower than i might have wanted for speed but hitting your breast with the edge of the gun slows your fast draw even more so a little lower angle to avoid the chest legends say that the amazons chopped off a breast to make them better at archery i dont believe that i think its just another example of men thinking a woman cant be a great warrior without cutting away her womanhood symbolically or otherwise we can be great warriors we just got to pack the equipment a little differently nathaniel was looking very solemn i didnt bring a gun thats great because youre not coming anita no nathaniel i taught you about guns so you wouldnt hurt yourself and so in an emergency you could defend yourself this isnt an emergency i want you to stay inside out of the line of fire something flitted over his face something that might have been stubbornness it faded but stubborn wasnt something that id ever seen on nathaniel i wanted him more independent but not stubborn he was about the only person in my life that did what i asked when i asked right that second i valued that i hugged him and i think it caught us both by surprise i whispered in his ear against the sweet vanilla scent of his cheek please just do what i say he was quiet for a heartbeat then his arms wrapped around me and he whispered yes i drew back from him slowly searching his face wanting to ask him if he found my rules a burden if id taken half the pleasure out of his life too i didnt ask because i didnt really want to know it wasnt that my courage failed me it was more that my cowardice overwhelmed me id had about all the truth i could stand for one day i kissed him on the cheek and left to find bobby lee him i trusted to be in the line of fire but it was more than that i wasnt sleeping with bobby lee i didnt love him sometimes love makes you selfish sometimes it makes you stupid sometimes it reminds you why you love your gun i was looking through a pair of binoculars at a car parked at the far corner of the circus of the damned employee parking lot nathaniel was right it was the same two men but now they were in a large gold impala dating to the s or some such it was big old but in good shape it was also very different from the shiny new blue jeep that theyd been in before theyd switched so the blond was driving with the binocs i could see that he looked youngish under forty over twentyfive he was clean shaven wearing a black mock turtleneck and silver frame glasses his eyes were pale gray or grayish blue the darkhaired man had put a billed cap on and changed to a larger pair of sunglasses his face was thin clean shaven with a goodsized mole at one corner of his mouth what they used to call a beauty mark i watched them sitting there and wondered why they werent at least reading a newspaper or drinking coffee something anything theyd done everything they were supposed to do according to kasey krime stoppers theyd changed vehicles theyd made small changes to their appearances all this might have worked if they werent sitting outside circus of the damned doing nothing no matter how clever you disguise yourself very few people sit in a car in the middle of the morning and do nothing also the employee parking lot was almost empty before noon once darkness fell they could probably have parked and not been noticed so quickly but this time of morning there was no hiding bobby lee was explaining all the kasey krime stoppers tips and more to me if they hadnt changed cars and they hadnt done anything to change their appearance it might mean they didnt care if you spotted them or even that they wanted you to spot them but theyve changed enough i think they really are trying to follow you i handed him back the binoculars why are they following me usually when people start following you around you know why i thought they might be renfields working for musette and company but i dont think renfields would have taken the trouble to change their appearance like this most renfields arent the brightest of people bobby lee grinned at me how can you be friends with so many bloodsuckers and still be so damn disdainful of them i shrugged and my shrug wasnt graceful it never had been just lucky i guess the smile stayed but the eyes began to go serious what do you want to do about these two for a second i thought he meant asher and jeanclaude then i realized he meant the two yahoos in the impala the fact that even for a second i thought he meant something else said just how bad my concentration was concentration like that will get you killed in a fire fight i took a deep breath another let them out slowly trying to clear my head i needed to be here now not worrying about my increasingly complex personal life here and now with men and women with guns about to risk their lives because i asked them to do it maybe the two men in the car werent dangerous at all but we couldnt count on that we had to treat them like they were if we were wrong no harm done if we were right well wed be as prepared as we could be i couldnt shake the feeling of impending disaster i looked up at bobby lees tall frame i dont want to get any of you guys killed wed kind of like to avoid that ourselves i shook my head no thats not what i mean he looked at me face suddenly very serious whats wrong anita i sighed i think im losing my nerve for this shit not for my own safety but for everyone elses the last time the wererats helped me i got one of you killed and another one cut up pretty badly i healed up pretty good claudia walked towards us all six feet six and serious muscle her long black hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail leaving her face clean and unadorned id never seen her wear makeup and maybe because id never seen her in any she didnt need it she wore a navy blue sports bra and a pair of dark blue jeans she usually wore sports bras i think because she had trouble finding shirts that fit over the spectacular spread of her shoulders and chest she was a serious weight lifter but not to that point where youd ever mistake her for masculine no claudia was definitely all girl the last time id seen her shed had her arm damn near shot off there was a faint tracery of scars on her right shoulder pale pink and white silver shot will scar even a shapeshifter thered even been a faint possibility that the silver could have lost her the use of her arm but the right arm looked as whole and muscular as the left you look great hows the arm i asked smiling one of my favorite things about hanging with the monsters is the healing straight humans seemed to get killed on me a lot monsters survived lets hear it for the monsters claudia flexed the arm and muscles rippled under her skin it was downright impressive i lift weights but not like that not all the way back to full strength i still cant curl more than one hundred and forty pounds with it i could benchpress my own body weight plus a few pounds and until now id been pretty impressed with doing reps with forty pounds for curls suddenly i felt inadequate i wanted to ask her if she was okay with putting her life and that impressive body on the line for me again but i didnt some questions you just dont ask not out loud i stood there pressed against the blackmirrored glass that from the outside looked like part of the wall id always wondered how someone was usually there to meet me at the back door now i knewthey had a lookout we could have watched the bad guys all day and theyd never have seen us it was part of a narrow loft area up above the main part of the circus of the damned but this one small nook was equipped with binocs comfortable chairs and a little table the rest of the loft area was mostly cables wires stored equipment like the backstage areas at a theater most of the ceiling of the circus was open to girders and beams like the warehouse it originally was but now that i knew the loft was here i realized that there was a narrow band of enclosed space that went around the entire top of the building id asked if there were other hidden lookouts and gotten the answer of course ask an obvious question and you get the obvious answer claudias going to drive one of the cars for our little plan bobby lee said i thought the plan was for someone who looked harmless and normal to drive both cars claudia gave me a flat unfriendly look no offense but you look anything but ordinary shell throw a shirt on over the muscles take out the ponytail and look like a girl bobby lee said i looked at him and her she was taller than he was hell she was as broad through the shoulders as he was and she had more bulk you know bobbyboy if i had to choose between armwrestling you or claudia id pick you he blinked at me totally not getting it claudia got it youre wasting your breath anita no matter how much i work out im still a girl to even the best of them bobby lee was looking from one to the other of us what are you two talking about i tried being very clear using small words claudia is more muscled and taller than most of the other wererats you have here today why are you putting her out in the first car to look normal and harmless she looks anything but harmless he blinked at me frowning you wont see the muscles under the shirt shes sixfreakingfeet and sixfuckinginches tall with a pair of shoulders as broad as yours youre not going to hide that under a shirt im aware of that anita then why put her out in front to look harmless bobby lee tried to wrap his mind around it but in the end he was a man that had spent most of his life being musclesmart muscle but still muscle shes the only girl we have here today except you and theyd recognize you are you really telling me that the bad guys would feel less threatened by claudia than by a short lesspowerfully built man that was clear enough that bobby lee finally got it he opened his mouth closed it opened it again smiled and gave a small laugh i see your point but truthfully yeah theyll be less intimidated men just dont see women as a threat no matter how big they are and all men are suspect no matter how small i shook my head why because we have breasts and you dont give it up anita claudia said just give it up theyre men they cant help it since i wasnt a man i took bobby lees word that the bad guys would panic less if one of the people involved in our mock accident was a woman i had to admit that even i was less physically afraid of another woman but it seemed wrong somehow claudia threw a mans pale blue shirt over her jeans and buttoned it up even the sleeves she left enough buttons undone in front to flash some cleavage then she took the tie out of her hair she shook her hair out and it fell around her face over her shoulders in a slick brunette flood the hair softened the strong lines of her face and i suddenly had a glimpse of what she might look like if she put any effort into being a traditional girl spectacular was the word that came to mind bobby lee watched the hair cascade with nearly openmouthed attention i think i could have shot him twice before he reacted shit id thought better of him than that claudia met my eyes and crooked one shapely eyebrow it said it all we had one of those moments of perfect understanding between girls and i think that for her like for me there werent that many of them we both spent far too much time hanging out with the men but no matter how many times you saved their lives and they saved yours no matter how much you could benchpress no matter how tall or strong or competentyou were still a girl and the fact that you were a girl overshadowed everything else for most men it wasnt good or bad it just was a woman will forget that a man is male if they are good enough friends but men rarely forget that a woman is feminine most of the time it bugged the crap out of me but today wed use it against the bad guys because theyd see all that hair those breasts and theyd underestimate her because she was a girl theyd only been following me for one day as far as i knew so why such determination to find out why one its usually better to know than not to know when people are following you and two i was in a truly foul mood i had no idea what to do about asher i didnt want to lose him and now i didnt trust the feeling in fact i was pretty certain it was really vampire mind tricks maybe id never really loved him maybe that had always been a lie the logical part of me knew i was kidding myself on that one but the scared part was happy with the theory the thing that bothered me the most was i was no longer certain which was the brave thing to do was it brave and right to dump asher for his treachery or was he right and hed just done what i asked him to do was i wrong and if i was wrong about this how many other things had i been wrong about unfair about i was losing my sense of rightness about so many things without my sense of holierthanthou anger i felt shaky and unreal i didnt feel like me anymore what if i got claudia killed the way id gotten her friend igor killed a few months back hell what if i got bobby lee killed like his friend cris id killed nearly fifty percent of any wererats that rafael their king had loaned me no one complained about it but today the thought of more losses seemed completely unacceptable if i wasnt willing to let people risk their lives then this plan wouldnt work we needed four vehicles to block four roads and make sure there was no place for the bad guys to go wed cut off all escape routes and reason with them that meant a minimum of four people in danger more since bobby lee wanted shooters hidden among the few cars in the parking lot the shooters would move out of the circus when the bad guys were busy driving around trying to figure a way out of the parking lot or that was the plan it was a good plan unless the bad guys pulled out guns and started shooting then wed have to shoot back and they might get killed and id be no better off i still wouldnt know shit and i might have gotten some more of rafaels people dead you alright anita bobby lee asked i was rubbing fingertips against my temples and shaking my head no im not im really not okay with this with what this all of it even as i said it i saw claudia driving down the back road and fredo coming up the other road id made sure i knew his name you shouldnt ask people to die for you if you dont at least know their name he was a few inches under six feet a slender dark man with large graceful hands wearing more knives than anyone id met in a long time bobby lee said that both fredo and claudia could make the accident look real they were both drivers he said drivers like it should have been in capital letters id asked to be one of the drivers and id been informed that i didnt know how to drive and i couldnt argue with that but right that moment waiting and watching other people take the risks for me was harder than risking myself i trusted bobby lees judgment i really did what i didnt trust was the bad guys they were bad guys so you couldnt trust them to be anything but unpredictable and dangerous i watched the two cars get closer and i almost yelled dont dont do it but i wanted to know who was following me and more than that if i said stop if my nerve failed here on something so mundane what good would i be the trouble was my nerve had failed i kept my mouth shut but i felt like the only thing keeping my pulse in my mouth was the tight line of my lips i prayed dear god dont let anyone get hurt then a thought occurred to me seconds before the fender bender if bobby lee and company could stage this they could probably have followed the men trailed them back to wherever following just hadnt occurred to me only confrontation shit the cars collided it did look real accidental claudia got out all tall and feminine even from a distance fredo got out yelling waving his arms around the bad guys started their car and went for the far entrance of the parking lot farther down the street that had just been blocked off they must have smelled a rat the impala stopped before theyd turned completely onto the road which meant theyd spotted the third car tucked in beside the circus blocking the alley between the circus and the building next door bobby lee led the way to the stairs and we clattered down trusting that the fourth vehicle a truck had blocked the far alley where the loading dock was located wed both sacrificed being one of the first shooters into the parking lot so we could watch the plan unfold by the time we hit the lot gunmen had sprung up among the few parked cars like mushrooms after a rainstorm i felt almost silly drawing my gun and joining the half circle claudia fredo and the two other drivers were the other half of the circle coming in from the other side it wasnt a perfect circle a perfect circle would have meant we were firing at each other so the circle was sort of metaphoric but the effect was perfect the impala sat there in our circle of guns engine on and no weapons in sight yet the blond had his hands very firmly on the top of the steering wheel it was the darkhaired one in his billed cap who had his hands out of sight there was a lot of shouting on our side about hands up and dont you fucking move they hadnt moved but the engine was still running and the one guys hands were still out of sight i kept my gun pointed onehanded but raised a hand i dont know if anyone else saw it or understood what i wanted but bobby lee did he held up his hand in almost the same gesture and the yelling quieted it was suddenly silent except for the thrum of the car engine i spoke into that silence making sure my voice carried turn off the car the one in the billed cap said something that i couldnt hear through the windows the blond very slowly lowered one hand and the engine died the ticking of the engine was very loud in the stillness billedcap man was obviously unhappy even with sunglasses covering his face it showed in the line of his mouth his hands were still hidden the blond had put his hand back on the steering wheel hands where we can see them i said now the blonds hands seemed to vibrate on the steering wheel as if he would have put his hands where i could see them if they werent already there he said something to his companion and billcap shook his head i lowered my gun took a deep breath held it aimed let the breath out slow and careful as i squeezed the trigger the gunshot was loud in the stillness and it took a moment for me to be able to hear the air hissing out of the tire i aimed my gun back up at the blonds window his eyes flashed wide he was speaking fast and frantically to his friend bobby lee i said have someone on that side of the car press the barrel of their gun against the passenger side window you want them to shoot not yet and if they do have to shoot i dont want to chance hitting the blond with the same bullet i looked up at him aim accordingly it was claudia who stepped forward and put her gun against the window she angled it slightly down so shed miss the man on the other side bullets have a nasty tendency to travel farther than you want them to she asked without looking at me never taking her eyes from the man she was aiming at do i get to kill him we only need one of them to question i said she smiled a flash of white teeth and it was fierce and frightening framed by all that dark hair that lovely face great i wont ask again put your hands where we can see them or else i said he didnt put his hands up he was either stupid or bobby lee does anyone have our backs you mean backup he asked yeah hes awful stubborn unless he thinks help is coming he said something quick and harsh it sounded german but it wasnt and his southern accent vanished when he said it some of the wererats turned outward watching the perimeter we were in the open no one was going to sneak up on us the only real danger would have been if someone had a rifle and scope there was really nothing we could do about snipers and because there was nothing we could do about it we had to let it go pretend it couldnt happen and take care of what was happening but a spot from between my shoulder blades to the top of my head ran with goose bumps as if i could feel the scope on me i was pretty sure it was imagination but my imaginations always been a problem when i got overly excited i tried to think of something else like why the man wouldnt put his fucking hands up i aimed onehanded so i could free up my left hand i held a finger up one then another finger two the blond was speaking frantically i could hear snatches of his voice do it god do it i actually started to put up that third finger when the billcap man put his hands up slowly empty hands but i was betting any amount of money that he had some nasty piece of hardware in his lap oh yeah claudia kept her gun against his window i think because she hadnt been told to move away frankly i liked her there close enough to fire if he went for whatever was in his lap i made the universal sign for roll the window down rolling my hand in the air they were in an old enough car that they actually had to crank it down the blond unwound the window slowly carefully and kept his other hand glued to the steering wheel he was a cautious man i liked that he rolled the window down put his hands back on the steering wheel and said nothing he didnt try to plead innocence or confess guilt he just sat there fine i was short enough that with a little stooping i could see into the other mans lap it was empty which meant whatever hed been cradling was on the floorboard hed dropped it so we wouldnt see it what the hell was it i raised my voice a little you in the cap put your hands slowly on the dashboard flat and if they move from there you will be shot is that clear he wouldnt look at me is that clear he began to move his hands towards the dashboard its clear why were you following me i asked mostly to the blond because i was beginning to realize the other man wasnt going to volunteer much i do not know what you are talking about he had a faint german accent and i had too many relatives with the same accent not to recognize it of course they were all over sixty and hadnt seen the old country for a few decades i was betting blondie was a more recent import whered the pretty blue jeep go i asked his face went very still i told you the billcap said yeah we spotted you i said it wasnt all that hard you would not have seen us if you had not been swerving all over the road blondie said sorry about that but we had some technical difficulties yeah like one of you turned furry the guy in the cap said he definitely was middle american middle of nowhere no accent so you wondered what was wrong and got close enough to see i said neither of them said anything to that you are both going to get very slowly out of this car if either of you goes for a weapon you may both die i only need one of you for questioning the other is just gravy ill do my best to see that one of you lives but i wont break a sweat to save you both because i dont need you both is that clear the blond said yes the other one said crystal fucking clear oh yeah he was american only we have that poetic turn of phrase then i heard the sirens they were close very close like in front of the building close id have liked to think they were just passing through but when youre holding this many guns out in the open you cant count on that never a cop when you need one bobby lee said try to do anything illegal and theyre all over ya the billedcap man said if you put all your guns away before the cops get in sight well just pretend this didnt happen he was smiling as he leaned across so id be sure and see the smug expression i smiled back and his smile wilted because i looked too damned pleased i wasnt smooth at digging my badge out of my pocket yet not onehanded anyway but i managed i flashed the metallic star in its little case federal marshal asshole keep your hands where we can see them until the nice policemen arrive what are you arresting us for the blond asked in his german accent we have done nothing oh i dont know well start with carrying concealed weapons without a permit then suspicion of grand theft auto i patted the side of the impala this aint your car and whatever your friend over there dropped on the floorboard is going to be illegal just call it a hunch bobby lee we dont need this big a crowd he grasped my meaning and barked another order in that odd guttural almostgerman the wererats melted away in that tooquicktofollowwiththeeye blur of speed id seen them use once or twice claudia stayed at her post and bobby lee refused to leave but it was just the three of us when the first policeman saw us well five if you count the bad guys two uniformed officers came up the alley walking because the truck that was blocking the road hadnt moved but the wererat that had been driving it was walking just ahead of them with his hands laced on the top of his head with his hands up it flashed that his shoulder holster was empty theyd taken his gun i made sure my badge was held up as high as i could manage i was yelling federal marshall as they came around the corner the cops used the few cars on that side of the lot for cover and yelled guns down i yelled federal marshal anita blake the rest of these people are federal deputies bobby lee whispered deputies i spoke out of the corner of my mouth just agree with me yes maam i stepped back from the car enough to flash my badge better and yell federal marshall blake glad to see you officers the officers stayed behind the engine blocks of the cars but had stopped yelling at us they were trying to figure out how much trouble theyd be in if we really were federal and they messed up what we were doing but they werent worrying about politics so hard as to risk getting themselves shot i approved i lowered my voice and spoke to the men in the car before i walked towards the policemen carrying concealed without a permit weapons on you that are illegal no matter what a stolen car and im betting when your prints hit the system it lights up like a christmas tree i was smiling and nodding at the two policemen hiding behind the cars the badge had calmed them but they still had their guns out and i heard other sirens in the distance theyd called for backup i couldnt blame them they had no way of knowing any of us qualified as a cop i glanced at the blond besides the police around here take a dim view of criminals following federal marshals around we did not know you were police the blond said your intel sucks i said he nodded his hands still on the steering wheel yes i put my gun up and held my badge up very high put both hands up to show i was currently unarmed and walked carefully towards the two uniforms and the others that were creeping cautiously guns drawn out of the alley there were days when i truly loved having a badge this was sooo one of those days three hours later i was sitting in the outer office of the police station sipping really bitter coffee and waiting for someone to let me talk to my prisoners i had a badge and i had the right to deputize anyone i saw fit in an emergency the police had taken bobby lee claudia and the one driver in for questioning theyd been sent home an hour ago bobby lee had tried to insist he stay with me but his lawyer had told him going home after only two hours was a gift and he should take it he took it after i insisted it helped that there had been an mp heckler and koch submachine gun on the floorboard not to mention about half a dozen more smaller weapons four knives one of those collapsible clubs an asp oh and that the car they were driving wasnt theirs the darkhaired guy whod been so sullen turned out to be exarmy so his prints came up strangely he had no criminal record i would have bet almost anything that he was a bad guy but if he was a bad guy he was good enough at it to have never been caught the blond didnt exist his prints werent in our system because of the german accent and my insistence theyd forwarded both sets of prints to interpol to see if our boys were wanted outside the country but that would take time so i had been left to cool my heels in a very uncomfortable desk chair beside the desk of a detective that never seemed to be there the nameplate read p obrien but as far as id seen in over three hours he was a myth there was no detective obrien they just sat people by his desk and assured them that hed be coming to talk to them soon i wasnt under arrest in fact i wasnt in trouble at all i was free to go but i was not free to speak with the prisoners without someone present fine by me i talked to them with the nice policemen present none of us learned anything but that they both knew that they wanted their lawyers once they got read their rights that was all either of them would say there was enough to hold them for at least seventytwo hours but after that we were up shit creek unless their prints came back with an active criminal warrant i took another sip of the coffee made a face and set it carefully on the desk of the invisible detective i thought id never meet coffee i couldnt drink i was wrong it tasted like old gym socks and was nearly as solid i sat up straight and wondered about simply leaving my badge kept me and the wererats out of jail and made sure the two bad guys didnt get to go free but that was about all the local police werent happy with anyone with federal as part of their title messing in local crime a woman came to stand in front of me she was about five eight wearing a black skirt that was longer than was stylish but then her comfortable black shoes werent exactly cutting edge either her blouse was a dark gold that looked like silk but was probably something easier to clean her hair had been dark brunette but was so streaked with gray and silver and white that it looked like shed streaked it on purpose natural punk deep smile lines showcased a truly nice smile she held her hand out to me i stood up to shake hands and her handshake was firm strong i glanced at the black suit jacket on the back of detective obriens chair and knew who i was talking to even before she introduced herself sorry its taken me so long to get back to you weve had a busy day she motioned me to sit back down i sat understandable she smiled but her eyes didnt match the smile now as if she didnt believe me im going to be in charge of this case so i just want to get a few things clear she laid the folder shed been carrying on her desk opened it and seemed to be reading some notes sure i said you dont know why these two men were following you correct no i dont she gave me a very direct look out of her dark gray eyes yet you felt the matter was so urgent that you deputized she checked her notes ten civilians to help you capture these two men i shrugged and gave her pleasant empty eyes i dont like being followed by people i dont know you told the officers on sight that you suspected the men of carrying illegal weapons that was before anyone had searched them or the car how did you know they were carrying illegal weapons there was the slightest hesitation before she said marshal blake gut instinct i guess those warm gray eyes suddenly went as cold as a winter sky cut the bullshit and just tell me what you know i widened eyes at that ive told your fellow officers everything i know detective obrien honest she gave me a look of such withering scorn that i should have wilted in my seat and confessed all the trouble was i had nothing to confess i didnt know shit i tried for honesty detective obrien i swear to you that i just noticed that i had a tail today on the highway then i saw that the same two men were outside where i was in a different car until i saw them the second time i was willing to believe i was being paranoid but once i knew they were following me i wanted them to stop doing that and i wanted to know why they were following me in the first place i shrugged that is the absolute truth i wish i knew something to conceal from you but i am as much in the dark on this one as you are she closed the file with a snap and hit it sharply on the desk as if to settle the papers inside it but it looked like an automatic gesture or an angry one dont try batting those big brown eyes at me ms blake im not buying batting my big brown eyes me are you accusing me of trying to use feminine wiles on you detective that made her almost smile but she fought off the urge not exactly but ive seen women like you before so cute so petite you give that innocent face and the men just fall all over themselves to believe you i looked at her for a second to see if she was kidding but she seemed serious whatever axe youre grinding find someone elses forehead to sink it into i have come in here and told nothing but the truth i helped get two men off the streets that were carrying firepower with armorpiercing copkilling ammo you dont seem very damned grateful she gave me very cold eyes youre free to leave anytime ms blake i stood then smiled down at her and knew my eyes were as cold and unfriendly as hers thanks so much ms obrien i emphasized the ms thats detective obrien she said as id almost been sure she would then its marshal blake to you detective obrien i earned the right to be called detective blake i didnt get grandfathered in on some technicality you may have a badge but it doesnt make you a cop jesus she was jealous i took a deep breath and let it out slowly i would get nowhere rising to the bait and fighting with her so i didnt bully for me i may not be your kind of cop but i am a duly appointed federal marshal you can interfere on any case involving the preternatural well this one doesnt involve the preternatural she gazed up at me face calm but still showing signs of anger so have a nice day i blinked at her and counted slowly to ten another detective came striding up he had short curly blond hair freckles and a big grin if hed been any newer to plainclothes hed have squeaked when he walked james said we caught some sort of international super spy is that true a look passed over obriens face a look of near pain you could almost hear her thinking shit i grinned at the other detective interpol came back with a hit huh he nodded eagerly the german guy is wanted all over the place industrial espionage suspected terrorism obrien cut him off go away detective webster go the fuck away from me his smile faltered did i say something wrong i mean the marshal here brought them in i thought she get away from me now obrien said and the growl of warning in her voice would have done a werewolf proud detective webster walked away without saying another word he looked worried and he should have i was betting obrien carried grudges to the grave and made sure everyone paid up she looked at me and the anger in her eyes wasnt just for me maybe it was for the years of being the only woman on a detail maybe the job had made her bitter or maybe shed always been a grumpygrumpy girl i didnt know and i didnt really care catching an international terrorist in these days and times could make a persons career i said sort of conversationally not really looking at her the look of hatred in her eyes made me want to flinch you know it will i shook my head obrien i dont have a career in the police department i dont even have a career with the feds i am a vampire executioner and i help out on cases where the monsters are involved me having a badge is so new and so unprecedented that theyre still arguing on whether well have rank as federal marshals or be able to move up in rank at all im not a threat to your promotion me taking credit wont help my career a damn bit so help yourself her eyes toned down from hatred to distrust whats in it for you i shook my head dont you get it yet obrien what did webster say international spy industrial espionage suspected terrorism and thats just the top of the list what of it she said hands clasped over the file folder on her desk like she was shielding it from me as if id snatch it and run with it he was following me obrien why ive never been out of the country what does an international bad ass like this want with me she gave a small frown you really dont know why they were following you do you i shook my head no and would you want someone like that following you around no she said and her voice had softened was uncertain no i wouldnt she looked up at me eyes hard but not as hard as they had been she didnt apologize but she did hand me the file folder if you really dont know why theyre after you then you need to know just how bad a man youve dug up marshal blake i smiled thank you detective obrien she didnt smile back but she did send detective webster for fresh coffee for both of us she also told him to make a fresh pot before he poured our cups i was liking detective obrien more and more his name was leopold walther heinrick he was a german national he was suspected of almost every large crime you could think of and by large i mean not petty he wasnt a pursesnatcher or a con artist he was suspected of working for terrorist groups worldwide mostly those with a decided aryan bias it wasnt that hed never taken money from people that werent out to make the world safe for bigots but he seemed to prefer to work with them hed been linked to espionage that specialized in helping paler people either stay in power or get power over people that were less pale the file contained a list of known associates with pictures of some of them a few of the pictures were the equivalent of mug shots but most were grainy faxes of surveillance photos faces in profile faces caught dashing to cars into and out of buildings in distant countries it was almost as if the men knew they were being photographed or feared they would be there were two faces that i kept coming back totwo menone in profile wearing a hat and the other a blur of face staring out at the camera obrien came over to stand beside me looking down at the two pictures that id laid side by side on the edge of her desk do you recognize them im not sure i touched the edge of the pictures as if that would make them more real make them give up their secrets you keep coming back to them she said i know but its not like i know themknow them more like ive seen them somewhere somewhere recent i cant place them but i know ive seen them or two people very similar i peered down at the grainy images gray and white and black made up of little dots as if the fax was a copy of a copy of a copy who knew where the original had come from obrien seemed to pick up what i was thinking because she said youre working from faxes of bad surveillance photos youd be lucky to recognize your own mother in these i nodded then picked up the one with the big darkhaired man in it he was about to get into a car there was a generic older building behind him but i wasnt a student of architecture it told me nothing the man was looking down as if watching his step off a curb so i didnt have a full front view even maybe if i could see a front shot or did they send us all they had they sent me all they had or thats what they said the look on her face said she wasnt sure she believed that but she had to act as if she did theyre pretty worried that more of heinricks friends might be in the states were going to be giving a stack of these photos to the patrol cops with orders to follow and report but not to apprehend you think theyre that dangerous i asked she gave me a look youve read heinricks résumé what do you think i shrugged yeah he sounds dangerous i went over the list of known associates again none of these rings a bell i closed the folder and laid it behind the two pictures i picked up the second photo this time the one of the palehaired man his hair looked white in the photo white or a very very pale blond there wasnt much background to help me judge his size it was a fullface shot up close only his upper body showing he was leaning over a table talking this was a better photo more detailed but i still couldnt place him was this taken with one of those concealed spy cameras why do you ask i moved the photo so she could look straight down on it its an odd angle for one thing up like the camera is low about hip level you dont usually take photos from the hip second hes talking but not looking at the camera and its too natural id bet good money he doesnt know hes being photographed you could be right she took the photo from me and looked at it turning it a little to get a better angle on it why does it matter how the photo was taken her eyes had gone nice and cold good cop eyes suspicious wanting to know what i knew look ive watched you guys try to question heinrick and his friend they sound like a fucking broken record you can hold them for seventytwo hours but they can spend every hour of that time saying nothing yeah she said we could go fishing tell heinrick that his friends really need to watch themselves better you cant tell where these photos were taken the blond is just in a room obrien shook her head no we dont know enough to go fishing not yet if i remember where ive seen these guys we might i said she looked at me as if id finally done something interesting we might her voice was cautious even if i dont remember where i saw them if it gets close to the seventytwo hours can we try bluffing why she asked i crossed my arms over my ribs and fought the urge to hug myself because i want to know why this bugger is following me frankly if he wasnt following me specifically id be more worried about st louis in general she frowned why if heinrick and crew were in town in general then id say we have terrorism to worry about probably something with a racial bent i touched the folder without opening it though hes worked a few times for people of color as the saying goes wonder how he justified that to his white supremacist friends maybe hes just a mercenary obrien said maybe the fact that hes worked for the white supremacist is coincidental they were the people who had the money at the time he needed it i looked up at her you believe that no she said and smiled you think more like a cop than i thought you would blake ill give you that thanks i took it as high praise which it was no if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck its a duck and his dossier reads like hes a white supremacist that isnt above taking money from the very people he wants to destroy hes a racist not a zealot i nodded i think youre right she looked down at me for a second or two then nodded as if shed made up her mind if the seventytwo hours gets close you can come and well play go fish but i think were going to need better bait than a couple of grainy photos i nodded i agree ill do my best to come up with more before we have to beard the lion in its den beard the lion in its den she shook her head what have you been reading i shook my head i have friends that read to me if there arent pictures im pretty much lost she gave me another of those looks half disgust half trying not to smile i doubt that blake i doubt that very much actually micah nathaniel and i were taking turns reading aloud to each other at night micah had been shocked that neither nathaniel nor i had ever read the original peter pan so wed started with that id then discovered that micah had never read charlottes web nathaniel had read the book to himself as a child but no one had ever read it to him in fact he didnt ever remember being read to as a child that was all he said just that hed never had anyone ever read aloud to him when he was small but that one bit of knowledge seemed to speak volumes so we were taking turns reading aloud to each other a bedtime ritual that was more homey and strangely more intimate than sex or feeding the ardeur you didnt read your favorite childhood stories aloud to people you fucked you read them to people you loved there was that word again love i was beginning to think i didnt know what it meant blake blake you in there i blinked up at obrien and realized shed been talking to me and i hadnt heard her sorry really i guess im thinking too hard whatever you were thinking about didnt look too happy what was i supposed to say some of it was some of it wasnt like most of my personal life what i said out loud was sorry its unnerved me a little to have someone like heinrick after my ass you didnt look scared blake you looked like you were thinking too damned hard ive had hit men after me before but not terrorists who specialize in politics there is nothing political about what i do the moment i heard it leave my mouth i realized i was wrong there were two types of politics that i was deeply involved in furry and vampire shit had belle hired him no it didnt feel right id touched her mind too intimately she still thought she could own me she wouldnt destroy what she believed she could control or use richard was still digging out of the political mess hed made of his pack when he tried to make them a true democracy you knowone vote per person it so hadnt worked because hed forgotten to keep that presidential veto power he was ulfric wolf king but hed gutted the office of ulfric and still hadnt built back up the respect and power base he needed i was helping him rebuild but some of the pack saw my involvement as another sign of weakness hell so did richard but to my knowledge no one was trying to move in on richards pack neighboring packs were giving us a wide berth until the dust settled there wasnt anyone worthy of challenging him for pack leader except sylvie and she had held off because she liked richard and didnt want to have to kill him if richard hadnt been afraid of what sylvie would do as ulfric he might have just stepped down for her but he knew and sylvie had admitted that her first order of business would be to kill anyone she suspected of disloyalty that could be a dozen or two richard wasnt willing for that to happen but sylvie would have come directly to my face if she had a problem so i looked up at obrien she was watching me trying to read me i had no idea what shed seen as the different thoughts played over my face i was definitely not on top of my game today talk to me blake she said i decided for halftruth better than nothing i was thinking that theres one type of politics i do participate in and that is vampires ive got close ties to the master of the city of st louis i dont think heinrick would knowingly work for a vampire but he might not know most people like this work through intermediaries so no one ever sees faces why would some vampire want to kill you just because youre dating the master of the city i shrugged the last time someone tried to kill me it was for pretty much that reason they thought it would weaken the master make his concentration bad she leaned on the edge of her desk arms crossed on her stomach you really think thats it i frowned and shook my head i dont know i dont think so but its the only politics i could think of ill put a note in the file pass it up the line she said we could offer you some police protection you got the extra budget for that she smiled but not like she was happy heinrick has terrorist in his dossier trust me right now with the tword in the picture i could swing the man power wouldnt that be person power i said straight faced looking her dead in the eye she snorted oh please im not that pc and i dont think you are either sorry couldnt resist besides youve worked with the police long enough to know that it usually is man power too true i said how about the police escort or some surveillance let me think about it i said she pushed away from her desk she didnt exactly tower over me but she was tall why wont you let us help protect you ms blake could i have a copy of the report she smiled but it wasnt a pleasant smile apply through channels im sure youll have one in a day or two cant i just use the xerox machine no she said why not because you wouldnt take police protection which means you are hiding something maybe but if you give me copies of the photos i might be able to id them how i shrugged ive got a few connections you think your connections give better intelligence than the government lets just say that i know the motives and priorities of my connections i cant say the same for every branch of my government we looked at each other for a few heartbeats i wont try and debate this with you good now can i have a copy of at least the photos no and it had that ring to it of finality youre being childish i said she smiled but it was more a baring of teeth a friendly snarl and youre hiding something if it comes back and bites this investigation on the ass ill have your badge for it i thought about saying try and see how far you get but i didnt i was new enough to the badge that i wasnt really sure what i could lose it over and what i couldnt i probably should look into those kinds of details i dont know enough about why heinrick was trailing me to hide anything obrien so you say i sighed and stood up fine have a nice day blake go talk to your connections and see where it gets you ill stick with the government and interpol she gave an exaggerated shrug call me oldfashioned suit yourself i said just go she said i went i opened the jeep and heard my cell phone ringing i kept leaving it in the car forgetting i had it i slid onto the warm leather of the seats fumbling for the phone from under the seat even as i closed the door behind me yeah it would have been cooler with the door open but i didnt want my legs hanging out the open door while i lay across the seat not because bad guys were after me just normal girl paranoia i finally dug the phone out on the fourth and last ring before it went over to message mode yeah its me what i sounded rude and out of breath but at least i picked up ma petite jeanclaude made the word almost a question as if he wasnt a hundred percent sure hed gotten me with the gearshift digging into my side and the overheated leather against my arm i still felt better better to hear his voice better to know hed called me first he couldnt be all that mad at me if he called first its me jeanclaude i forgot the phone in the jeep again sorry i wanted to say other things but i couldnt figure out how to get the right words out of my mouth part of the problem was i wasnt sure what the right words were the police have taken jason he said what did you say the police have come and taken jason away his voice was matter of fact empty even which usually meant he was hiding a lot of emotions none of which he wanted to share i moved over an inch so the gearshift wasnt stabbing me and lay on the seats for a moment the first hint of panic was fluttering around in my gut why did they take him my voice sounded almost as normal and matter of fact as jeanclaudes for questioning about a murder his empty cultured voice said it as if the mword hadnt been there what murder i asked and my voice was getting emptier sergeant zerbrowski said youd figure it out that bringing jason to a crime scene was a bad idea i was not aware you took anyone on your crime scene visits you make it sound like im visiting friends i meant no insult but why was jason with you i wasnt feeling well enough to drive and the police didnt want to wait for me to feel better why were you unwell enough not to drive well it seemed to be because asher took a hell of a lot of blood and i was having a bad reaction to having my mind rolled it left me feeling a bit sick how sick he asked and there was a note of something in his empty voice now something i couldnt quite place i fainted a couple of times and threw up okay now lets concentrate on the current crisis did they actually arrest jason i could not get a good sense of that but i think not they did take him away in restraints though thats standard with any known or suspected lycanthropes i said i pushed myself up so i could sit on the seat instead of lying across it the front of a jeep just wasnt made for lying across you do know that if they didnt arrest him then hes free to walk out of questioning at any time it is a pretty theory ma petite now he sounded tired its the law i said perhaps for humans he said voice mild i couldnt keep the indignation out of my voice the law applies to everyone jeanclaude thats the way the system works he gave a soft laugh and for once it was just a laugh with nothing otherworldly about it you are not usually so naive ma petite if the law doesnt apply evenly to everybody then it doesnt work at all i will not argue this with you ma petite if zerbrowski picked him up i know where they took jason im not that far from rpit headquarters what are you going to do he asked voice still holding the soft edge of his laughter get jason out i said buckling on my seat belt and trying to pin the phone against my shoulder enough to start the jeep do you think that is possible he asked sure i said and nearly dropped the phone but i got the jeep started i seemed to be having a little trouble coordinating everything today you sound so confident ma petite i am confident i was the fluttering feeling in my stomach wasnt ive got to go good fortune ma petite i hope you rescue our wolf ill do my best of that there is little doubt je taime ma petite i love you too we hung up at least wed ended with i love you it was better than screaming at each other i dropped the phone on the seat beside me and put the jeep in gear one emergency at a time save jason contact some people i knew to see if they knew anything about heinrick then prepare for the big banquet with musette and company oh and figure out how to keep the mess with asher from driving a permanent wedge between jeanclaude and me just another day in my life this was one of those days when i thought that maybe a new life a different life wouldnt be so bad but where the hell had i put the receipt and could you return something that was over twenty years old where do you go to get a new life when your old one has you so puzzled you dont know how to fix it wish i knew no one stopped me at the door no one stopped me at the stairs in fact people kept saying hi anita how you doing i wasnt an official member of the regional preternatural investigation team but id worked with them all for so long that i was like the office furniture something that was there accepted even expected it was detective jessica arnet that finally said something to me that wasnt just hi wheres that cutie you always have in tow which one i asked she laughed at that and blushed a little it was the blush that got my attention she always flirted with nathaniel but id never thought much about it until i saw her blush you do seem to have more than your share of cuties but i meant the one with violet eyes id have bet money that she knew exactly what nathaniels name was he stayed home today i said she laid the stack of folders down on a desk not her own and pushed back her hair from her face there wasnt enough of her dark hair to push back it looked like an old gesture from when shed had longer hair the short barely belowearlevel cut really didnt flatter her face but the face was still good triangular with delicate bones that framed her smile nicely id never really noticed but she was pretty did nathaniel ever want to date just date not the dominance and submission stuff but like dinner and a movie someday id have the ardeur under control and wouldnt need a pomme de sang right that had been the plan so nathaniel should likedate shouldnt he if i wasnt going to keep him he should date i had a headache starting right between my eyes detective arnet almost touched my arm but stopped in midgesture are you alright i forced a smile looking for zerbrowski she told me what room he was in because she didnt know she wasnt supposed to hell i wasnt even sure she wasnt supposed to technically this was part of the investigation that dolph had wanted my input on so i had a right to be there when they questioned suspects in my head it all sounded logical but a little desperate as if i were trying way too hard to convince myself i went up on tiptoe outside the door so i could look in the little window television will make you think that all police interrogation rooms have huge oneway mirrors that take up almost an entire wall very few departments have either the budget or the space for that kind of thing television uses it because its more dramatic and makes camera work easier it seemed to me that real life is dramatic enough without big windows and there are no good camera angles only pain or maybe i was just in a rotten mood i wanted a quick peek into the room to make a hundred percent sure i had the right place jason was at the little table zerbrowski was sitting across from him but what got me flatfooted was that dolph was leaning against the far wall zerbrowski had said he was on leave for a couple of weeks had zerbrowski lied to me that didnt feel right but what was dolph doing here i gave one sharp knock on the door i waited steeling myself to be calm or at least to look calm zerbrowski opened the door a crack his eyes looked surprised behind his glasses this isnt a good time he said he tried to tell me with his eyes that dolph was in the room i know dolphs here zerbrowski i thought he was supposed to be on leave for a few weeks zerbrowski sighed but his eyes were angry angry at me i think for not slinking off and making things worse making things worse was one of my specialties zerbrowski should have known that by now lieutenant storr is here because he is still head of the regional preternatural investigation team and he brought this suspect to our attention suspect why is jason a suspect you dont want to do this in the hallway anita no i dont i want to come in the room so we can all talk like civilized human beings youre the one keeping me out in the hallway he licked his lips and almost turned and looked at dolph but fought the urge come in he lowered his voice to a whisper but stay on this side of the room i followed zerbrowski inside and went where he motioned so that i ended up with the table between me and dolph it was almost as if zerbrowski didnt trust what dolph would do you are not letting her sit in dolph said zerbrowski squared his shoulders and faced dolph we asked her to help us on this crime scene dolph i didnt he said actually yeah you did i said dolph opened his mouth then closed it in a tight thin line he hugged his arms so tight it looked like it hurt as if he didnt trust what his hands would do if they werent wrapped around something there was a look of such rage in his eyes he usually had some of the best cop eyes id ever seen empty gave nothing away today his eyes gave everything away but i didnt understand where the anger was coming from jason was sitting at the end of the table trying to seem as small and inoffensive as possible since hes not much taller than i am he was doing a good job of it zerbrowski shut the door and sat on the side of the table close to dolph leaving me the chair farther away i didnt sit why did you pull jason in he has defensive wounds on his body consistent with the crime you dont actually believe that jason was involved in that i searched for a word slaughter do you hes a werewolf and hes got defensive wounds dolph said if he didnt rape our vic then he raped somebody youre here to observe lieutenant zerbrowski said but his face said plainly that he would have rather been anywhere than sitting here telling dolph to mind his own business dolph started to say something then stopped himself by force of will alone fine fine sergeant carry on those last two words held more heat than a forest fire wait i said did you say rape we found semen at the first murder site zerbrowski said the crucifixion i asked no dolph said harshly the woman who was ripped apart semen doesnt mean rape at a scene like that just that he enjoyed himself its sick but it doesnt necessarily mean true sexual contact i saw the body there wasnt enough left of her to know whether he touched her like that or not i had a thought an awful thought please tell me you dont mean the head zerbrowski shook his head no scattered over the scene it was almost a relief almost so why did dolph say rape there was a little more left of the second female vic zerbrowski said i looked at him i dont remember being notified about a second attack you didnt need to know dolph said you were right i called you in on the first one but i didnt make the same mistake twice i ignored dolph as best i could and looked at zerbrowski he mouthed later fine zerbrowski would fill me in when we had some nondolph time fine great i couldnt do anything about the psycho shapeshifter we had running around town not right that second but i might be able to do something about the current disaster what did jason say when you asked where he got scratched up said a man doesnt kiss and tell zerbrowski said even i thought that one was lame i looked at jason he shrugged as if to say what was i supposed to say he knew me well enough to know i wouldnt want him talking out of school he was right on that i so didnt want zerbrowski and dolph to know hell i didnt want anyone to know but my embarrassment wasnt worth jason getting locked up i sighed and spoke the truth the scratches arent defensive wounds hes cut up anita and we got the polaroids to prove it zerbrowski said dolph noticed some scratches at the first scene theyre gone but now hes got fresh wounds i cut him up my voice sounded bland because i was fighting to sound bland dolph gave a sound that was more snort than laugh no words were needed to say he didnt believe me zerbrowski said his out loud shop it somewhere else anita were not buying i raised the sleeves on my shirt and showed my own healing scratches when i was afraid id hurt him more i scratched myself zerbrowskis eyes went wide jesus blake you always this rough youll never find out zerbrowski if that was a yes then im okay with that he almost touched some of the deeper scratches on my arm then stopped and almost touched the scratches on jasons arms i hope the sex was good jason looked down at the tabletop and did his best impression of an awshucks look he managed to look coy and pleased with himself all at the same time thats answer enough i said jason flashed me a grin that made his baby blues sparkle whatever you say mistress i gave him a very mean look that didnt dim his enjoyment one bit dolph pushed away from the wall to peer over the table at my arm i dont buy this anita maybe you scratched your own arms up on the way here to give him an alibi the scratches arent that fresh dolph he started to grab my arm but i stepped out of reach i dont want to be manhandled again thanks anyway he leaned across the table at me and jason began to ease his chair back as if he didnt want to be in the middle youre lying dolph said a shapeshifter heals anything but silver and wounds from another monster real quick you taught me that anita he should be healed by now if you really were the one who hurt him wouldnt that same logic dictate that if the scratches were from the female victim then theyd already have healed not if they come from the second victim dolph slapped that bit of information down as if it were a blow and in a way it was i looked at zerbrowski i cant debate the healed scratches thing if i dont know the time line i need a time he opened his mouth but dolph answered why so you can give the perfect alibi gee zerbrowski i dont see your hand up dolphs ass but it must be because every time i ask you a question the answer comes out his mouth i was leaning across the table now too his scratches are older than yours anita dolph said voice almost a growl of its own more healed youll never prove in court that they happened at the same time hes a shapeshifter he heals faster i taught you that remember are you really admitting that you fucked him dolph said i was too angry to flinch at his choice of words i prefer the term made love to fucked but yeah we did the nasty if that was true the marks would have healed completely by now if youre only human like you keep telling me the headache between my eyes felt like something was trying to stab its way out of my skull i really wasnt in any mood for this what i am or what i am not is none of your damn business but im telling you that i marked him up in the heat of passion more than that chances are good he was with me when the second murder took place we can give you times if you want times would be good zerbrowski had scooted his chair a little farther down the table but he hadnt deserted his post hed stayed closer to all that quivering rage than most people would have i had to think about it but i managed to give him approximate times for the last two days truthfully i wasnt much good on alibiing jason for the first murder but on the second i was pretty sure i had him covered zerbrowski was doing his best to give blank cop face while he wrote down what i said the entire interview was being recorded but zerbrowski like dolph liked to write things down i hadnt really thought about it before but zerbrowski might have learned that habit from dolph dolph stayed standing near the table looming over all of us as i spoke zerbrowski asked small questions to nail the times as clearly as possible jason stayed as quiet and still as he could through all of it his hands clasped together on the table head down eyes taking small quick glances at all of us without moving his head or body he reminded me of a rabbit hiding in the long grass hoping that if he just stayed quiet enough still enough that the dogs wouldnt find him the analogy should have been laughable i mean he was a werewolf but it wasnt funny because it was accurate being a werewolf didnt protect you from the human laws most of the time it hurt you sometimes it even got you killed we werent in that kind of danger yet but that could change a shapeshifter accused of murdering a human got a speedy trial and an execution if a shapeshifter was declared rogue one that was actively hunting humans and the police couldnt capture it then you could get a court order of execution just like for a vampire it worked almost the same way a vampire that was suspected of murder but was still eluding capture and deemed a danger to the public could have an order of execution issued by a judge once you had the order of execution in hand you could kill it when you found it just insert shapeshifter for vampire into the formula and it worked the same way there was no trial no anythingjust hunt it down and kill it id done a few jobs like that not many but a few thered been a movement a few years ago to make a magicusing human subject to orders of execution but too many human rights organizations had kicked a fit as a magicusing human i was happy as someone who had executed people on orders of the court i wasnt sure how i would have felt about hunting a human being down and killing them id killed humans before when they threatened my life or the lives of those i held dear but selfdefense even proactive selfdefense wasnt quite the same thing a human witch or wizard got a trial but if they were convicted of using magic for murder it was an automatic death sentence ninetynine percent of the time the witch or wizard was convicted jurors just didnt like the idea of people who could kill by magic walking around free one of my goals in life was to stay the hell out of a courtroom i knew jason hadnt done anything wrong but i also knew enough about the way the system worked to know that for those of us who werent exactly human sometimes innocence didnt matter much can anyone else verify these times zerbrowski asked a few people yeah i said a few people dolph said he looked disgusted and i didnt understand this emotion either you dont even know who the father is do you that made me give him a deer in headlights blink i dont know what you mean he gave me a look as if id already lied to him detective reynolds told us her little secret i looked at him across the table he was still leaning over and i was still standing so we were almost eyetoeye so he gave a sound between a snort and a cough she wasnt the only one who passed out at the murder scene and she wasnt the only one who threw up he looked as if hed made a great point driven it home with a surgeons precision i frowned and blinked at him im sorry what are you talking about i let myself look as confused as i felt dont be coy anita youre not good at it im not being coy dolph youre making no fucking sense then an idea popped into my head but that couldnt be it dolph wouldnt think i looked at him and thought maybe he would think that are you implying that im pregnant implying no i relaxed a little i shouldnt have im asking do you know who the father is or have there been too many to guess zerbrowski stood and he was close enough to dolph that it forced him to move a little way from the table i think you should go now anita zerbrowski said dolph was glaring at me i should have been angry but i was too surprised ive thrown up at murder scenes before zerbrowski moved a little back from the table he had a resigned look on his face like someone who saw the train coming down the track and knew nobody was going to get off in time i still didnt think things were that bad youve never passed out before dolph said i was sick dolph too sick to drive myself you seem fine now he said voice low and rumbling filled with that anger that seemed always just below the surface lately i shrugged i guess it was just one of those viruses it wouldnt have anything to do with the fang mark on your neck would it my hand went up to it then i forced myself not to touch it truthfully id forgotten about it i was sick dolph even i get sick have you been tested for vlads syndrome yet i took in a deep breath let it out then said fuck it dolph wasnt going to let this one go he wanted to fight i could do that hell a nice uncomplicated screaming match sounded almost appealing ill say this once im not pregnant i dont care if you believe me because youre not my father youre not my uncle brother or anything you were my friend but even thats up for grabs right now youre either one of us or youre one of them anita one of what i asked i was pretty sure of the answer but i needed to hear it out loud monster he said and it was almost a whisper are you calling me a monster i wasnt whispering but my voice was low and careful im saying youre going to have to choose whether youre one of them or one of us he pointed to jason when he said them you join humans against vampires or some other right wing group dolph no but im beginning to agree with them the only good vampire is a dead one is that it they are dead anita he took that step closer that zerbrowskis moving had given him they are fucking corpses that dont have enough sense to stay in their godforsaken graves according to the law theyre living beings with rights and protection under the law maybe the law was wrong on this one part of me wanted to say you know that this is being recorded part of me was glad hed said it if he came off sounding like a bigoted crazy then it would help keep jason safe the fact that it wouldnt help dolphs career did bother me but not enough to sacrifice jason id like to save all my friends but if someone is bent on selfdestruction there is only so much you can do you cant shovel other peoples shit for them not unless theyre willing to pick up a shovel and help dolph wasnt helping he got down low hands flat to the table and pushed his face into jasons jason moved back as far as he could in the chair zerbrowski looked at me and i gave wild eyes we both knew that if dolph touched a suspect the way hed touched me earlier his career was well and truly over it looks so human but its not dolph said i didnt like the use of the it for one of my friends did you really let him touch you him see even if you hate the monsters its hard to keep straight in your own head whats an it and whats a him yes i said zerbrowski was moving around dolph trying to get to jason to get between them i think dolph turned to look at me still bent over low way too close to jason for anyones comfort and the bite on your neck was that the bloodsucker youre fucking no i said that was a new one im fucking two of them now he staggered almost as if hed taken a blow he leaned heavily on the table and for just a second i thought hed fall into jasons lap but he recovered himself with a visible effort zerbrowski touched the big mans arm easy there lieutenant dolph let zerbrowski sit him down he made no reaction when the sergeant eased jason out of the chair and farther away from dolph dolph wasnt looking at them his painfilled eyes were all for me i knew you were coffin bait i didnt know you were a whore i felt my own face go hard and cold maybe if i hadnt been so tired so stressedbut there was no real excuse for what i said next except that dolph had hurt me and i wanted to hurt him hows that grandchildren problem coming dolph you still got a vampire for a soontobe daughterinlaw i felt zerbrowski react to the news and knew in that moment that only i had known you really shouldnt piss off people youve confided in dolph the moment i said it i wished i hadnt but it was too late too fucking late he came up out of the chair hands under the table and upended it with a tremendous crash onto the floor we all scattered zerbrowski stood in front of jason against the far wall i took a corner near the door dolph trashed the room there was no other word for it the chairs hit the walls and the table followed he finally picked one chair up and seemed to take a special grievance against it he smashed the metal chair against the floor over and over the door to the interrogation room opened police filled the door guns drawn i think they expected to see a rampaging werewolf the sight of a rampaging dolph stopped them dead in the doorway theyd have probably cheerfully shot the werewolf but i dont think they wanted to shoot dolph of course no one volunteered to arm wrestle him either the metal chair folded in upon itself and dolph collapsed to his knees his harsh breathing filled the room as if the walls themselves were breathing in and out i went to the door and chased everyone back i said things like its okay hell be fine just go i wasnt sure hed be okay or fine but i really did want them to go no one needs to see their lieutenant lose it it shakes their faith in him hell my faith wasnt doing all that well i closed the door behind them and looked across the room at zerbrowski we just stared at each other i dont think either of us knew what to say or even what to do dolphs voice came as if from deep inside him as if he had to pull it up handoverhand like the bucket in a well my sons going to be a vampire he looked at me with a mixture of such pain and anger that i didnt know what to do with it you happy now he said i realized that there were tears drying on his face hed cried as hed destroyed everything but he wasnt crying as he said my daughterinlaw wanted to bring him over so hed be twentyfive forever he made a sound that was halfway between a moan and a scream saying i was sorry didnt seem to be enough i couldnt think of anything that would be enough but sorry was all i had to offer im sorry dolph why why sorry vampires are people too the tears started again silent youd never have known he was crying if you hadnt been looking directly at him yeah im dating a bloodsucker and some of my friends dont have a pulse but i still dont approve of bringing humans over he looked up at me and the pain was flooding over the anger it made his eyes harder and easier to meet all at the same time why why i didnt think he was really asking me why i believed what i believed about vampires i think it was the universal cry of why me why my son my daughter my mother my country my home why me why isnt the universe fair why doesnt everyone get a happy ending i had no answer for that why i wished to god i did i answered the implied why because i couldnt answer the other more painful questions i dont know anymore but i do know that it creeps me out every time i meet someone i knew first as a live human then as a dead vampire i shrugged it just seems i dont know unnerving he gave a big hiccupping sob unnerving he half laughed and half cried then he covered his face with his hands and he gave himself over to crying zerbrowski and i just stood there i dont know which of us felt more helpless he walked carefully around the room bringing jason with him dolph sensed the movement and said he goes nowhere he had nothing to do with this i said dolph wiped at his face angrily you havent alibied him for the first murder youre looking for a serial killer if a suspect is cleared of one of the crimes then hes usually innocent of all of them he shook his head stubbornly we can keep him seventytwo hours and were going to i looked around the destroyed room met zerbrowskis eyes and wasnt sure dolph had enough clout to make those kinds of pronouncements anymore the full moon is in a few days i said well put him in a secured facility dolph said secured facilities were run by the government they were places where new lycanthropes could go and be sure of not accidentally hurting anyone the idea was youd stay until you got control of your beast then theyd let you out to resume your life that was the theory the reality was that once you were signed in voluntarily or otherwise you almost never got out the aclu had started the years of court battles it would take to get them outlawed or made unconstitutional i looked at zerbrowski he stared at me with a sort of growing horror and weariness i wasnt sure he had the juice to keep jason out of permanent lockup if dolph pushed this couldnt be happening i couldnt let it happen i looked back at dolph jason has been a werewolf for years he has perfect control over his beast why send him to a secured facility he belongs in one dolph said and the hatred had chased back the pain he doesnt belong in a lockup and you know it dolph just glared at me hes dangerous dolph said why hes a werewolf anita so he needs to be locked up because hes a werewolf yes zerbrowski looked ill locked up just because hes a werewolf i said it i wanted him to hear what he was saying to disagree to come to his senses but he didnt yeah he said and he said it on tape evidenced untakebackable it could and probably would be used against him there was nothing i could do to help dolph but i knew in that moment that jason wouldnt be going to a secured facility half of me was relieved half of me was so scared for dolph that i could taste metal on my tongue zerbrowski went for the door pushing jason ahead of him well give you a few minutes alone lieutenant he motioned at me with his head dolph didnt try and stop us he just knelt there face shocked as if hed finally heard his words finally realized what he might have done we all went out the door and zerbrowski closed it firmly behind us everyone in the squad room was looking at us they tried not to be but everyone had found something to do to keep them close at hand id never seen so many detectives so eager to do paperwork at their desks or even somebody elses as long as the desk was close to the hallway zerbrowski looked at the near wall of people and said break it up people we dont need a crowd they all looked at each other as if asking should we move should we listen to him they would have moved without question for dolph but finally they did move drifting off in ones and twos to other parts of the big room the ones who were at their own desks close to the action seemed to remember phone calls they needed to make zerbrowski bent close to me and spoke low take mr schuyler with you and go whatll dolph say i asked he shook his head i dont know but i know that schuyler here doesnt deserve to go to one of those facilities thanks sarge jason said and he smiled zerbrowski didnt smile back but he did say youre a pain in the ass sometimes schuyler and youre a furball but you arent a monster they had one of those guy moments women would have hugged but they were men which meant that they didnt even share a handshake thanks zerbrowski zerbrowski gave a weak smile good to know im making somebody happy today he turned back to me we looked at each other whats going to happen to dolph i asked he looked even more solemn which considering hed looked downright depressed before said a lot i dont know dolph had said enough on tape to lose him his job if it got out hell if the head of rpit was this prejudiced it might bring all their cases under review going back to the beginning make sure he takes the two weeks of personal time zerbrowski keep him out of here i know that he said now i shook my head im sorry of course you do just go for now anita please go i touched zerbrowskis arm dont go back in there without some backup okay perry told me what dolph did to you the other day dont worry ill be careful he glanced back at the closed door please anita go before he comes out i wanted to say something something comforting or helpful but there wasnt anything the only helpful thing i could do was leave so we did leaving felt cowardly staying would have been stupid when its a choice between being cowardly or stupid i choose stupid every single time today i opted for the better part of valor besides i wasnt sure that dolph might come out of the room like some rampaging bull and try to attack jason or me we might be able to hush it up in an interrogation room but if he trashed the entire squad room it would mean the end of his career right now he maybe had shot his career in the foot even probably but maybe and probably were better than certainly i left zerbrowski to pick up the pieces because i didnt know how i was so much better at destroying things than fixing them jason leaned his head back against the passenger seat of the jeep his eyes were closed and he looked weary there were hollows under his eyes even with them closed jason was fairskinned not pale he didnt tan dark but nicely golden today he looked vampire pale and his skin gave the illusion that it was too thin as if some great hand had been rubbing around his eyes and across his face rubbing him down like youd worry a pebble in your hand you look like shit i said he smiled without opening his eyes you sweettalker no i mean it you look terrible are you going to be okay about tonight the banquet and everything he opened his eyes enough to slide his gaze towards me do i have a choice do any of us really have a choice put that way no i guess not my voice suddenly sounded tired too he smiled again his head still back against the seat eyes almost closed if the lieutenant hadnt popped a major gasket would i be on my way to a secured facility right now i buckled myself into the drivers seat and started the jeep you didnt answer me he said voice low but insistent i put the jeep in gear maybe i dont know if dolph hadnt been popping a major gasket as you put it then hed never have even thought of putting you in a facility i eased out of the parking area but he might have called you in for questioning you are pretty scratched up and you are a werewolf i shrugged he stretched his arms up over his head arching his body against the seat stretching all the way to his toes it was an oddly graceful gesture the movement flashed the cuts on his arms making his tshirt sleeves ride up and he added a writhing movement like a shudder or a wave that flowed from the tip of his fingers down his arms his chest the arch of his neck his waist the ripeness of his hips down the muscles of his thighs to his calves to his toes a loud honking and the screech of brakes brought me back to the road and the fact that i was driving i managed not to hit anyone but it was close i threaded my way through a forest of rude gestures and jasons laughter i feel better now he said laughter still thick in his voice i glanced at him frowning his blue eyes were sparkling his face suddenly glowing with glee i struggled but finally had to smile back jason had always been able to do that to me make me smile when i didnt want to what is so damned funny i said but there was an edge of laughter in my voice that i couldnt quite swallow i was trying to flirt and it worked youve never reacted to my body before not even when i was naked i concentrated on the road really hard while the blush burned my face he chortled youre blushing for me oh god yes keep it up and you are going to piss me off i turned onto clark and headed for the circus you dont get it do you he looked at me and i couldnt read the look on his face puzzlement delight and something else get what i asked im not invisible on your guyradar anymore what you notice men anita but youd never noticed me i was beginning to feel like the court eunuch i gave him a quick frown before turning back to the road i did not want to risk another near miss id had my adrenaline rush for the day come on you know what i mean i sighed maybe maybe its because you dont do casual sex but it means more to you than just fucking even with the ardeur on if id been standing i would have shuffled my feet i had to settle for concentrating really hard on my driving if youve got a point to make jason make it dont get all grumpy anita my point is that even if we never touch each other again im on your radar screen now you see me you really see me he looked deeply content i was confused when im confused i usually try and concentrate on work do you think the lycanthrope thats raping and killing these women is local i know hes not jason said i looked at him because he sounded so positive how can you be that sure it was a werewolf it wasnt one of our pack there are no werewolves in the st louis area that are not part of the thronnos rokke clan how do you know it was a werewolf it could have been any of a dozen types of halfmen predators it smelled like wolf he frowned at me didnt you smell it in the house mostly all i smelled was blood jason sometimes i forget youre not one of us yet is that a compliment or a complaint he grinned neither how can you be so sure it wasnt one of our werewolves it didnt smell like pack forget that i am human and my nose isnt four hundred times more sensitive and scent discriminating and explain it to me simply my nose in human form isnt as good as my nose in wolf form the world is so alive scenting is almost like sight if youve never experienced it its hard to explain but in human form touch is probably secondary to sight in wolf form scent is secondary to sight or in some cases ahead of it okay say thats so what does that mean for this investigation it means that i know the killer is a werewolf and i know hes not one of ours your opinion wont fly in court i said i didnt think it would honest i would have mentioned what id smelled in the house sooner if i hadnt assumed you smelled it too he looked worried now and suddenly younger because of it all schoolboy charm what hed said got me thinking most breeds of scent hounds wont track a werewolf or any wereanimal for that matter they go all shitface howling and whining and freaking out they basically tell the hunters youre on your own i said i knew dogs didnt like us but i didnt know they didnt like us that much depends on the breed of dog but most dogs dont want to mess with you guys i cant say i blame them so i guess going down to the pound and picking out a dog is out then youd set the place on its ear okay did you have a point he asked and grinned again yes could a werewolf in wolf form track this killer jason thought about that face all serious again probably but i dont think the police will go for it they dont like us much either probably they wont but ill float it by zerbrowski when he calls youre sure hes going to call yes why because weve got two dead women and its probably all over the media if you watched television read a newspaper occasionally or even listened to the radio you might know these things jason said probably true but theres heat to solve this case and more innocent lives at risk zerbrowski will call because theyre grasping at straws or they wouldnt have brought you in if dolph had a more promising lead even out of his head like he is he wouldnt have been busting your chops or mine youre sure of that hes a cop above all else if he had anything else to chase hed have been out chasing it not wasting time with you i dont know anita i didnt see much of the cop left today he seems like a man whos let his personal problems eat everything else i would have argued if i could have but i couldnt ill mention the idea to zerbrowski if they get desperate enough they may go for it how desperate would they have to be i turned the jeep into the parking lot of the circus maybe two more bodies maybe three using a werewolf to track a werewolf might appeal to zerbrowskis sense of humor but getting the upper brass to agree would be the problem two more women maybe three jesus anita why not try the desperate measures before things get so damned bad the police are like most people jason they dont like thinking outside the box using a werewolf in animal form as a sort of preternatural scent hound is way outside the freaking box maybe he said but i smelled what was upstairs anita so much blood so much meat a human being shouldnt be reduced to meat and blood arent we all just food on the hoof i tried to make a joke of it but jason looked offended you of all people should know better than that maybe i said feeling my own smile slide away from my face okay im sorry no offense meant but ive had too many shapeshifters threaten me to have any illusions about where i am on the food chain and there are an awful lot of shapeshifters that still believe they are at the top i dont buy that radical crap about us being the top of the evolutionary ladder jason said if we were really the perfection of evolution why have we been around for thousands of years but yet you poor humans outnumber us and usually outkill us i parked near the back door and turned off the engine jason opened his door but said over his shoulder as he was getting out dont fool yourself anita plain old humans kill more of us than we ever will of them he smiled but not like it was funny they even kill more of each other than we kill of them then he was striding across the parking lot he never looked back i had offended jason until that moment i hadnt been sure it was possible to offend him either he was growing up or i was getting less diplomatic since i couldnt possibly get less diplomatic than usual jason must have been growing up for the first time in a while i wondered if he would always be content to be jeanclaudes lap wolf and appetizer and stripper too but you cant strip and feed the vampires forever can you bobby lee met me at the door tall lighthaired and almost shiny compared to the dim storeroom behind him but his mood was not shiny the police should have let me stay with you i dont think they believed my story about making you all deputies you should have just said that we were your bodyguards ill do that next time bobby lee i filled him in on what id learned at the police department while we walked down the nearly endless steps that led from the storeroom to the lower parts of the circus of the damned the stairs were wide enough for four people to walk abreast but the steps themselves were oddly spaced as if whatever they were originally carved for wasnt very human they definitely had not been made for bipeds i dont know the name heinrick he said i looked at him so suddenly that i stumbled and he caught my arm i realized in that moment that i didnt know that much about bobby lee not really you work for rafael you cant be a white supremacist he let go of my arm when he was sure i was solidly on one of the odd wide steps honeychild i know white supremacists that specialize in hating people a little darker than rafael real southerners dont say honeychild he grinned at me they do if you northern bastards expect it were in missouri that aint exactly north it is from where i came from and that was his smiled widened when were not in the middle of an emergency we can sit down and share personal time over a beer or coffee right now concentrate honeychild cause we are neckdeep and sinkin if you dont know heinrick how do you know were sinking i was a mercenary before rafaels people recruited me i know people like heinrick what would somebody like that want with me they were watching you for a reason anita you probably know what that reason is ya just got to think of it i shook my head you sound like a friend of mine hes always telling me that when the shit hits the fan that i should know why the bad guys are after me hes right not always bobby lee not always but the conversation did make me think of edward hed started his professional life as a hit man then killing humans became too easy so he switched to monsters monsters covered a lot of ground for edward no among the vampires and shapeshifters hed include serial killers snuff film actors anyone and anything that caught his fancy though the price had to be right edward didnt work for free well not often sometimes hed work simply for the thrill of chasing something that scared the rest of us mere mortals to death does anyone in rafaels operation have contacts in nongovernmental channels i dont want anyone owing anyone a favor for this i dont want anyone getting in trouble i just want to know what the regular government channels either dont know or arent sharing with the st louis police department we have some exmilitary special forces things like that ill ask around i nodded good and id call edward see if he knew heinrick i started walking down the steps again bobby lee fell in beside me though since he was six feet and i so wasnt it was probably an awkward stride for him he didnt complain and i didnt offer to speed up i wasnt exactly looking forward to seeing jeanclaude or asher again i still didnt know what to say we were within sight of the big heavy door that led into the underground areas it was partially ajar waiting for us by the way jeanclaude and asher request your presence in jeanclaudes room i sighed and my unhappiness must have shown on my face because he touched my arm dont look so glum honey they said something about owing you an apology my eyebrows went up at that an apology them owing me i liked the sound of that i liked the sound of that a lot it wasnt the apology i was expecting but under the circumstances any apology was better than none especially if i wasnt having to give it of course it took them nearly five minutes to get me to hear the apology because once i got a good look at the two of them in their banquet finery i was rendered speechless deaf and damn near blind to anything else i dont think it was magic or vampire trickery they just looked fine asher wore a jacket of pale gold with darker gold embroidery and an edge of true metallic gold thread shot through the embroidery itself there was a touch more gold at collar lapels wide cuffs just enough extra sparkle to mingle with the gold of his hair as it cascaded over his shoulders and add emphasis to the gestures of his hands his shirt was a foam of white frills at chest and wrist like a tamed cloud i knew from rifling through jeanclaudes closet that the shirt wasnt nearly as soft as it appeared the pants were the same pale gold as the jacket with a line of embroidery down either side of his leg boots the color of oyster shells graced his legs their tops folded down just above the knees tied with pale brown leather belts and small gold buckles which could be glimpsed as he moved i noticed asher first maybe because of his powers or maybe because he was all shiny and gold and eyecatching it was like noticing the sun you couldnt help but see it to turn to face the heat of it to bask in the glory of it but often when the sun is high in the sky the moon is up there too a dim memory of what she will be in the night but there nonetheless dim and misty hard and white at night there is only the moon the sun is nowhere to be seen there are no distractions when the moon rules the night sky jeanclaudes coat was a black velvet so soft and fine that it shown like fur it was opera length flowing down to his ankles there was embroidery on the lapels and wide cuffs a deep royal blue the embroidery on the coat matched that on the black vest but the shirt that showed in all that black and royal was the same shade of blue of the silk sheets on the bed cerulean blue a color caught between the skies of day and night it brought out the blue of his eyes so that they were like living jewels set amid the black of his hair the near pure whiteness of his skin the silk was mounded into soft ruffles at his chest and tucked into the vest a gold and sapphire stickpin pierced the ruffles at his chest the stone was almost as large as one of his blue eyes cuff links winked as he gestured gold with sapphires almost as large as the one on his chest the sapphires were that cornflower blue like a drop of caribbean sea water made solid his hair was a mass of black curls it was almost as if hed done less to it than normal letting it tousle around his face and shoulders the black of his hair blended into the black of his coat so that the hair was like a living accessory for a moment i thought he was wearing leather pants until i realized the black boots ran up the entire length of his leg he was wearing black pants but they were barely visible i got just a flash of the back of the boots when he moved the entire length of the boot from ankle to ass was tied with a blue cord that matched the startling blue of his shirt i was caught between going yippyskippy i get to play with them both and running like hell i managed to simply stand there in the middle of the room and not run or fall at their feet like a groupie though that last part took more determination than id ever admit out loud ma petite have you heard a word that we have said i remembered that their mouths had been moving while i gazed at all that masculine splendor but for the life of me i couldnt repeat a word of it i blushed as i admitted not really he looked exasperated hands on hips spreading the coat backwards flashing more of the blue cord as he paced towards me it is as i feared asher she is besotted with you if we cannot he made a waffling motion with his hands and i saw the sapphire ring for the first time winking at me in the candlelight tone this effect down she will be useless tonight if i had dreamt that she could be so totally affected i would have held back jeanclaude turned and faced asher i could see that there was blue embroidery on the back of the coat it made a pattern or picture but i couldnt figure it out through the spill of hair would you mon ami would you truly have withheld such pleasure could you have resisted if i had known this oui i would not have weakened us with musette and her people here not for any pleasure i frowned and shook my head hold it guys they turned and looked at me they both looked surprised i think because i sounded so normal this cant be ashers powers not unless his fascination extends to jeanclaude because you both seem equally nifty i feel like jumping up and down and saying yippee i get to play with them both i blinked and fought not to blush im sorry did i just say that out loud the two men exchanged glances then jeanclaude turned back to me and asher directed that pale blue gaze on me what are you saying ma petite i have never seen you stand so speechless and insensible before me i looked at the two of them and shook my head fine you need a reminder i can do that i walked past them to the fulllength mirror that sat on the opposite side of the room i motioned them both over come on come on we dont have all night they finally drifted over to me looking puzzled i got a little distracted watching them glide towards me in all that silk and leather and sparkly stuff but finally i had them standing in front of the mirror though they werent looking at the mirror they were looking at me still puzzled i finally had to touch each of them lightly on the arm and maneuver them so that the golden cream of ashers coat spilled against the black velvet of jeanclaudes so that black curls intermingled with golden waves i pushed them together until the startling blue of jeanclaudes shirt and the sapphire pin brought out the blue of both of their eyes look at yourselves and tell me that any mere mortal isnt going to stand there and say wow for a few minutes they looked into the mirror they looked at each other and finally jeanclaude smiled asher didnt if it were merely ashers powers then you are correct ma petite it would not extend to me he turned to face me still smiling but i have never seen you this besotted you just havent noticed he shook his head non ma petite i would have noticed such a phenomenon before i shrugged maybe ive never seen you both dressed to kill before the double impact is a little overwhelming he moved away enough to turn in a graceful circle arms out showing off the outfit you think it is too much i smiled almost laughed no not even close but im allowed to stand dumbfounded in the presence of such beauty trиs poetic ma petite looking at the two of you i only wish i was a poet because i cant do you justice you look amazing wondrous specfuckingtacular asher walked to stand at the far end of the room beside the false fireplace it was hard to see in the dimness but tonight someone had put two tapered candles on the mantel piece each encased in crystal so they glimmered like jewels ashers hair sparkled in the uncertain light he put one hand on the mantel his head down to stare at the cold hearth as if the new fire screen jeanclaude had added was trиs fascinating the fire screen was a huge antique fan encased in glass the colors were vibrant reds greens a brilliant spray of flowers and delicate lace it was pretty but not that pretty i looked at jeanclaude for some clue and he merely motioned me to follow asher across the room when i just stood there jeanclaude took my hand and led me over to the other man asher must have heard us coming because he said i was very angry with you anita very angry so angry i did not think you might have just cause to be angry with me jeanclaude squeezed my hand as if to tell me not to interrupt but i seemed to be ahead on the discussion so i hadnt planned to say a word never interrupt when youre winning jason told us how ill you were after i took blood from you if you were as ill as he has reported then you would naturally fear my embrace he looked up suddenly eyes wide and almost wild lost in the glow of his hair and the flickering candlelight i would not have hurt you it has never been so he seemed to be searching for a word terrible for any of my other again he hesitated victims i wasnt sure what to say to that because i agreed with part of what hed said i felt that hed made me a victim of his powers by not asking first but whether id been aware of it or not somewhere in the back of my mind i must have been thinking about the problem all damn day because i knew one thing for certain i wasnt completely in the right either damn it i let go of jeanclaudes hand because the feel of his skin against mine made it harder to concentrate right now i can see where you might have gotten the idea that i understood what sharing blood with you would mean i did ask you to bite me i did offer to feed you and you were right i did know that your bite could overwhelm my natural defenses it was my turn to look down at the pretty fire screen that would never know the touch of flame i just was so out of my head with i almost couldnt say it desire that i wasnt thinking clearly but that wasnt your fault you could only go with what i said out loud i looked up met those eyes oh hell asher even if you could have read my mind at that moment i wanted you to take me whatever that meant there were no rules or stop signs in my head i let out a long breath and it shivered because i was afraid of this afraid of admitting it out loud afraid of it all i was afraid of being consumed by desire or love or whatever the hell you want to call it i wanted you to take me while jeanclaude made love to me i wanted us all to be together as of old it is not of old for you anita asher said he looked past me at jeanclaude see it is as we feared she is besotted with me through your memories it is not real what she feels for me with my powers of fascination or without them it is not real that sounds like what ive been saying asher i said that because you mindfucked me ill never know if what i feel for you is real but i can tell you this what i felt for you before that was real it isnt you before the holy water that i think of its you now just as you are he shook his head and looked away making his hair a barrier between us so i couldnt see his face but i did use my powers to fascinate you as a snake fascinates a bird i captured your mind and i meant to do it i touched his hair and he jerked away from me moved down the mantel out of reach i didnt try and follow i took in a lot of air and blew it slowly out id have rather faced a dozen bad guys than this next bit of conversation in your defense i think we were naked and doing the nasty before you rolled my mind he looked up face barely clear enough through the shadows and uncertain light for me to see he was puzzled nasty having sex jeanclaude said it is a quaint american slang term for it to do the nasty ah asher said though he didnt look any less puzzled i plowed on im nothing if not determined once ive made up my mind my point is this we were already having sex you hadnt rolled my mind when i agreed to everybody taking their clothes off you hadnt rolled my mind when we had foreplay you hadnt rolled my mind when i was licking the back of your knees and other things i forced myself to meet his slowly calming eyes i volunteered for all that if i could have figured out a way for you to be inside me that didnt include fangs i would have but i wanted you both inside me i had to close my eyes because i suddenly had a visual so strong that it nearly made my knees buckle with the visual came the wave of sensation it didnt make me claw the air this time but i was left with a death grip on the mantelpiece and my breath coming in gasps ma petite are you well i shook my head compared to the first time i flashed back on the orgasm yeah im peachy quelle asher asked she has experienced the pleasure of us earlier today asher looked even less happy she has every symptom i did not believe she would i thought her necromancy would protect her i should also tell you that i think belle morte had something to do with how sick i was she was feeding on me and richard through you two jeanclaude leaned against the wall arms crossed jason had told us that ma petite but i still believe that your power has struggled with ashers power all day it is the old question of what would happen if an irresistible force met an immovable object asher being the irresistible force and me the immovable object i said oui id have liked to argue with the division of labor but it was too damned appropriate so what does that mean for us being together as a ménage а trois again jeanclaude had a moment of something showing on his face then he went to his blankest of blank faces it was asher who spoke you would be willing to do this again i started to let go of the mantelpiece decided not to just in case and said maybe i looked at jeanclaude his careful beautiful face i think jeanclaude has finally found something that he wont compromise on whatever do you mean ma petite i mean if i cost you asher it will drive a wedge between us so i am something that you will take to your bed to be with jeanclaude he was suddenly enraged eyes full of liquid blue fire his humanity folded away before my eyes to leave him pale and still beautiful but it was the beauty of carved rock and jewels a hard bright beauty with no life to it no softness nothing human he stood before me with his golden hair moving around his face like a halo blown by the wind of his own power he was wondrous and horrible a terrible beauty like the angel of death come to find you i wasnt afraid of him i knew asher wouldnt hurt me on purpose i knew more that jeanclaude wouldnt allow it but id had enough enough of asher and of me in some perverse way asher and i were well matched in a bad needtherapy sort of way we both had so many issues about personal intimacy and so many hoops that people had to jump through that even i was tired of it i unbuckled my belt and started sliding it through the loops when it was far enough back i slid the belt out of the loop on my shoulder holster asher asked in a voice that echoed through the room crawled down my spine what are you doing i finished taking my belt off then shrugged out of my shoulder holster im getting undressed i assume that jeanclaudes got some clothes around here somewhere for me too though i am so not wearing an outfit that matches yours if it has like petticoats and stays and stuff you cant move in that shit have no fear ma petite i have held your preferences in the forefront of my thoughts as i chose the clothing he held his hands out to the side and struck a lovely if overly dramatic poise even our clothing is comfortable and easy to move about in we were both ignoring the vampire that was glowering at us nothing takes the wind out of your sails when youre trying to be scary like being ignored i started to take my shirt off but stopped i did not want to have to go through the glowing cross routine again i did not want to mess with it so i went for the bed where i could take off my shoes in comfort so jason told you what else belle did she has given you the first mark oui she knows jeanclaude she knows that richard and i dont have the fourth mark i hopped up on the bed laying my belt and shoulder holster beside me i concentrated on untying my shoes because i did not want to go where i feared the discussion would go you will not look at me now ma petite why is it that you fear what i will say i know that if you gave me the fourth mark that she couldnt mark me again id be safe from her non ma petite no lies between us she could not mark you as hers but you would not be safe i could use this as an excuse to claim that last bit of you but i will not because i fear what belle would do i looked up at him one shoe in my hand what do you mean for now she thinks she may be able to claim you as her human servant she may be able to use you to increase her own power if she finds you are beyond her reach in that way she may decide that you are better off dead if she cant have me then nobody else gets me either is that it he gave a small nod and an almost apologetic shrug she is a very practical woman no shes a very practical vampire trust me jeanclaude that is a whole new level of practicality he nodded oui oui i would argue if i could but it would be lies asher was walking towards us now his eyes were still glowing that drowning blue as if a winters sky had filled his skull but for the rest he looked as ordinary as he ever did which was extraordinary but at least he wasnt raising a small wind of his own otherworldly power or levitating a few inches off the floor you are both weakened by not sharing the fourth mark neither of you is as powerful without it you know that jeanclaude i do but i also know belle she destroys that which she cannot use or casts it aside asher said voice soft holding sorrow enough to make my throat tight i had my shoes off my jogging socks tucked into them on the floor casting you aside did destroy you i said i meant it to be soft but it came out pretty much like i usually sound he glared at me his pupils swimming up through the blue fire like an island reborn from the sea what i mean asher is that she chose what would hurt you worse than death to be cast out from her affections from jeanclaudes bed since his bed was hers she would not kill me because she promised jeanclaude she would not i glanced at jeanclaude i came back to her for a hundred years if she could save ashers life if he died i was free of her so she worked to keep me alive asher said and his voice was bitter enough to choke on there were nights when i cursed you for my life jeanclaude i know mon ami belle morte often pointed out that if only i would allow you to die you could be spared such humiliation i did not know that she gave you that choice jeanclaude looked away not meeting the other mans eyes it was selfish on my part i would rather you alive and hating me than dead and past all hope he looked up then and his face was raw with emotion so unlike his usual polite blankness was i wrong asher would you rather have died all those years ago i sat on the bed watching them waiting for the answer in a way i was an audience in a way i wasnt there at all there were moments when i longed for death jeanclaude turned away asher touched his arm fingertips on the velvet that small touch seemed to freeze jeanclaude if he was breathing i couldnt see it last night was not one of those moments they stared at each other ashers fingertips barely touching jeanclaudes arm there was so much between them centuries of pain and love and hate it was as if all of it boiled in the air almost visible in the flickering light i wanted to say kiss and make up but i knew they wouldnt i dont know what issues they had about each other but they seemed unable to do things like that without their julianna shed been the bridge between them the thing that allowed them to love each other without her they stood on the brink of the abyss and gazed at each other separated by a chasm that neither knew how to cross i could never be julianna i had too many memories of her for gods sake shed done embroidery shed been gentle and kind and everything i didnt think i was but there was one thing i might be able to do i slid off the bed and went first to asher because i didnt want to set him off again i went on tiptoe and he had to bend down a little for me to kiss him but he didnt fight me i held his face in my hands like it was a cup carved of some delicate stone something that would shatter if you abused it i kissed him softly drinking from that cup as the sacred gift it was i went to jeanclaude with the taste of asher still on my lips i cupped his face as i had held ashers and i kissed him he barely moved under my mouth i stood back from the two of them now weve kissed and made up we need to get me dressed and we need to talk before the banquet jeanclaudes voice came out low and hoarse as if he wasnt breathing well talk of what ma petite the mother of all darkness jason spoke of her too but i hoped he was misunderstanding it cannot be the sweet mother asher said she has not woken in a millennium shes not awake asher but shes moving around like a restless sleeper the two men looked at each other it was asher who said i would put aside petty differences until we are at the bottom of this most grave mystery what petty differences i asked whether we are to be a ménage а trois or no i shook my head i adore you asher but i dont have enough energy left to shovel this much emotional shit do you realize that you have more hangups about personal intimacy than i do he opened his mouth closed it then gave that gallic shrug were actually wellmatched in a ihaventbeatenyoutodeathyet sort of way but for now lets both try to put our personal mess aside okay please he gave a graceful bow as my lady commands so shall i obey for as long as it suits you i said he laughed then and it was a good laugh a sound that glided down my skin and jerked at things low in my body it brought a sigh from my lips now where are my clothes for this little disaster tonight i had of course complained about my clothes the black velvet and blue silk seemed to be offering my breasts up like pale ripe fruits the colors emphasized the near translucence of my skin with the undertone of blue highlights but i knew what the blue highlights really wereblood blue blood inside my veins that would burst red when oxygen hit it stephen had done my hair and makeup hed done them before for these little gettogethers he regularly did it for the other strippers at guilty pleasures i had let him put my hair in a pile of loose curls on top of my head so that my neck looked white and bare ashers bite marks stood out starkly against all that flesh my neck and breasts look like they should be on a plate with a sign saying come and get it stephen stepped back from applying the last bit of eyeliner you look lovely anita he probably meant it but his blue eyes were all for the makeup for his work he saw me as a canvas he frowned slightly did some minute adjustment near my eyes that left me blinking he dabbed with a kleenex then stepped back again he looked me over from the top of my head to the end of my chin then nodded its good its positively appetizing micahs voice came from the doorway he stepped into the room closing the door behind him the moment i saw him i knew id lost all rights to bitch about what i was wearing the color was turquoise blue with enough green to make his eyes blaze green the shirt had holes at the top of his shoulder in the middle of his upper arm and two in the middle of his forearm black cord was threaded through the cloth and tied around his elbow above and below the holes to keep the cloth from sliding around the cuffs were wide and stiff with shiny black buttons with cutouts on the underside so the skin of his wrists was bare just as the holes at his elbows left those spots bare his skin looked very tanned very smooth very warm against the turquoise the pants matched the shirtand not just in color there were holes on the sides that flashed the perfect smoothness of his hip down to glimpses of thigh the holes probably went farther down but black boots cut off the view just above his knee the pants were so tight that he really didnt need a belt but there was a black cord threaded through the unnecessary belt loops that swung as micah walked he was actually almost to me when i realized there were holes on the inside of the pants legs too i shook my head theres more holes than cloth he smiled at me im food so youve got to be able to reach the blood jeanclaude didnt want anyone to have an excuse to undress anyone i glanced at jeanclaude hes not feeding any of these people non ma petite he is ours and ours alone but we do not want to have to undress him either if all of us keep our clothes firmly in place then so will they it would be a faux pax of gigantic proportions if they undress their food and we do not it is our house and our rules put that way it was hard to argue but i still wanted to then i looked at micahs face more closely hes wearing eye makeup i got off the chair that id sat in while stephen fixed me and walked closer to micah he was wearing more than just eye makeup but it was all so artfully done that you didnt see it at first i could not resist those eyes jeanclaude said they deserved to be decorated micahs hair was tied completely back from his face in a bun that was a graceful mix of french braid and sheer art where did all the curl go i asked it has been blow dried straight jeanclaude said he came and almost touched micahs hair to show how lovely it was he did not protest anything that we did to make him so pretty jeanclaude gave me a look out of his own blacklined eyes it was a refreshing change micah blinked those amazing eyes that someones art had made even more amazing you dont like it i shook my head no i like it i mean youre beautiful i shrugged i dont know its just a very different look for you i turned to jeanclaude ive never seen you in this much makeup belle morte broke me of wishing to see myself this way he was shielding as he said it as if whatever memory went with those words was nothing he wanted to share so why pretty micah up like this you dont like it micah repeated i frowned thats not it why do it now what do we gain by having you look like this because dont try and tell me theres no purpose to it i turned to include asher in his chair across the room in the look i gave jeanclaude neither of you would go to this much trouble tonight without a reason ive heard nothing but both of you complaining that we dont have enough time to get everyone presentable for the banquet i gestured at micah this took a lot of time that could have been used elsewhere so im asking both of you what gives they exchanged a look then asher looked studiously at the floor he pretended to be studying his perfectly manicured fingernails but i wasnt fooled i turned back to jeanclaude out with it i said he shrugged it wasnt so much graceful as almost embarrassed musette was finally forced to give us the complete guest list she has withheld only three names because they are part of the gift from belle so three mystery guests what does that have to do with why you dolled micah up one of the vampires coming tonight has an eye for a beautiful man both asher and i fell afoul of him more than once and i said to flaunt such delectable meat in front of his table yet not allow him a taste or a touch pleases us so youre being petty i said jeanclaude was suddenly angry it showed in his face filled his eyes with blue fire you do not understand ma petite belle has sent paolo to torment us he is to remind us what we were and how helpless we were we went to anyone that belle gave us to anyone she did not do it casually but if our bodies in anothers bed would gain her something she wished then she used us and let others do the same he stalked in a tight circle the black coat floating out around him like dark wings the thought of sitting at the same table with paolo again sickens me and belle knew that it would i loathe him in a way that i do not wish to describe but we cannot harm him ma petite belle has sent him to torment both of us by his mere presence he will smirk and leer and remind us with every look every touch of his hands on someone else what he once was allowed to do to us jeanclaude came to stand in front of me his anger beating in the air like invisible flames but this we can do ma petite we can flaunt the bounty at hand we can show paolo what i am able to touch and asher is able to touch but paolo cannot have paolo is one of those men who always wants what others have it eats at his soul if he cannot have in every way whomever he desires he touched fingertips down my neck and left a trail of heat on my skin that made me gasp almost pain almost pleasure i want paolo to suffer if only a little because i do not have it within my power to make him suffer a great deal i looked up into jeanclaudes angry angry face and sighed its going to be like this all night isnt it belles only sent people that make you uncomfortable or that you hate or hate you now ma petite we fear musette and valentina i believe bartolomé came because he is bored paolo is the first name that truly incenses me i touched jeanclaudes face holding that anger against the palm of my hand his eyes bled back to normal or as normal as they ever get i looked past him to micah you okay with fangteasing some male vampire as long as i dont have to come across ill play that made me smile if micahs okay with it so am i i cradled jeanclaudes face between my hands but was trying for eye contact not a kiss but lets keep our eye on the ball revenge is not why were here tonight he put his hands over mine and held them both against his face we are here tonight because belle morte is le sourdre de sang of our line and we cannot refuse her right to send visitors our way but make no mistake ma petite musette and her company are here to have revenge upon us revenge for what i asked asher answered from across the room revenge for us leaving her of course i looked at him why of course they exchanged another look one that i couldnt read it was jeanclaude who said because belle morte believes herself to be the most desirable woman in the world i gave him raised eyebrows shes beautiful ill grant you but the most beautiful woman in the world come on i mean it depends on what you consider beautiful some people like brunettes some people like blonds i said the most desirable ma petite not beautiful i dont get the difference he frowned at me men have killed themselves when she exiled them from her bed wars have been fought between rulers who were driven mad at the thought of any other man sharing belle mortes favors it was my turn to frown are you saying that once youve had belle morte that no one else will do that is her belief i looked at him you and asher left twice apiece exactement ma petite do you not see not really if we left her bed if there is any touch that we prefer to hers then perhaps she is not the most desirable woman in the world i thought about that for a second so this entire expedition is to punish you two not entirely i believe belle does want to test the ground as it were before she visits herself why does she want to visit at all it will be something political of that you can be sure jeanclaude said so punishing the two of you this time is what an extra treat they started to do another of those looks but i touched jeanclaudes face forced him to look at me no no more mysterious looks just say it belle is the most desirable woman in the world her entire power base her entire selfimage is built on that she must find a way to understand why we left and why we prefer to stay away even now so i said you are being too subtle asher said pushing himself to his feet and striding over to us fine you tell me i said just as belle saw julianna as a threat so she will see you but we hope to convince her that it is not another woman alone that keeps us entertained but a man belle never did see men as competition not as she did a woman so thats why youve prettied micah up and others asher said i looked at jeanclaude others he had the grace to look embarrassed but it didnt work completely his eyes looked pleased if musette can report to belle that i have a harem of men then belle will cease to be worried about you i shook my head i dont think so jeanclaude i think shes got a taste of me now shes either going to be afraid of me or attracted to the power i believe she marked you once to torment me ma petite she does not truly want you as her human servant but she is angry with me angry with you for having me he shook his head she thinks like a woman ma petite and not a modern one you think more like a man so it is hard to explain to you no i think ive got an inkling youre going to try and convince belles people that you didnt dump her for any woman but for a lot of men oui and if the sight of a lot of gorgeous men torments paolo too so much the better he smiled but it left his eyes hard and unpleasant oui ma petite i didnt say it out loud but belle morte wasnt the only one who rarely did anything without having more than one motive the banquet was in one of the inner rooms of the circus one id never seen before i knew that the place was huge and id seen only a fraction of it but i hadnt realized id missed a room this size it was literally cavernous because it had originally been a cave a huge towering space that water had carved out of solid stone over a few million years there was no water now only rock and the cool air it was the way the air tasted the way it touched your skin that let you know somehow that all this dark splendor was natures handy work not mans i dont know what the difference between natural caves and manmade ones is but the air feels different it just does i expected torches for the night but was surprised to find that there was gas gas lamps placed around the room chasing back the dark i asked jeanclaude when hed installed the gas and he said that some bootleggers had done it during prohibition that the cavern had been a speakeasy nikolaos the master of the city before jeanclaude had let the bootleggers pay rent for the space her vampires had also fed on the drunken revelers it was a good easy way to feed without getting caught since the prey was already breaking the law it wouldnt go to the police to say where the vampire attack had happened id never been in a room that was lit entirely by gas lamps it had that soft edge of firelight but it was steadier and burned cleaner id half expected there to be an odor of gas but there wasnt jeanclaude informed me that if i smelled gas it would mean there was a leak and we should probably run like hell okay what he actually said was we should leave as quickly as possible but i knew what he meant the banquet table was both beautifullyand oddlyarranged it gleamed with golden flatware and the gold picked up the delicate gold pattern in the white fineboned china there were gold napkin rings around white linen napkins the tablecloth was triple layered one long and white that nearly dragged the floor a gold edge of leaves and flowers embroidered around its hem the middle layer was a delicate gold lace the top was a different layer of goldwhite and goldas if someone had taken gold paint and dabbed it spongelike on white linen the chairs had white and gold cushioned seats and richly carved backs in a dark dark wood the table sat like a gleaming island in the midst of the gaslit dark but two things confused me first there were way more golden utensils at each place than i knew what to do with what the hell do you use a tiny twotined fork for anyway it was set at the top of the plate so it was either for seafood salad dessert or something i hadnt thought of i was hoping for seafood or dessert since i thought i knew which fork was for salad having never been to a formal vampire banquet i tried not to speculate on other possible uses for the twotined fork secondly there were a number of complete place settings on the floor each setting had a white linen napkin spread under it like miniature picnics the place settings on the floor were spaced between the chair settings so there was room to pull the chairs in and out it was odd i stood there in my black and royal blue gown with its faint sparkles of deep blue tapping the toe of my black high heel trying to figure out why there were plates on the floor jeanclaude glided through the long black drapes that covered the entrance between this room and the smaller adjacent chamber everyone was mingling in the other room i hated mingling under any circumstances even at normal dinner parties but tonight was like small talk combat style everything had double or triple meanings everyone was trying to be subtly insulting all so polite so backstabbing so painful my small talk skills were pretty limited and among musette and her crew i was unarmed id needed a break before i started breaking things for real at least musettes underage pomme de sang was missing from tonights festivities wed been told the girl had been sent back to europe because her presence seemed to upset me so my guess was musette just didnt want to lose her toy if things went badly asher slipped through all that blackness like a golden vision but he didnt glide after jeanclaude he hurried musette wasnt entirely ready to believe that asher was truly ours since i wasnt a hundred percent sure he was either it was hard for her not to smell a lie on me even though it wasnt exactly a lie i should never have left asher on his own but i was tired tired of vampire politics tired of digging out from problems that i didnt start and didnt truly understand ma petite our guests are asking after you ill just bet they are jeanclaude did that long slow graceful blink that usually meant he was trying to figure out what id meant with a bit of slang or sarcasm i used to think the blink was to show off his impossibly long eyelashes but trust him to make something enticing out of what for anyone else would have been an irritating habit musette really is asking after you asher said and he imitated her voice where is your new beloved has she abandoned you so soon his pale blue eyes flashed white showing that edge of panic that was just below the surface it is not like you to wander off on such an important and potentially dangerous occasion what is the matter ma petite oh i dont know an international terrorist following me around the vampire council back in town an evening of some of the most politely vicious small talk ive ever heard asher being his usual temperamental self one of my friends and favorite policemen having a nervous breakdown a serial killer werewolf on the loose in my town oh and the fact that richard and his wolves havent arrived yet and no ones answering their phones pick one i knew the smile on my face wasnt pleasant when i finished it was a challenging smile it said why wouldnt i be uptight i do not believe anything has happened to richard ma petite no youre afraid hes going to take a pass on the whole evening that would make us look damned weak damian flies almost as well as i do asher said hell find them if they are close and if theyre not i mean richard is shielding so hard that neither jeanclaude nor i can reach him he doesnt usually do that without a reason usually a pissy one asher sighed i do not know what to say about your wolf king but i know that he is not our only problem he looked at me and there was a stubborn set to that handsome face i am not being temperamental i didnt bother to debate him asher was temperamental he just was fine but the problem is that musette can smell this lie she asks me if youre mine i say yes she doesnt believe me she doesnt believe me because i dont quite believe it you arent totally mine its too new to feel that real and thats what shes picking up on shes practically chased me around the room finding new ways to ask if im fucking you and even that caught me i shook my head and missed the feel of my hair against my skin i touched the back of my bare neck and it felt vulnerable if it is only for their visit i understand asher said no no damn it its that we havent had intercourse asher looked at me then raised his gaze to jeanclaude in this she is very american if you have not had intercourse you have not had sex with ma petite it is a very american mindset i covered her back in my seed and that does not count i blushed so suddenly that i felt dizzy can we please change the subject jeanclaude touched my shoulder and i jerked away i desperately wanted comforting and thus i couldnt let him do it i know it made no sense but it was still true id stopped trying to talk myself out of myself and begun to try and work with what i had i was a mess of contradictions wasnt everybody though admittedly i might be a teensy bit more contradictory than most i walked away from him from both of them but that also took me away from the lights closer to the waiting pools of darkness i stopped i didnt want to walk into the dark i spoke half turned around as if i didnt trust my back to the dark completely why are there plates on the floor jeanclaude moved towards me graceful in those amazing boots the dark coat swirling around him the embroidery catching the light here and there like faint blue stars the blue shirt seemed to float from the darkness bringing his face to my almost painful attention emphasizing how truly lovely he was of course hed probably planned for exactly that effect his voice seemed to fill the cavern like a warm whisper be at peace ma petite stop that i said and realized i turned my back on the greater darkness turned towards him like a flower turns to the sun turned because i couldnt not look at him this wasnt vampire powers it was the effect he had on me had almost always had on me stop what he asked voice still warm and peaceful like a comforting blanket trying to use your voice on me im not some tourist to be soothed by pretty words and a good delivery he smiled then gave a small bow non but you are as nervous as a tourist it is not like you to be so jumpy the smile had vanished replaced by a small frown i rubbed my hands up and down on my arms wishing the silk and velvet wasnt there i needed to touch my own skin with my own hands the cave was around fifty degrees i needed the long sleeves but i needed the skin contact more i looked up to the towering ceiling above us and the darkness that seemed to press down from it hovering over the gaslight pressing at the edges of the glow like a dark hand i sighed its the dark i said at last jeanclaude came to stand next to me he made no immediate move to touch me because id drawn away once id taught him caution he looked up briefly at the ceiling then back to study my face what of it ma petite i shook my head and tried to put it into words while i huddled into myself as if i could hold in the warmth i was wearing a cross the silver chain traced down my neck into the generous cleavage revealed by the lownecked dress there was a piece of black masking tape over the silver cross itself so that it wouldnt spill out at the wrong moment after the earlier visits from belle and mommy dearest i was not going anywhere without a holy item on me i wasnt sure what that might mean to having sex with jeanclaude or any vampire but for the short term i wasnt sure that any sex was worth the risk jeanclaude touched my hand gently i jumped but didnt move away he took that as an invitation hed always taken anything that wasnt an outright rebuke as an invitation he moved to stand behind me putting his hands over mine where i still gripped myself your hands are chilled he pressed me in the circle of his body arms sliding around me pinning me gently against him he rested his cheek against the top of my head i ask again ma petite what is the matter i settled into the circle of his arms relaxing by inches against him as if my very muscles couldnt stand the thought of giving in to anything soft or comforting i ignored the question and asked again why are there plates on the floor he sighed and held me close do not be angry because there is nothing i can do to change this i knew you would not like it but belle is oldfashioned asher came to join us her original request was to put humans on large trays like suckling pigs bound and helpless then everyone could have picked a vein and enjoyed i turned my head against the velvet of jeanclaudes coat so i could stare at ashers face youre joking right the look on his face was enough shit you arent i rolled my head up so i could look at jeanclaude he obligingly looked down at me his face was more unreadable but i was pretty sure asher hadnt lied oui ma petite she suggested three humans would be enough for all of us you cant feed this many vampires off of three people not true ma petite he said softly i kept looking at him until he looked away you mean drain them dry from multiple bites yes yes that is what i mean he sounded tired i forced myself to settle back into his suddenly tense arms and sighed just tell me jeanclaude i believe you that belle insisted on it whatever it is i believe you that she wanted worse things done just tell me he bent his head so that he whispered against my hair his warm breath touching my ear when you have steak do you invite the cow to sit at table with you no i said then turned my head to the side so i could see his face the look in his eyes was enough you dont mean he did mean so whos sitting on the floor anyone who is food he said i gave him a look he spoke quickly to the look in my eyes you will be seated at table ma petite just as angelito will sit at table what about jason pomme de sangs will eat from the floor so nathaniel too i said he gave a small nod and let me see how worried he was about how id take all this if you were this worried about how id react why didnt you warn me ahead of time in truth there has been so much happening that i forgot this was once very normal for me ma petite and belle holds with the old ways there are older still than she who would not even allow the food to sit on the floor he shook his head hard enough that his hair touched my face smelling of his cologne and that indefinable something that was simply his scent there are banquets ma petite that you would not wish to see or even know of they are indeed horrible did you think they were horrible while you were participating in them some oui his eyes filled with that wistful look that lost innocence centuries of pain it didnt happen often but sometimes in his eyes i could glimpse what hed lost i wont argue if you tell me theres worse out there than this arrangement ill just believe you he gave me a look of disbelief no arguing i shook my head and leaned back into his chest held his arms around me like a coat not tonight i should leave this miracle alone but i cannot you have taught me bad habits ma petite i think i must ask once more what is wrong i told you its the dark you have never been afraid of the dark before id never met the mother of all darkness before i said it softly but her name seemed to echo into the darkness as if the darkness itself were waiting for the words as if the words could conjure her to us i knew it wasnt true all right i was pretty sure it wasnt true but it made me shiver just the same jeanclaude tightened his grip around me pulling me tight in against his body ma petite i do not understand how could you came a voice behind us jeanclaude turned me in his arms as he moved to face the voice making it a dancelike movement ending with my left hand in his right his coat and my skirt swirled out and settled in a cloth whisper around us our outfits were designed to move and flow like some goth version of fred astaire and ginger rogers asher walked quickly to us and even the way he moved was wrong his posture was still perfect but there was a hunching to it like a dog that expects to be hit he hurried in those white boots hurried and though still beautiful there was little grace to his movement there was too much fear in him to allow for grace jeanclaude held out his hand and asher took it we stood there the three of us holding hands like children it should have been absurd considering the vampire we faced but it wasnt valentina that we wanted to huddle together against i think for all three of us it was the night in general it was everything in the next room and what it represented valentina stood in front of the drapes she looked like a tiny doll dressed all in white and gold so that she like asher would match the table settings everyone in musettes party matched the table which meant that that too had been something they negotiated somehow clothes wouldnt have been high on my list but then that was me valentinas outfit was a miniature seventeenthcentury dress with the skirt flared out to either side so that she was shaped like an oval the skirt was very full and gave glimpses as she walked of tiny gold slippers and numerous petticoats she even had a white wig that hid her brunette curls from view the wig looked too heavy for that slender white throat but she walked as if the jewels and feathers and powdered hair weighed nothing she had absolutely perfect posture but i knew that was from the corset that was under the dress those dresses dont fit right without the proper undergarments there had been no need for powder to make her skin white rouge and red lipstick had been enough oh and a black beauty mark in the shape of a tiny heart near that rosebud mouth she should have looked ridiculous but she didnt she was like a sinister doll when she flipped open her gold and lace fan with a sharp snap i jumped she laughed and only the laughter was childlike a hint of how she might have sounded long ago she has stood on the brink of the abyss and stared into it and the abyss has looked back has it not i had to swallow hard to be able to answer because my pulse was pounding and i was suddenly shivering you talk like you know i do she walked towards us gliding and graceful she wore the body of a child but she didnt move like one i guess centuries of practice can teach anyone to glide she stopped farther back than an adultsized person would so she didnt have to strain to look up at me id noticed she did that while everyone was mingling once i was truly the child this body pretends to be i wandered away from everyone exploring as children do she looked up at me with enormous brown eyes i found a door that was not locked a room with many windows and none of them looked outside i finished for her she blinked up at me exactement what did the windows look out upon a room i said a huge room i looked up at the cavernous roof like this one but bigger and the windowed room sits above it all you have not been in our inner sanctum of that i am sure but you speak as if you stood where i stood not physically but i have stood there i said we looked at each other and it was a look of shared knowledge shared terror shared fear how close did you get to the bed she asked closer than i wanted to i whispered i touched the black sheets because i thought she was only sleeping she is sleeping i said valentina shook her head solemnly non to say she sleeps is to say any vampire sleeps it is not sleep shes not dead not dead the way the rest of you are when you sleep true but she is not asleep either i shrugged whatever you call it shes not awake and for that we are truly grateful are we not she spoke softly enough that i leaned in towards her to hear the words yes i whispered back we are she reached up and touched my neck and i flinched not from the touch but from the tension of our words she didnt laugh this time only you and i have been touched by that dark belle morte too i said valentina looked a question at me belle has called me into some kind of dream when the darkness rose around us our mistress has not informed us of this valentina said it only happened today early today i said hmm valentina said folding her fan tight running it through her tiny hands each tiny nail done in gold musette should know of this she gazed up at me and there was so much more of her than there should have been she would always appear to be eight a petite eight but her eyes held an adults awareness and more there are some unexpected guests that are about to make their appearance i cannot spoil the surprise for that would anger musette and through her belle but i think that you and i will be equally unhappy with them i think that you and i more than any will see it for the disaster it is i dont understand i said jeanclaude will explain their presence to you when they appear but only you and i will truly grasp why the mere fact that they are here is bad very bad i frowned im sorry but youve lost me she sighed and unfurled her fan with a practiced movement we will speak again after the surprise she turned to walk back towards the curtain i called after her what saved you from the dark she turned the fan folding away again as if playing with it had become habitual what saved you a cross and friends she gave a small smile that left her eyes as empty and gray as a winter storm my human nurse did she see what was on the bed no but it saw her she began to shriek she shrieked and shrieked and stood there staring at nothing until she fell down dead her body lay there for a very long time because no one wished to enter the room valentina opened her fan with a snap i managed not to jump this time the smell got to be quite atrocious she smiled and made a joke of it a vicious joke but she couldnt make her expression match the humor her eyes were haunted no matter how cruel the smile she left through a flick of black drapes all three of us visibly relaxed when the drapes swung shut and we shared a glance why do i think im not the only one too tense to pull this off tonight i said asher kept jeanclaudes hand but moved around so he was facing both of us musette smells a lie and she will not let it rest valentina and i just finished talking about the mother of all bad vampires and youre already back to harping on musette jeanclaude squeezed my hand and sighed the sweet dark will not take me tonight anita it will not pin me to a table and unfasten my clothes and force itself upon me musette will youre in our bed now rules say she cant have you but she smells that it is a lie i cant help that the fact that we havent had intercourse comes up on vampire radar as lying about fucking you musette wishes it to be untrue ma petite she is searching for anything that will allow her more room to play your doubts ashers doubts give her that room i closed my eyes and counted slowly to ten when i opened them they were both giving me their best blank faces it was like looking at two superb paintings suddenly made threedimensional very lifelike but not alive i squeezed jeanclaudes hand and he squeezed back dont go all strange on me guys im having enough trouble tonight they both blinked one long graceful blink and they were alive again i shivered and took my hand back from jeanclaude that is so disturbing i said pourquoi ma petite why he has to ask why i shook my head and crossed my arms i had to cradle my breasts because thanks to the bra and the neckline there was no way to cross my arms over my chest damian came through the black drapes his scarlet hair glowed against the cream and gold of his oldfashioned clothes he could have stepped out of a seventeenthcentury painting complete with white hose below kneelength pants and those odd highheeled buckle shoes the noblemen wore only his hair loose and blazing was untamed and recognizably him he had not volunteered to be one of jeanclaudes pretty men damian was a touch homophobic boy had he fallen in with the wrong bunch of vampires he strode across the carpet and went to one knee in front of me for tonight we were being formal so i didnt argue and offered him my left hand he took it laying a kiss on my fingers the ulfric and his party are almost here where have they been jeanclaude asked damian looked up giving us the full force of his grass green eyes he almost looked underdressed without eye makeup i think almost every other person at this little party was wearing makeup the corner of his mouth gave the smallest twitch and i realized he was trying not to laugh they had to find someone to repair the ulfrics hair no one in their pack was a hairdresser what does this mean repair his hair jeanclaude asked i sighed you know how you forgot to tell me about the plates on the floor oui i forgot to mention that richard cut his hair off i dont mean like gotothebeautyparlorandgetitstyled i mean hacked it off with scissors himself jeanclaude looked almost as horrified as i had his beautiful hair yeah i said i know id done my best not to think about it i mean richard had said it we werent dating it wasnt any of my business what length his hair was my major concern was that sane happy people dont hack their hair off at home with scissors cutting your hair like that is usually a substitute for hurting yourself in other more permanent ways any counselor will tell you that damian spoke still on one knee still holding my hand lightly they found someone to salvage what they could but he is all but shorn jeanclaude looked ill which for a vampire is a neat trick is he well enough for all this tonight i wasnt sure who hed asked it of maybe everyone maybe no one but jeanclaude had grasped how bad a sign it was that richard was mutilating himself im not sure any of us are i said he gave me an unfriendly look we are stronger than this ma petite strong yes but tired i guess i can only speak for myself but if musette comes up to me one more time and asks me about asher im going to smack her that is against the rules ma petite what would make her stop nagging us about asher does she have to see us fucking in front of her to back off damian was stroking my hand in his i jerked back from him i dont want to calm down im pissed and i have a right to be pissed a right oui but not the luxury ma petite what the hell does that mean anger without purpose is luxury tonight ma petite and we cannot afford it we do not wish to give musette any reason to cross the boundaries that we have so carefully negotiated he was right and i hated it fine fine youre right youre always fucking right about the political shit but then what are we going to do to make musette stop asking about asher i have one possible solution jeanclaude said the solution had to wait because micah came through the curtain with nathaniel and merle in tow nathaniels outfit was mostly cream colored strips of leather that covered almost nothing a white thong covered his front but left his buttocks bare he had cream colored boots that were over the knee but open in back so you got glimpses of his legs to midcalf when he walked away from you there was a threeinch heel on the boots and nathaniel knew how to make the heel work for him i knew he wore less than this almost every night at guilty pleasures but it bugged me until nathaniel assured me he was fine with it stephen had styled nathaniels auburn hair looping it back and over itself to form the largest french braid id ever seen french braids just arent meant to hit the knees the delicate eye makeup was almost overwhelming to his violet eyes making them almost painfully shockingly beautiful lipstick had shaped his mouth and made it kissable even from a distance he would have looked like a girl except that the outfit left no doubt that the body it was almost covering was very male merle was wearing a variation of what all the bodyguards would be wearing black leather black leather pants over black boots with silver points a black tshirt under a black leather jacket merle had had his own outfit he was six feet plus with graystreaked hair that fell to his shoulders and a mustache and partial beard that were both a darker gray than his hair he looked like what he wasa longtime biker and hard case at the moment he was livid so angry that his beast was rolling in the air around him like an almost visible presence what happened i asked merle growled if that bastard touches my nimirraj one more time im going to tear off his arm and shove it up his ass jeanclaude and asher said in unison paolo yes merle growled micah looked amused i dont think it bothered him but not much bothered micah he was one of the most easygoing people id ever met i guess he had to be to survive as my boyfriend it isnt bothering me merle thats not the point the big man said its insulting it shows he has no respect for us its paolo asher said he has no respect for anyone except belie let me guess i said paolos pawing nathaniel too merle gave a low skincrawling growl the curtains opened and bobby lee stuck his head and shoulders in unless we can just start tearing people up you better get back in here we exchanged a look sighed almost as a group and we got back in there there was a wall of our black leatherclad bodyguardswererats werehyenas wereleopardsso that we couldnt see who was making a high piteous noise make a hole i said i was ignored merle yelled make a hole people and the bodyguards parted like a black leather ocean it was stephen making the noise he had pressed himself up against the far wall as if he were trying to shove himself into it and out the other side valentina was in front of him she wasnt doing anything to him that i could see or even feel but she was standing very close one tiny hand hovering in front of him gregory was pressed into a different space bartolomé stood just in front of him a look of near rapture on his young face i concentrated on the vampire and i felt him feeding feeding on gregorys terror id known a vampire or two that could cause fear in others then feed i hadnt known it was a power that belles line carried stephen screamed and the sound whipped me around to see that valentina had laid a tiny hand on his bare stomach she wasnt feeding on his fear she wasnt hurting him in any way that i could see stephen hid his face his long blond curls tangling across his madeup face his naked upper body pressed into the stone as if he thought he could make himself disappear valentina slid her tiny hand down his waist to the hips of his white leather pants and that tore another scream from stephens throat i suddenly had a clue why the twins were terrified of the children bobby lee pushed his way beside me bodyguards are supposed to go first anita not second i ignored the anger because i knew it was frustration wed told the guards that we could not start violence under any circumstances that musette and her crew had to break truce first as far as i was concerned this did break truce i started towards stephen and a strange vampire barred my way i knew suddenly why our guards were simply standing there with their hands in their proverbial pockets the vampire wasnt that tall but he was bulky and it wasnt just muscle there was something to the hunch of his shoulders the shape of his head was wrong somehow there was nothing specific i could put a finger on except that he hit the radar as not human not human in ways different from other vampires he was also one of the few black vampires id ever seen some people theorized that the same genetics that made many people of african descent immune to malaria also made them less likely to become vampires he stood there looking at me with his dark skin still somehow strangely pale like chocolate ivory his eyes were golden yellow and the moment i looked into them the words not human came to mind another scream tore the air it didnt matter what the thing in front of me was or wasnt i didnt care i tried sidestepping and the vampire moved with me not threatening but not letting me through either the room was suddenly quiet so quiet gregorys voice came first unnaturally loud in the tense silence dont make me do this oh god dont make me do this jeanclaude was murmuring to musette and i heard her voice just a word or two in french she was basically saying they hadnt broken truce this was only entertainment i felt my shoulders relax felt the decision settle into the center of my body i stared up at the vampire you are a coward an ugly childabusing coward the vampire didnt react he ignored me and i didnt think it was simply bodyguard cool i tried a few more choice insults concerning everything from his parentage to his physical appearance and got glazed blinks he didnt speak english good bobby lee i said he leaned in close to me trying even now to insinuate his body between me and the big bad vampire yes maam overwhelm him with numbers can we cut him up no then we cant overwhelm him for long i only need a minute he gave a small nod i might just squeeze a minute out of this mess i met his eyes do it yes maam he made a signal with his hand and all the wererats moved at once i sidestepped the mass of black leather and went quickly to valentina and stephen i was talking before id really gotten to them i wouldnt have much time micah appeared beside me merle and noah micahs second bodyguard were practically pressed to his back id made sure all my bodyguards were busy with the vampire if things went wrong i wasnt sure either merle or noah would protect me if it meant endangering micah oh well stephen had been abused as a child he was used for sex by his own father and sold to other men i said as i moved forward i remembered what jeanclaude had said that valentina hated child molesters because of her own past she turned that tiny heartshaped face to me her hand still caressing stephens shoulder he had collapsed to the floor huddled in an almost fetal position i was beside them now and the noises behind me were escalating there was going to be a fight soon a bad one i swear to you that what i say is true look at him look at the terror your touch inspires in him stephen wasnt looking at either of us his eyes were squeezed closed and his tears had smeared the eye makeup to black tracks down his face he hugged his body tight hed given himself up and over to what was happening as if he were still a child valentina looked down at him and something like horror began to grow on her face she stared at her tiny hand as if it were something awful that had just appeared at the end of her arm she shook her head non non and more french that i couldnt follow hes coming merle said and i felt him and noah brace themselves in front of micah and me i touched valentinas arm and she raised eyes glassy with shock and turned towards me call off bartolomé tell him why gregorys afraid of him i felt the impact of the vampire slamming into merle and noah and they pressed forward taking the fight away from us by a few feet micah stood over me ready he could shapeshift and use claws but he just didnt have enough body mass to stop the vampire valentinas voice cut through the fighting echoed through the room and i realized she was using vampire powers to make herself heard we broke truce first first blood is on our hands musette screamed valentina valentina repeated herself in french this time the fighting slowed at valentinas words slowed and began to die valentina turned to face musette who was in a dress of all white so that she looked like a bride it is truth musette these two men have been abused enough by us i will not let it continue he was so afraid of me valentina such fear to feed on bartolomé said now youve spoiled it the slender boyish figure was dressed in nearly solid gold oldfashioned very seventeenth century cloth so that he sparkled as he moved valentina spoke low and soft in rapid french bartolomés face didnt pale but he looked back at gregory he turned to look at me is this true their own father i nodded gregorys sobs were loud in the sudden stillness to force yourself on children is an evil thing bartolomé said to use your own sons he spat on the floor and said something in what i recognized was spanish but couldnt follow i brought them here tonight so theyd be under my protection safe their father has returned recently and is trying to meet with them again they are here so he couldnt find them i didnt think about the two of you we would not have done this if we had been told bartolomé said musette was told jeanclaudes voice seemed to fill the tension like water in a cup we all turned to jeanclaude who was standing not too far off near the mass of bodyguards that had taken on a second vampire like the one that had kept me from stephen i told her of gregory and stephens past because the moment stephen saw valentina and bartolomé he said he could not feed them that the memories it would waken would be too much for him to bear i did tell musette this if i had not warned her i would never have left stephen and gregory out here without anita or myself to guard them all of us now turned to look at musette she was not wearing a wig but had curled her hair into long banana curls so she looked like a porcelain doll with her red lips her carefully made up eyes her pale skin and the white seventeenthcentury dress with its attached cape nothing would ever take her beauty from her but physical beauty isnt enough to make up for sadism is this true valentina asked now ma poulet would i do such a thing yes valentina said yes you would the two child vampires stared at musette stared at her wordlessly until it was she who looked away she who blinked big blue eyes for a moment i saw what i thought id never see musette was embarrassed bobby lee capture her ass ma petite what are you doing i know the rules jeanclaude theyve forfeited their safe conduct in our territory that means that we are within our rights to put her under house arrest until her little company leaves but we cannot harm her she is too important to belle he said sure i said i glanced at bobby lee escort her back to her room and put the cross back on the door he looked at me then at jeanclaude you mean just like that we can hurt them jail them i nodded he sighed wished it worked that way with the shapeshifters occasionally the vampires being so civilized comes in handy bobby lee grinned at me and he and claudia and about half a dozen others moved towards musette angelito moved in front of her blocking her from view her voice rang clear though hidden do not fear angelito the wererats will not touch me bobby lee and claudia were facing off with angelito he made them both look small we can do this easy or hard bobby lee said move and we all go quiet to the rooms stay put and well hurt you then drag your ass back to the rooms there was an eagerness to his voice that said he was hoping for a fight i think they all were none of them had liked having to stand by and watch gregory and stephen be tormented move aside angelito musette said now angelito moved his face showing how reluctant he was to do so i was surprised that musette was being so cooperative shed struck me as someone whod have to be carried off kicking and screaming bobby lee reached out for musette she said do not touch me he stopped in midmotion as if his hand had frozen in place take her bobby lee i said i cant he said and there was something in his voice that id never heard before fear what do you mean you cant i asked he took his hand back slowly and cradled it against his chest as if it had been hurt she told me not to touch her and i cant claudia i said the big woman shook her head i cant the first hint i had about how wrong things had gone was the real rat that waddled up to sniff at musettes white skirts it looked up at her with shiny black button eyes i looked at musette and her blue eyes had bled solid so that she looked like a blind blond doll her face was exultant with triumph rats are your animal to call i said didnt jeanclaude tell you and the laughter in her voice said clearly she knew he had not he forgot to mention it i did not know jeanclaude said her only animal to call two centuries ago was the bat his voice sounded empty hiding whatever he was feeling she gained the rat as her second animal about fifty years ago asher said i gave him a look it would have been nice to know that he shrugged it never occurred to me that anyone would actually try to put musette under guard i turned back to the vampire in question why didnt you use your new power to get rid of the wererat guards earlier i wanted it to be a surprise she said and smiled smiled wide enough to flash fangs she was so terribly pleased with herself fine i said all shapeshifter bodyguards that dont happen to be rats get her ass kill them and i knew she was talking to bobby lee that i hadnt foreseen shit but bobby lee and claudia were both shaking their heads and backing off from her you can order us not to harm you but you cant make us hurt others you aint got that kind of power girl the wererats were all backing away looking confused and worried more real rats had begun to scamper in from the far cavern one of the problems with using a place that is naturally created is that you get nature nature isnt always pretty or friendly it was mostly werehyenas that moved forward only two of the wereleopards qualified as bodyguards and those two stayed close to micah the rest of our leopards had been brought along as food food doesnt fight food just bleeds i realized something i hadnt beforethere were no werewolves in the cave except for stephen where had the werewolf guards gone musette said something and it wasnt in french in fact it wasnt a language i could even guess at the two vampires with their ivory gray skin and golden eyes moved in front of her jeanclaude said call them back ma petite i would not lose them over this theres only two of them jeanclaude but they are not what they seem i called everybody off and turned to jeanclaude what it was valentina who came forward and answered my question there is a room where the servants of the sweet dark wait asleep the council members will go into that room from time to time and try to call them to their service i glanced at the two vampires then back to valentina these two woke i said more than these two she said our mistress has called six of them awake she believes it is a mark of her growing power valentina and i looked at each other the mother of all darkness is waking and her servants wake before her i whispered it but even whispered it shivered and filled the room with dancing echoes i believe so valentina said our mistress is more powerful than any other the servants of our sweet mother wake to belle mortes command it is a sign of our mistresss greatness musette declared it as truth a ringing pride in her voice youre a fool musette the dark is waking the fact that they are standing here is proof of that theyll obey belle morte until their true mistress rises then god help you all musette literally stamped her foot at me you will not spoil our fun you cannot touch me they will not let you i looked at them and frowned theyre not just vampires are they what do you mean ma petite i could feel them feel a presence that shouldnt have been there they feel like shapeshifters vampires cant be shapeshifters i realized even as i said it that that wasnt entirely true the mother of all darkness was a shapeshifter and a vampire id felt that i thought mommy dearest was the first vampire the one who made you all oui ma petite are there any vampires on the council that descend directly from her jeanclaude thought about that for a moment we all descend from her thats not what i asked asher answered there is no one that can claim direct descent from her line but she founded the council of vampires she began our civilization gave us rules so that we were no longer solitary beasts killing each other on sight so shes your cultural mother not your lines originator who can tell for certain ma petite she is the beginning of what we are today she is our mother in all ways that are important i shook my head not all ways i stood out of reach and said someone who speaks whatever they speak translate this for me valentina stepped up they understand french now fine jeanclaude i am here ma petite tell them that musette has forfeited safe conduct and we need to place her under arrest she wont be harmed but she wont be allowed to harm anyone else jeanclaude spoke slow french so i could understand a lot of it i had picked up more and more over the years but rapid speech still gave me problems i have told them then tell them this too if they dont move out of the way so we can arrest her then we are within the rules that the mother of darkness laid downto kill them for disobeying the rules jeanclaude looked doubtful just repeat it i said i walked away a little to find bobby lee he was sweating and looked unwell i am sorry anita we failed you i shook my head not yet you havent he looked puzzled open your leather jacket wide he did what i asked i took his gun out of its shoulder holster and got a glimpse of a second gun in his belt rules said only guards could be armed i pointed the gun at the ground and clicked off the safety his eyes were very wide i wasnt actually sure if he could let me have the gun but he did and i threaded my way carefully back through the crowd to the front lines the gun was invisible held in the folds of my full black skirt what did they say jeanclaude they dont believe anyone here can hurt them they say that they are invincible how long have they been asleep jeanclaude asked them they dont know for certain how do they know theyre invincible i asked he asked and they drew swords from under their white coats short swords forged of something darker and heavier than steel was it bronze i wasnt sure i just knew it wasnt steel we all stepped back from the drawn blades whatever they were made of they say that no weapon born of man can harm them jean claude said musette laughed they are the finest warriors ever created you will not touch me with them as my protectors i stepped back put myself in as balanced a stance as i could get with the high heels and raised the gun i aimed for a headshot and got it the vampires head exploded in a wash of blood and brains the sound of the shot seemed to echo forever and i couldnt hear the yell i saw on the lips of the second warrior as he charged me his head exploded like the first one had all the handtohand combat training in the world is useless if your enemy doesnt let you get close enough to use it musette stood blinking too shocked to move i think she was covered in blood and gore her blond hair and pale face were a red mask out of which her blue eyes blinked her white dress was half crimson i aimed the gun at her startled face i thought about it god knows i thought about it but i didnt need jeanclaudes frightened ma petite please for all our sakes do not do this to make me hesitate i couldnt kill musette because of what belle morte might do in retaliation but i let musette see in my eyes my face my body that i would kill her that i wanted to kill her and that given the right excuse i might forget belles vengeance for the second it would take me to pull a trigger musettes eyes filled with glistening tears she was a fool but not so big a fool as all that but i had to be certain so we didnt have these misunderstandings again what do you see in my face musette my voice was low almost a whisper because i was afraid of what my hand would do if i yelled she swallowed and it was loud to my ringing ears i see my death upon your face yes i said yes you do never forget this moment musette because if it happens again it will be your last moment she let out a shaking breath i understand i hope so musette i really truly hope so i lowered the gun slowly now merle can you oversee musette and angelito going to their rooms right now merle stepped forward and a small army of werehyenas moved with him my nimirra speaks and i obey id heard him say things like that to micah before but never to me or at least not like he meant it merle stepped over the bodies of the dead vampires to take musettes arm the werehyenas looked pale but happier id just made all the muscle in the room happy because things were simple now we could kill them if they messed up again i caught jeanclaudes expression he was not happy id made the soldiers job easier but not the politicians no i think id just complicated the hell out of the political side of things merle led musette none too gently over the bodies she stumbled and only a mass of werehyenas kept angelito from grabbing her musette regained her balance and the room suddenly smelled like roses i thought id choke on my own pulse as musette raised her head and showed eyes the color of dark honey bellemorte looked at me out of musettes face and i think i stopped breathing all i could hear for a moment was the hammering of my own heart in my head sound returned with a rush and belle mortes voice slid out of musettes mouth i am vexed with you jeanclaude merle kept trying to drag her across the room either he didnt know the shit had hit the fan or one vampire was all the same to him he was about to learn otherwise release me she said in a calm voice merle dropped her arm as if shed burned him he backed away from her the way that bobby lee had backed away from musette with a look of pain holding his arm as if it hurt the leopard is her animal to call jeanclaude said and his voice carried into yet another heavy silence but i didnt have time to think about silence because belle was talking saying awful things i have been gentle up til now she turned and looked back at the two dead vampires do you know how long the council has been trying to wake up the mothers first children i think we all thought it was a rhetorical question one we were afraid to answer she turned back to face us and something swam underneath musettes face like a fish pushing against water but i awakened them i belle morte awakened the mothers children not all of them i said and immediately wished id kept my mouth shut she gave me a look that was so angry it burned and so cold it made me shiver it was as if all that had ever been of rage and hatred were in that one look no not all of them and now you have taken two away from me what ever shall i do to punish you i tried to speak around the pulse in my throat but jeanclaude answered musette broke the truce and would not concede it we have obeyed the law to the letter it is true valentina said the crowd of black leatherclad grownups moved so the child vampire could come and stand near musettebelle valentina kept out of reach though i noticed that speak little one valentina told the story of how musette had withheld information about the child molestation and what had happened because of it musettes body turned to look at stephen and gregory gregory was holding his brother rocking him stephen wasnt looking at anyone or anything whatever his staring eyes saw it was nothing in this room belle turned back to us and again there was that sense of another face swimming underneath but this time i saw it like a ghost superimposed over musettes face ghostly black hair bled over the blond a face with more cheekbones more strength to it showed for a moment before it sank back into the softer beauty of musette musette did break truce first i concede that why was it that my heart rate didnt slow a single beat when she said that her next words came out in a purring contralto a voice like fur to caress the skin and ease across the mind you have acted within the law and now so shall i when musette and the rest come back to me asher will come with them temporarily jeanclaude said but his voice held doubt non jeanclaude he will be mine as of old jeanclaude took a deep breath and let it out slowly according to your own laws you cannot take someone permanently away from those to whom he or she belongs if he belonged to anyone that would be true but he is no ones pomme de sang no ones servant no ones lover that is not true jeanclaude said he is our lover musette communicated with me told me that she smelled your lies your weak effort to keep asher from her bed belle was able to smell lies too if the lie was something she understood no vampire could tell truth from falsehood if it was about something they didnt understand if a vampire had no loyalty they couldnt discern it in othersthat sort of thing i was going to try and give her something she could understand i didnt think it was a weak effort i said jeanclaude gave me a look and i shook my head at him he stepped gracefully aside because he knew i had a plan but his voice whispered through my head be careful ma petite yeah id be careful belle turned her borrowed body to look at me so you admit it was an attempt to lie to musette no i said it wasnt weak i found the whole thing embarrassing exciting wonderful and terrifying being in bed with asher wasnt exactly what i thought it would be you havent lied yet she said and her voice was so rich it was as if i should have been able to get down on the ground and roll myself up in it like some soft warm suffocating carpet her voice was enticing like jeanclaudes and ashers could be but also frightening we took asher to our bed and by european standards we are lovers by european standards she looked confused and her face pushed out against musettes this time it was like a mask the sense of something larger more dangerous pushing against musettes face i knew through jeanclaudes memories that belle wasnt physically much bigger than musette but physical size wasnt all there was to belle morte i do not understand what that means european standards jeanclaude answered americans have a most peculiar idea that only intercourse between a man and a woman constitutes true sex anything else does not truly count i taste truth but i find it most odd as do i but it is still true he gave that gallic shrug i added what musette kept smelling wasnt a lie it was my hangup that asher and i hadnt had true intercourse trust me we were all naked and sweaty in the bed she turned that strange halfface to me it would have looked more frightening if her face hadnt been surrounded by musettes long blond banana curls the shirley temple look was not meant for belle i believe you but by your own admission you are not lovers not truly by your own standards thus asher is mine you dont care about the truth i forgot that i said she narrowed those honeygold eyes at me you have forgotten nothing little one you do not know me i have jeanclaudes memories here and there thats enough they should have taught me better than to use truth she walked towards me and as she did her body seemed to fold over musettes so that she wasnt just a face but a dress of dark gold a longer arm a pale hand with coppercolored nails she moved like a ghost draped over musette so that you got glimpses of the other woman underneath it wasnt perfect belle morte wasnt really physically there but it was close and it was unnerving jeanclaude had moved so that he touched me from behind by the time belle came to stand in front of me i leaned back against him because she had marked me once and that was without any physical touch i leaned against jeanclaude and fought the urge to draw his arms around me like a shield belle stood so close that the edge of musettes full skirt brushed my feet belles ghostly dress seemed to bleed over my shoes creep up my ankles i couldnt breathe jeanclaude moved us backwards out of reach of that creeping power i pulled his arms around me tight screw it i was scared if truth will not work with me what will ma petite belle asked i found my voice it was breathy scared but there was nothing i could do about it i am jeanclaudes ma petite no one elses but whatever he has is mine so you are my ma petite i decided to let that argument go for now there were other more important ones i needed to win you asked if truth doesnt work with you then what does oui ma petite i did ask sex or power i said thats what works for you you prefer both together if you can get it are you offering me sex she purred at me and the sound made me shudder and push myself harder against jeanclaude i didnt want to play with belle not in any way no i said in almost a whisper she reached out towards me that slender white hand with its dark copper nails and that afterimage of musettes hand underneath as if belles graceful hand were a strange metaphysical glove jeanclaude moved us back again a fraction of a fraction of an inch so that those longnailed fingers missed my cheek by a breath belle looked at him her long black hair beginning to move around her body like there was a wind blowing around her there was no wind only belles power are you afraid that one touch and i will take her from you no jeanclaude said but i know more of what your touch can do belle morte and i am not sure that anita would care for it hed used my real name he almost never did that perhaps because belle was using my nickname he didnt want to her anger burned the air in front of us like a real fire stealing the oxygen from the lungs making it impossible to breathe unless you took that heat into your lungs then they would sear and you would die the heat filled her words so that i half expected them to be burned into the very air did i ask if she would care to be touched no jeanclaude said his voice was very still and i felt him sinking away even with his arms wrapped around me he was sinking away folding into that quietness that he went to when he hid from everything i had a glimpse of that quiet place and it was quieter than the place i went when i killed there wasnt even static there only complete silence the emptiness filled with the smell of roses sweet so sweet cloying choking i gasped and all i could taste was roses jeanclaude caught me or i would have fallen the perfume of roses filled my nose my mouth my throat i couldnt swallow past it couldnt breathe anything but perfume i would have screamed but i had no air i heard jeanclaude yelling stop this belle laughed and even choking to death the sound rode through my body like a knowledgeable hand a hand grabbed mine and a breath of air clawed its way down my throat fighting its way through belles power again if id had enough air id have screamed micahs face hovered over mine micahs hand in mine non mon chat you are mine as is she belle knelt beside us reaching out to touch micahs face jeanclaude moved us all backwards so that we collapsed on the floor at her knees but we were out of reach again barely but barely was good right then belles eyes burned with honey fire and the nails of her hand bled copper flames on the air as she reached for micah jeanclaude tried to help us crawl away but wed fallen in a heap of long skirts long coats death by fashion belle touched micahs face trailed those glowing claws down his cheek the smell of roses closed over my head like sweet poisoned water and i was drowning again another hand on me and this touch had nothing warm in it it didnt call the ardeur it didnt call my beast it called something colder and more certain of itself my necromancy came welling up and it burst over my skin my body and i stared up into belles burning eyes and i could breathe my throat was sore as hell but i could breathe i moved my eyes enough to see damian holding my other hand his eyes were wide and i could feel his fear but he was there kneeling beside me facing the power that was belle morte belle drew micahs face towards hers her skin seemed to be made up of white light black flame hair the glittering molten metal of fingertips and eyes her lips glowed like a slash of fresh blood micahs hand convulsed in mine so strong it hurt and the pain helped made my thoughts clearer harderedged he made a small sound in his throat as belle pressed her mouth to his i knew he didnt want to touch her and i also knew he couldnt refuse her but he was mine micah was mine not hers mine i sat up with micah on one hand and damian on the other the warm and the cold the live and the dead the passion and the logic jeanclaudes hands were still on my nearly bare shoulders he strengthened me as i strengthened him but this power was mine not his the leopards werent his to call they were mine i called that part of me that the leopards touched and realized for the first time that it wasnt tied to richard or even really jeanclaude the leopards were mine and belles i sat up with my face so close to hers that the glow of her fire caressed my face and the pleasure of that light touch sent a wave of shivers over my skin it wasnt that i was immune to belles touch it was that i had my own i usually fought my beast whatever flavor it was but not tonight tonight i welcomed it embraced it and maybe that was why it poured through me like a scalding flood of power if id been a lycanthrope in truth my beast would have burst from my skin in a flood of warm fluids but i wasnt a lycanthrope but the beast rode under my skin screamed out my mouth and hit micahs body like a train a huge liquid muscled train it tore his mouth from belle mortes and brought a scream to echo mine my beast roared through his body and his beast answered it his beast rushed up from the depths to meet mine like two leviathans racing for the surface we hit that metaphorical surface together and our beasts wound in and out of our bodies rolling like huge cats luxuriating in the feel of fur and muscle there was nothing to see with the eyes but there were things to feel belle brushed her glowing hands just above us caressing that energy trиs de bon gout she touched micahs skin and that energy leaped to her bringing a gasp from her throat micah turned and i think would have gone to her again but i caught his face in my hands we kissed the kiss began as a brush of lips an exploration of tongues a nibbling of teeth a pressing of mouths then our beasts rolled through our mouths like two souls changing places the rush of energy slammed our bodies together sliced my nails through damians hand convulsed jeanclaudes hands on my shoulders i felt both his body and damians bow backwards a second before the power tore through them and ripped sounds from both their throats that had more to do with pleasure than pain micah and i rode each other mouths locked in an endless kiss as if our beasts had merged into one then slowly the entwined energies began to roll apart and slide into their separate houses of flesh i came completely to myself on the floor with micah collapsed on top of me damian lying on the floor with only my hand holding him jeanclaude was still sitting upright but he was swaying softly in place almost like he was dancing to music i couldnt hear i think he was simply fighting not to fall down but even that he made seem graceful belle was staring down at us with a look close to rapture on her face oh jeanclaude jeanclaude what toys you have wrought for yourself jeanclaude found his voice while i was still fighting to breathe over my pulse and micahs heart was thudding so hard against my chest it felt like it would burst the pulse in damians palm beat like a second heartbeat against my skin none of the rest of us had found a voice that could override the pulse of our bodies not toys belle never toys they are all toys jeanclaude some are merely harder to use than others but they are all toys she stroked her glowing hand down the back of micahs carefully styled hair her energy played along his body brought a sigh from all of us but it was faint almost a kneejerk reaction that you couldnt quite prevent we lay quiet under her touch belle looked down at us and it was hard to see through the glowing mask but i think she frowned she ran her fingertips down the side of micahs face and there was no reaction she called to his beast but his beast was well fed sleepy and content my voice came hollow as if i hadnt quite filled back up the leopards are mine belle the leopard was my first animal to call anita and call them i shall i lay on the floor feeling languorous content micah rolled his face so his cheek rested on the soft pillow of my breasts we watched her with lazy eyes the way that only cats can i should have been afraid but i wasnt the rush of power seemed to have taken all my fear along with it i felt clearheaded and safe belle poured that misty power on us but though she raised gooseflesh and brought sighs to our lips there was no more she could not call micah as her beast because he was mine she could not call my beast because i was micahs we truly were nimirra and nimirraj and together we were enough to keep her out of us she turned those goldflame eyes to someone behind us and i felt her reach out to one of the leopards id known somehow it would be nathaniel if shed tried it before micah and i had merged he would have come to her but now it was too late wed shut that gate and barred it belle morte could not touch our leopards not tonight this is not possible she said and her voice had lost some of its purring caress jeanclaude answered her doubt you can call almost all the big cats but you cannot call the cats that answer to the master of beasts padma sits upon the council you are one of my children that i cannot take what belongs to another council member is merely truth that any of my children could keep me from possessing what is theirs is impossible perhaps jeanclaude said and he got to his feet he offered a hand to both micah and me normally i dont let people help me up but tonight i was wearing a long skirt high heels and had just had what amounted to metaphysical sex in public we took his hands together and he pulled us to our feet damian still had a death grip on my other hand but he stayed on his knees eyes still only halffocused as if the power rush had thrown him more than it had the rest of us he was the only one of us who wasnt either a master or an alpha something i drew him in to sit against my legs but didnt try and make him stand it didnt look like he was ready to yet by american standards jeanclaude said this did not count as sex belle laughed and the sound still shivered across the skin but it was distant either we were too numb or too shielded for her to touch the americans do not count this as sex that is absurd perhaps but true nonetheless you and i would consider it sex would we not oh oui sex enough for one of my entertainments i almost felt jeanclaude smile i didnt have to see it do you truly believe we have not done this and more with asher she looked at him and her anger lashed through the room again like a wind off the lakes of hell i will not be turned aside so easily she gestured back at the two dead vampires you have no idea what your human servant has taken from me they were not merely vampires they were lycanthropes i said she looked at me and there was more interest than anger in her now belle had always been more interested in power than being petty though if she could be both well that would be the best of all worlds how do you know this i felt their beasts and i felt the beast from mommy dearest earlier today mommy dearest she managed to look puzzled underneath all that glittering power the sweet dark jeanclaude said i felt her stir in her sleep belle the mother of all darkness is waking up thats why her children as you put it finally came to someones call i called them she said you can call all of the great cats and among other things they are cats ill bet the master of beasts could call them too if he tried i said i thought for a moment she was actually going to stamp her footor rather musettesat me they came to my call no one elses doesnt it worry you that the children of the dark are rising doesnt that scare you i have worked long and hard to amass enough power to wake the children of the dark i shook my head you felt her today belle how can you stand there and not understand that this isnt your power going to a new level its hers waking up belle morte shook her head non ma petite you are seeking to deter me from my revenge i never forget an insult and i always make sure someone pays the price for it she walked up to us and that glowing edge of power swirled at my full skirts but it didnt catch my breath this time it was power and it crawled across my skin like lines of insects marching but it wasnt seductive it wasnt special wed all had so much power poured through us that we just didnt have anything left for more fun and games tonight she ran her hand down micahs chest and i felt his body tighten but it wasnt the effect she was used to she touched jeanclaudes face and he let her marvelous as always belle no not as always she said she turned to me then i didnt want her to touch me but i knew that i could let her do it now she wasnt here in the flesh not really and it limited her power intellectually i knew that the cold hard feeling in my stomach wasnt so certain i made myself stand still while she put that glowing hand against my face her hand didnt exactly burn where it touched but it was hot and the power spread from it marching down my body like hot water poured from my face down my skin it made me shiver and want to pull way but i could tolerate it i didnt have to pull away i didnt have to run she drew her hand back and there was a lingering sense of power between her hand and my skin she brushed it against her skirt musettes skirt i wondered was musette still in there did she know what was happening or did she go away only to come back when belle was finished she turned last to damian he tucked himself in tight against me like a dog that was afraid of being hurt but he didnt run belle touched his face he flinched not wanting to meet her eyes but as he knelt at my legs and nothing worse happened to him than the feel of power over his skin he looked up slowly there was something like wonderment in his eyes and behind that triumph belle jerked her hand back as if it had been she who was burned damian is of my line but not of yours jeanclaude it is not your power that he tastes of she looked at me and there was something on that beautiful alien face that i couldnt understand why does he taste of your power anita not you of his but he of yours i wasnt sure truth would help here but i knew a lie wouldnt would you believe me if i said im not quite sure oui and non you speak truth but there is some evasion to it i swallowed and took a deep breath i really didnt want belle to know this part i really didnt want it getting back to the council at large she looked at me and her eyes went wide and some of that glowing power began to seep away sliding back into musettes body so that it was musette with honeybrown eyes that met my gaze somehow he is your servant our legends speak of this possibility it is one of the reasons we once slew all necromancers on sight glad weve moved on from the good ol days i said we have not but when we thought you were jeanclaudes human servant then there was no harm because your power was his she shook her head and there was an afterimage of black hair over the blond a dark ghost over all that bloodstained white now i am not so certain you taste of jeanclaudes power oui but damian tastes only of yours and the leopards taste only of your power also no necromancer has ever had an animal to call she shook her head jeanclaude with his new human servant and her servants has been able to keep me at bay if i were here in flesh instead of spirit this would not save you i think of course it would not jeanclaude said your beauty would overwhelm us no false flattery jeanclaude you know how much i hate it i did not know it was false i am not so certain that my beauty would overwhelm any of you somehow this one and she motioned at me has cut me off from the leopards and somehow you have cut me off from the vampires that descend directly from you my pulse sped up a bit at that because i hadnt even felt her trying to take over meng dei or faust they were standing as far from the show as they could dressed in the bodyguard black leather though both were so small compared to the rest that they looked out of place meng die looked scared faust didnt which could have meant anything and nothing but not every vampire in this room is a direct descendant of yours jeanclaude because i am not here in flesh you may keep me from the flock that is yours but not what was first mine i was afraid i knew what she meant and hoped i didnt belle morte brushed past us with a flare of power lost like a breeze against our skin she was walking towards asher because she had made him herself and he was older than jeanclaude asher owed nothing to jeanclaude except the vows any vampire makes to his master of the city and love perhaps love i wasnt sure love was enough to save him from belle morte i believed in love but i believed in evil too neither love nor evil conquers all but evil cheats more the wolves chose that moment to come in through the far curtain their entrance stopped everything briefly because they doubled our bodyguards i didnt need to see bellesor musettesface to know she didnt like it it showed in the sudden stiffening of her shoulders the slight clenching of her fists i realized suddenly that i was seeing musette begin to rise up through belle like a fly caught in melting ice it was when i saw jason in an outfit that was mostly dark blue straps which covered about as much of his body as nathaniels outfit covered of his that i realized that there had been no wolves present until now except stephen who had ridden with micah from my house id known that richard was delayed but i hadnt noticed that none of the wolves had been here usually there were always some wolves here for jeanclaude jason walked in smiling in his black overtheknee boots but there was something in his eyes some small warning that i couldnt decipher id expected to see him wearing makeup like micah and nathaniel but he wasnt none of the male wolves were richard came into sight easy to spot above the sea of black leather that was his pack i knew that he had butchered his hair but i hadnt really grasped how much until i saw him im sure the hairstylist had done his or her best but there was only so much they could do theyd had to buzz his hair back to less than an inch of medium brown it seemed darker this short missing the gold and red highlights he also looked remarkably like his older brother aaron and his father the resemblance had always been strong but now it was like they were clones he was wearing a black tux with a shirt of deep rich blue and a matching bow tie with the new haircut and the more conservative clothes he lookedout of place his eyes met mine and the shock of how handsome he was still sent a thrill through me from head to toes without the hair to distract you couldnt pretend that the cheekbones werent knifeedge perfect the dimple in his chin didnt soften the strong masculinity of his face his shoulders were broad his waist not slender but small nothing about richard was slender he was built more like a football player than a dancer jamil and shangda his hati and skoll the ulfrics personal bodyguards flanked him jamil was wearing black leather straps for a shirt to complement almost ordinary leather pants and short boots the bright red beads worked into his cornrow braids looked like drops of crimson blood against the darkness of his skin and the black of the leather he met my eyes and there was again that sense of warning that id gotten from jason something was wrong something beyond what was already happening but what shangda looked uncomfortable out of his usual suit but black leather suited his tall frame the same way any kind of armor would have shangda was the tallest chinese person id ever met he was physically imposing by any standards he was also a warrior and protecting his ulfric was all he did he pretty much hated me because so much of the pain i caused richard was something he couldnt protect him against bodyguards cant do shit about emotional stress he avoided my gaze jason strutted towards me making sure his body swayed seductively he was by profession a stripper so he was pretty good at the seductive sway his body language said sex his eyes held a shadow of something else and when he got to me he slid an arm across my shoulders pressing his body up against mine but what he whispered in my ear wasnt sweet nothings it was a warning richard has found his backbone but hes decided to use it against jeanclaude first he smiled as he said it his face full of the seductive promise that his walk had held he ran his hands across the back of my neck playing his fingertips in the hollow of my collarbone i whispered against the shell of his ear what does that mean he turned my head towards his so that my face was hidden from richard and the pack it looked like flirting richards going to try and take all his wolves away from jeanclaude i was glad my face was facing only jason because i couldnt hide the shock i fought to control my face and jason laughed at nothing that id said he put a hand on either side of my face giving me time to regain control of myself i whispered against his skin you too he was still smiling but he managed to let me see his eyes his unhappy eyes even me he said barely moving his lips and still smiling shangda was suddenly beside us he tried to grab jasons arm and jason moved just out of reach if you had been watching you might not have realized what had happened at all a low growl trickled out of shangdas human mouth a sound that raised the hair on the back of my neck jason growled back and he was standing close enough that the growl whispered over my skin it made me shudder a shudder visible from a distance richard said shangda one word just his name but the big man didnt try and grab jason again he lowered his head and spoke in a voice gone mostly to growl a man cannot serve two masters he was trying to be discreet so hed lowered his head over me not jason i dont think he was worried that id take a chunk out of his face i looked up into that face that was almost kissably close and asked your orders are to remind jason who his pack leader is his gaze slid from jason to me and the look was equally unfriendly my ulfrics orders are none of your business he whispered it because he was trying not to clue the bad guys into the division in the ranks i realized in that moment that no matter how much shangda hated me he didnt entirely approve of what richard was doing not with enemies in town i caught movement out of the corner of my eye jeanclaude had gone to richard and they were speaking low and earnest jeanclaude tried to get close enough to whisper as we were doing but richard moved back he didnt want to be that close i glanced farther away to see musette still standing close to asher but they were not alone the wereleopards were ranged around him not protecting him exactly but making sure you had to touch them before you touched asher micah met my gaze gave the tiniest nod it said clearly ill take care of it til youre free micah didnt get distracted merle hovered over everything like an angry black leather mountain staring down at that petite figure in white musette stood there looking very much herself just herself shangda was looking at musette too it was almost as if he could smell where the danger lay we turned back to meet each others gaze at the same time we were physically close enough to kiss it should have been intimate but it wasnt it was almost frightening because we both understood each other and that had never happened before i didnt argue that i was bolverk for their clan thus the ulfrics orders were my business shangda disapproved that i was anything to them i tried for logic i leaned in close and whispered whatever richard is doing tonight is not the night for it were in trouble here something flicked through his eyes and he dropped my gaze but leaned in a fraction closer so that his short black hair brushed the top of my curls i have spoken with him he hears no one tonight his eyes came up to meet mine and there was something there i could read now pain sylvie has already argued for this to wait until our enemies leave i dont see her i whispered again leaning in closer not thinking about it she is not with us he breathed it against my cheek i must have reacted because he added she is not dead i moved back just enough to see his eyes he fought sylvie she fought him i widened eyes he won shangda nodded is she hurt he nodded again badly bad enough he said and for the very first time i saw something that wasnt approval in his face tomorrow he would go back to hating me but tonight was a dangerous night and shangda was too much the warrior not to see that even if richard couldnt jason must come with me there was no outright pleading in his voice shangda did not beg but there was a softness there room to compromise for now i said jason had worked his way behind me using me as shield against the bigger man and being jason using the excuse to lean his nearly nude body against the back of my velvet and silkclad one he laid a gentle kiss on the back of my neck and it made me shiver i cant go back to being just another pack member i cant i knew what he meant or thought i did i answered without trying to make eye contact as he kissed softly across the bare skin where neck met shoulders him playing with my neck was making it hard to concentrate only for tonight what is it with you anita does everyone want to fuck you it was richard when he was really angry he could be more hateful than anyone id ever dated the fact that he said the word fuck told me exactly how nasty he was going to be tonight god i didnt want to do this shovel emotional shit while the big bad vampires munched on us i was close enough to see the look in shangdas eyes he didnt like what his ulfric had said i touched his face which made him jump i leaned in close enough that from richards point of view it probably looked like a kiss but i whispered against shangdas mouth jasons yours tonight but this cant be permanent shangda stayed close so that he breathed his answer on my lips we will discuss it he began to lean back and i caught the back of his head with my hand there will be no discussion his face went hard with his usual anger he moved back forcefully enough that i either had to let him go or take a handful of hair to keep him close to me i let him go he held his hand out and said your ulfric wants you to stand with the wolves his voice held only one emotion and that dimlyanger jason slid out from behind me trailing his fingers across every piece of bare skin he could find until he left me shuddering shangda led him away one hand on the smaller mans arm jason kept his gaze on me like a child being carried away by scary strangers but he wasnt really in immediate danger and i couldnt say that about everybody in the room unfortunately maybe i should have made you erato instead of bolverk erato had been the muse of erotic poetry among other duties now she was the title among most werewolves for the female that helps new little werewolves control their beast during sex eros god of love and lust was the male title more first time shapeshifters lost control and killed people during sex than during any other single event the point of orgasm is to lose control after all i looked across the room at richard met his angry brown eyes and felt nothing i wasnt angry it was too ridiculous that he was fighting like this in front of musette and her people it was beyond ridiculous it was foolish well discuss this when our company goes back home richard i said and there was no anger in my voice i sounded reasonable ordinary something crossed richards face something that leaked through his tight shields rage he was so angry hed turned that anger inward and the depression had eaten him to the point where he cut his hair hed pulled himself out of the depression but he was still angry if the anger couldnt go inward then it had to go outward outward seemed to be directed at me great just great if youre bolverk then come and stand with your pack his voice vibrated with the rage that he was having trouble containing i blinked at him for a second im sorry what did you say if you are truly bolverk for our clan then you need to stand with us he met my gaze and there was no flinching in him now no softness id waited for him to stop flinching id never dreamed it could mean this jamil walked back across the room with stephen held in his arms gregory was still clinging to stephens hand so they moved as a unit when jamil was back with the wolves richard said gregory is not one of us he cannot stand with us i couldnt hear what jamil said but i think he was trying to persuade richard that that wasnt necessary richard shook his head then jamil made a mistake he looked back at me and with his eyes alone asked for help hed done it before many times most of them had tonight richard saw it understood it and didnt tolerate it he grabbed gregorys wrist and tried to jerk him away from stephen stephen screamed and reared up in jamils arms clinging with both hands to his brothers arm id had enough i didnt care if belle heard it all i moved across the floor toward the pack richard youre being cruel he didnt stop trying to pull them apart i thought you wanted me cruel i wanted you strong not cruel i was almost to them and not sure what i was going to do when i got there youre strong and youre cruel actually im strong and pragmatic not cruel i was beside them now and i knew i didnt dare touch anyone if i touched richard or the twins it would lead to more violence i could feel it stephen was making a high piteous noise like a baby rabbit being eaten alive he was scrambling with his hands trying to hold on to gregory gregory was crying and trying to hold on to his brother pragmatic is saying that youre making us look weak in front of a council member cruel is saying that im bolverk because you dont have the balls to be he stopped pulling on the twins and jamil took that one moment of hesitation to slide away of course that left me facing richard alone and it was one of those moments when i realized how physically imposing he was richard was one of those big men who dont seem big until suddenly they do and you go oh god and its usually too late we stood glaring at each other i hadnt been angry until hed tried to hurt stephen and gregory but once you get me angry i usually stay there i enjoy my anger its the only hobby i have a dozen cruel remarks danced through my head and i kept my mouth closed i was afraid of what would fall out if i opened it i walked forward closing the remaining distance between us i got to see something else in his eyes besides angerpanic he didnt want me this close great i kept moving forward and richard actually moved back a step then he seemed to realize what hed done when i took another step towards him he stood his ground i walked until the full skirt of my dress brushed his legs the skirt swirled out and covered the toes of his polished shoes i was close enough that it would have been more natural to touch each other than to simply stand there as we did i looked up the length of his body and met his eyes with the knowledge in my eyes that i knew what was under that conservative suit every inch of it richard wasnt looking at my face when i looked up he was staring at my décolletage i took a deep breath making the mounds of my breasts rise and fall as if a hand were pushing them from underneath he looked up from my chest and met my eyes the rage in his face was a nearly pure thing an anger without purpose without form it was like one of those huge wildfires that begins by eating the trees then somewhere along the way the fire takes on a life of its own almost as if it doesnt need fuel anymore it doesnt need anything to exist it burns and grows and destroys not because it needs fuel but because thats what it does what it is i faced richards rage with my own his was new and fresh it hadnt had time to burn its way down to his soul to hollow out a space that held nothing but the anger mine was old almost as old as i could remember if richard wanted to fight we could fight if he wanted to fuck we could fuck at that moment either one would have been almost equally damaging to both of us his beast rose to his anger like a dog to its owners voice any strong emotion could bring on the change and this was about as strong as emotions got for richard the energy of his beast flared like heat off a road on a summers day a visible wave of power it danced along the bare skin of my body once upon a time hed brought me using nothing but his beast thrusting through my body but tonight wed do other things i doubted theyd be as fun musette glided close to us in her bloodspattered white dress her eyes were blue again she wove her hands through the energy of richards beast playing between the two of us not touching literally playing with the energy oh you would be very good to eat trиs bon trиs trиs bon she laughed and it was the kind of laugh that would make you look twice in a bar a laugh made to get attention the sound didnt go with the blood drying like a mask on her face richard let the rage fill his eyes and directed it at her it was a look that i think would have backed up anyone else in the room musette laughed again richard turned to face her his anger really didnt care who the target was anyone would do this is none of your concern when were done with pack business then and only then well talk to the vampires musette threw her head back and chortled there was no other word for it she laughed until tears leaked down her face carving runnels in the drying blood the laughter died slowly and when she opened her eyes again they were honeybrown richards breath caught in his throat i was close enough to him to know that he stopped breathing just for a moment the smell of roses was everywhere you remember me wolf i can feel it in your fear that purring contralto shivered down my skin and i saw richard shudder too i will play with you later wolf but for now and she turned and looked at asher for now i will play with him asher was still pressed to the wall doing that utter stillness that the old ones can do he had sunk into the silence of eternity trying to make this not happen trying to hide in plain sight it wasnt going to work as musettes body glided towards him belle began to spill out of her the dark gold gown overlaying the white like a ghost the black hair spreading like phantom flames around her moved by a wind that trickled through the room the wind of belles power whats happening richard whispered and i dont even know if he meant to have an answer but i replied anyway musette is belle mortes surrogate his eyes were all for belles ghostly form overriding the other body when he said what does that mean exactly it means we are in a shit load of trouble he looked at me then i am ulfric anita that doesnt change just because some highranking vampire comes to town be ulfric richard great knock yourself out but dont destroy us all while you do it some of the anger had leaked away on the tide of fear it was impossible to be up close and personal with belles power and not fear it i am either ulfric or im not anita i am either master or slave i cant be both i raised eyebrows at him yeah actually you can i held up a hand i dont have time for this tonight richard tomorrow if were all still alive then we can discuss it okay he frowned shes not here in flesh anita its only metaphysical games how bad could it be i realized in that moment that richard was still living in that other world the world where people played fair and horrible things never really happened it must have been a peaceful place to live the planet that people like richard called home id always admired the view but id never lived there the trouble was that richard didnt live there either the first scream cut through the silence the wereleopards had all backed away crouching at belle mortes feet only micah stayed standing hed put himself in front of asher but he was small like me and he couldnt hide asher completely i looked at richard and he had a look of such hurt in his eyes he was never going to wake up and smell the blood he wasnt going to truly change i turned away from him and started walking towards asher and micah jeanclaude moved up beside me offered me his hand and i took it no one else moved with us the wererats couldnt attack musette the wereleopards were doing their best but it wasnt going to be enough only the wolves could have helped us and richard wouldnt let them in that moment i wondered how long it would be before i started hating richard i couldnt figure out why asher was screaming there was no blood no rending of flesh but he screamed all the same then as we got closer i watched the flesh of his face begin to seep away it was as if his skin collapsed around the bones of his skull as if belles touch were draining him dry not of blood but of everything i risked a glance at jeanclaude and he looked stricken a second before his face showed nothing i felt him pull away into that emptiness where he hid she could drain him to death this way his voice was remarkably empty but youre immune to it right she didnt make you she is our sourdre de sang none of us are immune to her touch i stopped and pushed him back then you stay i dont need two of you to worry about he didnt argue but his gaze went past me to asher i wasnt sure hed even heard me and there wasnt time to check i was halfrunning when micah pushed belle back pushed her back using his whole body broke her touch on ashers face asher collapsed slowly down the wall and belles glowing face kissed micah the moment their lips touched i felt the ardeur fill the room like hot water spilled in stinging drops across my skin it froze me in midstep made me stumble i stood there caught between asher against the wall and micah lost in that glowing embrace i knew that i could have drained micah to death with the ardeur over a matter of days but part of me knew that belle could do it faster ashers hand reached out to me skeletal thin like sticks in paper micah was trying to push himself back from musettebelles body but she rode him arms at his back glowing crimson lips like a red fog across his face i had a moment of feeling asher dying fading for lack of a better word jeanclaude went to him but i knew that jeanclaude had no life to share then the cross taped to my chest blazed to life it burned against my flesh as if the black tape held all the heat in i halfscreamed as i ripped the tape away and the cross spilled out into the light white hot like a captive star on a chain micah stumbled back from belle morte jeanclaude spilled the black velvet coat over himself and asher the other vampires hid their faces and hissed at the light i saw movement from the corner of my eye a second before angelito slammed into me there was no one to stop him now the cross was a twoedged sword he grabbed me in one arm completely off the ground the other hand wrapping around the cross i poked him in the throat with three fingers stiffened to a spear point he gagged and dropped me but he held on to the cross and as i fell the chain broke cutting into my neck as it came away the moment the cross was his the glow began to fade musettes body turned to me but her eyes were pools of dark gold fire and it wasnt a ghostly image superimposed over her body this time it was as if i were seeing double my eyes saw musette with the wrong color of eyes but inside my head it was belle belle in the flesh a little taller than musette long black hair falling to her knees in waves the dark gold of her dressing gown showing a triangle of white flesh her face like something sculpted from a pearl her lips a perfect red pout she wrapped white hands around my arms long dark nails playing along the velvet of the sleeves she pressed me against her body and leaned in to lay a kiss with that mouth upon mine a small voice in my head screamed dont let her touch you but i couldnt move couldnt get away wasnt sure i wanted to get away that red red mouth hovered over mine her breath pushed against my lips the world smelled of roses then suddenly i could taste ashers kiss upon my lips tasted it as if i had kissed him but a second before that one taste opened my eyes helped me draw back from belles mouth helped me want to draw back her eyes stared down at me pools of golden fire like brown water in sunlight i realized that i had swooned and she held me as if shed dipped me in a dance her hand was behind my head raising me up to meet her kiss i felt movement and rolled my eyes back to see richard belle saw him too interfere and i will raise the ardeur in you again wolf you brought no women with you did you think that would save you it wont the ardeur only wants to be fed wolf it doesnt care how richard hesitated i could taste his fear in my mouth but underneath that was still the taste of ashers kiss jeanclaude was suddenly beside belle it is me you want he spread his arms in a wide dramatic gesture that spread the darkness of his coat spilled his hair around him i am here i dont know what would have happened or what she would have said because the next thing that overwhelmed me was the memory of ashers love making it came on me like it had once with jason but this was more worse better it bowed my back convulsed me in belles arms surprised a scream from me made my hands scratch at the air and at belles face she dropped me then and i saw dimly as if through a white window her hands grab jeanclaude richard caught me before i hit the ground cradled me in his arms he looked so worried his hand touched my face anita are you hurt i managed to shake my head but even with richard this close his face soft and worried about me i turned my head to look towards asher i couldnt help myself ashers hair was like golden christmas tree tinsel lifeless hanging around a face that was more skull than flesh his lips were a thin hard line around teeth that were mostly fangs only his eyes were still asher pools of pale blue fire as if a winter sky could burn the moment i saw his eyes i tried to crawl out of richards arms tried to crawl to asher anita anita whats wrong he held me turned me to look at him i found my voice but all i could say was asher he glanced at the fallen vampire and the disgust was plain on his face i know anita im sorry i wasnt sure what he was apologizing about and i didnt care there was something else i should have been more worried about something id forgotten but i couldnt think of anything except ashers eyes and that i had to go to him had to richard stood up suddenly with me still in his arms i heard scrabbling as if of a thousand tiny claws rats thousands of rats flowed in a furry squeaking wave across the floor of the cave ashers power receded and i knew it had cost him dear to let me go knew in that instant that i was the only one who could feed him enough energy to keep him alive richard made a small sound of dismay and turned so that i could see what had paled him the two vampires that had had the tops of their heads blown off were slowly rising to their feet they were healed those strange cateyed faces were whole there wasnt even a scar to mark where the bullets had struck fuck i said one of the werehyenas nerve broke and he fired into the squirming mass of rats the next sound was a second gunshot and he fell with a hole in his back fell into the mob of rats they boiled over him and his body vanished from sight the sounds though nothing masked the sounds i hadnt been close enough to the gunshots to be deafened and for the first time i was sorry about that the sound of tiny teeth tearing flesh squeaking voices squabbling over what used to be a man seemed to drown us all one of the wererats was staring at the gun in his hand as if it had suddenly appeared he turned a white face back towards us i think he mouthed im sorry before bobby lees scream guns down guns fucking down now no one fire he threw his own gun spinning across the room and the other wererats followed suit some of the werehyenas lowered their guns but only one threw his away bobby lee went to his knees and clasped his hands on top of his head claudia did it next then one by one all the wererats followed i knew why they were afraid musettebelle would use them against us but i wouldnt have wanted to be kneeling on the floor when the rats found me i finally could think enough to remember that jeanclaude might be fighting for his life but he wasnt belle held his beautiful face in her hands but he was still standing his own hands cupped hers pressing her hands against his face his face was still perfect untouched a soft smile played along his lips it was belles eyes that were wide her face that was unhappy he couldnt eat her as she had asher but strangely she seemed to be having trouble eating him i knew that bellemusette had called the rats i didnt think shed had a thing to do with the recuperative powers of the two children of the night they were half crouched one helping the other to stand but they werent looking at belle or anyone else i had a moment to wonder if they were going to hold a grudge when the wave of rats jumped on the first werehyena tiny teeth trying to tear through the black leather people were screaming and the werehyenas began to fire into the small rats blasting their bodies into red ruin but there were so many of them the rats parted around the kneeling wererats like they were big rocks in a stream can you stand richard asked i think so he lowered me gently to the floor then he glanced at the werewolves who were still standing in an unhappy group apparently richards point to sylvie had been violent enough that none of them had disobeyed well jason was struggling in a joint lock that shangda had on his arm but no one else had tried to help what the hell had richard done to sylvie the world suddenly smelled like the musk of wolf fur the damp richness of leaf mold the christmas tree scent of evergreen as if my furred shoulder had just brushed it with dew still on it on a calm still morning i felt that piece of me that was richards beast pour up through my body and ease across my skin like wind richard looked at me with amber wolf eyes hed opened the marks between us opened them wide he threw back his head and howled and a dozen throats answered him then the werewolves moved forward like a black wave of destruction shangda and jamil stayed at richards back and they showed claws where fingernails should have been the halfchange of the very alpha for the rest i felt them slip their skin felt the rush of energy like small tugging explosions in my gut i could feel now that jeanclaude had shut his end of our triumvirate down as tight as he could i could look at him but for once i couldnt feel him at all hed expected to die and he hadnt wanted to take us with him i found one of the guns that the wererats had discarded and felt instantly better the weight of it in my hand was a very good thing unfortunately i wasnt the only human servant that had found a gun angelito fired at a werehyena sending him spinning round falling into the mass of biting rats he screamed and writhed trying to beat them off him i shot into the rats close to him but there were too many it was like trying to shoot water you moved it but didnt hurt it i knew one way to stop the rats i sighted down the barrel at musettebelles head if i killed her the rats would go back to wherever they came from i let out my breath stilled myself for a shot that was far too close to jeanclaude for my comfort a rat jumped on my hand dug its teeth into me the wave of them began to jump on my dress their claws catching in the heavy fabric i screamed and suddenly micah was there halfcrouched hissing at the rats those on the floor scattered squealing in terror the ones already on my body seemed immune to the fear he helped me pick them off and threw them into the scurrying mass the rats poured over their injured comrades and ate them too the rats seemed more afraid of the wereleopards than of the wolves and the wereleopards began to spread out from the wall hissing sending the small rodents back gaining an everwidening space the two vampires that i thought id killed had grown claws and fangs that no vampire ever had they were wading through the werewolves in a spray of blood and white bone one great hand was raised at shangdas back and without thinking i fired able to aim because i stood in the circle the leopards had made the vampires head exploded again i knew now that if we wanted him to stay dead we needed to take his heart and burn it all scattering the ashes over different bodies of running water wouldnt have hurt either shangda had time for the barest of glances my way then the other vampire launched himself and sent all three of them to the floor for the rats to engulf belles voice rose over the noise like a storm a thunderclap that froze all of us in midaction even the furred sea of rats froze enough she stepped back from jeanclaude and he began to laugh it wasnt his magical laugh that slithered across the skin and made you think of sex it was just laughter pure unadulterated joy we will fight no more belle said and though her voice was still deep it had lost its sexy purr she sounded not angry but put out as if shed gotten badly surprised the rats pulled back like a furry ocean draining away they squeaked and squealed but they left most of the werewolves were covered in tiny crimson bite marks the remains of the fallen werehyena looked like it had been mauled by something much bigger jeanclaude found his voice and it was as joyous as his laughter had been you cannot feed from me you cannot take back what you gave me because i am no longer of your line i am sourdre de sang of my own line now belle stared at him her face that blank emptiness that i knew so well she was hiding how she really felt i know what it means jeanclaude you can no longer treat me as a lesser member of your line belle there are different niceties to be observed between two sourdres de sang she smoothed her hands down her full skirt and i knew that gesture it was one of jeanclaudes nervous belle morte was nervous i was within my rights to do as i have done for i did not know nor did you true enough but now that we do know you must take all your people and go leave our lands tonight for if you are found in our territory come tomorrow night your lives will be forfeit you would not truly kill my musette but her voice held the lightest thread of uncertainty to be able to kill musette legally with no political repercussions he made a small tuttut sound that has been the fondest wish of many a master vampire and i will do it belle you can taste the truth of my words she stiffened just a little i will retain control of musette until we are out of your lands she has an unfortunate temper at times it would be a bad thing if she lost her temper here in st louis jeanclaude said and his voice was empty the joy seeping away cherry appeared at my elbow sorry to interrupt im not an expert on vampires but i think ashers dying asher lay against the far wall he was a skeleton with dried parchment skin he lay on a bed of golden christmas tree tinsel the glorious remnant of his hair his clothes had collapsed around his sunken body like a deflated balloon his eyes were closed and only the roundness of his eyes underneath that thin skin was flesh and solid everything else seemed to have withered away i fell to my knees beside him because suddenly i couldnt stand hes not dead valentinas child voice came but she stayed out of reach she offered comfort but she wasnt stupid i looked down at what was left of all that beauty and didnt believe her see with something other than your eyes ma petite jeanclaude said he didnt kneel but stayed standing facing belle morte almost as if he didnt dare turn his back on her i did what jeanclaude told me to do i looked with power instead of my physical eyes i could feel a spark inside asher some small part of him still burned he wasnt dead but he might as well have been i looked up at jeanclaude hes too weak to take blood and he has no human servant belle morte said no animal to call he is without and she paused seemed to think upon her next word finally she said resources resources that was a nice word for it but whatever word you used she was right asher had nothing to feed on but blood and if he was too weak to feed on that i couldnt finish the thought even in my head belle morte could save him jeanclaudes voice was neutral empty i looked up at him then past him to her what do you mean she made him and she is a sourdre de sang she could simply give him back some of the energy that she stole from him i stole nothing belle said and her own neutral voice held a hint of anger you cannot steal what is yours by right and asher is mine all of him jeanclaude every piece of his skin every drop of his blood he lives only through my sufferance and without that he dies jeanclaude made a small gesture perhaps stole is not the correct term but you can restore some of his life energy you could bring him back enough to be able to feed on blood i could but i will not her anger was like a scalding wind biting along my skin where it touched why not i asked it because no one else seemed willing to and i had to know i do not have to explain myself to you anita i still had the gun in my hand suddenly it was heavy as if it had reminded me it was there or maybe the shock of lifting it was enough for me to feel again i stood up and aimed the gun at musettes chest if asher dies so does musette you have not had much luck killing vampires with your little gun belle said and she sounded confident of course it wasnt her body that i was about to riddle with bullets i think the mothers children are special cases they probably can survive pretty much everything but fire i dont think thats true of musette i had let out the breath in my body so that i was as still as i could get my free hand was resting at my lower back half cradled on my buttocks it was my favorite position for target shooting angelito will stop you she said simply i looked back to find angelito held on his knees by three werewolves but hey if he makes a nuisance of himself he can die too he probably wont survive me killing musette anyway belle mortes brown eyes widened just a bit you would not dare sure i would and i smiled but it didnt reach my eyes because i had them on musettes body i was ignoring belles shape over musette concentrating on seeing that white dress with its dried blood the more i concentrated the more of musette i could see like a double image musettes chest in my physical eyes and belles ghostly overlay in my head it made me wonder how much of belle everyone else had been seeing or if id had a better show because of my necromancy id ask someone later much later jeanclaude you cannot allow this ma petite has her moments of rashness but in this moment she has reminded me that the rules are not the same now i am within my rights as sourdre de sang to punish one of your people for harming my second in command it is perfectly within our laws i did not know that asher was the second in command to a sourdre de sang when i drank from him my arm was still steady but it wouldnt last you cant hold a onearmed shooting stance forever hell you cant hold any shooting stance forever you know now i said and hes not dead yet so youre killing the second in command of another sourdre de sang with foreknowledge we are within our rights to take musettes life in payment for ashers jeanclaude said you should be more careful belle sending people you value far away from you makes it so much harder to keep them safe i was fighting for my arm not to tremble eventually id lose let me make this easy for you belle help asher now or i kill musette the one thing that was the same in both the vision of my eyes and the vision of my head was those honeybrown eyes those eyes looked at me and i felt the draw in them she wanted me to lower my gun and my arm hurt so why didnt i my arm started to lower and i caught myself a moment before jeanclaude touched my shoulder i put the arm back where id had it but just lowering and raising it had helped the lactic acid build up i could hold the stance for much longer now if you wish to play games with musettes life that is up to you jeanclaude said and his voice danced over my skin made my body shiver made my hand convulse and only practice kept my finger from squeezing the trigger but i didnt tell him to stop because belle had used her mark on me to cloud my mind it had been a long time since a vampire had gotten to me so casually jeanclaudes sex ran over my skin while the fear ran like ice through the rest of me belle wasnt defeated not even close arrogance would get more of us killed so no arrogance just truth what you have to ask yourself belle i said in a voice that was very quiet because i was concentrating on my breathing trying to be still for when i fired is is your love for musette stronger than your hatred for asher you do not hate lesser beings anita you merely punish them her voice sounded so sure of itself jeanclaude said one word liar those dark honey eyes flicked to him and there was no love lost in that look she hated jeanclaude too she hated them both they had told me why they were the only two men who had ever left her bed voluntarily as far as she saw it they had deserted her and no one leaves belle morte because no one would want to strangely their leaving had damaged her sense of self but i didnt share this knowledge because hurting belle mortes pride wouldnt help us to salvage her pride shed let asher and musette die i was almost sure of it i swallowed the words and fought to control my face but id forgotten that she was a sourdre de sang and shed marked me once it wasnt my face i had to worry about her voice came in my head like a dream riding on the scent of roses my pride is not so fragile a thing anita jeanclaudes kiss on my cheek chased back the scent of roses and that purring voice ma petite ma petite are you well i nodded prove it i said heal asher jeanclaude didnt ask to whom i was speaking hed heard through me or he guessed or he didnt bother to question because we were running out of time you will talk him to death valentina said everyone but me looked at the child vampire i was still fighting to keep a target on musettes whiteclad chest if you do not give him the kiss of life soon he will be beyond even your powers belle morte valentina said belle fought to keep her face calm but the anger leaked through the room or maybe i was just more sensitive to it have you changed sides petite morte non but i do not wish to lose musette by accident if you choose ashers death that is one thing to simply miss the chance to save him another i wanted badly to turn and look at valentina but i kept my gaze on musette on belle besides valentinas face would have been like all the old ones when they were hiding themselves or risking themselves blank empty a lovely mask something passed between them something i could not read belle took a deep impatient breath smoothed her skirts and began to walk forward it wasnt quite the graceful glide that musettes body normally had i wondered if vampires had trouble gliding when they were nervous because belle was nervous i could feel it i lowered the gun as she moved because if she was going to save asher musette lived that was the deal besides my shoulder and hand were beginning to ache if id known i was going to have to keep the stance so long id have gone for a twohanded stance belle morte seemed to collect herself as she moved across the room so that by the time she reached asher she was gliding and musettes white dress was completely lost to belles dark gold at least to my eyes she knelt by ashers body i couldnt think of it as anything else but a body i was already distancing myself from him i realized with something like shock that i didnt believe shed save him he felt so dead so very dead jeanclaudes hands squeezed my shoulders and i realized that he was shielding from me hard he didnt want to share his feelings right now and i didnt blame him they were too personal for sharing too frightening richard was gone too i actually had to glance at him to make sure he was still in the room thats how tight he was shielding i wasnt sure when he went away behind his shields which seemed strange i should have noticed he caught my look and he couldnt keep the compassion or the pain off his face i dont think it was pain for asher jeanclaudes hands tensed and the movement brought my attention back to belle her hair fell out around her like a black cloak so that the gold dress showed only in hints through all that blackness i felt jeanclaude gather himself like it was a physical effort to gather his will then he sighed and he shook himself like a bird settling its feathers he stepped out from behind me and offered me his arm very formally i hesitated for a heartbeat then slid my arm through his he was still shielding from me still hiding his emotions but i didnt need to be anything but his friend to know what he was thinking it hurt his heart to see asher reduced to this it hurt me and i didnt have centuries of history with the man he walked us forward toward the kneeling vampire and what was left of the person that we both loved i would never know if my love for asher was because of jeanclaudes feelings for him it probably was but i couldnt separate my feelings from jeanclaudes that should have panicked me but it didnt i was tired of being scared all the time i was ready to try and be as brave with my heart as i usually was with the rest of me besides id been careful with richard and in the end wed broken each others hearts i glanced at him as i walked forward on jeanclaudes arm my heart still tugged at the sight of him earlier today id been ready for a reconciliation i was always ready for a reconciliation with richard any time he gave an inch the trouble was he kept taking back that inch he caught me looking at him and there was something in his eyes a pain a loss as deep as the ocean as wide as the sea i loved him i really loved him maybe i always would i had this horrible urge to run to him to let him sweep me up in his arms to chase that hurt from his eyes but he probably wouldnt sweep me up in his arms hed probably just look at me uncomprehending and that would make me hate him i didnt want to hate richard i turned away from him i didnt want him to see the longing the loss or the first stirrings of hate on my face i felt richard beside me before he touched me i had a moment of surprise while i gazed up into his face his face was as close to unreadable as he could get he didnt sweep me up into his arms but he did offer me his arm i hesitated as i had with jeanclaude then slowly i slid my arm through his he pressed his hand over mine so warm so solid pressing me against the solid weight of his muscular forearm i lowered my eyes so he wouldnt see how it affected me we were all shielding like a son of a bitch trying to stay safe in our own thoughts richard and jeanclaude exchanged a look over my head i dont know what the look was supposed to mean it should have seemed silly to be exchanging any looks when all we had to do was open the marks that made us a triumvirate then we could have nearly read each others minds but this was the first time in months that richard was at our side i think all three of us were being as careful as we knew how to be belle knelt over asher her head lowered as if she were kissing him but she held herself off his body one hand on the floor the other against the wall the kiss looked so intimate but she went to great pains to not touch him more than she had to an intimate act ruined i should have been able to feel the power she was pushing into him but i was shielding too tight i wasnt good enough at shielding to filter out and in what i chose when i shielded this hard i shielded everything out i wanted to feel what she was doing i wanted to sense whether that faint spark inside asher was growing i opened just a touch like widening the shutter on a camera only a little opening only enough to reach out and touch that spark i tasted ashers kiss upon my mouth as if i had drunk a wine that tasted of him the spark had become a flame a cold flame that filled his body and still belle poured energy into him asher screamed through my mind and that silent scream staggered me would have knocked me to my knees if richard and jeanclaude hadnt caught me anita whats wrong richard asked ma petite are you well there was no time to explain i pulled free of both of them and they didnt fight me i grabbed belle by the shoulder and the hair and it was almost shocking to feel musettes careful curls crush under my hand as i jerked her back i was expecting to feel belles waves under my hand but belle wasnt here not really shed never been here she was not illusion but not exactly real either i flung her away from asher sending her sliding across the floor on the slick white cloth of musettes dress but it was belles voice that thundered through the room how dare you lay hands on me youre trying to bind him to you again as of old he doesnt want to be bound he will fade and die without the power that i can breathe into him she looked around as if she expected someone to help her to her feet the only people who would have been willing to help were under guard and no one else made a move she finally stood on her own but with nothing near to grab onto and an oldfashioned corset on graceful it was not good to know that some fashions even a vampire cant make work belle turned eyes that glittered with brown fire to me asher will die without me look at him see what is left of him it is not enough to survive her power had poured some flesh in under that dry skin but not much it was as if i could see the individual muscles and ligaments under the skin like a physiology diagram to show where all the attachment points are but it was not like a person the hair was still a dry nest of golden tinsel and the skin like faded parchment stretched over an obscenely thin frame but the eyes the eyes looked human except for that extraordinary ice blue color even when hed been human his eyes could never have looked anything but extraordinary asher was there in those eyes he was trapped in that fragile halfdead shell he gazed up at me and i felt the weight of everything he was in his eyes blood may save his life belle said but it will not give him back what he has lost only his maker or the one who has taken his essence can give it back she stood there with her shining darkness coming out of the eyes in musettes face she didnt add that since she was both ashers maker and the one who had stolen his essence only she could return him to his former glory belle morte had a little too much class to point out the obvious but it hung unsaid in the air he just needs power i said it doesnt have to be yours if he had a human servant or an animal to call but he has nothing belle said and there was a tone of satisfaction in her voice that she couldnt or didnt try to hide he is alone and binding himself to me again is the only choice he has unless you wish him to spend the rest of eternity as he is now the note of satisfaction slid into cruelty without blinking an eye you cant leave him like this richard said and there was pity on his face yes but more there was horror being tied to belle morte isnt worse than this if you had ever known her embrace jeanclaude said you might not be so quick to decide richard looked at him then back at asher then at belle morte i dont understand no i said you dont then i looked up at him touched his arm very lightly think of yourself trapped forever with raina a look of disgust and personal revulsion skipped across his face before he could hide it i still carried a piece of rainas munin her spirit memory in me she was a sexual sadist but shed also fiercely protected the very people she tortured the woman had needed some serious therapy in the end the only therapy shed gotten had been silver bullets i never felt bad about killing raina funny that richard nodded i understand that but he made a helpless gesture towards asher this is not he seemed at a loss for words i couldnt blame him i had no words at the thought of this being ashers fate for the next few centuries it wasnt bearable it simply wasnt but i couldnt make belle give him the energy without strings attached it was the nature of vampire energy that there were always strings attached it was designed to bind a vampire to its maker and through its maker to the council to the entire power structure of their world everything would fall apart if you didnt belong to somebody there are masterless shapeshifters but no masterless vampires there are vampires who have lost their masters but they are compelled to find a new master to swear new blood oaths to hunt someone else to rule them a truly lesser vampire can even die without a master vampire to rule them they go to sleep at dawn and never wake up again i knew all this knew all of it and didnt care i could feel ashersnot thoughtsbut will he preferred a clean death to this or to being belles slave again i dropped to my knees beside him i could give him a clean death i knew all about death i started to touch him my hand hesitated i didnt want to touch him didnt want to feel that onceliving skin turned to this didnt want my last memory of him to be this but i hate cowardice almost worse than anything else and if asher could be trapped inside this body then i could touch him one last time i laid my hand against his face gently oh so gently the skin felt thin as paper dried and brittle i was afraid if i pushed my fingers would go through his skin like the pages of an ancient book handled too roughly id forgotten that all vampire powers are stronger with touch one second i was holding his face as delicately as i could the next moment i had collapsed across his body and was writhing with the memory of ashers body on mine hands grabbed me back ripped me away from asher and i fought those hands drove my elbow back into a groin the hands didnt let go but dimly i heard someone yelling my name anita anita anita over and over i blinked and it was like waking but i knew my eyes hadnt been closed richards hands were still on me but he was standing like something hurt i opened my mouth to apologize but what came out wasnt an apology why did you stop us i thought you were going to crush him staring up into his so sincere face i knew he meant it hadnt i just moments before been afraid id shove a ringer through ashers brittle skin but somehow i knew that wasnt going to happen somehow i knew he was a lot more durable than he appeared jeanclaude came to stand beside me and the look on his face said that hed figured out what richard hadnt but richard wasnt good with the dead it wasnt his area of specialty jeanclaude touched my face gently as if afraid id break he fed from you from your memory of him i nodded yes how many vampires can you serve belle asked apparently jeanclaude hadnt been the only one to notice i realized that she thought asher had marked me but that wasnt exactly it he hasnt marked me belle if thats what you think then how can he feed from your strength surprise i said i dont think that jeanclaude is the only vampire whos gained new power this is not possible but its true i said and i didnt try and keep the triumph out of my voice we didnt need her now we didnt fucking need her now richard was still holding my arms i looked up at him let me go richard he frowned down at me he either didnt understand or didnt want to i repeated myself more gently let go richard please his eyes flicked to asher lying against the wall still looking mostly dead the last time we talked about this you had the same rule i had no one feeds off of you i searched his face while he gazed at what was left of ashers beauty i tried to see something in that gaze that i could talk to explain things to but i wasnt sure there was anyone there that would understand if i dont let him feed richard hell be trapped like he is right now he wont die he wont decay hell just exist like that he tore his gaze away from asher and looked at me he didnt take blood its more like an energy feed like the ardeur it suddenly occurred to me that richard might not know that asher really truly was in my bed id pretended in the past with more than one man that he was a boyfriend or lover to fool the bad guys richard might believe that it was just a game again now wasnt the time to explain all the gory details there would be time later to find out if richard had meant what he said in my mind in the jeep that he didnt care who i had sex with because we werent dating if he meant it it would upset me if he hadnt meant it then knowing about asher would upset him either way it could wait he still hadnt let go of my arms have you let asher feed on you before i dont know what i would have answered because he let go of one of my arms he reached up a slow hand to touch my chin i knew what he was going to do and i couldnt stop it he turned my head to one side and exposed the vampire bites on the side of my neck when did you start sharing blood last night he lowered his hand and i turned to meet his eyes one look was enough he like me thought sex was the lesser evil the problem with something being a lesser evil is that something else has to be the greater evil is it just jeanclaude or his gaze flicked to asher well talk about this tomorrow richard i promise but right now i need to help asher he shook his head are those jeanclaudes marks on your neck i sighed and looked down at the floor i made myself meet his eyes but damn it i didnt have time or energy for this not right now no i said again his gaze flicked to asher his yes how can you let them feed off of you if i hadnt let asher feed last night then tonight hed be dead or enthralled to belle morte for the rest of eternity its one of the reasons we did it you knew hed be able to feed he frowned at me i shook my head no but musette had claimed him for belle because he didnt belong to anyone we made sure he belonged to us us he actually looked at micah first micahs face was as neutral as he could manage not micah jeanclaude he looked at the vampire then back to micah how can you let her do this id feed him myself if it would help micah said richards eyes widened and the look on his face was uncomprehending i dont understand that micah just looked at him for a moment then he looked at me and there was something in his eyes that said he understood some of what all this cost me cost us both cost us all richard had let go of my arm now in fact hed taken a step back from me as if he didnt want to be that close he acted as if id done something unclean if he only knew or maybe the sex wouldnt bother him at all maybe it was all about the feeding for him my moral standards just werent that finely cut anymore i sighed and turned to jeanclaude since you went along for the ride with ashers feeding he may be able to feed off of you through me jeanclaude nodded perhaps if you touch me while i touch asher and drop shields we can try it between the two of us i think we can get him back to a place where one blood feeding should get him back to his normal glorious self i am willing to try he said i fought the urge to glance at richard i know you are i walked away from them both towards asher i wanted to feed asher back to health but truthfully id had about enough of all the men in my life for one night jeanclaude and i knelt by asher he had gained enough from that first small taste to manage a smile the smile was the barest phantom of what he had been but i was so relieved to see it that it made me smile too i gripped jeanclaudes hand in my left hand and laid my right on ashers cheek the moment i touched him he was the most beautiful thing id ever seen nothing mattered but to touch him nothing mattered but to be with him nothing mattered but asher it was as if the world had narrowed down to his eyes his body the sun revolved around him i just knew it in a dim part of my brain i realized that asher hadnt been using vampire powers on me that whatever id felt before this had been real because this was unreal id never felt for anyone like this because it wasnt love or even lust it was obsession it was the sure knowledge that if i did not touch him i would die even as i thought it i knew it wasnt true but it felt true god help me it felt true i fought to free my left hand something was holding it so i couldnt touch asher with both hands i needed to touch him with both my hands i laid my body on top of asher and caressed my hands down him his hands trapped my face between them and in some part of me i knew they felt like old leather and sticks with things underneath them but for the first time when dealing with vampire trickery i didnt fight it i let ashers power turn what might have been horror into something erotic and beautiful i opened myself wide and let asher roll through me like a stream long dammed flowing flooding filling up a land that has been too long without water i did not ride his power his power engulfed me rolled me under with a weight of a thousand waves pressed me to the bottom of the sand and held me at the bottom of the ocean it wasnt that i didnt drown it was that i didnt care that i drowned i woke if waking was the term with his body pressing me to the hard stone floor i was staring up at a waving cloud of his hair the lights sparkled through it like a golden veil i ran my fingers through it and it was soft and alive again the edge of his cheek was full and rough with scars again i touched those familiar marks and he turned to face me fully and the sight of him caught my breath in my throat from the curve of his forehead to the line of his cheek the fullness of his lips he was perfect once more his eyes sat in that face like icy sapphires set among pearls and gold i laughed when i saw him a joyous burst of sound he cupped my face in his hand and i turned to lay a kiss against his palm the weight of his body against mine was one of the best feelings id ever had because it was proof that he was back that he was well and that he was whole he halfrolled and halfraised me to a sitting position in his lap with his back to the wall he turned with me held in his arms to look across the room at belle morte i didnt have to see the look on his face to know that it was not an entirely friendly one impressive wouldnt you say jeanclaude said no i would not he can only feed on the energy of those whom he has taken blood from and rolled their poor minds you know as well as i do jeanclaude that you cant allow asher to roll the mind of every victim it would be a parade of lovebesotted fools following him everywhere i resented the lovebesotted fool part but i let it go we were winning tonight never argue when youre winning be that as it may belle asher is restored to his glorious self we have no more need of you tonight so you and yours must be gone from our territory before tomorrow night you would truly slay all of us she made it a question oui my vengeance would be terrible non belle by council law you cannot chastise another sourdre de sang as you would a vampire of your line your hatred would be terrible but your vengeance would have to wait not if the head of the council agrees with my vengeance she said ive touched her belle she doesnt care about your vengeance she doesnt even care about you or me or much of anybody i said the mother has been asleep a very long time anita when that sleep ends she may retire from the council i laughed and it wasnt joyous now retire vampires dont retire they die but they never retire it wasnt something that showed on her face it was more a stillness to her shoulders a movement in an arm i dont know what made me see it ashers power or something else but i did see it and i had a wonderful terrible idea you plan to kill her you plan to kill the first darkness and make yourself head of the council her face was perfectly blank as she said do not be absurd no one attacks the gentle mother yeah i know and theres a very good reason for that shell fucking kill you belle she will roll over you and destroy everything you are she fought but she couldnt keep the arrogance off her face i guess if youve been alive longer than christ has been dead you cant help but be arrogant if you declare war on anyone now belle as a sourdre de sang in my own right neither i nor any of my people have to come when you call you will find no aid here jeanclaude said aid from you my two petite catamites i have found other men to serve your purposes she turned with a swish of musettes skirts come my poppets we will leave and shake the dirt of this provincial town from our shoes a moment my mistress it was valentina she gave a very low curtsy in her stiff white and gold dress bartolomé and i have had our honor besmirched by musettes trick what of it poppet valentina stayed down in the low curtsy as if she could have held the position forever we beg your indulgence to remain behind and make amends to the shapeshifters non belle said valentina raised her gaze to the woman they were abused as i was abused and we have made it worse i beg permission to remain behind and make it better bartolomé belle said bartolomé came forward and dropped to one knee head bowed yes mistress is this what you wish non mistress but honor demands that we remedy this error he looked up then and there was something on his face of the boy he might once have been they have grown into men but the scars laid on the boys that they were are deep valentina and i have made them deeper this i do regret and you know above all others that i do not regret much i expected belle to tell them no to gather her people up and leave but she didnt she said stay until honor is satisfied then return to me she glanced at jeanclaude if you will allow them to remain that is jeanclaude nodded until honor is satisfied oui i didnt agree with this but something in belles face something in jeanclaudes face something in the tightness of ashers body let me know that things were happening that i probably didnt understand if the wolves would be so kind as to escort our guests to their rooms to pack then to the airport richard seemed to startle awake almost as if he too had been under some spell i didnt think that was it he was staring at me in ashers lap with micah leaning against the wall beside us nathaniel had crawled towards us and i raised a hand let him lay his head and shoulders in my lap well escort them out he said but his voice sounded empty he opened his mouth as if to say more then he turned and his wolves moved with him they gathered up belles people and began to escort them back towards the front and the main rooms belle glanced back once at valentina and bartolomé as they stood in their shining white and gold clothes that one glance back said worlds id never be certain but i think that belle morte felt guilty not just about valentina but about bartolomé valentina i understood because a vampire of belles making had done the unspeakable but bringing bartolomé over as a child had been simply good business i hadnt thought belle morte lost any sleep over good business but shed still condemned him to an eternity in a childs body a childs body with a mans appetite forever belle let them stay though the excuse was weak belle let them stay because guilt is a wonderful motivator even among the dead i woke in the dark with the comforting weight of bodies around me i knew by the quality of darkness and the faint light from the nearby bathroom that i was in jeanclaudes bed i remembered jeanclaude giving us the bed because it was near dawn and i dont think that either of us wanted a repeat of yesterday morning strangely what had happened with asher seemed to have sated my own ardeur or maybe i was just too tired once i would have assumed it meant i was gaining more control but id stopped trying to secondguess the ardeur i was wrong too often there really wasnt enough light to see clearly but the tickle of curls along my cheek let me know it was micahs face pressed into the hollow of my neck his arm lay heavy and warm across my upper stomach his leg entwined with my thigh there was another arm across my hips a second face pressed into my side a second body curled into a tight ball against me i didnt really need to touch the top of nathaniels head to know it was him the sliver of light from the bathroom showed a pale slender arm flung carelessly across micahs one outstretched leg the arm was all that was visible out of the covers i knew the arm and i knew somewhere under all the covers theyd stolen was zane and the rest of cherry i didnt mind sleeping in big warm piles but i did mind sharing a large bed with such outrageous cover hogs cherry wasnt bad on her own but put her with zane and you either fought for every inch of covers which was not restful or you gave up id found that the silk sheets at jeanclaudes were especially hard to keep track of in my sleep i wasnt sure what had awakened me but i knew that the wereleopards had better hearing and better sense of smell than i did if it hadnt alerted them it was probably a dream then i heard it very very faint it was my phone sounding like it was ringing from the bottom of a deep well i tried to sit up and couldnt i was pinned by the two men there was a groan and the slender arm across micahs leg vanished under the dark bulk of sheet the next moment there was a slithering sound a thump a curse and the sound of clothes being pawed through cherrys voice was groggy as she said yes silence then no this isnt anita just a minute her other hand poked the dark bulk of the sheet at the foot of the bed zanes voice what phone she groaned his hand grabbed the phone and before i could say anything he said hello zane was quiet for a second then just a minute shes here hang on a pale more masculine hand appeared out of the welter of sheets and handed the phone vaguely in my direction but i was still pinned the phone dangled just out of reach i finally had to push micahs arm off me and try and sit up micah move i have to reach the phone he made a small inarticulate noise and rolled off me to give me the long line of his back nathaniel took the phone from zanes hand before i could take it his voice was the most awake whom may i say is calling i was finally sitting up give me the phone i said nathaniel handed me the phone with a its zerbrowski i hung my head for a second sighed and put the phone to my ear yeah zerbrowski whats up how many people you got in bed with you blake none of your business one of them sounded like a girl didnt know you swung that way i pressed the button on my watch so i could see the time on the lightup dial zerbrowski weve had about two hours of sleep if you just called to check up on my sex life im going back to sleep no no sorry it just he laughed softly just caught me off guard ill try to keep the teasing to a minimum but damn you dont usually give me this much ammunition cant blame me for getting distracted did i mention the two hours of sleep you did he said sounding depressingly wide awake i was betting hed had coffee im counting to three if you havent said something interesting by the time im finished im hanging up and im turning off my cell phone weve got a fresh murder scene i scooted up so my back was against the headboard im listening micah stayed curled on his side back to me but nathaniel cuddled up close so he was still pressed around me cherry and zane were motionless under the pile of sheets i think theyd gone back to sleep its the shapeshifter rapist again the humor was leaking away from his voice and he sounded tired i wondered how much sleep hed gotten last night i was wide awake now my pulse fast in my throat when she was found just after dawn we havent been here long ill be there regardless but is dolph going to be there no zerbrowski said hes on leave he lowered his voice top brass told him he either takes voluntary leave with pay or enforced leave without okay where are you it was chesterfield again hes staying in a pretty small geographic area i said yeah zerbrowski said and that one word had so much tiredness i almost asked how he was holding up but its against the guy code youre supposed to pretend you dont notice anythings wrong pretend and it will go away sometimes because i am a girl ill break the guy code but today i let it stand zerbrowski had a long day ahead of him and he was the man in charge he couldnt afford to look at his feelings right now it was more important that he held together than that he understood what he was feeling zerbrowski started to give directions and i had to tell him to wait until i had a pen and paper there was no pen and paper anywhere in the room i was finally reduced to writing directions in lipstick on the bathroom mirror zerbrowski was laughing his ass off by the time i found the lipstick and started drawing on the mirror he gasped a little and finally managed to say thanks blake i so needed that glad i could brighten your day i crawled back on the bed i thought about what jason had said about a werewolf being able to follow the scent trail i bounced the idea off of zerbrowski he was dead silent for a minute there is no way i could get anyone to agree to letting another shapeshifter near this scene youre the man in charge i said no anita you bring another shifter around and theyre going to end up being questioned just like schuyler did dont do it this whole thing is going to turn into a witch hunt soon what do you mean i mean theyre starting to bring in all known shapeshifters for questioning the aclu is going to be up in arms i said yeah but not until theyve held a few people over and questioned them it isnt one of the local lycanthropes zerbrowski i cant tell the upper brass that our perp doesnt smell like the local werewolf pack anita theyll say that of course the local wolves would say that they dont want to be blamed for this shit i believe jason maybe i believe him too maybe i dont but it doesnt matter anita it really doesnt matter people are fucking terrified theres a rush bill in the state senate right now to declare varmint laws legal again in missouri varmint laws jesus zerbrowski you dont mean like some of the western states still have on the books yeah kill it first then if a blood test proves its a lycanthrope its selfdefense not murder and theres no trial itll never get into law i said and i was almost certain when i said it probably not right now but anita we get a few more women torn up like this and i dont know id like to say people arent that stupid i said but you know better he said yeah he sighed theres something else he sounded really unhappy i sat up a little straighter against the headboard forcing nathaniel to recuddle you sound like youre about to give me really bad news zerbrowski i just dont want to have to fight with you and dolph and the top brass all at the same time whats wrong zerbrowski why am i going to be mad at you remember anita dolph was still in charge until now just tell me my stomach was strangely tight like i was dreading whatever hed say there was a message at the first rape scene i didnt see a message it was by the back door dolph never gave you a chance to see it i didnt know about it until later what was the message zerbrowski a lot of thoughts went through my head was it a message for me about me first message read we nailed this one too it took me a few seconds to get it or think i got it the first murder the man nailed to his living room wall there had been nothing to connect that death with the shapeshifter killings except maybe for an odd message youre thinking of the first man in wildwood i said the message could mean anything zerbrowski thats what we thought until the second rape the one dolph wouldnt let us call you in on there was another message i said voice soft nailed another one he said it could still be a coincidence nailed is a euphemism for sex todays message was there wasnt enough left to crucify the maniac thats slaughtering these women is not methodical enough or neat enough for that first murder i know he said but we didnt release the nails and the fact that our first vic was crucified nobody but the killer would know one of the killers i said the mans death was a group effort i thought of something is there more than one type of sperm at the scenes nope so what the rapist wants us to know the crimes are connected why why do any of these crazy buggers want us to know anything it amuses him anita what background did you dig up on the first vic hes exmilitary you dont get that house and the indoor pool on retired military benefits he was an importer traveled around the world and brought back stuff drugs not that we can find i had another thought a record after only two hours sleep name me the countries he frequented why he asked i filled him in on what he hadnt heard through the grapevine about heinrick if the dead man frequented the same countries it might mean something a clue zerbrowski said a real live clue i dont think id know what to do with one youve got lots of clues they just arent helping you noticed that too he said if heinrick knew the dead man i still dont know what it means me either just get here as soon as you can and dont bring any shapeshifters with you i understand i said i hope so he spoke away from the phone for a second ill be right there then he spoke directly to me hurry he said and he hung up i think dolph had taught all of us not to say goodbye id expected the scene to be bad because the last scene had been bad but i hadnt expected this either our rapist murderer had moved to the bathroom for his second kill or we had a whole new killer id smelled the same hamburger smell as i walked through the house zerbrowski had given me little plastic booties to put over my nikes and handed me the box of gloves hed said something about the floor being messy id never thought of zerbrowski as a master of understatement the room was red red as if someone had painted all the walls crimson but it wasnt an even job of painting it wasnt just red or crimson but scarlet ruby brick red where it had begun to dry a color so dark it was almost black but it sparked red like a dark garnet i tried to stay cold and intellectual and look at all the shades of red until i saw a piece of something long and thin and meaty that had been glued to the wall with the blood like a piece of offal tossed aside by a careless butcher the room was suddenly hot and i had to look away from the walls but the floor was worse the floor was tile and that didnt absorb liquid it was covered in blood blood deep enough that it sat liquid and shining on almost the entire floor the floor space was small admittedly but it was still a lot of blood for one room i was hugging the doorframe that led into the room my feet in the little booties were still on the relatively clean tile of the area where the stool sat a tiny room with a vanity area complete with double sink beyond the master bedroom was beyond even that but the bed was carefully made untouched there was a small lip of marble that held the shallow lake of blood inside the final room a tiny ledge of stone to keep the rest of the rooms clean i was grateful for that tiny edge i looked at the walls again there was a threeperson deep shower in the far corner the glass doors were splattered with blood and it had dried to a nice candy red shell the shower stall wasnt covered as completely as the other walls i wasnt sure why yet most of the rest of the space in the room was taken up by a bathtub it wasnt as large as jeanclaudes but it was almost as large as the one i had at my house i liked my bathtub but i knew it would be days before id be able to use it again this scene would ruin that particular pleasure for a while the tub was full of pale blood blood the color of dark red roses left too long in the sun faded to a shade of pink that never looked quite pink but always as if it had meant to be a darker color pink bloody water filled the tub almost to the brim like it was a cup filled up with punch bad thought bad thought thinking about food or drink of any kind was a bad thing right now a truly bad thing i had to look away stare back into the smaller rooms catch a glimpse of the bed and the police still milling around the far room none of them had volunteered to accompany me on the tour couldnt blame them but i suddenly felt isolated they were only three small rooms away but it felt as if it were a thousand miles as if if i screamed now no one would hear me i used the farthest doorframe to get to the vanity sink area i leaned on the cool tile sink and ran cold water over my hand when it was cold enough i splashed it on my face there was no hand towel probably it had been bagged and sent to the lab where it would be checked for hair and fiber and stuff i untucked my tshirt from my jeans and wiped my face dry i came away with a few dark stains the remnants of last nights makeup i looked into the wide shining mirror glaring bright in the overhead lights i had dark smudges of mascara and eyeliner under my eyes waterproof really isnt its more like water tough but not proof i used the hem of my tshirt to dab at the black marks and got most of it i also ended up with black stuff on my shirt but it didnt seem to matter zerbrowski looked in at me from the doorway hows it going i nodded because i didnt trust myself to speak he grinned suddenly and if id felt better i would have dreaded his next comment but today i was too numb it didnt matter nothing mattered because for anything to matter i could not have gone back into that room and i had to go into that room so nothing mattered i was empty and quiet and there was nothing who was the girl this morning weve got a pool going some people think its your best bud ronnie sims personally i dont think so shes still hot for that professor guy at wash u im betting on the blond wereleopard thats always at your house which is it i think i just blinked at him he frowned then and stepped into the little room anita are you okay i shook my head no i am not okay his face was all concern and he came close enough almost took my arm then stopped himself whats wrong i stayed leaning on the sink but pointed backwards with one hand not looking where i was pointing not wanting to look he glanced back where i was pointing then his eyes flicked very quickly back to me what about it i just looked at him he shrugged yeah its bad youve seen bad before i lowered my head so i was staring at the golden faucet i took a month off zerbrowski thought i needed a vacation and i did but maybe a month wasnt enough what are you saying i looked up into the mirror and my face was almost ghost pale my eyes standing out like black holes in my face the remaining eyeliner making my eyes larger more compelling more lost than they should have been what i wanted to say was i dont know if i want to do this anymore but what i said out loud was i thought the bedroom scene was bad but this is worse he nodded i started to take a deep breath but remembered in time about the smell and took a shallow breath which wasnt nearly as soothing to my psyche but better for my stomach ill be okay he didnt argue with me because zerbrowski treated me by guy rules most of the time if a guy says hell be okay you just take him at his word even if you dont believe it the only exception is when lives are at stake then the guy code can be broken but the man that you broke it with will probably never forgive you i straightened up hands still deathgripping the sink i blinked into the mirror a couple of times then went back for the far room i could do this i had to do this i had to be able to see what was there and think about it logically it was an awful thing to ask of myself id finally acknowledged that acknowledged that seeing things like what lay in the next room were souldestroying acknowledged and moved on i was back in the bathroom door zerbrowski had come with me though standing just behind me there really wasnt room to stand in the doorway together not comfortably i looked at the room at the walls with their coating of blood and gore how many people were killed in here why he asked dont be coy zerbrowski i dont have the patience for it today why he asked again and this time there was a note of defensiveness in his voice i glanced back at him what is your problem he didnt point at the carnage in fact for a second or two i thought he was going to tell me to mind my own business but he didnt if dolph said why youd just answer him not argue with him i sighed dolphs shoes hard to fill i asked no but im damned tired of repeating myself when i know that nobody makes dolph fucking repeat himself i looked up at him and felt a smile creep across my face well actually i make dolph repeat himself too he smiled alright alright maybe you do but you are such a fucking pain in the ass anita its a talent i said we stood in the doorway and smiled at each other nothing had changed in that small horror chamber there wasnt a drop less of blood or an inch less of gory bits plastered to the walls but we both felt better now i said still smiling how many people were killed in the bathroom his smile slid into a full grin why do you ask you bastard i said he wiggled his eyebrows above the rims of his glasses not what my mom says though youre not the first to speculate i half laughed and knew that id lost because zerbrowski there are only two full walls in that room both of them are so thick with blood and heavier bits that its like two kills one at one wall one at the other what about the bathtub he asked the waters pale ive never seen anyone bled out in a bathtub so i dont know if the water would be this pale or if it would be darker but my gut tells me that no one was bled out in the tub they may have been killed in the tub but most of the blood is on the floor and walls you sure about that no like i said ive never seen anyone bled out in a bathtub before but im also wondering why the tub is so full almost to the brim you cant fill most tubs that full theyve got that little hole that stops it from overflowing this one is so full that you couldnt even step into it without sloshing water all over the floor he watched my face while i talked then his gaze slid away to look into the room beyond then to the clean section of floor we were standing on im right about at least two people being killed arent i he had control of his expression now and met my gaze maybe i sighed but it was more frustration now look ive worked with dolph for years and i like him i respect his work methods but damn it zerbrowski you dont have to play it as close to the chest as he does ive always hated playing twenty fucking questions lets try something new and different i ask questions you answer them he almost smiled maybe i fought an urge to yell i spoke very calmly very quietly at least two people were killed slaughtered against the walls i forced myself to turn back and look at the two walls in question again now that i had another human being to talk to and hed made me a little angry i could think again the walls werent literally painted with blood there were spots where the tile showed through but the tile was a medium brown color so that at first it looked worse than it was and god knew it was bad enough i turned back to zerbrowski okay two kills one against each wall or at least they were sliced open up whatever against each wall i looked at the tub again are there bits of bodies in the tub dolph would make you go fish i stared up at him maybe probably but youre not dolph and im not in the mood we left the bits in there special for you anita no joke he held up his hands youre our monster expert and if this isnt a monster i dont know what is he had me there its a monster zerbrowski but is it a human monster or something else thats the sixtyfourbilliondollar question i thought it was sixtyfourthousanddollar question he said inflation i said do you at least have any long gloves or something no long gloves on me he said i fucking hate you i said not the first to say it today he said and he seemed tired again i am going to track blood all over hell and back he fished under the sink and retrieved a garbage bag put the booties in here before you step out of the room what can i possibly learn by fishing around in that mess probably not a goddamned thing he said i shook my head then why should i do it because we held the scene for you we didnt drag that damn tub just in case we spoiled some arcane piece of monster shit that you would have noticed and we would have thrown away arcane i said what katie been reading the big grownup books to you again he smiled the faster you do this the sooner we can all get the hell out of here im not stalling i said even as i knew i was yeah you are and i dont blame you i looked into the next room then back at zerbrowski if i dont find some really nifty clue i am so going to kick your ass he grinned only if you can catch me i shook my head took a shallow breath and stepped over that last bit of doorway the blood closed up around the plastic bootie not quite to the top of it not quite rolling over onto my shoe but close even through the plastic through my shoe i could feel that the blood was cool not cold but cool i wasnt sure if it was my imagination or not i didnt think i should have been able to feel the blood through the bootie and my shoe but it felt like i could sometimes my imagination is not an asset at a crime scene i slid my foot forward one hand still on the door frame i wasnt sure that the plastic booties would be slippery in this much liquid on a tile floor but i so didnt want to find out the hard way there were two things i didnt want to do in this room one was fall on my ass in the pool of blood two was put my hand in the bathtub i had to do the second but i would be damned if i did the first i eased my feet forward slowly cautiously and kept my fingers on the doorjamb as long as possible actually the room wasnt that large and it wasnt that big a reach between the door and the tub i got a death grip on the edge of the tub with my glovecovered hands and when i had both my feet planted as steady as i could get them i looked down at the water it was like some kind of red soup i knew it was mostly water but the color i kept thinking of the cups you use to dye easter eggs it looked like a great big cup for dyeing easter eggs and just like sometimes happened if you didnt get the mix right it wasnt exactly red or pink but both i concentrated on the thought of easter eggs the smell of vinegar and better times than this the water seemed to swirl heavier than it was probably illusion but i suddenly had this image of something floating right below the surface something that would pop up and try to grab me i knew it wasnt true i knew it was just too many horror movies but my pulse was in my throat my heart thudding i glanced back at zerbrowski you guys dont have any rookies to do this how do you think we got the first piece out he asked that would explain the uniform that was throwing his guts up in the bushes as i came through its his first week on the job you bastard maybe but no one else wanted to put their hand in there when youre finished looking the techies are going to pump the water out and filter it for evidence but you get to see it first tell me this wasnt a lycanthrope kill anita tell me and ill tell the media itll quiet down the witch hunt but not the hysteria zerbrowski if this is a second killer then weve got two of the worst psychos ive seen in st louis id love to prove its not a shapeshifter but if its not then weve got other problems he blinked at me youd really be happier if its the same shapeshifter traditionally two separate killers slaughter more people than just one you still think more like a cop than a monster expert anita thanks i turned back to the tub and suddenly i knew i was going to do it i wasnt fishing deeper than the gloves too fucking unhealthy but if i could find a piece with the shorter gloves i was going to do it the water was cold even through the gloves i reached down the line of cold bloody water creeping up my skin and with my hand less than halfway in i hit something solid i froze for a moment took a shallow breath and ran my hand down along what id touched it was soft and solid at the same time meaty flesh i came to bone and it was enough to grip and raise it free of the water it was what was left of a womans arm the bone showed pinkish white as the water streamed away from it the end that had attached to the shoulder was crushed there were manmade tools that would do that kind of damage but i doubted anyone would have gone to the trouble i set the arm aside and went back to where id found it my hand sunk in a little farther this time and i pulled out a nearly meatless bone it didnt look like a piece of person so i didnt think of it that way i just looked at it as if id found an animal in the woods and was trying to figure out what had eaten it big teeth lots of crushing strength very few real predators had this kind of bonecracking strength but most lycanthropes did i doubted that some hyena had escaped from the zoo to rampage in a suburban bathroom i let the bone drift back into the water slowly easing it down because for some reason i really didnt want it to splash on me i turned away from the bathtub walked carefully to the doorway stripped off the gloves threw them in the sack that zerbrowski held open for me leaned against the doorjamb removed the booties threw them into the garbage sack stepped out of that awful room and kept walking until i hit the bedroom the air seemed cleaner more breathable here zerbrowski followed me out and it was merlioni who said she did it didnt she yep merlioni made a sort of crowing sound i knew it i won i looked at him then at zerbrowski im sorry what did you say zerbrowski didnt even look embarrassed when he said we had a bet going on whether youd actually fish around in the tub i sighed and shook my head you are all such unmitigated bastards unmitigated ooh said merlioni if you use big words to insult us blake well never figure it out i looked back at zerbrowski its a shapeshifter i dont know if its the same one the first vic was done in her bed was the second he nodded this was in the bath and theres at least two bodies cut up in the bathtub why two zerbrowski asked because the pile is too damn high to be only one womans body especially since he ate parts of it you say he like you know i shook my head i dont know but im assuming male because you dont find many women willing to do this kind of shit it happens but its rare we actually got a witness that the woman who owns the house and another girlfriend were seen entering the residence at about am zerbrowski had his eyes closed as if he were quoting they appeared drunk and there was a man with him you have a witness i asked if the man who brought them home is the shapeshifter and not part of what is in the bathtub yeah i hadnt thought about that he could be in the tub by the way why is the water so deep why isnt the overflow valve working our rookie says a piece of body has been stuffed into the valve i shivered no wonder he freaking threw up i lost on that one merlioni said lost on what i asked most of us bet youd be sick who bet i wouldnt be zerbrowski cleared his throat me what did you win dinner for two at tonys what did you win for me fishing in the tub i asked merlioni money he said i shook my head i hate you all i started for the door wait we got one more bet merlioni said who was the chickie on the phone when zerbrowski woke you i was about to let loose a scathing comment when a voice from the door stopped me havent seen anything this bad since new mexico i turned to find my favorite fbi agent in the doorway special agent bradley bradford smiled and offered me his hand bradley was with the special research section it was a new division set up to handle preternatural crime wed last worked together on some very gruesome murders in new mexico i took his firm handshake and gave one of my own he smiled and i think we were both actually glad to see each other but his gaze swept the room until he found zerbrowski sergeant zerbrowski you must be living right zerbrowski moved towards us what do you mean agent bradford he held up a slender manila folder theres a store across the street from the club where the two women went to last night the store got robbed last year and put in a very nice surveillance system all the joking was gone zerbrowski was very serious all of a sudden and they caught a picture of a man matching the neighbors description with the two women last night they walked right past the store window he opened the folder i took the liberty of getting a still made and passed it to all of your men merlioni said no detective this is the only copy and i brought it here first merlioni looked like he would have argued but zerbrowski cut him off i dont care who solves this as long as we get this guy i feel the same way bradley said i didnt exactly believe bradley last time wed talked his little division had been in jeopardy of being disbanded and their cases given back to the investigative supportread serial killerunit bradley was one of the good guys he really did care more about solving crimes than career advancement but he also cared about his new unit he felt strongly that the feds needed one i agreed with him so why was he handing over the only copy of the picture sharing made sense simply giving it to us didnt what do you think anita he asked me i glanced down at the photo it was black and white pretty good quality actually two women were laughing up at the tall man in between them the brunette on the left matched some of the pictures downstairs i hadnt asked the name of the woman who owned the house i hadnt wanted to know not knowing had made it easier to go into that bathroom and paw through the remains the other woman looked vaguely familiar wasnt the woman in a group picture downstairs it looked like it was taken at a party well check zerbrowski said what about the man bradley asked i looked at the man in the picture the man that might be our killer or might be at the bottom of the pile of bones in the bathtub was tall broadshouldered straight brown hair was pulled back into a long ponytail that one of the women was tugging on playing with the face was high cheekboned handsome he wasnt like richard handsome but they reminded me oddly of each other both tall both broadshouldered both classically handsome but there was something in this mans face even through the film that creeped me out it was probably knowing that the two women were only hours away from being butchered it was probably my imagination but i didnt like the look on the mans face when he glanced up and spotted the camera i realized that that was what the look was why it looked strange he spotted the camera i said what do you mean zerbrowski asked look at his face he didnt like being on film he probably knew what he was going to do to them merlioni said dont want to be seen with the vies before the murder maybe probably i kept looking at his face and i thought it was familiar do you recognize him bradley asked i stared up at him his face was empty guileless but i didnt believe the innocent look why would i well he is a shapeshifter if hes our man i thought you might have seen him around bradley was lying i could feel it even i wasnt tactless enough to accuse him of it to his face but i was saved from having to come up with something to say by my cell phone ringing id kept it with me today hooked on the back of my belt just in case musette and company didnt go quietly out of town call me silly but i just didnt trust them hello is this anita blake it was a woman i didnt recognize the voice yeah this is detective obrien strangely with all the vampire politics and the new murder i hadnt given much thought to the internationally wanted terrorist leopold heinrick detective obrien good to hear from you whats up we identified the two pictures you pulled really im impressed the photos werent that good lieutenant nicols you met him once he picked them out it took me a second to place the name the lieutenant that was in charge at lindel cemetery yeah thats the one he picked out the same two pictures that you did and since the two of you have only met once before she could finish i said the bodyguards the freaking bodyguards canducci and she said balfour yeah thats right i cant believe i didnt remember them you saw them once at night blake and from what nicols says the widow was putting on quite a show yeah but still did you bring them in for questioning no one knows where they are they quit their job at the security agency the day after you saw them theyd only worked there for about two weeks all the references they gave are leading to dead ends shit i said i glanced down at the picture that bradley was still holding down where i could see it i suddenly knew why that picture looked vaguely familiar he was another of heinricks known associates or he looked amazingly like one of them but i just didnt believe that coincidence would stretch that far i looked up at bradley he was still patiently holding the picture down where i could see it lower than either of the other two men needed it maybe he was being polite or maybe not he met my gaze and he gave me blank face cop face what if i told you that im looking at a picture of one of the other known associates of heinrick and hes in town too bradleys face never changed zerbrowskis and merlionis did they looked surprised bradley didnt how did you get the picture long story but hes wanted in connection with some murders here in town which man i think he was the only one with longer hair i dont think it was back in a ponytail like it is here but it was definitely shoulder length i heard papers rustling ive got it i heard more papers rustling then a soft whistle roy van anders he is a very bad man blake how bad strangely we got files just today about mr van anders crime scene photos that would turn your stomach a lot of blood not a lot of body left i asked i could feel zerbrowski tense beside me yeah how did you know i think im at a crime scene right now thats van anderss work youre on that lycanthrope murder right yeah theres nothing in his record that says hes anything but human hes just a sick son of a bitch who likes to rape and kill women did anybody question how he dismembered the bodies or where the rest of them went i havent read through everything yet but no most of his crimes were in countries where were lucky to have gotten any pictures at all very low tech very little money to do sophisticated crime work how sophisticated do you have to be to figure out the difference between tools and teeth a lot of serial killers use teeth blake she sounded like she felt she had to defend the honor of some far away police i know that obrien but oh hell it doesnt matter what does matter is that hes here in our town right now and we arent low tech and we do have at least a little money to track down the bad guys youre right blake concentrate on the here and now do we have enough to question heinrick and his pal now i think we might we can make a case that heinrick knows about his pals hobbies that would make him an accessory before the fact if not more ill be down there as soon as i can get out of here blake this is not your case youre one of the potential victims i think that makes you too close to everything to be objective dont do this obrien ive played fair with you this isnt a game blake this is a job or do you want credit for everything i dont give a fuck about credit i just want to be there when you question heinrick if you get here in time but we aint holding the party up for just you fine obrien fine youre the detective in charge nice of you to remember that she hung up on me i said a very heartfelt bitch zerbrowski and merlioni had eager expectant faces but bradley didnt he could do cop face but he wasnt an actor i filled them in and zerbrowski was pissed at obrien not for excluding me but for not even bothering to consider contacting a member of rpit shes got them in lockup for what following you around weve got four murders maybe more he looked at me you want a ride in a car with sirens and lights so that we can fucking get there before she does something to wreck our case i liked the our case and i liked that he asked me along dolph probably wouldnt have even if he hadnt been mad at me i nodded id love to go riding in and wave jurisdictional flags in her face he grinned give me ten minutes to give everybody their marching orders then meet me downstairs well borrow a marked car people always get out of the way faster for a marked car he was out the door and down the stairs humming to himself merlioni went after him saying who has to stay here with the tub o death cleanup i dont think merlioni wanted to be included in the cleanup not even to supervise bradley and i found ourselves alone it was unheard of for a fed two feds i guess to be left alone at a murder scene like this most locals hated the feds and the feds hated them right back i looked up at bradley now that ive made all the connections you wanted me to make tell me why you really came down here he closed the manila envelope and handed it to me to solve a crime solving these crimes would add to your units clout last time we spoke you needed that clout he was looking at me carefully are you here officially bradley yes i stared into his bland face are you here officially just as an fbi agent dont know what you mean you told me once that id come to the attention of some of the less savory branches of our government the spooks i think you called them is van anders a spook no government in their right mind would want an animal like this in their country talk to me bradley talk to me or the next time we meet im not going to trust you like i do right this minute he sighed and suddenly looked tired he rubbed at his eyes with his thumb and forefinger these murders were brought to our attention but id seen crimes like this before in a different country in a place where the government was more worried about staying in power than protecting helpless women there was a look in his eyes something faraway and painfilled you said you got out of that line of work i did he looked very steadily at me no cop eyes now men like van anders were one of the reasons i couldnt keep doing it but when certain people found out that van anders might actually have been let loose within the confines of the united states they werent happy i have a one time permission to help things along here whats the price tag on this help heinrick will be escorted out of the country theyll never put a name to the second man he was taken in with it will all disappear heinrick is a suspected terrorist you think that theyll just let him walk hes wanted in five different countries that we have strong treaties with who do we give him to anita better to just let him go dont you want to know why he was in town i know i want to know why he was following me i told you why these kind of people would want you so i can raise the dead for them a political leader here a few zombie bodyguards there i tried to make a joke of it but bradley wasnt laughing you know the man you found nailed to his living room wall yeah he knew heinrick and van anders and he felt that they were too extreme he left and he hid but not well enough if it was an execution why make it look like some sort of ritual murder so it wouldnt look like an execution why did they care i asked he shook his head it was a message anita they wanted him dead and they wanted him dead in such a way that it would be sensational enough to make headlines they wanted his death out there for all the others like him like me that left you dont know this for sure bradley not all of it but i know that everyone involved wants van anders caught and heinrick gone what about the others i dont know are they gone for good or should i still be worried be worried anita i would be great something occurred to me i know this is all off the record for you well ive got one thing off the record to ask you i cant promise but what is it i gave him leo harlans name and a general description because its not that hard to change your name he says hes an assassin and i believe him he says hes here on a sort of vacation and i believe that too but st louis is suddenly lousy with internationally wanted bad guys and id be curious to know if my client is tied to them somehow ill check around if he comes up on any of your hit parades ill avoid him and refuse to raise his ancestor if he doesnt ill do the job even though hes an assassin i shrugged who am i to throw stones bradley i try not to judge people more than i have to or maybe youre getting more comfortable with murderers yeah all my friends are either criminals monsters or cops that made him smile zerbrowski yelled from downstairs anita yo were out of here i gave bradley my cell phone number he copied it down i ran for the stairs obrien had started the interrogation before we got there people in st louis didnt seem to understand that sirens and lights on a police car meant get the fuck out of the way it was almost as if the police car with all flags flying made a gawkers block around us the drivers were so busy trying to figure out why we were in such a rush that they forgot to get out of the way i had never seen zerbrowski so angry hell i wasnt sure id ever seen him angry not for real hed raised enough of a fuss to drag obrien out of the interrogation but she kept saying you can have him when were through with him sergeant zerbrowskis voice had crawled down so low it was almost painful to listen to it that dragging careful voice held enough heat to make me nervous obrien didnt seem impressed dont you think detective that questioning him about a serial killer thats already butchered three maybe four people takes precedent over questioning him about following a federal marshal i am questioning him about the serial killer a small frown formed between her eyes what do you mean three maybe four we havent finished counting the pieces at the last crime scene there may be two victims you cant tell she asked he let out his breath in a loud humph of air you dont know anything about these crimes you dont know enough to be questioning him without us his voice shook with the effort not to start screaming at her maybe you can sit in sergeant but not her she jerked a thumb in my direction actually detective technically you cant exclude me from the interrogation now that heinrick is a suspect in preternatural crimes obrien looked at me a blank unfriendly stare i excluded you just fine before blake ah i said and felt myself smiling i couldnt help it but that was when heinrick was a suspected terrorist and guilty of nothing more than illegal weapons violations very mundane stuff and nothing that my federal marshal status puts under my jurisdiction as you pointed out earlier im not a regular federal marshal my jurisdiction is very narrow i have no legal status on nonpreternatural crimes but on preternatural crimes i have jurisdiction all across this country i dont have to wait to be invited in i know i looked smug when i finished but i just couldnt seem to help myself obrien was being pissy and pissiness should be punished obrien looked like shed bitten into something bitter this is my case actually obrien its everybodys case now mine because federal law gives me the jurisdiction zerbrowski because its a preternatural case and that means it belongs to the regional preternatural investigation team truthfully you have no jurisdiction on the murders they didnt happen on your turf and you wouldnt even have known that heinrick was involved if we hadnt shared information so freely with you we played fair with you zerbrowski said play fair with us and we all win his voice was almost normal hed lost that frightening bass she pointed a finger at me rather dramatically i thought but itll be her name in the paper i shook my head jesus obrien is that all this is about you want your name in the headlines i know that cracking a serial murder could make me a sergeant if you want your name on this case fine i said but lets worry more about solving the case than whos going to get credit for it easy enough for you to say blake like you said you dont have a career in law enforcement getting credit for this wont help you but youll still get the credit zerbrowski pushed away from the wall where hed been leaning he touched the files on the edge of the table he opened one just enough to pull out a photo he halfslid halfthrew the picture across the table at obrien it was a splash of shape and color most of the color was red i didnt look too hard at it id seen the real deal i didnt need a reminder obrien glanced down at the picture then looked again she frowned and almost reached out for the photo then stared harder she concentrated on the image i watched her try to make sense of what she was seeing watched her mind rebel at making sense of it i saw the moment she saw it on her face in the sudden paleness of her skin she sat down slowly in the chair on her side of the table she seemed to have trouble looking away from the picture are they all like this she asked in a voice gone thin yes zerbrowski said his voice was soft too as if he had made his point and wouldnt rub it in she looked up at me and it looked like a physical effort to pull her gaze away from that photo youll be the darling of the media again but her voice was soft like it didnt matter probably i said but its not because i want to be youre just so damned photogenic her voice had held a hint of her earlier scorn then she frowned and glanced down at the photo again she seemed to hear what shed just said and with that awful hideous photo sitting in front of her it seemed the wrong thing to say i didnt mean she rallied and put back on her angry face but it seemed more like a mask to hide behind now dont worry obrien zerbrowski said and he had his teasing voice back i knew enough to dread what would come out of his mouth next but she didnt we know what you meant anita is just so damned cute she gave a weak smile something like that yes she said the smile vanished as if it had never existed she was all business again obrien never seemed to get very far from business seeing that this doesnt happen to another woman is more important than who gets credit glad to hear we all agree zerbrowski said obrien stood up she pushed the picture back towards zerbrowski doing her best not to look at it this time you can question heinrick and the other one though he doesnt say much lets have a plan before we go in there i said they both looked at me we know that van anders is our guy but we dont know for sure that hes our only guy you think one of the men we have here helped van anders do this obrien motioned towards the picture that zerbrowski was tucking away i dont know i glanced at zerbrowski and wondered if he was thinking the same thing i was the first message had read we nailed this one too we i wanted to make sure that heinrick wasnt part of that we if he was then he wasnt going anywhere not if i could help it i really didnt care who got credit for solving the case i just wanted it solved i just wanted to never ever have to see anything else as bad as that bathroom that bathtub and its contents i use to think i helped the police out of a sense of justice a desire to protect the innocent maybe even a hero complex but lately im beginning to understand that sometimes i want to solve the case for a much more selfish reason so i dont ever have to walk through another crime scene as bad as the one i just saw heinrick was sitting behind the small table slumped back in the chair which is actually harder than it looks in a straightbacked chair his carefully cut blond hair was still neat but hed laid his glasses on the table and his face looked younger without them his file said he was closer to forty than thirty but he didnt look it he had an innocent face and i knew that was a lie anyone who looks that innocent after thirty is either lying or touched by the hand of god somehow i didnt think leopold heinrick was ever going to be a saint which left only one conclusionhe was lying lying about what now there was the question there was a styrofoam cup with coffee in front of him it had been sitting long enough that the cream had started to separate from the darker liquid so that swirls of paleness decorated the top of the coffee he looked up when zerbrowski and i entered something flickered through his pale eyes interest curiosity worry the look was gone before i could decipher it he picked up his glasses giving me a blank innocent face with his glasses back on he came closer to looking his age they broke up the line of his face so that the frames were what you saw first you want a fresh cup of coffee i asked him as i sat down zerbrowski leaned against the wall near the door wed start out with me questioning heinrick to see if i got anywhere zerbrowski made it clear that i was up to bat but no one including me wanted me alone with heinrick he had been following me and we still didnt know why agent bradford had guessed that it was part of some plot to get me to raise the dead for some nefarious purpose bradford didnt know not for sure until we knew for sure caution was better hell caution was probably always better no heinrick said no more coffee i had a fresh cup of coffee in one hand and a stack of file folders in the other i placed the coffee on the table and made a show of arranging the pile of folders neatly beside it his gaze flicked to the folders then settled serenely back on me had too much coffee i asked no his face was attentive blank with a touch of wariness something had him worried was it the files too large a stack wed intended it to be too large there were files at the bottom that had nothing to do with leopold heinrick van anders or the nameless man that was sitting in another room just down the hall it was impossible to have a military record with no name attached but somehow the darkhaired american had managed it his file was so full of blackedout spaces that it was almost illegible the fact that no one would give our john doe a name but they would acknowledge he was once a member of the armed forces was disturbing it made me wonder what my government was up to would you like something else to drink i asked he shook his head we may be in here a while talking is thirsty work zerbrowski said from the back heinricks eyes flicked to him then back to me silence is not thirsty work his lips quirked and it was almost a smile if sometime during this interview you want to tell us exactly why you were following me id love to hear it but thats really secondary to why were here he looked puzzled then when you first stopped us that seemed to be very important to you it was and id still like to know but the priorities have changed he frowned at me you are playing games ms blake i am tired of games there was no fear in him he seemed tired wary and not happy but he wasnt afraid he wasnt afraid of the police or me or going to jail there was none of that anxiety that most people have in a police interrogation it was odd bradley had said that our government was going to just let heinrick go did he suspect thatknow that if so how how did he know why wasnt he the least bit afraid of spending time in the st louis jail system i opened the first file it held grainy copies of old crimes women van anders had slaughtered in foreign countries far from here i laid the photos out in front of him in a neat row of black and white carnage in some of the photos the quality was so bad that if you hadnt known you were looking at human remains youd have never guessed van anders had reduced his victims to rorschach tests heinrick looked bored now almost disgusted your detective obrien has already shown me these already marched out her lies what lies would those be i asked i sipped my coffee and it wasnt bad it was fresh at least as i sipped i watched his face he folded his arms across his chest that there are fresh murders here in your city like these old ones what makes you think shes lying he started to say something then closed his mouth tight his lips a thin angry line he just glared at me pale eyes bright with anger i opened the second folder and began laying out colored photos just above the old black and whites i laid them out in a line of bright death and watched all the color drain away from heinricks skin he looked almost gray by the time i sat back down id had to stand to reach the ends of the table to lay out the photos this woman was killed three days ago i got another file out of the stack i opened it and fanned the photos on top of it but didnt put them with the stack i wasnt a hundred percent sure id be able to match the photos back to the right crime they were supposed to be marked on the back but i hadnt marked them personally so i didnt want to risk it once you get into court the lawyers get damned picky about evidence and stuff i pointed to the file pictures this woman was killed two days ago zerbrowski stepped forward and handed me a plastic baggie with a handful of polaroids in it i tossed the baggie across the table so that it slid by him and he caught it automatically before it hit the floor his eyes were very big when he saw the top print those women died last night we think there were two victims but truthfully we havent finished putting together the pieces so were not a hundred percent certain it could be more or it could be just one woman but thats an awful lot of blood for only one woman dont you think he laid the baggie of polaroids carefully on the table so that they didnt touch any of the other photos he stared at all the pictures his face gone death white his eyes huge his voice squeezed out like it was an effort to breathe let alone talk what do you wish to know we want to stop this from happening again i said he was staring down at the pictures as if he couldnt look away he promised he would not do it here he swore that he could control himself who i asked softly yeah the government had given him a name but that was the same government that wouldnt give our john doe one van anders he whispered the name he looked up and there was surprise underneath the shock the other detective said you knew it was van anders great nothing like giving your suspect more information than hes giving you i shrugged without eyewitnesses its hard to be certain something like hope sparked in his eyes and he started regaining some of his color you think this might be someone else not van anders i riffled through the files again and heinrick flinched i found the thin folder with the picture of van anders and the two women i flashed him the picture van anders with the victims from last nights slaughter he winced at the last word and the color that had been seeping back into his face drained away again his lips looked bloodless for a second i thought he might faint id never had a suspect faint on me before his voice was a hoarse whisper then it is him he laid his forehead on the table do you need some water something stronger i asked though truthfully black coffee was as strong as i could give him there were rules about giving liquor to suspects he raised his head slowly but he looked awful i told them that he was crazy i told them not to include him told who i asked he sat up a little straighter i agreed to come here against my better judgment i knew the team was assembled too quickly when you rush such a task it ends badly what task i asked to recruit you for a mission what mission i asked he shook his head it doesnt matter now some of our people got you on tape raising a man in a local cemetery he did not look alive enough for what my employers wished he looked like a zombie and that is not good enough good enough for what i asked to fool people in the country that their leader is still alive what country i asked he shook his head and a ghost of a smile crossed his lips i will not be here long ms blake those that employ me will see to it they will either work to free me soon with no charges or they will have me killed you seem calm about that i said i believe i will go free but youre not sure i said few things in life are certain i know one thing thats certain i said he just looked at me i think hed said more than hed planned to say so he was going to try not to say anything van anders will kill someone else tonight his eyes were bleak when he said i had worked with him years ago before i knew what he was i should not have believed him that he was in control of his rage i should have known are your employers just going to leave van anders here to butcher more women he looked at me then again i couldnt quite read his expression determination guilt something i know where van anders is staying i will give you that address i know that my employers would wish him dead now he has become a liability we got the address from him i didnt hurry out after it because unlike the movies i knew i wouldnt be allowed in at the capture mobile reserve st louiss answer to swat would be the ones running the show when you have people that can go in with body armor and fully automatic weapons the rest of us are just outclassed i opened one last file and showed him the man theyd crucified against the wall why did you need van anders to do this not his kind of kill i dont know what you are talking about he was going to deny it fine even if we could have pinned it on him i doubt we could have kept him long enough for a trial we know you and your team did this we even know why if bradley was telling the truth i did know you know nothing he sounded very sure of that you were ordered to kill him because he ran ran away from people like you and people like van anders he looked at me then and he was worried he was wondering how much i knew not much but maybe it was enough whose idea was it to crucify him van anderss he looked like hed swallowed something sour then he gave a small smile it wont matter ms blake ill never see trial maybe not but i always like to know where the blame goes he nodded then said van anders was so angry when we shot him first he said what good is a crucifixion if the person isnt struggling he looked at me with haunted eyes i should have known then what he meant to do whose idea were the runes i asked he shook his head youve gotten the last startled confession you shall get from me theres still one thing i dont understand actually there were lots of things i didnt understand but its never good to appear confused in front of the bad guys i will not incriminate myself ms blake if you knew what van anders was capable of then why bring him along why make him part of the team at all he is a werewolf as you have learned from what he does to his victims there were those who believed you were a shapeshifter as well we wanted someone that could manage you without risk of infection if you fought us you were planning on kidnapping me as a last resort he said but because balfour and canducci didnt like my zombie the plan is off those names will do for them but yes we had reports that you could raise zombies that thought they were still alive and could pass as human my employers were very disappointed when they saw the tape i owed marianne and her coven a thankyou note if they hadnt gotten all witchierthanthou on me id have raised a fine alivelooking zombie and i might even now be kidnapped and at the mercy of van anders maybe i should send marianne flowers a card just didnt seem to be enough i tried some more questions but leopold heinrick had given out all the information he was going to give he finally asked for a lawyer and the interview was over i stepped out into the main area and it was in chaos people yelling running i caught the phrase officers down i grabbed detective webster of the blond hair and bad coffee whats happened obrien answered for him the mobile reserve squad that went out to pick up van andershe cut them up at least one dead maybe more shit i said she had her jacket on and was digging her purse out of a drawer wheres zerbrowski hes gone already can i catch a ride she looked at me where to im going to the hospital i think i need to be at the crime scene ill take you webster said obrien gave him a look ill be at the hospital later i promise obrien shook her head and ran for the door everyone was leaving some would go to the hospital some would go to the crime scene and see if they could help there some would go sit with the families of the downed officers but everyone would go if you really wanted to commit a crime in any city wait until theres an officerdown call everyone drops everything id go to the scene of the crime id try to help figure out what went wrong because something had gone very wrong if van anders had taken out an entire squad from the mobile reserve theyre trained to handle terrorists hostage situations drugs gangs biochemical hazards pick your nastiness and mobile reserve can handle it yes something had gone terribly wrong the question was what id seen enough of van anderss handy work to be prepared for the worst what i saw in the hallway wasnt even close to his worst compared to the other crime scenes it was almost clean there was a uniformed officer standing next to the window at the end of the hallway the window was almost completely free of glass as if something large had been thrown through it i turned away from the thought of one of the citys finest plunging to his death other than the window there wasnt much else a sprinkling of blood on the pale brown carpet in the hallway two blood smears on the wall looked almost artificial overly dramatic on the offwhite walls that was all van anders hadnt had time to enjoy himself one officer was dead maybe two but hed just had time to kill them he hadnt had time to cut them up i wondered if that made him angry did he feel cheated there was a trickle of police in the hallway but the sound of voices from the open door of the apartment was as murmurous as the sea a sorrowful angry urgent confused sea the apartment was pristine untouched there had been no fight inside all the trouble had started and ended in the hallway detective webster had come up with me he was still in the doorway because there wasnt room to walk into the room every homicide has more cops than you think it needs but id never seen a crowd like this it was nearly walltowall people like at a party except that every face was grim or shocked or angry no one was having a good time zerbrowski had called my cell phone in the car on the way there everybody was wanting answers answers about the monsters answers that he couldnt give because he didnt fucking know his quote not mine i debated on whether to yell for zerbrowski or call him back on his cell phone i dont usually mind being short but this time i couldnt see through the crowd and i sure as hell couldnt see over it i glanced at webster he was damn near six feet can you spot sergeant zerbrowski webster suddenly looked even taller i realized that hed been slumping artfully the way some tall people do especially if they got tall early and didnt like it standing with his shoulders back and trying to gaze across the crowd he was at least six one maybe an inch more im usually a pretty good judge of height hes on the far side of the room he suddenly seemed to shrink shoulders rounding almost like his spine compressed before my eyes i shook my head and said can you get his attention he got a mischievous grin on his face a look that zerbrowski and jason had made me dread i could put you on my shoulders then hed spot you i gave him a look that wilted the grin into a smile he shrugged sorry but it was the kind of sorry im used to the one jason always gives when hes not sorry at all either zerbrowski is more psychic than i thought or he was trying to get away from the man who was dogging him it was one of the mobile reserve officers in full combat black body armor still in place but hed lost his helmet his mask and his eyes were wild the whites kept flashing like a horses when its about to bolt zerbrowski saw me and the look of relief on his face was so pure so happy that it almost scared me officer elsworthy this is anita blake marshal anita blake shes our preternatural expert elsworthy frowned blinking a little too rapidly it was as if it took longer than it should have for the words to filter through and have meaning id seen enough shock to know the symptoms why wasnt he at the hospital with the rest of his squad zerbrowski mouthed sorry to me elsworthy blinked at me his brown eyes didnt even look like they were focusing as if what he was seeing was somewhere inside his head shit a moment ago hed been yelling at zerbrowski now he was staring at things that we couldnt see probably reliving the disaster he was pale and there was a light dew of sweat on his face i was betting he would be clammy to the touch i put my face close to zerbrowski and spoke low why isnt he at the hospital with the others he wouldnt go said he wanted to ask rpit how the hell a werewolf can grow claws when its still in human form i must have reacted to the question because zerbrowski suddenly gave me a look through the rims of his glasses i told him it wasnt possible for a shifter to gain claws while still in full human form was i wrong i nodded a shifter has to be really powerful to be able to do it ive only known a handful that could do partial change while they pretty much looked human zerbrowski lowered his voice even more it might have been good to know that before they busted in on van anders i thought a minimum of one person from each squad went down to quantico for the big preternatural class and lecture they did i gave him a disgusted look i dont go around assuming that i know more about the monsters than the freaking fbi maybe you should zerbrowski said softly the way he said it took the heat out of my words i couldnt really get angry with elsworthy standing there blinking like an innocent come to slaughter is it hot in here elsworthy asked actually it was too many people in too small a space detective webster take elsworthy out into the hall for a breath of air would you webster did what i asked and elsworthy went without a single complaint it was as if hed used up all his anger before i got there and now all that was left was the shock and the horror of it all zerbrowski and i stayed in our little corner what went wrong i asked ive been yelled at by elsworthy but even better captain parker hes waiting at the hospital for me to get my ass down there and explain to him how the hell van anders was able to do what he did what exactly did he do zerbrowski dug his everpresent notebook out of his jacket pocket the notebook looked like itd been rolled in the dirt then stepped on he ruffled through it until he got to the pages he wanted van anders cooperated completely when they came in he seemed surprised and didnt know why anyone would want to arrest him he was handcuffed patted down and the two tactical officers bates and meyer led him out into the hallway while the rest of the squad reformed and made sure the rest of the apartment was clear he glanced up at me standard procedure so when did it stop being standard then it gets a little confused meyer never came back on the radio at all bates started yelling officer down and something about hes got claws elsworthy and another officer got out the door in time to see van anders clear enough that they both swear he had claws but was in full human form zerbrowski gave me a look truthfully i was ready to think elsworthy and he turned a page of his notebook tucker were seeing things i shook my head no its possible i shook my head again and fought the urge to rub my temples i had a headache starting the lycanthropes that ive seen do this the claws just whip out its like having five switchblades suddenly appear there wouldnt have been anything for the officer bates was it to see meyer bates is still alive i nodded names were important it was important to remember who was dead and who was alive van anders stabbed meyer when the claws shot out of his fingertips he used them like knives apparently kevlar doesnt stop lycanthrope claws zerbrowski said kevlar isnt made to stop a stabbing attack i said the claws acted like blades he nodded van anders used the officer as a shield held him on his claws like a puppet is what elsworthy finally said he should have gone to the hospital with the others i said he looked fine when i got here anita honest i dont blame them for not forcing him to go well he doesnt look fine now we can give him a ride to the hospital when we go i looked at him why do i think that we are going to the hospital for more than just a show of moral support youre just perceptive as hell tonight zerbrowski i said i told captain parker that id be right along once marshal blake showed up you bastard hes asking questions about the monsters that i dont have the answers to maybe dolph would but there is no way i want him to be here we managed to quiet down the worst of what happened in the interrogation with your furry friend but if dolph loses it in a public setting he just shook his head i agreed with him fine ill go with you to the hospital and see if i can answer the captains questions ah but first ya gotta see this he was actually smiling and it wasnt a place for smiles see what i asked suspiciously he turned without a word and led the way down the hallway towards the empty window webster had taken elsworthy in the opposite direction so that they stood as far from the window as the hallway allowed good for webster when we were close enough my eyes started looking at something besides the window there were two neat bullet holes in the wall near the window at the end of the hallway mobile reserves weapons can go fully automatic at the flick of a switch but theyre trained to do it one bullet at a time with two officers down and a monster on the loose theyd remembered their training zerbrowski motioned the uniform back so we had some privacy there was almost no glass on the carpet because it had all gone outside did van anders throw someone through the window he threw himself zerbrowski said i stared at him were twenty stories up even a werewolf isnt going to walk away from that kind of fall it may not kill him but hell be hurting he didnt go down he went up he motioned me closer to the window i didnt like the window it had a very low sill almost low enough to step through that gives a better view but without glass in the metal frame there was nothing but empty air between me and a very big fall careful of the glass and dont look down but trust me anita its worth leaning out just a little and looking up look at the right side of the window i placed a hand against the wall and found a place in the metal that was glass free so i could get a grip the air was beating against me like eager hands ready to snatch me away im not afraid of heights but the idea of falling from them well that im afraid of i fought the almost irresistible urge to look down because i knew if i looked down i might not be able to look out the window at all i leaned out very carefully and at first i didnt understand what i was seeing there were holes in the side of the building all the way up as far as my eyes could follow small holes at regular intervals i eased myself back in carefully watching for glass as much as a fall i frowned at zerbrowski i saw the holes but what are they van anders did a spiderman on them the sniper and observer were set up on the opposite side of the building there was nothing they could do i felt my eyes go wide you mean the holes are where he shoved his hands into the building and climbed up zerbrowski nodded and he was smiling captain parker was screaming that he didnt know werewolves could do that either i glanced back at the window captain parker isnt the only one that didnt know i mean they have the strength but they get cut and scraped and break bones even they may heal quickly but it hurts them i looked up at the ceiling as if i could still see the upward march of holes being shot would have hurt like hell zerbrowski nodded will he need to see an emergency room a doctor something i shook my head i doubt it if hes strong enough to do a partial change then ill have to assume that his healing abilities are on the high end if they are hell be healed within a couple hours maybe less if he changes form when hes human again hell be good as new theyve put the word out to all the emergency and urgent care places just in case i nodded cant hurt i guess but i dont think youre going to catch him that way how are we going to catch him anita how do you catch something like this i looked at him did you ask the upper brass what they thought of using werewolves to track him they vetoed it i think you might find them in a more receptive mood now you think your friends will be nice on a leash for me i was really thinking id been holding the leash my phone rang and the sound made me jump i flipped it open and it was a voice i didnt recognize i dont talk to the chief of police all that often i did a lot of yes sir and no sir then the phone was buzzing and i was left with zerbrowski staring at me were you talking to who i think you were talking to theyve issued a court order of execution for van anders zerbrowskis eyes were wide you are not going after him alone i shook my head i hadnt planned on it he looked like he didnt believe me i actually had to give him my word i wouldnt try to pop van anders without backup id have backup the police chief had told me over the phone that theyd go along with the werewolf tracking idea id have backupif i could persuade richard to give them to me i asked for some plastic evidence bags and raided van anderss dirty clothes drawer i used gloves not to keep my scent off them but because i didnt want to touch anything that had touched van anderss body i sealed the clothes in the bag and hoped it would be enough to help the werewolves track him wed come back and start around the foot of this building van anders might have climbed up but he had to come down somewhere zerbrowski drove me officer elsworthy and himself off to the hospital so captain parker could yell at us both bates had died on the operating table zerbrowski had to take the tongue lashing because a sergeant doesnt outrank a captain i took it because i smelled the fear on parker i didnt blame him for being afraid i think we were all afraid every single person in the hallway every person in the apartment every policeman and woman in town should have been afraid because when something like this happens its still the police that have to clean up the mess well the police and your friendly neighborhood executioner we were all afraid and we should have been i met richard at his house we sat at the kitchen table where wed sat so many weekend mornings he drank tea i sipped coffee he wouldnt meet my eyes and i didnt know what to say he caught me off guard by starting if youd stuck to my morals asher would be dead right now or worse trapped in europe with that monstrous bitch i was pretty sure that monstrous bitch was belle morte thats true i said and i tried to keep my voice neutral i wanted to get down to business and ask richard to loan me some werewolves but it didnt usually work well to approach richard head on it didnt take much to offend him i needed his cooperation not another fight i dont understand how you could let them feed off of you anita he finally looked up and his perfectly brown eyes were filled with a pain and confusion so raw that it hurt me to look at them its hard for me to cast stones anymore richard the ardeur he said i nodded i cant let you feed off of me either i understand that i said he searched my face then why are you here had he really thought this was going to be some tearful reunion some plea on my part to get him back in my bed part of me was pissed part of me was sad none of me had time for it the werewolf thats been raping and killing women here got away from the police today i havent seen anything on the news were trying to keep it quiet youre here for business his voice was soft im here to keep other women from dying he got up from the table and i was afraid for a moment that hed leave but he took the tea cozy off the teapot and refreshed his mug its not one of my wolves anita i know that he turned and there was the first hint of anger then what do you want from me i sighed richard i love you i may always love you but i dont have time for this fight not right now why not now he asked and he was angry i opened the file folder and took out the first photo i held it up so he could see it he frowned narrowing his eyes then finally his mind made sense of it and total disgust filled his face he turned away why are you showing me that hes killed three women here and over a half dozen in other countries those are only the ones we know about hes out there right now picking a new victim i cant do anything about that but i can if youll give me some werewolves to help track him he looked at me then then away because i still had the photo showing track him you mean like a dog no most dogs wont track a shapeshifter theyre too scared of them were not animals anita no youre not but in animal form you have the nose of one but you still have the brain of a person you can track and think me you expect me to do this i shook my head and laid the photo down on the pile i stood and spread the pile out across his table no but jason would and jamil would if you asked him to id say sylvie but shes not well enough to do much of anything she challenged me and she lost richard said his eyes kept flicking to the photos on the table get those off of my table hes out there right now about to turn another woman into so much meat fine fine take jason take jamil take whoever the hell you want thank you i started gathering the photos up you didnt have to do it this way anita what way i asked shutting the file over the gruesome photos harsh you could have just asked me would you have said yes i dont know but those photos are going to haunt me i saw the real deal richard your nightmares cant be worse than mine he moved in one of those blurs of speed and grabbed my arm part of me thinks theyre horrifying just like im supposed to but part of me likes the pictures his fingers dug into my arm bruising part of me just sees fresh meat he let a growl trickle out from between his even white teeth im sorry you hate what you are richard he let go of me so fast i almost fell take the wolves you need and get out if i could wave a magic wand over you and make you human purely human id do it richard he looked at me his eyes had bled to wolf amber i believe you but there isnt a magic wand i am what i am and nothing will ever change that im sorry richard ive decided to live anita i looked at him im sorry i dont understand ive been trying to die im not going to die anymore im going to live whatever that means im glad but i wish you sounded happier about the choice go anita youve got a murderer to catch i did and time was not on our side but i still hated leaving him like this ill do what i can to help you richard you know that like you help all your friends i shook my head gathered up the folder and went for the door when you want to talk and not to fight give me a call richard and when you want to talk and not catch murderers you give me a call we left it at that but i didnt have time to hold his hand even if he would have let me van anders was out there and there were so many people he could hurt what was a little emotional desolation between friends compared to getting van anders off the streets jason and jamil stayed in human form while norman and patricia stayed in wolf form id seen norman in human form before but i couldnt put a face on patricia she was just a big shaggy wolf pale almost white we had to put the two ponysized wolves on leashes today of all days i did not want the police seeing a giant wolf running loose on the streets i was thinking theyd be in a shootfirstaskquestionslater sort of mood id unzipped the two bags that id collected from van anderss rented apartment the wolves sniffed it growled and on the end of leashes they tracked him from the sidewalk around his apartment building and all through the city and finally to a mall the police had been watching the airports the bus stations the highways van anders was sitting in the freaking food court of eastfield mall hed piled his hair up under a billed cap and added a cheap pair of sunglasses as disguises went it was okay besides i couldnt complain much i was wearing a billed cap with my hair up under it and sunglasses i hate it when the bad guys copy i was also wearing a baggy tshirt and baggy jeans with my nikes short as i was i looked like a thousand teenagers wandering any mall in america id deputized jamil and jason they stayed out of sight but warned me that hed smell them sooner or later id already flashed my badge at mall security id made the decision that we wouldnt call the police and we wouldnt try to evacuate i had a court order of execution i didnt have to give him a warning i didnt have to do anything but kill him it was midafternoon so the food court wasnt too busy that was good there was a group of teenagers at the table nearest van anders why werent they in school at the table nextclosest to him was a mother with a baby in a stroller and two toddlers two toddlers neither of them in baby seats but running free while she tried to help the baby eat softserve yogurt van anders was still more than fifteen feet from the rampaging toddlers the teenagers were frightfully close but i couldnt figure out how to get them to move i was working up my nerve to wind my way through the daytime moms and kids when the teenagers got up left their trash on the table and walked away van anders was as isolated as i was going to get him here in the mall i wasnt willing to let him escape again he was too dangerous i made the decision in that moment that i would endanger all these nice people that the mother with her yogurtsmeared baby and the two screaming toddlers were going to have to take their chances i was fairly certain i could control the situation well enough to keep them out of it but i wasnt completely certain all i knew for sure was that i was going to take him now i wasnt going to wait i had my gun at my side safety off roundchambered long before i got to the table with the mother and her children i had my federal marshal badge hanging out over the pocket of the large tshirt just in case some brave civilian decided to try and save van anders i had the gun up and pointed as i passed the womans table i think it was her soft gasp that made him turn he saw the badge and he smiled taking another bite of his sandwich he talked with his mouth full are you going to warn me not to move tell me to freeze he sounded dutch no i said and i shot him the bullet spun him out of his chair and i fired again before hed hit the ground the first one had been rushed not lethal but the second one was a solid body shot i fired into his body twice more before i got close enough to watch his mouth open and shut blood blossomed from his lips and turned his blue shirt purple i circled wide so i could get a clear head shot he lay on his back and bled and managed to cough blood and clear his throat enough to say police have to give warning cant just shoot i let out all the breath in my body and sighted on his forehead just above the eyes im not the police van anders im the executioner his eyes widened and he said no i pulled the trigger and watched most of his face explode into an unrecognizable mess his eyes had been bluer than in the photos bradley called me at home that night strangely after blowing a mans brains out in front of a lot of suburban moms and kids i just wasnt in the mood to go into work i was already tucked into bed with my favorite toy penguin sigmund and micah curled beside me usually micahs warmth was more comforting than a truckload of stuffed toys but tonight i needed that choking grip on my favorite toy micahs arms were wonderful but sigmund never told me i was being silly or bloodthirsty neither had micah but i kept waiting for it you made national news and the postdispatch is running a frontpage picture of you executing van anders bradley said yeah turns out i was across from a camera store lucky me even to me i sounded tired or something more whats more than tired dead you going to be alright he asked i pulled micahs arms closer around me snuggled my head against his bare chest i was still cold how could i be cold under all these blankets ive got a few friends staying with me theyll keep me from getting too morose he needed killing anita i know that then whats that tone in your voice you havent gotten to the part of the article where the threeyearold boy is having screaming fits about me killing him like he saw me do to the bad man in the mall have you if hed gotten away just stop bradley just stop i made the decision before i moved on him that the witnesses psyches werent as important as their physical safety i dont regret that decision much okay ill just talk business then we think leo harlan is best known as harlan knox hes worked with some of the same people that employed heinrick and van anders why am i not surprised i said we tried the number he gave you the answering service says hes canceled his contract with them except for one message i waited for it youre not going to ask just tell me bradley okay here goes ms blake sorry we didnt get to raise my ancestor in case you were wondering he is real but under the circumstances i thought discretion the better part of valor and the assignment has been canceled for the time being do you understand what he means about the assignment being canceled i think so i think he means the deal was called off it got too messy thanks for checking bradley dont thank me anita if i hadnt tried to get you onto our payroll as a federal agent you might never have come to the attention of whoever hired heinrick you cant keep blaming yourself for that bradley its like spilled milk clean up the mess and move on the same goes for van anders i always give better advice than i take bradley you should know that by now he laughed then said watch your back okay i will you too bye anita take care i was in the middle of saying you too when he hung up on me what was it about working for law enforcement that gave you such bad phone manners nathaniel came into the bedroom with the copy of charlottes web it was in the kitchen and its got a second bookmark i think zane or somebody has started reading it i cuddled tighter in against micahs body and he held me his arms warm and fierce as if he could squeeze the bad feelings out of me let them get their own copy i said nathaniel smiled micah kissed the top of my head whos reading tonight nathaniel asked i will micah said unless anita wants to i buried my face in the crook of his arm no being read to sounds just about right tonight nathaniel handed him the book and climbed into bed i wasnt sure if it was the warmth of both of them under the covers or the sound of micahs deep voice as he read but slowly i began to be warm again i hadnt read charlottes web in years i was overdue overdue for so many things that didnt involve guns or killing people dolph is still on leave but im working on arranging a gettogether between him his wife and their son and daughterinlaw i dont know if theres anything to talk about but lucille mrs dolph wants me to try ill try richard seems to have some peace not enough peace for us to date but hey im just thrilled that hes no longer suicidally depressed at this point i want him healthy and happy more than i want him with me asher jeanclaude and i have an understanding i guess you could say were dating you wouldnt think that dating two men simultaneously would be a first with me but two men on the exact same date at the exact same timethats new stephen and gregorys father is still in town valentina and bartolomé asked jeanclaudes permission to kill him jeanclaude said okay as long as stephen and gregory agree stephens therapist thinks it would be healthier if the boys handled it themselves gregorys comment had been oh we get to kill him ourselves thats not what i meant stephen said the two of them are still arguing about how to handle their childhood nightmare come to town im with valentina and bartolomé on this one kill his ass but i wont take the choice away from stephen and gregory not if their therapist says itll do more damage god knows theyve had enough damage in their lives already but because they havent been able to satisfy their debt of honor the two child vampires are staying in st louis besides the debt of honor thing i think valentina doesnt want to be anywhere near belle morte when she goes up against the mother of all darkness me either there are nights when i dream about the living dark as long as i sleep with a cross on im okay but if i forget she haunts me id get a cross tattoo if i wasnt afraid itd burst into flames the mobile reserve has me on their list of civilian experts theyll call if they need me captain parker was wicked pissed that the feds latest update on the preternatural wasnt so updated the fbi just doesnt have enough friends that are monsters if they did theyd know more larry is back in town all duly trained to be a federal marshal and vampire hunter the wedding is set for october tammy is threatening to have me in the wedding some friends they are were still reading charlottes web the crickets sang in the grasses they sang the song of summers ending a sad monotonous song summer is over and gone they sang over and gone over and gone some people think thats a sad chapter but its always been one of my favorites summer is over and gone but autumn is here and next month is october with the bluest skies of the year for the first time in years no scratch that for the first time ever i had someone to hold my hand and go walking out under those blue skies richard and i had always planned to do it but he had his job and i had mine and we never made the time but now i have micah and im learning that you have to make time for whats important you have to fight to carve little pieces of happiness out of your life or the everyday emergencies will eat up everything when we finish charlottes web nathaniel wants to read treasure island sounds good to me
