sophie littlefield horizon the third book in the aftertime series in honor of all beginnings failed and fresh hopeless and hopeful and for m safe in his arms chapter all those shades of redcandyapple and cinnamon and carnelian and rust and vermilion and dozens morepeople arriving for the party stopped and stared at the paper hearts twirling lazily overhead on their strings no one had seen anything like it since before no one expected to see anything like it again aftertime except maybe for cass who dreamed lush banks of scarlet gaillardia mister lincoln roses heavy on glossyleafed branches delicate swaying spires of firecracker penstemon cass dollar hoarded hope with characteristic parsimony when she was awake but since coming to new eden her dreams were audacious greedy lusting for color and scent and life even here in this stretch of what had once been central california valley farmlandrarely touched by frost the sun warming ones face in march and burning in aprileven here it was possible to long for spring in february in her winter garden homely rows of blacktwig seedlings and lumpy rhizomes protruded from the dirt there was little that was lovely save the pale green throats of kaysev sprouts dotting the fields beyond skimming the entire southern end of the island with verdant life beyond the few dormant acres in which cass toiled at the end of each day she had dirt under her nails pebbles in her shoes the sweetrot smell of compost clinging to her skin and nothing to show for it yet in the fields cass was not the only one who was tired of winter in fact the social committees first idea had been a cabinfever dance until someone suggested the more upbeat valentines day theme there was romance to be found in new eden for somedifferent than before of course some kinds of human attraction thrived in an atmosphere of strife and danger others waned cass couldnt be bothered to care it wasnt the first time shed ignored the social committees call for volunteers though it wasnt like she was swamped with work the pruning was done shed sprayed the citrus with dormant oil shed handpressed from kaysev beans and she covered the thorny branches whenever nighttime temperatures dipped a second round of lettuces and cabbages and parsnips were planted beyond weeding and the eternal blueleaf patrol there would be little else to do until warmer weather launched the growing season into full swing so cass would have had plenty of time to join the other women in turning the public building into a party room fashioning decorations from bits gathered from all around the islands shed declined to help as they set aside ingredients for special dishes and tested out cocktails made with kaysev alcohol its gingery taste overpowering anything else they tried to mix it with the committee had even talked the raiding parties into bringing home scrap wood for the past two weeks enough for a bonfire to burn until the wee hours cass watched them as she walked home across the narrow bamboo bridge from garden island stretching her tired limbs and working the kinks out of her neck sore from the backbreaking work of checking the kaysev for blueleaf every afternoon the sun was still high enough to offer some warmth so theyd thrown open the skylights and french doors to let it in on their party once the building had been the weekend getaway of some tech baron with lowbrow taste a man who preferred booze cruises and wakeboarding to wine tasting in napa most of the residents of the banks along the farm channels opted for trailers and prefab buildings and listing shacks so the house stood out for both its size and the quality of its construction well before cass had arrived in new eden all the nonloadbearing walls had been removed opening it up there were foosball and pool tables bar stools leather furniture a community center of sorts a clubhouse surrounded by the little town that had sprung up on three contiguous islands wedged in the center of a waterway that had been nameless and unremarkable before it was supposed to be called pison river now after one of the four lost rivers that carried water away from eden in the bible but the methodist minister who had named the river had died in a cirrhotic coma after coughing up black clotted blood he had the disease long before coming to new eden but everyone had taken to calling it the poison river instead cass slipped just inside curious about the party preparations despite herself there was collette portescue with her signature apron and a colorful scarf in her hair collette was inexhaustibly cheery a born organizer a sacramento socialite whod found her true calling only after she lost everything cass cass there you are the womans cultivated voice called to her now unmistakable in the high registers over the murmurs of the other volunteers and a handful of early guests even though shed agreed to this casss gut tightened as collette put a drink cup down and rushed toward her oncasss eyes widened with astonishmentteetering red satin high heels beneath the wrinkled linen of her embroidered apron collette wore a tight red jersey dress cass glanced around at the others some of them had made an effort with hair washed and tied back even an occasional slash of lipstick or jingling silver braceletbut february was still february and most people wore layers to stay warm none of it new and none of it truly clean it was a testament to collettes fierce commitment to new edens social life that she stood before cass with her arms bare and her hair in homejob pin curls her smile was as splendid as everthat kind of dental work probably came with an apocalypseproof guaranteeand her kindness was genuine only kindness felt like a blade to casss heart and forced her to turn away pretending to cough oh precious you havent got that bug thats going around have you there was a faint note of the south in collettes voice a hint of the miss georgia crown shed worn four decades ago the early eighties would have been the perfect era for herbig hair big parties big spending austerity never seemed like a greater affront than it did where collette was concerned no maam justdust maybe collette nodded tildy and karen have been up on ladders all afternoon probably knocked some loose i should have had them take rags up there with them but honey come with me now let me show you what i need collette dragged her through the milling little crowd of edenites who held drinks in plastic cups and chatted over the sounds of luddy barkava and his friends warming up in the corner on long tables at the back wall of the public building where the wealthy entrepreneur had once installed a pair of fourthousanddollar dishwashers were the makings of the centerpieces such as they were four mismatched vases and bowls and piles of plants that cass had cut from the winterblooming garden near the islands shore there were coral fronds of grevillea creamy pinktinged helleborus already dropping petals tight clusters of tiny skimmia berries cass sighed these were the only flowering plants shed been able to grow this winter the helleborus seed had been raided from a garden shed the others plants were returners species that had disappeared during the biological attacks and the siege and only now were starting to show up again these plants were never meant for floral arrangements they were merely the hardiest the sturdiest the first to come back aftertime fodder for birds and insects early drafts in the earths bid for return they were not especially lovely and it would take skill to make them appear so and cass was no florist she touched a cluster of glossy oval skimmia leaves i dont know trust me anything you do will be an improvement june found you some stuff ribbon andi dont know its all right there gotta run youll do a marvelous job collette was off to organize the volunteer bartenders to untangle paper hearts whose strings had gotten twisted to admonish luddy and his little band to play only cheerful songs luddy had been in a thrashcore band of local renown on the san francisco scene now he spent his days building elaborate skateboard ramps along the islands only paved stretch of road it was a testament to collettes charisma that in her wake the band started in on a jittery minorkey version of wonderful tonight and cass got to her task as well starting with the berry stalks in the center of the vases and bowls and filling in with the more delicate flowers and leaves she was winding lengths of wired organza ribbon through the stemswhere june found such a luxury cass had no idea but you never knew what the raiders would bring back from the mainlandwhen she sensed him behind her and she closed her eyes and let it come the fading of the other sounds in the room the heating of the air between them collette put you to work too huh his voice low and gravelly traced its familiar liquid path along her nerves he was standing too close but dor was always too close cass pushed a hand through her hair grown in the past few months well past her shoulders and released for the occasion from her usual ponytail before turning to face him his expression was faintly mocking in the sunset glow diffusing through the tall windows of the public building his face was tawny and sunbrowned from his work outside just like her own the scar that bisected one eyebrow had faded considerably since she first met dor six months earlier but a new one puckered a crease along his skull that disappeared into his silverflecked black hair cass had been there when the bullet barely missed killing him here in new eden under the ministrations of zihna and sunhi it had taken him only a few days to recover enough to insist on leaving his sickbed of course he had other reasons to want to leave the little hospital reasons neither of them forgot for even a day watching her watching him dor leaned even closer inclining his head so that his toolong hair fell across the top scar obscuring it cass doubted he was even aware of this habit which had nothing to do with vanity like so many men aftertime dor didnt like to talk about himself about who he had been and where he came from though insisting its way to the surface the scar was in the past she was in the past as well for that matter except neither of them could quite seem to remember that wheres valerie cass asked ignoring his question she would have expected the woman to be here already with her embroidery scissors and pins in her mouth doing lastminute repairs for all the women whod managed to pull together something special for the party most days she did mending and alterations in her small apartmentjust two rooms the back half of a flatbottom pleasure boat grounded and rebuilt by the two gay men who shared the frontbut for the parties given by the social committee she came early and sewed on loose buttons and took in seams and tacked up hems valerie loved to help to feel needed she had a pretty spilledglass voice and a ready smile she was a very nice woman dor grimaced shes not feeling well again cass nodded carefully valeries stomach pains came and went the sort of thing one managed before with medication and special diets but that one just endured nowadays truly it would have been so much easier so much less complicated if she was here right now in one of her oldfashioned aline skirts and pendleton jacket a velvet headband smoothing back her glossy dark hair sammi said valerie looked like a geek and cass supposed it was true but she was pretty in a fragile way and if she were here she would be with dor and there would be no danger from the thing that loomed between them im sorry cass muttered meaning it what have you been doing all day dor shrugged in the general direction of the back of the building theres some rotted siding along the backearl and steve brought back some lumber and weve been replacing it trying to get finished before it rains lumber figure of speechthey took down an old house along vaux road weve been cannibalizing it for parts you smell like youve worked two days straight i was going to take a showerbefore this thing starts i think its already starting luddys band rehearsing their party sets had segued into lola and the conversation swelled as people finished their first round and went back for refills cass wouldnt be joining them you gonna be here later cass shrugged staring into dors eyes they were a shade of navy blue that could easily be mistaken for brown when he was angry they turned nearly black very occasionally they were luminous colors of the sea i dont knowim tired ingrids had ruthie all day i need to go check on her i might just turn in early dor nodded probably best yeah probably a group of laughing citizens rolled a table covered with pies into the center of the room and a goodnatured shout went up from the crowd everyone knew theyd been hunting all day yesterday for jackrabbits and voles for meat pies so the three hawthornberry pies were a surprise cass knew all about them though for she had been the one tending the shrubs hidden on the far end of garden island down a path that only she and her blueleaf scouts ever used or sometimes the kids when they wanted to watch the beaters after an autumn harvest the shrubs had surprised her by reblooming she could not say why or how that had happened other than the fact that kaysev did odd things to the earth when it first appeared people worried that kaysev would strip the soil of its nutrients in a single growing cycle the opposite seemed true there were other cover cropsrye for one planted to give overworked soil a break and renew mineralsbut cass had never seen one behave like kaysev the hawthorn bushes second bloom was scant and after cass picked enough for the pies the small berries were nearly all gone the few that remained werent enough even for pancakes cass would give them to ruthie and twyla when they were ripe and they would get the sweet juice all over their faces a treat something to enjoy as they waited out the winter winter was tough on children the cold days and early nightfalls they had no television no electronic games no radios not even lamps except for special occasions children got bored and then they got restless cass could sympathize she got restless too chapter an hour after sundown cass was back in the room she shared with ruthie one of three cobbledtogether boxes that formed a sloping secondfloor addition to an old boardsided house these were not coveted rooms but cass was among the most recent to arrive at new eden and so she took what was offered without complaint besides even with that she didnt mind what the builders of the ramshackle house lacked in skill they made up for in imagination the rooms lined a narrow hall that overlooked a spacious living room the body of the original house whose roof had been sheared off to accommodate the second floor there were two tiny rooms at either end of the hall and ruthie and twyla loved to use them for imaginary boats or stores or churches or zoos or schools and since no one really owned anything they were free to borrow props from all over the house buckets became steering wheels folded clothes became racks of fancy dresses dolls became dolphins bobbing on imaginary seas twyla who was older than ruthienearly fiveremembered some of these things from before but to ruthie they were entirely makebelieve ruthie was telling cass about a book that ingrid had read them that evening fridays were ingrids turn to watch the four youngest childrenthe girls plus her two sons age one and threeand she stuck to the most educational books from new edens lending library biographies and howthingswork and math books she also made flash cards with pictures of things long gone like birthday cakes and puppies and helium balloons and ice skates cass and suzanne secretly called ingrid sargeat least they had before suzanne mostly quit speaking to herbut cass felt a hollow pang whenever she saw ingrid bent earnestly over the little ones pouring herself into lessons they were too young to understand cass had once felt that passion when ruthie had been missing casss hunger for her daughter was stronger than her own pulse a primal longing now shed had ruthie back for half a year but sometimes cass felt like she was losing the thread that bound the two of them together so she listened and she listened harder the fork goes on this side ruthie said in a voice that was little more than a whisper patting the mattress on the floor she was a quiet child she never yelled never shouted with joy or rage the knife and spoon go here you can put the plate in the middle thats where it goes cass murmured encouragingly folding back the sheets and blankets as she listened these lessons were pointless but what else could she do for some the old rituals brought a kind of solace ingrid was such a person the room was illuminated by a stub of candle melted to a plate and when ruthie was tucked in she blew the candle out as was customary candlelight was to be conserved to be used only when necessary can i help set the table tomorrow ruthie asked yawning tomorrow suzanne would watch the kids so the other two could work the three of them rotating every three days despite their troubles suzanne and cass had an unspoken agreement never to let their discord affect the children cass calculated what needed doing tomorrowearl had promised to come to garden island in the afternoon and look at some erosion that was threatening the area cass had tilled for lettuce along the southern bankbut she could knock off after that come by and get ruthie they could help with dinner eat early and still have time to visit the hospital it had been a long timetoo longthree weeks a month she hadnt meant to let it happen but it had gotten harder and harder to go there but yes she had promised herself she would be better they could get there in time to help sunhi with the last few chores of the day and ruthie actually enjoyed the visitsshe was too little to be afraid yes babygirl cass said trying to keep her tone light and then you can wash all the dishes and dry them and put them away how does that sound will you help me ruthie asked doubtfully sleep overtaking her voice so serious ruthie never seemed to know when cass was teasing her of course ill help you cass whispered laying her head down on the mattress next to ruthies her knees on the carpet she felt ruthies breath on her cheek before long it became regular with sleep cass kissed her softly and crawled over to the corner of the room where she kept their few special things in a cabinet that had once held electronics part of a media center in a time when media still roamed the earth and electric byways she ran her hand over the books the toys and jars of lotion the wooden flute and the little glass bowl of earrings and only then did she take down the antique wooden box that had held a board game a hundred years ago shed traded a potted limetree seedling for the box which a woman had carried with her all the way from petaluma in her backpack on its surface in flaking paint was the image of a dancing bear balancing an umbrella on its snout no one knew what the box meant to the woman or why shed carried it all those miles because not long after arriving in new eden she cut her foot on a piece of broken bottle in the muddy shores and died three weeks later when the infection reached her heart the woman had one good friend a mute who had walked beside her all this way who inherited her few paltry things when she died who now owned a lime tree cass ran her fingertips lightly over the painted bear then she opened the box took the plastic bottle from inside and put it to her lips the first swallow burned like heated steel like justice done the second swallow and all the ones after that went down like nothing chapter the singing was back somewhere behind his eyes a strange highpitched tuneless song that had been weaving in and out of his diluted dreams for days or months or years for all he knew it seemed like he had been here forever here was a place of watery uncertainty its outline flickering and disappearing brief flashes that inevitably faded into the nothing over and over and over again his senses were gone he was contentwell perhaps content was not right but aware of his lack of sensation and glad for it at one time in that vast unknowable that was before there had been pain indescribable pain but now there was just nothing and he drifted around in the nothing and was aware of it and that was all until the singing started a whiffling meandering tune as though someone was letting the air out of a bicycle tire the thing that was smoke this creation of mind and nothing stumbled over this thought bicycle tire details came into focus bicycle tire was black matte to the touch and about the size of the round mirror that had hung above the mantel in his parents home in valencia mantel parents valencia no no nothis was no good new thoughts intruded and smokes consciousness shivered and contracted like an amoeba under a slide he did not want to think he did not want to wake mantel parents valencia in the trilevel house in valencia where smoke lived with his father who soldacurasand his mother who dabbled in portrait photography dad acura mom portraits there were fires in the fireplace and trays of sandwiches and the game on monday nights also he was not called smoke edward allen schaffer that was his name and he had grown up in valencia and his parents were dead and now people called him smoke and hed loved a woman and hed tried to make up for the terrible thing he had done but theyd found him first and that was all waitit wasnt really singing was it what smoke had mistaken for singing wasnt sound at allit was light it waited outside his eyelids but it was growing impatient with waiting and when it became impatient it pressed harder against him and became like a sound entering his brain and ricocheting from one corner to the other it wanted him to come back it insisted that he come back smoke did not want to but now he understood that it was not his choice painfully inevitably smoke began to gather himself first stepsomewhere hed had a body where hed left it he wasnt really sure but he would not be able to do much of anything without it and so he cast his weary and reluctant mind out until it stumbled upon the form of the thing and he traced its shape with his memory it made him laugh or at least remember laughing remember the feel of laughter if not the reason toes toes were ridiculous werent they something to laugh about there were so many of them and it took smoke a long time to count each of them two sets at the end of his two feet these were attached to legs which had apparently been there all along but damn if he hadnt forgotten about them wonderingly smoke recalled his legs and that was enough for a while and he let go exhausted and floated back out into the nothing and rested some more days passed nights passed the next time he came back the toes feet and legs were still there and now so were arms fingersthese he found interesting enough to dwell on for a while especially since they feltincomplete memories of touching things grabbing them holding them breaking them his stomach his neck so it was mostly all there then he was all there and apparently had been for some time again that struck him as funny and he smiled or thought he smiled though maybe he only imagined either event waitthere was something something important the woman the woman and the girl cass and ruthie those were their names hair like corn silk eyes like green agate the memories and sensations coming back too sharp and too fast now bringing with them pain smoke groaned remembering a kissthat would be cass she tasted like sun and iron and oranges her skin was silk and velvet and he wanted it wanted her he had been at a crossroads had been choosing the forgetting place except now hed remembered cass and there was no longer a choice only cass only the cassshaped hole shed left in him once he thought she came to him he struggled to come up from the wavery nothere he was willing to accept the pain of returning willing to let go of the lovely forgetting if only he could see her touch her and he tried god how he tried he called her name but he had no voice because it too was still caught in the gone place the grief of this loss was as real as what hed left behind whether she was a prisoner too or a spirit he didnt knowonly that shed been here that was enough that and the memories they strengthened him and girded him for the pain the nothing was gone the pain was waiting he breathed in deep and pushed off from the edges and broke the surface and with a mighty effort he opened his eyes chapter when dor came around the sounds of partying in the distance had mostly died down earlier there had been the occasional shout laughter carrying on the breeze a couple of firecrackerswhere they had come from cass had no idea since nearly everything that could be ignited or exploded had been set off a year earlier when the siege splintered weeks into riots and looting and people fighting in the streets back then cass had trouble sleeping through the sounds of car crashes screaming gunshots things being thrown and driven over and crashed into by the time she finally left her trailer for the last time joining those who were sheltering at the silva library the street in front of her house smelled of damp ash and rot and smoke trailed lazily from half a dozen burned structures throughout the town while corpses rotted in cars and parlors and survivors learned that the beaters werent so easy to kill sleep had been hard then because sobriety meant you had to let it all in every sound every thought every memory doing aa the right way meant handing over your denial card those who held on too tight never lasted long and cass had been in the program long enough to see people come and go so when she lay awake in her hot lonely trailer tears leaking slowly down her face she accepted the sounds as her due just one more surcharge of sobriety of course none of that was a problem now cass sat on the rough pouredconcrete stoop behind the house sipping and watching the bonfire burning down to embers in the middle of the big dirt yard in front of the community center a ways off on warm days people played football and volleyball there in the spring there would be picnics if cass managed to patch things up with suzanne by then they could take the girls there to make wreaths of dandelions and wild loosestrife the buildings doors had been thrown wide and people spilled out of the party room holding their cups and plastic bottles drinking wasnt forbidden in new eden and it wasnt even exactly frowned upon but you didnt see much of it except on nights like these it had been hard to get used to after the indulgent ethos of the boxsometimes the mood of new eden seemed like a hoedown or a revival wholesome to the point of cloying sometimes cass missed the edgewalkers the despairdwellers the ones who routinely lost their battles with themselves her people and sometimes she wondered if people like that were just another species doomed to extinction aftertime was not hospitable to weakness it offered too many outs too many reasons to quit cass couldnt quit though because she had ruthie so when she fell off the wagon she fell with excruciating care she did not actually enjoy a single drop of her cheap kaysev wine as she slowly sipped it down she wanted to gulp to drown in it instead she parceled out not quite enough every nightand never before ruthie went to sleepenough to get just a little bit out of herself cass thirsted for complete oblivion instead she medicated herself to a painful place in the shadows cast by what she couldnt escape a footstep on gravel a figure cutting moonlightcass nearly missed him focused as she was on the orange glow of the remains of the bonfire but it could only be one person the one man who knew her habit of sitting out here late into the night while the community slept the sentries at the bridge the only other souls awake in the small hours thought you were going to turn in early dor said lowering his tall sinewy body next to hers cass shrugged you knew i wouldnt yeah i guess i did for a while they sat in silence dor drank the dregs of homegrown wine when he got to the bottom he held up his plastic cupthe flimsy kind that college kids used to serve at keggersand stared at it from several angles in the light of the bonfire a hundred yards away then he crushed it in his hand as though it was nothing cass raised her eyebrows in the dark better not let dana see you do that dana was the compliance leader tasked with making sure everyone reused and recycled and compostedand the most vocal member of the new eden council the council operated on principles of concordance and had sworn off hierarchy which only seemed to make dana that much more dogged about getting his way whenever an issue was brought before it he also seemed to delight in taking rulebreakers to task though there was no formal punishment structure only admonishments to do better you got the feeling dana would have welcomed more authority as long as he was the one wielding it dor flashed a bitter grin that quickly disappeared dana can go fuck himself ive just spent eight hours up to my ass in rotting siding and i have the splinters to prove it if i want to stomp one cup under my boot for old times sake id guess ive earned the right but rather than tossing the cup on the ground he took the twisted torn mess and tucked it into the pocket of his shirt no one littered in new eden not even dorthe three islands were all they had ruthie sleeping he asked after a while and when his words were followed by his warm rough fingertips on the strip of skin at the small of her back between sweater and jeans cass swallowed hard because he could take her to the other place that fast yes she whispered hoarsely as his fingers traced circles drifting slowly lower this went on for a while moments hours who knewit was always like this him barely touching her both of them going whitehot in seconds they never talked about it sometimes he would keep talkingabout the things he was fixing about nails and shingles and broken asphalt about a bird hed seen lighting on a fence post or a book the raiders had found somewhere about his daughters latest project a mural she was painting on the wall of their building or a jean jacket she was embellishing with valeries help he would talk and cass would murmur in the appropriate places the lulls and silences in their conversation and if someone had been listening to the two of them unable to see where his hands were going they would never know there was anything going on except conversation dull conversation i might take a ride out with nathan tomorrow dor went on without inflection go out toward oakton see what we can find cass nodded nathan siphoned gas from wrecked vehicles using a system hed rigged from a pump a length of hose and some custom couplingsalong with a sledgehammer and crowbar for dealing with tank locking devices he drove out in his tiny hybrid in the mornings and came back with his cans and jugs full cass suspected nathan did it more for sport than anything elseand that dor went with him for the same reason be careful she said unnecessarily beaters had been showing up more often lately along the shore five or six times a week where they could easily be picked off while they screamed in frustration unable to swim there was a certain fascination in watching glynnis and john the best shots on the island taking the skiff out and shooting them at almost pointblank range dropping them with a single shot to the head or spine the only sure way to kill them quickly cass never let ruthie watch but shed joined the other spectators half a dozen times borrowing jasmines binoculars so the burst of blood filled her vision through the lenses but meeting them on land was another story entirely especially since nathan and dor had to get out of the car to siphon i will dor growled as he pulled cass toward him his big hand wrapped around her arm his warmth seeping into her skin even through her jacket she went wordlessly straddling him in the dark and her mouth met his with a hoarse cry deep in her throat her knees ground against the hard cold concrete as she levered herself more forcefully against him she could feel his hardness between her legs and his hands slid down her back against her ass pulling her against him her teeth knocked against his and his mouth was hot and hungry on hers she plunged her hands into his hairlong enough to snarl in her fingersand felt the bristle of his beard against her thumbs it was like this with dor this hunger this need to consume him and be consumed there was nothing tender about it every time she had bruises sometimes one of them would break skin with their teeth their nails but every time this feeling where is she cass gasped wrenching herself away from the kiss she could feel dor scowl his jaw tightening under her hands cant be sure he said kissing the soft skin under her chin scraping against it he knew she meant sammi not the woman twiceonly when both valerie and sammi were safely on the sparsely populated northern island for the daydor and cass had fucked in his room the luxury of a bed intoxicatingly heady but almost distracting because they were so accustomed to sheds abandoned boathouses and most often the cold ground at night theyd rutted in between the rows of plants in casss garden on moonlit nights and on the rocky muddy shore on moonless ones and dor had taken her standing up in a narrow space between trucks in the auto shed many times working in the thin winter sun by herself cass thought about what they did and wondered if it was the shame of it the degradation of hiding that made it that much more intense she tasted the liquor on his mouth and licked it greedily she could not get enough of the taste of him so it would be another time in the open another morning when she would wake in filthy clothes dirt ground into her knees her elbows twigs and pebbles in her hair well so be it dor stood half carrying her until she wriggled from his grip and found her footing dor who had been an investor before who had spent his days under fluorescent lights working at a computer had been hardened aftertime until they came to new eden hed run the box a fencedin pleasure mart and hed trained with former cops and gang members learned martial arts and shooting and put his body through a demanding regimen until it was as imposing and strong as it could be and smoke had done the same right along with him what else was there to fill their days everyone was lean and basically fit now life demanded it physical labor filled everyones hours but dor ran the length of the islands at dawn and he lifted weights in the leanto where sports equipment was haphazardly stored on both fine days and rainy ones he was even more hardmuscled now than when they arrived and cass suspected it was because he was no longer in charge of anything no longer a leader and too much energy accumulated inside him with nowhere to go his skin against hers was hot his muscles had been hardened by his own punishment he led her ungently down the rocky path to the waters edge here on the southeast end of the middle island a wooden dock extended twenty feet into the water its pilings loose water lapping over the far end soon someone would need to either fix or salvage it but that was not for tonight dor led her to the center which was dry if splintered and rough and pulled her against him his breath was hot on her neck his teeth grazed against her skin she seized handfuls of his shirt threw back her head and let go of conscious thought for a moment he crushed her against him and casss eyelids flickered at the sensation of her body joined all the length of his the bonfire a golden shimmering wavering illusion in the distance before she let them drift shut if shed kept them open she might have seen her coming by the time her footsteps clattered on the wooden boards and her shocked gasp reached their ears by the time dor and cass disentangled from each other it was too late to do anything but try to keep their balance as the dock swayed and rocked a flashlights beam arced wildly across the dock skittering over the water until it leveled at them shining it directly into each of their faces in turn cass blinked hard but when sammi lowered the light she saw that the girls eyes were filled with tears dad she gasped oh my godcasswhat are you doing cass backed away from dor as though to erase what the girl had seen but really even a fifteenyearold couldnt mistake what they were doing for anything but what it was wuhwe were just cass stammered dors hand shot out and he grabbed sammis hand but she jerked it back oh my god she repeated i cant believe her her and then she was running but at the edge of the shore her shoe caught on the lip of the dock and she went sprawling dor raced to help her up cass stood with her hand to her throat unable to breathe knowing what they had broken the enormity of it buzzing in her head sammi refused her fathers hand crawled away from him got to her feet and paused for only a second her arms hugging her slender frame i hate you she cried i hate you both and then she was sprinting away the lights beam ricocheting wildly across the landscape back toward the bonfire and disappearing completely around a wide building dor watched sammi go cass watched him watching she ached for him even as her skin still tingled with the memory of his touch sammi wasnt supposed to see them not ever no one was how they thought they could keep doing this without anyone ever finding out in a place as small as these islands she had no idea but neither of them had been able to stop not once chapter sammis feet hurt like hell but you had to take your shoes off to climb up the tree without making noise shed taken her socks off too because once before she hadnt and snagged one on the bark it ended up stuck there because she wasnt about to go back for it once she got into kyra and sages room and at like three in the morning she had to sneak back to her room with just one sock and her boots were nasty rank and wornout and sticking her foot in them without a sock made her want to hurl so tonight even though shed run all the way here even though her lungs ached from the effort and she felt like the entire island could hear her breathing she took the time to stuff her socks into her pockets before she shimmied up the trunk the party had ended but there were still a few stragglers making their way back to their houses the paths crisscrossed with flashlight beams and candle glow laughter spilling over into the darkness the adults were drunk some of them which shouldnt be any surprise because they were all so fucking hypocritical sammi could hardly stand it dad and cass no no she wouldnt think about it wouldnt let herself remember the way they were groping each other hands all over each other like theyd just die if they couldntbut no the adults were drunk earlier tonight shed been having fun the kind of fun that came along unexpectedly sometimes when you had no expectations at all when you had resigned yourself to the idea that everything was going to suck and then some small thing would shift or change and suddenly it was like you were in grade school again and it was chocolate cake for lunch or your best friend gave you an invitation to a party or your mom painted your nails with a brandnew bottle of nail polish sammi remembered feeling that way that pure clean happy feeling that used to be part of her life just like sunday pancakes and riding in the bmw convertible her mom bought herself for her fortieth birthdaybut she had forgotten what the feeling felt like if that made sense which was somehow sadder than all the rest of it put together and then there would be a moment like tonight when it all came back for just a second or a minute enough to trick her into feeling like maybe things would be okay tonight it was when luddy and cheddar and their stupid friends with their lameass retroemo band were messing around and sage and phillip were making out in the corner and sammi and kyra were helping set out the pies and then all of a sudden the lazlow kids were in the middle of the room where the ladies were trying to set up tables and they started dancing only not really dancing they were taking running startsor dane was anyway since dirk was too little and then flopping down on his knees and sliding across the polished wooden floor like some sort of oldtimey breakdancer dane got on his back and kicked his legs in the air and sammi was reminded of a time when she was six or seven when she used to take classes at tiny troup but she couldnt keep up with the other girls she couldnt do a plié for anything so her mom told her it was okay if they quit and they went home and cranked the speakers and got on the floor and made up their own dance right there in the living room of the house in the mountains under the fake log beams and the elkantler chandelier they jumped and danced and rolled until they were piled in a heap the two of them laughing so hard her sides hurt and her mom had said who needs any stupid tiny troup and sammi said yeah who needs those guys of course her mom had been dead two months and twentyfour days and so had jed and sammi kept a count in silver sharpie on the inside of the plastic box she stored her last few tampons in the days since she stopped being her old self and started beingwell her half self because that was how she thought of herself now as half of what she used to be not that you could tell from the outside that was all fine and from the way the boys looked at her more than fine and sammi knew she looked goodshe had sun on her face even though it was so damn cold all the time and her hair had gotten really long and kind of wavy since she stopped using the flatiron so the outside yeah but inside she was only half there at any given time sometimes it was her thinking half that was there like when she was working on her chords red tapping out time on the back of a folding chair in the music room and sometimes it was her bad half her remembering half the one that kept hold of all the things she wished she could let go and other times it was her numb halfyeah that was three but who was countingthe numb self shed learned to call up from deep inside with the help of the herb cigarettes that sage made for them she swore they got you high and sammi wasnt so sure but what did it matter eleven herbs and spices or whatever was good enough for her so she and sage smoked like theyd been smoking forever and that was what mattered putting that paper to your lips and sparking it up and sucking it down with your friend beside you and getting to the numb thinking remembering going numb but never all at once right now pulling herself up the low branches swinging up to the ledge the different parts were coming and going that thing with cass and her dad what the hell her dad would fuck anything that moved but he wouldnt even let sammi walk down to the water with colton after dinner but she couldnt think about it tonight that had to wait so she was pushing back on the thinking half and calling up the numb half she was just killing time it was nothing sage she said kind of soft tapping on the window glass she had one arm wrapped around the branch the wood digging into her inner elbow painfully leaning down against the cold window sage and kyra were no doubt sleeping theyd left the party at least an hour ago kyra looking like she was going to puke again which was nothing new kyra had been puking since they got to new eden so much that corryn had started making her special crackers out of kaysev flour she even poked holes in them to make them look like saltines sage but sage was already there pushing the window open yawning you scared the shit out of me what are you doing i couldnt sleep sammi lied dads snoring again it was a pretty good lie her dad did snore sometimes if hed been out all day on the road with earl or if hed been doing something hardcore like cutting wood with the axe or hauling stumps with chains sammi figured snoring was just one of the ways old people dealt with physical exhaustion which was okaywould have been okay anyway back when they lived in a sixbedroom house and her mom and dad were like in a whole other wingexcept that now they shared a trailer barely big enough for one person to live in much less two and it was nice of her dad to let her have the bedroom except he slept in the living room which was the only other full room in the trailer and she couldnt even go to the bathroom without having to walk right past him which was just wrong since her dad was longer than the twin mattress hed put on the floor and he always had a leg or arm falling off the side she didnt want to see her dad like that and she figured he for damn sure wasnt proud of it either of course that was all before she knew about him and cass cass when he was supposedly with valerie who was totally boring except at least she was old and normal someone her dad should datenot cass who had been cool until they got here when she had some sort of breakdown and barely even cared about smoke anymore and besides she had a kid for gods sake but evidently aftertime meant that parents could just fuck around and do whatever they felt like and to hell with the kids even while they were still ordering them around i thought id hang out sammi said quickly not wanting to go down that path you know i thought we could be quiet if kyras like needing her sleep or whatever oh dude get this sage said forgetting that she was exhausted and pulling the window open wide so sammi could scramble inside sage and kyra were roommates in the house for wayward girls which wasnt actually what the place was called just their nickname for it red and zihna who were really old were like the housemom and housedad and had the big bedroom downstairs kyra would probably have to move over to the mothers house when her baby came but that was months and months away sage had been impregnated at the rebuilders baby farm too but she had miscarried right after they got to new eden so it was kind of like she hadnt even been pregnant kyras getting this like line on her stomach what do you mean i guess its a pregnancy thing thats what zihna says anyway zihna says its probably going to be a boy because the lines from testosterone and you get more testosterone in your system if youre having a boy like with the bacne i know right thats so disgusting sage made a face here look she wont wake up as sage tugged the blanket carefully off their sleeping friend and shone a flashlight on her sammi thought about how sage always acted like pregnancy was the worst thing that could happen to anyone not around kyra of course because that would be mean but when she and sammi were alone and that made sammi wondermaybe sage wasnt as relieved about having had the miscarriage as she pretended to be which sammi kind of got at least if you had a baby there would be something to do all day long and someone to love you back for you not for who people wanted you to be everyone was so messed up from everything theyd seen everything that had happened a baby wouldnt be like thata baby would never have seen cities getting blown up and burned down whole fields and farms leveled all the plants dead and now with the kaysev and all a baby would never go hungry of course there was still the beaters sage lifted the oversize tshirt kyra wore as pajamas and sure enough there on her stillmostlyflat stomach was a faint gray line running from her belly button down and a few black hairs lying flat against her skin shit sammi said impressed kyra sighed and shifted in her sleep and sage pulled the covers back up over her then snapped off the flashlight they sat on the floor with their backs to sages bed sammi who saw well in the dark could make out the shapes of kyras bottle collection on top of the dresser a few wilted weeds stuck in some of them i saw dad with cass tonight sammi said surprising herself she hadnt planned to tell sudden tears welled up in her eyes and she pushed them angrily away what do you mean with like with his tongue down her throat and his hands in her pants and she wasnt exactly saying no they were down on the dock doing it like like dogs they werent exactly doing it of course and not like dogs either but sammi was pretty sure theyd been headed that way and shed bet this wasnt the first time oh wow sage said seeming genuinely shocked i never would have thought that yeah no shit i thought she was like with smoke yeah there was a silence and sammi figured they were both thinking about smoke how messed up hed been when they first got here bone showing through his skin scabs oozing pus missing a couple of fingers scars crisscrossing his face and body for a while sammi visited him a few times a week and then she just sort of stopped she felt guilty about thatguilty as hell since smoke had always been there for her and her mom back when they all sheltered at the school but she couldnt stand looking at him halfdead because it reminded her too much of when her mom and jed and all the others were killed and none of them even killed by beaters but by supposedly good humans smoke didnt even know she was there anyway sunhi said he might never come out of his coma zihna said his energy was growing stronger but that was just the hippie way she talked all the time sowhat about valerie sage asked what about her sammi snapped and then regretted it she had wondered the same thing valerie was always trying to get close to her asking her about her friends sage and kyra and phillip and colton and kalyan and shane offering to make snacks for them all offering to loan her clothes that sammi wouldnt be caught dead in valerie was nice in her boring waybut there was no way sammi needed another mom well cass is kind ofway hotter than her i mean you know yeah but but it was still her dad i mean it would be one thing if dad wasnt on my shit all the time about every little thing i do his new thing now he doesnt want me going off the island without telling him first im like i always tell red or zihna and he says thats not good enough if hes off working or whatever i have to wait until he gets back sammihes worried about you i mean youre his kid there was a hollowness to sages voice and too late sammi remembered the thing that made her an asshole with her friends sometimesthat she still had a parent which was one more than most of the others here sammi said she was sorry like she always did and sage said it didnt matter like she always did and they smoked for a while and then they lay down sage in her bed and sammi on the floor under borrowed blankets and after a while sage fell asleep in the middle of talking about which actor from before phillip looked most like and sammi lay awake and tried not to think of her dad and cass and what they were doing and the sounds they were making and instead imagined sliding across the wooden floor on her knees like the little kids being seven again with her mom on the sidelines clapping and saying go go sammibear chapter i already knew that luddy said taking back his guitar after red had showed him exactly how the chord progression went they had been among the last people in the community center the party having wound down to the dregs all the good food gone and most folks having wandered home with a full belly and a pleasant buzz the chord progression was a tricky one and red remembered with wistful clarity the day hed learned it himself hed been crashing in a guys apartment in san francisco not too far from the haight red had a little of luddy in him back then insecure and ambitious he didnt dare let on how much of a rush he got just being that close to where it all started hendrix joplin garciaback in those days everyone still remembered the greats red used to get up before the rest of the guys and walk over to the park with his guitar and find a bench hed stay a couple of hours dicking around just for the sheer joy of it going through the set list first for whatever dive carmy had managed to book them intoand then hed play his own stuff some of the songs were polished as perfect as he could make them others were just a few bars here and there inspirations that came to him in the early hours of the morning while he lay in bed thinking and smoking after a gig back then people used to try to give him money all the time and what the hell red didnt discourage it a hey man for the guys a wink for the ladies he got other offers too and now and then hed take one of the girls home or if he and carmy were sharing a room to her place it never meant anything it was just part of the journey and red back then was always on a journey it was in his blood in his bones the original ramblin man that was him not anymore though red counted every day that he woke up in the same place zihna at his side as a good day and the kidsthe girls who lived with them the teenage boys who hung around the housethey were a kick he taught them all guitar just for fun on a good day it was pure magic on a bad day well then it was still pretty good his favorite nights were when the girls got bored and came downstairs looking for something to do zihna made tea and snacks and red got out board games or cards and they laughed and played until the girls got sleepy on nights like that it sometimes seemed like he had all the time in the world that was an illusion of course red was fiftynine this year and well aware that he looked a decade older than that all that hard living was catching up to him there was one more thing he needed to do before he was dead hed tried and failed more times than he could count on one hand still he was biding his time making a move too soon would be even worse than waiting too long and he had a feeling hed have only one more chance chapter in the morning cass woke before ruthie for a while she lay with her daughter tucked in the curve of her body wrapped in her arms watching ruthies hair ruffle in the gentle current of her breath feeling her good sure slow heartbeat and marveling for the hundredth the thousandth time at the perfection of her eyelids they were porcelain fair with a single faint crease and long curved dark lashes a tiny miracle evidence of grace she didnt deserve her head was thickly cottoned sharp thorns of ache punctuating the fuzz her stomach rolled and burned and she had a powerful drylipped thirst and a faint dizziness she eased herself out of the covers and crawled onto the carpet then carefully stood holding on to the small end table that served as a nightstand for support a tremor a shake a sheen of sweat on her forehead the backs of her hands selfcontempt as real as salt and poison on her tongue this morning cass would not go to the shower house where a primitive plumbing system had been cobbled together by earl and his men the women gathered there breathing misty clouds in the morning chill while they scrubbed their faces and brushed their teeth with split kaysev twigs cass couldnt face anyone until she got her daytime mask in place she retraced last nights path down to the water keeping an eye on the ground in front of her not many people came here besides the problem of the disintegrating dock the shore sloped too gently to be good for fishing especially when a steeper dropoff on the other side of the island meant you could practically hang a line into the water and catch bass or sturgeon still there had been enough foot traffic to wear a path from which roots and jagged rocks protruded ready to trip the inattentive cass reached the waters edge and shuffled slowly out onto the dock the river was wide here the water calm and lazy it seemed to flow more rapidly on the other side of the island where the bridge to the mainland was she knelt at the point where it sagged and a thin skim of water slid over the slimy wood inches from her knees cass watched the waters behavior for a moment as she lined up her thingsa toothbrush a cloth the plastic box of baking soda that she used under her armsand thought about how pretty it was the way it followed a design as endless in its variety as it was inevitable lapping dripping sluicing into every crevice in the wood every pock and hollow in the shore it would be so easy to slip soundlessly into the water let it find its way into her nostrils her eyes her mouth the breath bubbling out of her as she drifted slowly down into the reeds and muck the februarycold water would scour away the stale film left by last nights wine the guiltpall from dors bruising kiss a sound interrupted her treacherous train of thought a crowing burbled cry carried across the water sharp on the misty morning sharp and close cass jerked her head up and there across the twenty yards of sluggish river that separated the island from the shore were beaters cass fell back on her ass the impact jarring her body and scuttled backward several feet until she got herself under control twelve fifteeneighteen of them they saw her and started screaming at her like desperate lovers reaching and testing the water with their knobbed and scabbed and mostly shoeless feet before retreating back to the shore so many of them their rage was nothing new but ever since the first wave appeared nearly a year back they had steadily evolved like the old timelife picture books casss mother brought home from garage salesevolution presented in glorious saturated colors ancient dogs and apes turned slyly toward the reader with expressions of selfconfident conspiracy in no time the beaters started searching each other out and building nests in mere months they had learned to work together to take down a citizen in groups of four so there would be one to pin each of the victims flailing limbs not too much later they discovered that larger groups could divide responsibilities so that some kept wouldbe rescuers at bay while others spirited the prey away for a group feast gathering clothes and rags for their nests dragging their victims remains away and stacking them into bonepiles but some things remained beyond themputting on warm clothes when the weather turned cold or scaling walls or driving machinery or building fires andmost significantlyswimming it was the only thing that kept new eden safe no one had ever seen a beater even approach waterways with intent though surely in the crowd of lurching bumbling creatures on the other shore there must have been some accomplished swimmers perhaps one of them had swum for cal another had been a pretty young mother who floated her laughing toddler in water wings in a backyard pool yet another maybe wakeboarded on new melones lake only a few short years ago splendid and muscular and sunsparkling in his joyful youth no more even at this distance cass could make out the hallmarks of the advanced stages of the disease some of them were missing huge chunks of flesh and their bones flashed white and vulnerablelooking others had chewed off their own flesh the thin skin covering their fingers their nails their own lips tearing scabbed craters in their shoulders when they could not find fresh uninfected flesh the beaters would nibble dispiritedly at each other drawing blood and painting themselves with it tearing off strips of flesh but their hearts were not in it they could tell the difference and the difference was evidently considerable they would even eat kaysev when they grew truly hungry and as far as anyone knew no beater had perished from starvation eventually they diedeven the freakishly supercharged immune system that was left behind by the blueleaf fever was not enough to save them from the endless insults to their systems the breaking of bones and rending of flesh and unstaunched bleeding occasionally the raiding parties came across beater carcasses bent and splayed in the streets left by their companions where they fell the huge black carrion birds that had appeared last fall were not interested in dead beaters only maggots would eat beater flesh and cass had heard the stories of raiders rolling over a corpse to reveal its underside split and leaking a tide of fat white pupae onto the pavement casss stomach rolled and heaved and she retched and retched into the water the remains of a meal so long ago she had forgotten it bare lean tendrils of bile retching until there was nothing left until it felt like her soul itself was expelled at last she wiped her mouth on her sleeve and returned to the path without looking again at the opposite shore it was her duty as a member of new edens community to take this bad news straight to the council where it could be absorbed and disseminated and acted upon but as cass remembered what shed done on the dock only hours ago she knew she would shirk this mean duty as she had so many others someone else would have seen what she saw surely someone else would act someone else would have to save them chapter the day was a scorched and stretched expanse of time cass was gratefulher gratitude lousy with guiltthat it was not her day with the kids tomorrow was her day in the babysitting rotation and she would not drink tonight or at least she would only drink a little almost nothing and she would not see dor tonight and definitely she would visit smoke all of that she just had to get through the day first earl showed up as promised and they walked the bank together boots squelching down into the sodden soil near the bank clumps of reed stems going pale where they met the earth crushed flat under their feet i dont know he said finally when they reached the southern tip of garden island looking north from here toward the other islands you could see only the rooftop of the community center and a few of the other buildings a lazy plume of smoke swirled up into the clouds the remains of the breakfast fire lunch was always a cold meal a lean repast of kaysev in its humblest formsgreens for salad hardtack made from the everyday flour cass had been skipping lunch too often she knew that she was much too thin her muscles taut and sinewy across her shoulders her back her arms she would go join the others just as soon as they were finished here she would eat extra she would nibble sustenance like a squirrel maybe hold back on this one area earl said indicating a section of casss planned lettuce patch i dont think its gonna go but this winters been bad for rain cass nodded shed expected as much she had the rows sketched in twine tied to sticks sunk into the spongy soil waiting for a dry day to plant earl hitched up his pants their business concluded he was a kind man cass knew that the leathery kind of sixtysomething man who would have been a putterer a retired gent who refereed little league games and built sunrooms and gazebos for his wife he never complained about the arthritis in his joints though it was clear that mornings brought him almost debilitating stiffness as they walked slowly back along the path he favored one leg if a trove of advil or tylenol popped up there would be some relief for himbut that was as good as wishing for helicopters or snow cones since everything good had been raided from the easy scores long ago so you got your crew coming down after lunch earl said amiably cass was surprised he kept track benny carol a few others who pitched in occasionallythey came to garden island on the afternoons when suzanne watched the kids everything revolving around the childcare schedule the kaysev field was separated by footpaths into six long and narrow sections and on picking days the crew worked alongside cass bentbacked like the migrant workers who used to dot the strawberry fields along highway from salinas down to san luis obispo fifty miles to the west it was hard work painstaking and slow making sure they didnt miss a single bluetinged leaf the markings could be subtleon the youngest leaves in particular there was nothing but a light tint at the base of the veining only the slightest crenellation along the edges of the leaves in a mature plant the signs were unmistakablethe leaves were ruffled prettily and the underside had the blue shade of the veins on a fairskinned womans breast for that reason cass discouraged her team from picking any of the young plants at all benny and carol had become as efficient as she was and so she no longer doublechecked their baskets they were a good team closeknit the dynamics had shifted cass knew thatat first she and benny and carol stood together at the end of the rows hands pressing at their aching backs resting and talking for a few moments before heading back down the field now she mostly worked at her own rhythm and it was the others who took their breaks together their laughter occasionally ringing out over the hush of the island at the end of the day when everyone carried their baskets back to the kitchen the others were subdued overly polite asking after ruthie and smoke asking if she needed anything else help with some chore cass always said she was fine she had everything under control and it seemed to her they were happy to have her answers and be able to leave her company earl wasnt like thator maybe it was only that he moved so slowly he could not outrun the pall she cast for a moment cass was so grateful for his kindness that she had an urge to hug him to put her hand in his big workrough one he could be likea father to her maybe her own father left her for good early on and her stepfather was rotting in the hell he richly deserved by now and it would be niceso niceto have someone who cared about her cass blinked at the shock of painful longing made a small sound an exhalation of breath earl stopped put a hand on her shoulder to steady her cass are you all right she tried to evade his kind eyes they were sharp and shining in their nest of wrinkles in his weathered face but he had seen im fine his hand stayed heavy on her shoulder for a moment you need to take care girl he said gruffly and cass knew it was reproach as well as concern that he recognized the signs of her hangover well she deserved it didnt she and as they walked the rest of the way she redoubled her fierce silent promise that tonight would be different that tonight she would abstain from everything that was wrong the hardtack spread with a bit of jam to sweeten it did not go down easily and did not do well in her stomach afterward still cass got through the afternoon keeping to her own row and painfully thinking up responses to the others cheerful greetings the sky cleared by late afternoon turning a brilliant sapphire suffused with unseasonable warmth and casss skin sheened with perspiration as they walked back together they turned their baskets over to the kitchen staff who would wash the leaves and pods and roots and turn them into a dozen different dishes todays harvest was mostly tender leaves succulent and pale from all the rains so it would be salads stirfries and maybe even an exotic soufflé made with the precious eggs from the three chickens found in a creek wash a quarter mile from a farmhouse near oakton people joked that the chickens were new edens vips and everyone was anxious for the day a rooster would be found and ensure future generations of poultry the few pods theyd found were still young and tender enough to be eaten as is though mature pods were edible they were tough and fibrous and usually reserved for the work studio where they were dried and turned into a coirlike material that could be used for mats and scrubbers but the shelled beans could be tasty if they werent allowed to get too largeat that point the beans would be dried oil pressed from them and the rest ground for flour the meals would be prepared with care and presented with ceremony by the women and a few men who tended the kitchen people needed to take pride in their workcass understood that she even wished she could feel the same and she envied the beaming servers who set out dishes garnished with lemon slices the juice squeezed so that everyone could have a little in their boiled water cass lingered in the yard pretending that she was caught up in a boccie game in reality putting off the moment when she would have to face suzanne that was how she came to be among the first to hear the cry go up blueleaf for a beat after the syllables hung in the clear warm air there was silence cass whipped around and stared at the long table where the rinsed kaysev was laid out to dry two of the kitchen staffrachael and chevellefrozen over a sorted pile looks of horror on their faces cass leaped to her feet and ran to the table chevelle mutely handed over a bunch of leaves cass examined it with shaking fingers and yesoh yes there it isthe cloudy blue tint at the base of the leaf trailing up into the veining which was almost azure before it shaded to green the leaves were too young yet to have clearly ruffled edges and they lay cool and smooth in casss hand oh fuck chevelle murmured as corryn hastened over wiping her hands on her apron is it she demanded in the booming voice that more than anything had sealed her position as head cook she held out her hand for the leaves but cass made no move to share them only nodding the worst of the discoverythe first in a monthwas not that a rogue plant had grown on garden island but that one of them had failed to identify it when they picked it if it had been passed over by the kitchen staffwhose job was to cook not inspect the harvestit likely would have been eaten and one or more of the people of new eden would have begun to turn which basket cass demanded scanning the row on the wooden counter behind them rachael pointed her face drained of color whose basket cass seized the basket and spun it in her hands looking for the metal scrap that earl had wired to each basket initials inscribed with a nail to identify its owner cd cd she read and her throat closed cass dollar it could have happened to anyone the kind words spoken in an unexpectedly kind and tender voice by corryn were a branch offered to one drowning in a current and cass tried to hold on it worked in the moment corryn had ushered cass into the storage pantry while the others checked and rechecked the harvest harris and shannon joined them in the pantry for a quick consultation it would be discussed at the nightly council meeting and cass knew that harris could be counted on to quell any hysteria corryn if she were called upon to recount what happened would be fair she was a woman who would always continue to be kind these are good people cass reminded herself holding her arms tight across her chest back in the room an hour later with ruthie it was almost dinnertime and cass would not let her daughter go hungry but she did want to wait until most of the people had eaten until darkness was settling over the dining area and they could sit alone but these were good people how could she have taken them so resolutely for granted why had she rebuffed all their efforts at friendship at inclusion but cass knew the reason whythe reason was sitting in the wooden box in the dimming light of evening the bears gilded collar seemed to shine the umbrella balanced on his nose as it always did his placid canine expression remained unperturbed can we go see smoke ruthie asked she was playing with casss bowl of earrings taking them out and sorting them dozens of sparkly and polished studs and dangles some with mates some without cass mostly kept the collection for her girl since she rarely wore such things anymore but tonight she had to tamp down her irritation and resist snapping at her daughter for the baubles spilled and snagged on the dirty carpeting i dont know honey cass smoothed ruthies hair down gently as her little girl snuggled into her lap her skin soft and warm despite the chill of the room cause he misses us he told me casss fingers stilled in ruthies downy hair it needed a cut did you have a dream about smoke honey after cass had recovered her daughter it had taken a while for ruthie to begin dreaming again at first her dreams took the form of daytime trances they were often frightening and sometimes providential dreams of birds preceded the appearance of the giant black buzzards dreams of other disasters followed but recently ruthie had only mentioned nice things cakes mostlyshe loved cookbooks and pored over them at night with cassand adventures with twyla and sometimes dane she frowned a tiny line appearing on her brow i dont think so mama she said her voice going even softer almost a whisper he said he misses us but when it was on the tip of casss tongue to ask in which of their visits had smoke done more than thrash or mumble in a comasleep it had been weeks since theyd been to the hospital and cass had not discussed smoke with anyone least of all ruthie it was more frowning before before today yesterday cass sighed there would be no making sense of this rogue impulse and she didnt want to disconcert ruthie by pressing her further its all right well go see him soon and well see what he says okay ruthie brightened and can i ask corryn for a cookie to take to him you may askbut it might not be a cookie day also smoke was still being fed his meals ground and moistened in a spoon his dormant body responding only enough to swallow the mushbut cass didnt mention that either chapter on nights when she stayed over it was sammis habit to slip out before the rest of the wayward girls were awake it wasnt that she wasnt welcome there she came to the house almost every day since red and zihna let all the older kids hang out whenever they wanted sammi imagined that she could stay over whenever she wanted that she could show up anytime no matter the hour the front door wasnt locked doors in new eden werent locked well except for the storage sheds and the pharmacy cabinet a fact confirmed by colton when he had gone to the hospitalnothing more than a tworoom guesthouse behind the community centerto get a cut on his ankle cleaned the reason sammi sneaked in on her latenight visits and left early in the mornings had nothing to do with whether she was welcome in this place but with her dad she worried about him she used to anyway the way he always held on to her a little too long with his goodbye morning hugs the way he was always checking in with herat meals after dinner at the community center when she went to north island with her friends hell even when she was with valerie it wasnt exactly loneliness and sammi got that it was his job to worry about her and the fact that theyd been separated for so long all the terrible things that had happened her moms death and everyone elsesso yeah it was natural that hed want to keep an eye out for her but with her dad it was something more it was like his fear for her made him weak and she had to be the one to constantly remind him that he was strong and she couldnt let him worry too much or the weakness would grow and that was why she always made sure to be home in their crappy little trailer by the time he got up it wasnt hard to do she knew her dad had trouble sleeping and often spent the middle of the night tossing and turning but even on those nightsespecially on those nightsthe sleep that finally found him at dawn was deep but all of that was different now sammi reminded herself angrily she was sitting on the floor of sage and kyras bedroom for the second morning in a row the borrowed blankets were neatly folded with the pillow centered on top tucked under kyras bed because there was too much shit under sages ifwhensammi asked red and zihna if she could move in for good she would have to ask for her own room she loved her friends and the mess didnt bother her when she was just visiting but she needed a place where she could have her things the way she liked them everything in its place arranged exactly the same every single day she had that now she remembered with an unwelcome hollowness her dad let her do anything she wanted to the trailers only bedroom and didnt so much as raise an eyebrow when she took to dusting every single day her thingsa stone and a necklace that been gifts from jed a plastic barrette that had belonged to her mother and was missing a couple of teeth her journal a striped coffee cup holding sharpened pencils the small pocketknife colton had given her just last montheach had a specific place and sammi checked them all the time making sure they were centered on the shelves she had begged to use the jerryrigged hand vac and dana had finally relented and agreed to let her borrow it once a week and she went over the matted beige carpet one small row at a time walking all the way down to the shore to empty the debris into the swirling water of the river all of that was hers hers alone and all of it was good she would give that up by moving here even if they let her have her own room she would be too embarrassed to do the same things here besides she would have to share everything and even though she had no problem sharing her clothes and her food and her books even her treasured shampoo and conditioner and lotion and cleansershe could not bear the thought of her special things disappearing the stone the necklace the barrette were all she had left of jed and her mom too bad she wasnt more like her dad sammi thought bitterly hed started dating within a month of leaving her mom as if their twenty years together hadnt even happened one woman after anotherpilates instructors and pharmaceutical reps and even for a few strange weeks sammis old spanish teacher her father wasnt the type to let things get to him she ought to ask him how he did it right after she asked him if it was hotter to mess around with someone whod been a beater and recovered fucking cass they said people like that had higher body temperatures and faster heartbeats than ordinary people that they could heal from whatever injuriesscratches bite marks hickeysthey got fucking cass sammi kicked at exposed roots as she took the long way back home the path wound along the edge of the river disappearing in hummocks of reeds and reemerging only to dip down to the water and back up the banks hardly anyone came this way and sammi was in no mood to run into other people before shed had a chance to change clothes and wash her face she just wanted to spend a few minutes in the welcome order of her room touch the stone and the necklace and the barrette in order twice once to make sure and once for luck an exhalation followed by a curse sammi looked up the banks and saw an uncertain figure struggling through thick overgrowth grabbing handfuls of grass and weeds to keep from slipping down the slope on her ass sammi resigned herself to having to share this moment that she would have so much preferred to keep to herself and then she saw who it was the thick dark hair grazing the womans shoulders the grosgrain headband valerie with her bag slung over her shoulder the canvas printed with some artmuseum logovalerie the dogooder supporting the arts even after all the art museums had been ransacked and abandoned sammioh sammi thank god she called down pushing at a stalk that crossed her path ive been looking everywhere sammi looked past valerie toward the community center through wisps of mist and stumpy dead trees to the yard she had been so deep in thought that she hadnt noticed the crowd forming there people gathering in little groups huddling in the cold how come sammi asked irritably whatever the new crisis was she wasnt in the mood to be a part of it valerie slid the last few feet stumbling and almost falling there was a crowd of beaters this morning on the west shore your dad saw them when he headed out this morning with nathan and hes been looking everywhere for you not everywhere sammi mumbled even as valeries wordsa crowd of themsank in whats that honey valeries handsammi couldnt help focusing on her nails perfectly oval and cleansettled on her shoulder and sammi resisted shrugging it off i just said im surprised dad didnt find me i would think kyra and sages room wouldnt be all that hard to find but we did look there first thing welli was there sammi made a halfhearted effort to keep the defiance out of her voice but hadnt she and her dad talked about itshed asked him pointblank so valeries like my new stepmom now this was weeks ago when valerie had returned a stack of sammis clothes mended and pressed and smelling somehow faintly of lavender no one can replace your mom he had replied as if he knew that sammi was remembering her mom doing laundry back in their house in the mountains singing while she folded clothes in the sunny laundry room valerie was better at laundryher mom tended to mix red things in with the whites turning everything pinkand somehow that just made it all the worse but zihna said she hadnt seen you valerie said twisting her hands together so whats the big deal anyway theres beaters on the shore every day oh sammiyou dont understand it was more than thereve ever been before steve said he counted more than thirty before glynnis and john started shooting thirty sammi was taken aback a crowdby that she thought they meant eight or ten the most that anyone had ever seen before was like nine and that was two separate groups one that came from the direction of oakton and the other from straight across the field dragging what turned out to be a split and rotting garden hose behind them but thirtysammi had never heard of that many being in one place at one time though she probably could have imagined it in the denser cities ruins where did they come from no one knows it was so earlyno one saw them coming glynnis and john managed to kill eight of them and the rest ran nathan took off after them in the car and he and steve killed another seven theyd wanted to see which direction they came from but the beaters justthey just panicked i guess like they would and ran in every direction dad didnt go with nathan did he of course not valerie said eyes widening he hasnt done anything but look for you since they were spotted hes down on garden island now going row by row guilt made sammi blush she should have knownbut her dad loved going out with nathan and she could picture itnathan whiteknuckle driving her dad half out the window with that big glock of his like it was some kind of jackass safari her dad was such an idiot acting like it was all some sort of game the way he went out driving around looking for gas blowing up cars and he had the nerve to accuse her of being irresponsible her irritation was back in a flash well i guess you can tell him im fine she said pushing past valerie taking the incline nimbly sucks to be old she resisted saying knowing valerie would struggle even more getting back up the bank than coming downand knowing she was a real bitch for not staying and helping especially since valerie had devoted her morning to searching for her im gonna head back to the trailer and take a nap but sammi look ill talk to you later okay we were up late im wrecked sammi yawned and didnt bother to cover her mouth no what i wanted to saylook they found blueleaf they dont think anyone ate it the plants were young but theres an alert her worried face sagged theres a buddyup right after breakfast as if on cue the breakfast bell chimed two soulful tones carried on the mist sammi loved that bell possibly more than anything else about new eden the way it sounded like it had once hung in a beautiful old cathedral the way it made the air still and silent and echoy for a few seconds after it stopped ringing fuck i know theyre a pain valerie said not even commenting on sammis language which made sammi want to say it again or worse sometimes she wondered what it would take to get a reaction out of valerie of course the woman was only nice to her because she was dating her dadif she wasnt she would have snapped a long time ago given sammi the lecture she probably deserved sammi took advantage of her but honestly how could she not how could anyone stand valeries fakey niceness we could go together thoughif you want i mean once we get there id youre with mrs kristobal sammi interrupted right valerie nodded but it wont take long you and cindy can finish up quick and we can eat together your dadll come back im sure of itwe agreed hed come back every half hour to check in oh sammi hell be so glad to see you hell be so incredibly relieved maybe just to make him feel better you and i could try to stay away from the banks until we get this all sorted out keep to the middle of the island with everyone else what do you thinkshall we make a pact valerie was trying so hard to give her a brave smile that sammi gave up and held out her hand to help her scramble up the muddy bank valerie took it gratefully blinking against the sun which had risen high enough in the sky to warm their faces good idea sammi muttered wondering what valerie would have to say if she knew that not even twelve hours ago her dad had been out on the dock practically in the water as he buried his face in cass dollars tits chapter cass knew it was no accident that breakfast consisted solely of dayold pone a thick bread made in skillets over the fire from a kaysevflour batter sizzled in rabbit fat no fresh kaysev would be served until it had all been checkedin the daylighta couple more times this was mere paranoiathe odds of finding more blueleaf were incredibly low only the passage of time would get everyone comfortable again would lull them back into a state of calm after most had eaten and before anyone could leave dana got up on the porch of the community center and clapped his hands for quiet buddyups always began this way with dana listing the early signs of the disease in his droning voice the fever often accompanied by a darkening of the skin and a sheen of perspiration the dizziness that was traced with euphoria the sensitivity to light and the disorientation he would go on to remind everyone that the old and young were especially vulnerable things everyone already knew and then he would lead them in the buddying today cass felt people stealing glances at herwith apprehension judgment doubtand quickly looking away as they found their partners and lined up cass stayed rooted to the spot she knew that karen would come to her she was efficient that way one of collettes best volunteers a spry sixtyplus woman who liked to say she was a doer there was goodnatured grumbling that the vigilance committee headed by dana and neal had made a special effort to create as many odd couples as they could putting people together who didnt ordinarily seek each other out who didnt especially like each other no one said it but cass guessed that everyone believed the same thingthat the vigilance committee figured youd be more likely to turn in a suspicious case if you didnt like them that much in the first place much lip service was given to the promise that potentials as they called the symptomatic would be treated very well escorted to the comfortable house that had been set aside for just that purpose the house was outfitted with magazines and books and canned food and even soda the windows had been altered to raise only a few inchesenough to slide in a plate of food or a cup of water but not enough for anyone to crawl out of the house of course was locked from the outside only dana and two other council members had keys the quarantine house had apparently been used twice before both false alarms it wasnt that new eden hadnt lost citizens to the beatersit had more than a dozenbut in every case it had been from attacks on the mainland and those unfortunates had either been dragged away to their fates or mercifully shot by the citizens one of the false positives was gordon franche who now kept to himself people said that the experience of being locked in the house waiting to see if he was infected had caused him to lose his mind his illness had just been a virus evidently because after six days he was let out and welcomed back but he withdrew from all social events and mostly spent his days reading quietly now the other one a woman had died soon after drowning in the shallow waters off the mud beach up at the north end of the island supposedly she had been an excellent swimmer no one talked about her anymore there you are karen said behind her and cass fixed a smile in place before she turned around to greet her they lined up with the others in two rows before the porch and stood facing each other shivering a little in the shadow cast by the building temperature dana called and everyone put the back of their hand to their partners forehead like thirtyfive concerned mothers checking on sneezing toddlers eyes he said after a while though by then most people had already checked it was disconcerting cass realized the first time she did this exercise that in reality she rarely actually looked directly into peoples eyes focusing instead somewhere around their mouths watching their lips move as they spoke dor of course was the exception like smoke and ruthie all of whose eyes she knew like the familiar rooms of a house in which shed lived forever perhaps she thought the feeling was a selfprotective fear that eye contact might alert people to the bright green of her own irises it was something she preferred not to think about karens eyes were an unremarkable brown and they were nested in wrinkles the upper lids drooping and reddened the lashes thin and pale but her pupils were a healthy normal size cass was about to make some pleasant harmless comment beating karen to the punch for oncethe importance of covering her ass socially was not lost on herand other pairs of partners were breaking up and returning to the tables or walking off to start their workdays when milt secco surprised everyone by walking up onto the porch and joining dana his face was pinched and he leaned in close to speak but cass was close enough to hear him say a word if i might dana and she was far from the only one who turned to look at danas partner who stood frightened and lostlooking alone at the edge of the yard it was phillip chapter sammi and sage ran taking the shortcut behind a little row of prefab houses there was a small crowd clustered around the quarantine house dana and zihna conferring on the porch earl visible through the front door that sammi had never seen open before phillip stood with his back against the house under the overhang a few feet from dana looking as though a strong gust of wind would blow him away phillip looked smaller standing there how many times had sage gone on and on about how buff he was even sammi had to admit he was the bestlooking boy on the island his blond blueeyed good looks saved from being too perfect by that nose of his which had been broken in a ski accident now though he was wearing a paper mask on the lower half of his face the sort that the dental hygienist would wear back when sammi went in every six months with her mom phillip sage burst ahead of sammi and broke through the crowd people stepped out of her way but before she could get to the porch old mike grabbed her arm and she flailed in his grasp grunting and pushing off of him sammi caught up to her and took her other arm sage stop they think hes got the fever sammi theyre gonna lock him up calm down you have to just listen to me come here a minute sammi talked fast but softly the way zihna talked to the girls when they were upset the way valerie sometimes talked to her which she hated but sammi didnt have a lot of experience with trying to calm people down though she did know one thing and that was that sage could not win this one sages eyes welled with tears and she was leaning out of old mikes grip trying to use her bodys weight as leverage but old mikewho wasnt really all that old but still rather older than fat mikewas stronger than he looked he used to be a mechanic at the airport and his stance said he was determined to hold his ground earl stepped out onto the porch and looked out at the crowd saying nothing he put a hand on phillips shoulder and pushed him back into the doorway the boy went mutely shuffling and now sammi could see that he was trembling he didnt look sick though with that mask on she couldnt see much he just looked scared scared as shit and since his mom had died in the first round of fever and his older brother and his girlfriend had set out for sacramento in december and not been heard from since he didnt have anyone to come to his aid except for sage theyd been together since before sammi got to new eden and it was as serious as any couple she knew about even if they were young they sat together during reds crazy homeschool sessions and both worked parttime in the laundry so they could spend their work hours together too phillip was always trying to make her laugh and he gave her the best parts of his meals and took her plate to the washtub they had been close enough that occasionally sammi felt left out and on those occasions she just hung out with kyra and told herself it didnt matter not everyone had to be her best friend all the time except some days were so lonely that she would have traded everything to have a best friend and on those days she would have picked sage if sage wasnt obsessed with phillip and didnt already have someone more important in her life than sammi just like everyone had something more important to them than her like a certain parent who couldnt even be bothered to be here now if he was he would know what to do sammi thought and then immediately felt angry well her dad used to be in charge of a whole town or whatever to hear the way cass talked and cass said he was fair and brave and took care of things and even set up a whole system of commerce and laws and shit which if she really admitted it to herself sammi had felt secretly proud of but where was he now when there was a real crisis when phillip needed himwhen sammi needed himwhen someone had to step up and take care of things and it was so stupid with new eden having this whole collaborativegoverning shit no one was ever really in charge and whenever the least little thing went wrong it was like this with all the adults standing around staring at each other and no one doing anything that would actually make things better let him go sage screamed her voice wild and unfamiliar hes not sick just look at him he didnt do anything you just want to throw someone in there to make it look like youre doing something but sammi caught her breath because phillip was looking back at them his hand on the doorjamb to steady himself most of his face obscured by the white mask except for his eyes which were frightened and beseeching and his pupils had almost disappeared tiny black specks in the skyblue of his eyes and his skin phillip was fair so fair he wore a big straw hat to avoid getting sunburned during the day and it looked like a womans gardening hat so that shane and kalyan sometimes called him ladyhat his skin was not so pale today it had a burnishedgold tone and there was a sheen to the skin above his eyes that faint perspiration that made a person seem to glow a person with the fever glowed that way sammi dug her fingers more tightly into sages arm and yanked her back ow sammi stop youre hurting me sage wailed as earl spoke quietly to phillip and phillip stepped back disappearing into the house earl closed the door and old mike let go of sage so abruptly that she fell against sammi and they almost stumbled to the ground together and dana took the key out of his pocket and locked the door zihna did her best with sage but in the end it was red who finally got her to sleep on the sofa in front of the fire they almost never lit fires in the fireplace the rule was that fires were only for the public space both for conservation and safety there was no way to put large fires out besides an oldfashioned bucket brigade and everyone had seen city blocks consumed by fire during the worst times and remembered just how quickly it could reduce a building to nothing but one of them must have gone around quietly spreading the word to the neighbors because an hour after dark red laid the twigs and some crumpled comic books under the dry kindling and soon he had a roaring fire going one that reminded sammi of longago nights before her dad left when theyd end a day of skiing by picking up ribs from mountain smokehouse and her mom would open a good bottle of wine and theyd all curl up in front of the fire that fireplace had been beautiful the stone was faux but sammis mom had had it installed all the way up the twostory wall with the oil painting that shed paid a fortune for hung above it and iron candleholders arranged on the mantel sammi always grumbled about having to stay home with them instead of going out with her friends but she secretly loved these evenings cuddled under a quilt watching the fire while her parents drank wine and laughed about ridiculous stuff on the couch this fireplace was junk a metal box with a brick hearth and a strip of molding for a mantel on which zihna had lined up pretty rocks she found while out walking it didnt draw well at all and the house quickly filled up with smoke but sage stared into the flames and drank the weak tea that zihna gave her the rest of them on the carpet except for red who sat with his arm around sage and she let him soundless tears leaking slowly down her face while he mumbled words that only she could hear dad words and sammi thought angrily that he was more of a father to sage than her own father was to her she wasnt moving back in with him he and nathan came straight to the quarantine house as soon as they heard that phillip had been locked up valerie must have told him and sammi was pissed at her too all she wanted was to be here where sage needed her though if she was honest about it sage hadnt given her and kyra a second look since they all came back phillip was all alone in that dark little place sage knew he wasnt sick but sammi had seen his eyes sage said she would stay right outside the house so he could talk to her but maybe she forgot that or maybe they made her leave because not long after sammi came back here old mike and earl brought her home later when red and zihna went to bed sammi would ask sage if she wanted to go back near phillip they could take sleeping bags a tarp it would be cold though unless they took the blankets from the beds after the fire had burned down to glowing embers and sage had fallen asleep in the corner of the couch red got up and tucked the blankets carefully around her to sammi he whispered lets let her sleep here for now if she gets up she can come upstairs but this way shell be nice and warm i can sleep down here with her sammi whispered back i dont mind zihna got her a stack of blankets and a pillow and then the two old people went to their room leaning into each other red moving slowly because of his bum hip that always seemed to be worse late at night and in the morning sammi made herself a pallet but she didnt get in she sat with her arms around her knees and watched the fire for a while as the last of the logs burned low and the embers snapped and popped the heat felt wonderful reaching into her bones in a way like nothing had warmed her lately she was both sleepy and oddly awake stealing glances at sage who had bunched the blankets under her chin like a child sage she whispered feeling guilty that they were comfortable here when phillip was alone and no doubt frightened but sage didnt stir didnt so much as twitch in her sleep and sammi lay downjust for a momentand closed her eyes and felt the warmth on her face and let the thoughts and worries dribble out of her mind like pebbles through a grate until all there was was empty when she opened her eyes again the sky outside the sliding glass doors was starting to lighten to a midnightblue edged with pale pearlgray the air smelled of smoke but not in a nice way like last night on the couch sage had pulled the blankets up around her face leaving her ankles and feet exposed it was cold cold like it always was the kind of cold that made you wish you could stay in bed until the sun was high in the sky sammi crawled over to the couch and tugged the covers down but sage murmured in her sleep and her eyes blinked open before sammi could finish hey sammi said giving sage what she hoped was a reassuring smile sage pushed herself up on her elbows and frowned is it tomorrow yeah like morning barely were the only ones up sage struggled the rest of the way up and yawned pushing back her hair in the middle of the yawn she jerked her mouth closed and her eyes widened in horror phillip i know sammi said quickly look i would have gotten you up earlier but i thought you needed your sleep we can go over there now no one will see us and they wouldnt care anyway i mean all were going to do is talk right talk through the door they cant lock him up like that sammi its not right hes not fevered i saw him he was just like he always is dont worry sammi cut in gathering up the blankets and folding them quickly sloppily dont worryit was a stupid thing to say it was what everyone always said even when the shit was about to hit the fan but what else was there it nagged at the back of her mind this unfamiliar and unwelcome feeling of being the responsible one the one who had to lie to her friend to keep her going she raced upstairs and grabbed her own coat that shed thrown on the floor plus sages blue puffy one she had to help sage put it on urging her to hurry while she fumbled with the zipper she practically dragged sage out into the cold of the morning a fine drizzle was falling more mist than rain but sage didnt even seem to notice it there were a few women at the green latrine one of two that served the island this one had gotten its name from the fact that it had once been a greenpainted detached garage sammi and sage and kyra always used this one because it had a big mirror that they could all three look into while they did their hair and occasionally their makeup when the raiders brought some back at this hour it was too dim to see much at all in the mirror and the women looked sleepy and bleary no doubt on their way back to bed some people used jugs and buckets at night so they wouldnt have to venture out in the cold but most still made the trip dressed in flannel pants and winter coats they didnt talk on the way to the quarantine house only now approaching from across the island did sammi notice how it was situated as far as possible from the nearest structure in between were the buildings that were used for the sportsequipment shed the library and the storehouse the thought gave her an unpleasant shiverthey were trying to isolate people like phillip as much as possible the only way to set them farther apart would be to build a house on north island which was mostly wild with a couple of decaying shacks and acres of bramble only when they reached the house and were making their way around to the front where the windows were open a crack did they see the figure crouched there he or she was doing something at the window either pulling out or pushing in a dark lumpy something as they got closer sammi saw that it was some sort of fabric a bedspread or clothing of some sort and that the person was definitely trying to push it through the slot her feet crunched on the gravel and the figure turned toward her her jacket hood falling back a little to reveal valeries tired anxious face oh valerie said her hands going to her throat as she scrambled to her feet the object hung from the slot what looked like sleeves hung limply to the ground sammi sage is that you what are you doing it was sage who answered her voice shrill she stalked forward and grabbed the thing from the slot and yanked it savagely out it caught on a splinter or a nail and ripped curling lengths of knit fabric tumbling down the wall and sage yanked even harder and the sound of the tearing echoed in the still morning as the thing came away in her hands and all three of them stared at each other then valerie sighed her hands falling useless to her sides its his favorite shirt sage she said unhappily i was fixing a torn seam for himplease give it back ill mend it again he shouldnt be here sage said in that same thin high voice that didnt sound like her hes not sick but she allowed valerie to take the shirt sammi and sage watched her shake it out and squint at the damage a long rip in the underarm before folding it with care and stuffing it in the bag she carried over her shoulder i brought a few other things for him she said quietly some socks abook im going to put them through now sage didnt stop her this time and valerie crouched down again to slide her gifts through the slot sammi saw that the book was a bible a small one with a flexible blue plastic cover it made a muffled slapping sound when it hit the floor inside sage knelt down next to her and tried to look through the slot but all she saw was darkness i was here earlier valerie said softly around midnight i stayed with him until he fell asleep sage sammi knew that valerie was trying to comfort them but she felt guilty theyd been in their house drinking tea and warming themselves at the fire while only valerie had come here for him was that going to be his future to be forgotten and left alone each night as people found excuses to be elsewhere did he ask about me sage kept her face pressed against the house so she didnt see the way valerie pursed her lips the sadness that came over her expression but she didnt answer the question you must not blame cass she said instead this could be anyones fault no i mean its no ones fault the blueleaf could have been so young it was hard to detect the signs or it could have been from the roots theyve been dryingtheyre throwing out the whole batch nowor it could have been from dried flour even or beans from last summer but sammi had stopped listening what do you mean blame cass why would we blame her valeries eyebrows pinched together making a line between them no you know something sammi stared at her face trying to find the answer in her silence what happened come on im going to find out anywayyou know i will what did she do she didnt do anything sammi other than her job you know how hard cass works shes out there every day that she isnt watching the kids and thats hard work bending down between the rows i mean i tried it and i couldnt keep up its hard on your back and its just way too hard to keep staring at the plants and looking for something out of place it could have happened to any of them cass picked the blueleaf is that what youre saying a horrible thrill of understanding made sammi go cold but nobody ate it did they that couldnt have made phillip sick he isnt sick sage wailed crumpled against the house as though she was trying to embrace it but sammi was remembering all the times theyd hung out on north island the long lazy afternoons when if they got hungry they just ate handfuls of kaysev they were carefulmostly valerie held up her hands palms out as though defending against sammis anger against sages anguish sammi noticed that she had on a blouse with a scalloped collar like something a nun would wear something that should have been thrown out twenty years ago how did she do it how did valerie keep finding things to make her look so virginal so pure long after everyone else had resigned themselves to dregs and spoils the aftertime battle fatigues shed smoothed her shiny hair under yet another headband this one covered with plaid fabric and somehow that made sammi all the angrier why do you always defend her who cass why do you defend cass shes not your friend of course shes my friend valerie said but the line appeared between her eyebrows again and sammi knew that valerie suspected deep down maybe buried so far that she didnt even know that she knew something was wrong i think the world of cass shes overcome so much and shes such a great mother to ruthie and shes not your friend she fucks my dad sammi hadnt meant to yell but the words rang out sharp and clear on the chilly morning sammi watched the puff of her breath on the frosty air it dissipated and was replaced by another and another breathe in breathe out everyone kept breathing kept living and what was the point everyone betrayed everyone elsewas that the cost of survival something interesting was happening to valeries faceit was crumpling in on itself like a pretty tissuepaper flower splashed with water wilting and fading before her eyes sammi she is theyve probably been doing it ever since they got here hell probably before that i saw them down on the dock they were likelikehe had his hands inside her clothes valerie i dont know how he can even look you in the face every day but thats my dad valerie had a hand to her throat her narrow fingers twitching against her perfect pale skin like she was going to faint or something and still sammi couldnt shut up he left my mom did you know that even before everything got fucked up he went off to find himself or whatever and just showed up when he felt like it i hardly ever saw him the lie rolled easily from her lips to sammis surprise lying shouldnt be so easy and he never even tried to find us after he had his business im sure he told you about it right and thats all he cared about no valerie said in a choked voice he loves you he always did he told me he sent people to check on you your safety meant everything to him you know what he sold in the box right sammi felt the thrill of forbidden knowledge she only knew this because shed heard it from colton who overheard it from a couple of the raiders who used to go up to the box for medicine trades theyd stay there for a few days and party and then return to the shelter they were in before coming to new eden drugs booze sex like as in prostitutes she spat out the last word making it as ugly as she could curling her lips around the syllablesand still there was a little thrill to the revelation she realized that until now she had been trying not to believe it trying to explain it away shed told colton to shut the fuck up that her dad traded food and medicine that he protected people helped the ones who needed it but of course that was a lie just another one of her fathers lies kind of funny she said making her voice as bored as she could my dads a pimp and cass well since shell fuck anyone i guess that makes her his whore valeries arm shot out so fast that sammi didnt have time to duck the slap was more shocking than painful hard and stinging and making her head whip around she bit her lip and tears stung her eyes she put her fingertips to her mouth and touched blood oh my god sammi valerie said horrified oh my god im so sorry im so sorry i didnt mean to i didnt mean oh please but what sammi felt was victory a mean and hungry victory and she bared her teeth in a snarling grin the hot stinging impression on her cheek where shed been struck meant that she had won no worries id be pissed too i mean youve been so nice to my dad look at you in your little skirts and all and with your sewing you probably thought you could make a home for you guys with curtains in the window and a hope chest or whatever right valerie made a horrified sound in her throat a convulsion of shock and grief sammi knew she was hurting her but shed been hurt so many times and it wasnt like anyone was very concerned about that was it valeriewith her mended dresses and inspirational quotes and wind chimeswas just pathetic sammi was doing her a favor shed either deal with this or not shed get over her dad or shed sink like a stone and then shed be the one who wasnt careful when she ate her salad or who went on the mainland without a weapon or who walked into the water until it filled her lungs whatever it wasnt sammis fault i mean i guess you could still do that she muttered get dad to build you a little picket fence youll just have to move cass in with you so you guys can share him valerie had been backing away from her little stumbling steps her sneakers too white as though shed found bleach and soaked them but now she turned and ran weaving and unsteady heading for the path that led to her place the sound of her wailing eerie and heartbroken sammi sage cried sammi had almost forgotten she was there on her knees in the dirt up against the house sammi look jammed through the slot in the side of the house were fingers the nails torn and bloody deep gouges in the skin phillips fingers chapter cass woke feeling like teeth were working her head from the inside her eyes were gritty and her mouth tasted like the fetid rot in the bottom of a trash can she staggered out of the bed after checking on ruthiea trembling hand pressed to her cheek feeling the warmth and her daughters steady pulse calmed by the sight of her hair tangled and cascading over the pillowand down the stairs skipping the third one from the top the one that squeaked it was already getting late the sun rising in the sky and people would be up in the house cass heard voices from the kitchen and slipped out the back way the damp cold hitting her like a washcloth dipped in ice water she went down to the shore and did her morning routine there she brushed her teeth twice with the kaysev stub spitting over and over again into the river this time she checked the other shore first and there were a few of them there already though they looked sleepy too bumping and stumbling into each other as they got as close to the water as they could they kept up a steady stream of muttering but it wasnt the desperate hungry keening that signaled a hunt cass tested the air with a damp fingersure enough she was downwind and sheltered by the overhanging willow that was coming back into leaf they couldnt see her on another morning cass might watch them for a while taking in the details of the clothes theyd been wearing since before they turned of what was left of their hair it could be a fascinating exercise looking for clues to who theyd beena gold watch that still hung on a bony wrist the remains of a tattoo in the ruin of a bicep a hank of dreadlocks stringing across a filthy scarred scalp a tshirt with a now passé slogan or a skirt with last seasons flared hem but today she didnt care she just didnt care anymore after last nightdear god the boy had looked so terrified his skin already getting the sheen he had to be whattwo days in what had they served two days ago it was a useless exercise since everyone was allowed to visit the pantry freely and help themselves to the snacks the cooking staff left out each day bowls of greens and pans lined with kaysev cookies the hard little nuggets studded with dried berries and sweetened with the syrup made from cooking the juice crushed from kaysev stalks it was just impossible to know especially since the kids liked to spend their free days on north island frequently plucking raw kaysev to avoid coming back and eating at the community table cass understood that remembered how much shed wanted an identity of her own at that age how shed cherished the fleeting moments of freedom when she and her friends could pretend that they never had the homes and parents and lives they were all so desperate to outgrow she knew the kids stole kaysev wine from the pantry that theyd learned how to roll their own cigarettes she even knew where they kept their little weed patch although she hadnt been sure it was the kids and didnt feel right turning it under or trying to catch the gardeners in the act it wasnt her place to judgethat was for damn sure especially now she thought of the little band of new eden kids phillip and colton and kalyan and shane all the girlskyra and sage and especially sammi oh sammi and the thought of her hit cass with a fresh assault of dread and fear and guilt she had to talk to sammi had to explain again how they must never ever eat anything that hadnt been grown on garden island that hadnt been checked and rechecked and prepared by the kitchen staff but how could she get sammi to listen what if cass had had a chance to reach them warn them and had squandered it what if phillip was her fault no no she couldnt do that wouldnt do that it didnt help and god it hurt it hurt so much to wonder about all the ways shed failed and people shed hurt if she indulged that kind of thinking for even a minute shed never get up off her knees in the mud at the edge of the river shed just sink into it until it covered her over and buried her and that wasnt happening not as long as ruthie lived cass splashed her face with water and dried it with the cloth she kept in her kit she squatted to relieve herself the urine splashing into the brackish edge of the river and as she watched the beaters it almost looked like they were trying to copy her crouching and crab walking at the waters edge onlythey werent at the edge of the water they were in it water lapped around their ankles their shins soaking the bottom of their pants stupid beasts their shoes would be ruined waterlogged the skin of their feet would swell and peel and if they werent beaters succumb to rot and gangrene but because of their wretched immunity theyd keep walking even after the skin had sloughed away and they walked on boneends and raw pulped flesh never knowing and never caring something almost sounded like laughter they were playing like children patting at the water with their hands and crowing there was a commotion as they jostled for position going farther and farther into the water until it was up to their chests their underarms they had to be freezing a citizen could last ten maybe fifteen minutes in that water before hypothermia sucked the life from them but a beaterthey were too stupid to stay out of the cold water it would serve them right if they fell facedown dead in the river the water was the only barrier between them and the island and seeing them breaching it spurred a deep almost insensible terror of course they couldnt swim and the wide brown river surged and churned with whirling currents and floating debris and hidden hazards cass was perfectly safe on this side but the dread that accompanied this odd sight was undeniable and complete cass gathered her things she would tell the others would find dana or shannon or neal and let them know as they were supposed to report any beater sighting and especially any behaviors that were out of the ordinary theyd know what to do and cass was more than happy to let the others handle it she was stuffing the cloth back into the little zipped ditty bag that held her collection of toiletries when a startled squawk reached her ears she looked back over the water and saw that two beaters had given a third a shove pushing it into deeper water and were watching it flail water flew and frothed as it gasped for air and flung its arms out wildly cheered by its babbling grinning comrades the current began to carry it slowly spinning on a lazy ride downstream and for a terrifying moment it almost seemed as though it was floating toward the island but of course the river carried its bounty in the center and only when a log or branch jutted into the water would it get snagged and dragged and deposited on a silty bank by then it would be drowned as dead as dead could be sodden and already starting to decompose just another bit of aftertime detritus to be broken down and absorbed back into the earth no longer a danger to anything cass watched it struggle beginning to tire swallowing great gulps of river water but right before she turned to go she saw something that made her pause the beater stopped flailing and paddled for a moment she doubted what she was seeing but the longer she watched the more she became sure of it its hands stroked the water in front of itself a sloppy dog paddle fingers splayed and weak against the current a moment later it sank beneath the surface the water quivering and swirling above where it disappeared for a moment before the current smoothed it over the beater was as good as dead but before it died it had started to teach itself to swim the kids were all fussy as though they had sensed casss mood despite her efforts to cover it up twyla whimpered and sucked her thumb a habit suzanne had been trying to break her of for some time and which she had given cass strict instructions to monitor but today wasnt the day for it and cass let the little girl comfort herself wiping her tearstreaked face gently dane and dirk squabbled and as the morning wore on it got worse dane making a game of snatching away any plaything that caught dirks attention the little boy was enraged screaming and bunching his hands into fists so cass picked him up and walked him around the living room making loops through the kitchen on one of her rotations she came back to find dane holding his hands squeezed tightly together yelling at ruthie she bit me cass ruthie bit me cass sighed and set dirk down next to twyla who was giving play shots to a stuffed dog with a fake plastic syringe then she bent to examine danes hand sure enough there was a perfect angry red imprint of ruthies teeth on the soft flesh of his palm oh ruthie cass said and ruthie shyly picked up the skirt of her play dress and pulled it up over her head a new habit that cass usually found charming were you two fighting dane shrugged and cass saw that he was trying to hide the pile of play money behind him dane was a hoarder and she frequently had to intervene when he took things from the others only to find little stashes here and there around the house piles of doll shoes and board books and spoons she was always at a loss as to how to discipline for this habit the parenting books of before never gave advice about what effect seeing your dad beaten to death trying to defend a water supply or watching your happygolucky neighbor get dragged away by a horde of screaming monsters might have on children and what you could do to help shed tried to talk to ingrid about dane but she didnt believe cass ingrids answer to every parenting problem involved more of her relentless structured activities she suggested cass read a book called red monsters share and discuss it with the children dane theres enough play money for everyone to share she said now digging deep to come up with enough patience to see her through at least until lunch by the time she served the children their tea and jam sandwichesjam made from the nectarines shed grown herselfshe would probably be able to force down a few crackers she always felt better after she got something in her stomach to absorb the churning bile left behind by one of her infrequent allout benders which she never would have had if it hadnt been for no dont dane was looking at her doubtfully groping around behind him trying to push the coins out of her sight theres enough for everyone cass repeated you dont have to keep them all yourself she bit me dane repeated stubbornly biting is not okay and it wasnt of course biting was one of the things that could get a kid thrown out of child care before that and not being current on vaccinations or a failure to potty train all offenses that seemed ridiculously irrelevant now biting is not okay but neither is not sharing cass said through gritted teeth what she really wanted to do was seize all the plastic coins and put them in a box and put the box up on the counter where none of the kids could reach it and keep taking things away from them every time they fussed until they had nothing nothing and maybe that would keep them quiet just long enough for her to get her strength back just long enough to think maybe ruthies got the fever dane said watching her closely a mean little smile at the corner of his mouth cass froze she ground her fingernails into the palms of her hands forcing herself not to react dont you ever say that she finally whispered her own voice sounding strange to herself stripped bare and dragged over coals there must have been something in her tone or expression that finally got through to dane because the smirk left his face and his lower lip wobbled and he looked down at the carpet dont you ever say anything like that dane she repeated because if an adult could accuse who was to say that a child couldnt as well she was nearly positive that phillip had the fever but if more cases popped up there was sure to be hysteria fingerpointing blame there were people in new edenthe weak ones the easily swayed and those with a tenuous grip on realitywho might latch onto an accusation even a groundless one even one that came from a child none of us have the fever we are careful we are healthy before long she managed to distract the boy with a stub of crayon and pages torn from a microwave manual the densely printed instructions were in english spanish japanese but there was plenty of white space which dane and the other kids set to filling in with colorful scribbles at the kitchen table while cass made preparations for lunch long ago cass had practiced affirmations little phrases from a book someone had given her at aa live life on lifes terms faith chases away fear some days they seemed utterly worthless sentimental drivel mindless pleasantries and some days they worked a little i can do this i can do this i can do this cass repeated soundlessly to herself turning away from the children and forming the words on trembling lips it wasnt much of a mantra it lacked imagination and substance worst of all cass seriously doubted whether it was true but she did she got through lunch settling only one disagreement over who got the last of the cookies she managed to eat a few herbed kaysev crackers and the crusts of ruthies sandwich and after cleaning up the kitchen she got all the children to lie down for a nap even dane who was not much of a sleeper these days when she was sure they were all out she lay down between ruthie and dirk thinking she would just close her eyes for a moment perhaps catch fifteen minutes rest before one of the children woke her up but images of the mornings discovery kept her awake bubbles had risen to the surface of the water after the beater went under was it possible that she had imagined the otherthe sudden paddling of its hands the sound of the front door opening yanked cass out of her thoughts she scrambled to her feet and smoothed her clothes there was already enough trouble between her and the other moms without them thinking she wasnt doing her part with the children she picked up the closest bookone of the historical romances suzanne likedand put her finger between the pages so it would look like shed been reading and sat in the recliner ingrid came into the room followed by jay swarmer who headed up the security rotation guarding the bridge and dragging away dead beaters from the shore his presence here in the middle of the day caused an uneasy cramp in casss stomach as for ingrid her onetime friends lips were set in a thin line and twin red spots stood out on her cheeks and she refused to meet casss gaze whats going on cass said quietly getting no answer other than grim looks she set the book down on the coffee table lets talk in the kitchen so we dont wake the kids ill stay with them ingrid said primly she settled herself crosslegged on the floor the long wool skirt she wore draped over her muddy boots cass followed jay wordlessly into the kitchen wondering if she should offer him some of the cold tea left over from the morning theyd all grown accustomed to drinking it cold though the cooks kept a fire going through most of the day the hearth was usually in service for one task or another everything from slowcooking rabbits on a spit to baking flat breads to boiling river water to purify it there was no time for heating tea or leftovers barely even for warming ones hands over the flames but jay spoke before she had a chance this is a hell of a thing cass she was surprised at the approbation in his voice he leaned back against the counter his jeans slung low under a gut that had been slowly disappearing ever since cass had known him no matter how much kaysev a person ate it wasnt enough to make or keep them fat even fat mike was lean these days though the nickname stuck what do you mean jay winced closing his eyes for a moment as if the conversation pained him sammis been to see me cass set a hand on the back of a kitchen chair to support herself as she absorbed this fresh bad news sammi had told despite casss deep anguish over hurting dors daughter she had never considered that sammi would want revenge against her but of course cass would be much easier to hurt than her father their affair didnt go against any of new edens covenants and there were those who might even admire him for keeping a couple of women in playbut cass had trouble fitting into new eden from the start and this would only make people that much more reluctant to befriend her she told us all about it how shed had her suspicions about how people were talking somehow the knowledge that sammi suspected the affair troubled cass even more would that have been enoughwould knowing that they were hurting her have been enough to make them stop cass hoped the answer was yes but there would be no way to know now look i know we messed up but i never meant to to hurt anyone we just it was private it we jays gray eyebrows thick and untrimmed knitted together in consternation whos we they stared at each other for several seconds cass spinning possible scenarios wildly through her mind i am talking about your drinking cass if theres other folksi mean the issues judgment if theres partying going on people who need to keep their wits about them to do their job when it affects all of uslook were not trying to go on a witch hunt here jay wiped a callused hand across his forehead the only reason it was agreed we needed to do something was first of all the mistake thats got a boy down in the quarantine house if your little problem made you careless then hell yeah i think its community business and at the very least we need to think about taking you off the harvest detail but as ingrid pointed out and ive got to say i agree with her leaving you in charge of the kids when youre high as a kite aint much better i mean i know i wont have an argument from you when i say theyre our most precious resource right these little ones throughout his speech cass was trying to keep up trying to assimilate what jay was saying why hadnt sammi said anything about what shed seen on the dock but the answer hit her with blinding clarity because it wasnt enough to hurt her not in a big enough way by revealing her drinking the girl could hit her on every level that matteredcalling into question her commitment her competence even the wisdom of letting her have a role in the childrens lives of course there was one secret sammi still hadnt shared if she ever told the others that cass had been attacked and infected that would be a sure way to stir up so much trouble that cass could get thrown out of new eden cass wasnt the only beater victim ever to recover but no one in new eden had seen such a survivor before and with tensions running high there was no guarantee theyd listen when cass offered up frantic selfserving explanations that she was no threat to anyone nor was ruthie but i love the children she mumbled on the verge of tears you cant think that i dont aw hell jay said his shoulders slumping forward and she realized that he had been hoping he was wrong he was a good man a family man with no family anymore an associate dean at sacramento state with no one to ride herd on and he had the broken capillaries and red nose that signaled that he too had once known his way around a bottle i hate this cass lord knows i dont have any beef with you but theres too much at stake im here to ask you to resign from child care and picking both you can stay on gardeningi dont think youll get any argument for that everyone knows youre the best with the growing and thats enough for anyonehell theres lots of folks that dont get a fraction of that done we got ingrid we got suzanne we got jasmine ready to pop maybe we can get another of the gals to pitch in with the little ones valerie maybe shed be good his words cut deep she understood why he said itvalerie would have been a great mother her patience her soothing voice they were perfect maybe she said bleakly but it was a lie because the day that valerie was responsible for ruthies care would be the day cass had failed utterly her daughter had been taken from her twice before when other people decided cass wasnt a fit mother she couldnt let it happen again or i dont knowmaybe i could take ruthie in the field with me when i work let me think okay just give me a day to think about it jay sighed and folded his hands over his gut you could see in the gesture the shadow of what he had once been a paunchy proud cheerful man thats fine i dont want to take this up with the council in any official way you know what i mean that wouldnt serve anybody just hey ingrids a little sore with you right now he hooked a thumb in the direction of the living room lets let her finish out the day with the kids maybe you go for a walk talk to a friend whatever you feel like an afternoon off looks like the weathers breaking maybe well get a little more sun everythingll look different by tonight yeah okay cass said she saw him to the door and they said an oddly formal goodbye jay giving her a little half bow before he walked off toward the guard headquarters hed been right about the weather a thick cloud scudded across the sun and was quickly gone leaving the air warm and inviting she should do as he suggested take that walk maybe go to the far southern end of garden island where you could sit and stare off at the mountains in the distance skip stones into the river but she didnt think she could bear to look across all those rows and rows of kaysev the chubby deep green leaves hiding a secret killer somewhere in their midst and she couldnt leave ruthie here not with ingrid she wouldnt risk losing her daughter ever again she made her decision she went into the living room ingrid stood with her arms folded glaring but cass did not look away there was so much she wanted to say but instead she tamped down her anger as she picked up ruthie from her pallet of blankets and carried her into the remains of a day in which yet again everything had changed chapter smoke opened his eyes when it was quiet in the room closed them when the people came in he worked his hands under the blanket flexed his limbs tensed his muscles always going slack and still at the slightest sound he was careful because he knew the people were waiting for him to wake up what would happen then he did not know there were people who wanted him dead who wanted him to suffer the great irony was that smoke did deserve to be punished but only one other man left on this earth knew the true reason and who knew if he was even still alive it was smokes burden to know what he had done and to be alone in that knowing they could punish him for the lives he had taken for the rebuilder leaders he had killed and smoke would laughfighting the fascist warlords was only a tiny penance for his true crime for that secret crime they could send in one rebuilder after another and he would keep killing them until he was exhausted from the effort until he could no longer lift his blade or his gun and he would never regret all the blood that got spilled in that battle he had right on his side because the battle against the rebuilders was a battle for freedom and for hope but for his other crime his first crime he had no justification and no defense this was a strange prison where people came and went freely and he was not shackled and security was lax a terrible miscalculation on their part if they knew anything at all about him surely they would know hed bide his time and he would wait for the right moment each day smoke let the thin gruel dribble down his face swallowing just enough to survive so too with the water held to his lips and he felt his strength returning soon he was able to leave his bed at night to stand at the window looking out on a moonlit yard not long after that he was marching in place doing simple calisthenics returning to bed only when he was exhausted his body was not the same he was missing two fingers the flesh raggedly healed at the first knuckle where the little and ring fingers of his left hand used to be the skin of his face was crossed with scars he could not see his arms his torso his legs with scars that he could there was a persistent ache in one arm and in his hip his abbreviated walks around the room were hampered by a painful limp each night he pushed himself each dawn his body screamed in pain at the effort and each day he grew stronger emboldened by his success he took to working his hands during the day squeezing them into fists getting used to the odd absence of the severed fingers he flexed his limbs bent and extended them worked as though his life depended on it one day soon they would come for him they would not expect a fightbut a fight was what he meant to give them chapter ruthie barely stirred so cass settled her into the stroller they kept under the eaves of the house it was a nice one an italian model that navigated even the stony paths along the water without getting its wheels jammed but it didnt get much use now that the younger kids preferred to walk nearly everywhere she tucked a sweatshirt around ruthie draping it over her head to keep her warm and set out along the path to her herb garden when she heard gunshots two in rapid succession then another a few seconds later shouting followed not just one or two voices but half a dozen or more cass hesitated wondering what the latest calamity could be glynnis and john routinely picked off beaters on the shore when they patrolled the river but they lined up their shots carefully deliberately taking their time so as not to waste ammo in the end her curiosity won out and she turned the stroller toward the community center where people would know what was happening as she drew close she saw a knot of people on the edge of the lawn looking toward the water shielding their eyes against the sun on the opposite shore were beaters dozens of them how theyd managed to assemble so quickly since cass was last outsideonly a couple of hours ago when she took the little ones for a walk over to the drying house to watch corryn and chevelle lay out the metal pans of hardtackshe had no idea now they lined the bank for a hundred yards in either direction and from the distance if you squinted they could be spectators at a game shoppers at a department store except for their jerking awkward movements cass nervously ran her fingers over the sunbrowned skin of her forearms a habit left over from when her arms were covered with ragged scars but her torn skin had scabbed over and fully healed from her time asone of them early on after recovering the fear of what she might have donewhether shed joined a pack of the things whether shed hunted or even god help her feastedcontinually worked on her mind and her touch on the wounds brought the pain that she needed to distract herself these daysmostlyshe kept those fears at bay but looking at the things separated only by the river the old terror nagged at her and now she had a new concern a fresh terror that sammi her fury stoked by what shed seen would tell the others that cass and ruthie had survived infection it was dangerous information sure to stir up distrust and anger in the community but how far would the girl go to punish cass beyond the ragtag crowd in the fields studded with drifts of kaysev more approached in groups of three and four and in some cases more cass could only guess where they had come fromthere were more than could be accounted for from the usual nesting spots the raiders had mapped in the area were the wretched creatures somehow responding to a signal that citizens could not pick up on an instinctual awakening that drew them inexorably here in this moment since the early days of the fever when the first beaters cast off their humanity to follow their terrible hungers they had been drawn to population centers they preferred towns to farmland cities to towns of course at first many people believed that safety could be found in the most densely populated areas so they set out for urban settings in the heightened security of the new century every highrise featured antiterrorism barricades and could function as their own ecosystems for a short period most had backup power sources and filtration systems that could sustain citizens at least a few weeks while they modified the buildings to serve as shelters for the new grim reality the terrible fallacy of this assumption emerged slowly last summer citizens flocked to the cities by whatever means availableby the carload when gas could be found and the streets were clear on foot when not through an unseasonably warm and sundappled autumn those who stayed outside the city limits wondered if theyd made the wrong choice but as time went on the other citizens never returned and the cities remained dark and so one conclusion was generally drawn by those outside the fever thrived in the population centers infection spreading geometrically among those who lived close together until the skyline became a treacherous maw teeming with hungry beaters dor crafty and careful inside the box probably sent his patrols to get a visual confirmation of this cass suspected hed never said as much but that would be like himhe would want to know himself but not wish to inflict debilitating proof of the worlds end on others if he could avoid it though dor kept his own counsel others did not january had brought a few refugees from what sacramento had become their stories confirmed that the cities were lost taken over by swarms of maddened beaters nesting in office buildings in shops in public housing and luxury town houses restaurants and museums and parking garages were full of them the beaters were not above feeding on each other though they didnt seem to like it of late refugees passing by new eden reported that the creatures had begun to starve inside the cities imparting to listeners the most horrifying tableau of gaunt bony beaters in the later stages of the disease kneeling over recently fallen others feeding on their slack and waxy skin before seeming to lose interest and lying down next to them to die there was not enough to feed even these voracious implacable monsters had the beaters finally sucked all the sustenance out of the cities and returned to the countryside to hunt if so new eden would be a ready target with its seventysome citizens living out in the open where they could easily be observed and smelled and heard all that separated them was the perfect barrier of the river no one had ever expected the beaters to learn to cross it as a shocked murmur went up from the crowd cass knew that she wasnt the only one thinking that if they somehow took to the water new eden would be lost there was another gunshot and another cass pressed forward pushing the stroller through the crowd muttering apologies when she got near the front of the throng she wheeled the stroller around so that it was behind her and elbowed her way through two canoes floated in the current halfway between island and shore it was too far across the wide rapidly flowing expanse of water on this side of the island to reliably hit a beater from the shore even with a deer rifle which was why they patrolled from the middle of the river john steadied one canoe expertly paddle skimming the surface while glynnis sighted down her shotgun she alone of the security staff preferred to use a shotgun shed learned to hunt with her father and until last year had gone up to canada every year when the season opened now she hunted beaters in the other canoe neal struggled to keep the prow pointed at the opposite shore parker one of the younger security guys knelt clumsily in the front trying to reload but the crafts rocking made it difficult goddamn it a low voice said next to cass dor she turned to him instinctively resisting throwing herself into his arms suddenly flooded with the fear and tension that had reemerged with these things she couldnt give in to the urge not here not after what had happened with sammi and jay whats happening whats happening is this is what we get for not training more people on the watercraft dor snapped look at that look at that theyre likely to drown themselves before they get a shot off maybe even lose a rifle or two i told them he bit off his words and fell silent anger radiating off his tense rigid body do you know how to handle a canoe yeah me and nathanweve taken them out half a dozen times i mean im nowhere near what john can do but i could for damn sure keep the fucking boat pointed in the right direction fuck wheres nathan now went out this morning after i decided to stay back and look for sammi i doubt he even knows whats happening because he was going to try going down toward clifton i told him not to go alone but but nathan was another renegade just like dor hed mentioned sammi cass looked back at ruthie for a second did she find you or valerie yeah yeah i talked to val sammis over in the community center with the other kids earls told them to stay put there until we get this under control so sammi was safe for the moment at least by dors grim expression cass had to assume the reunion hadnt gone well which wasnt surprising but why are neal and parker even out there i mean the beaters are bound to wander off eventually they always do even as she said it cass realized that what she meant was that they always hadthere was a difference cass theyre only shooting the ones that get in the water trying to conserve ammo dor pointed down the river and only then did cass notice the gray lumps being carried downstream drifting lazily in gentle spins in the current they looked like logs or bags of trash but they were dead beaters the ones that get in the water you mean theyre trying to swim not a questioncass suddenly knew it beyond a doubt shed seen one try for the first time only this morning but that didnt mean that they hadnt been working up to it for a while they were gifted mimics for beasts that seemed insensate much of the time they often echoed each others movements and sounds at times it seemed like they made a game of it a primitive simon says but when one considered that this was how they learned it was both awesome and terrifying yeah and some of them are coming too damn close and theyre watching each other see theyre trying to figure out how to stay afloat the ones glynnis and parker took out they were paddling like dogsnothing pretty and with a lot of wasted motion lots of splashing but you can bet the rest of them noticed that they managed to stay above water for a few seconds before they went down just then a barking wail went up at the far right edge of the crowd of beaters past neals canoe a knot of them pushed forward the momentum of their bodies propelling a stocky one into the water it was recently turned with a nearly full head of dark hair and most of its face intact a womans face cass could guess through the leering and the pus and excited babbling a final shove sent it stumbling into the water where it wobbled and abruptly sat down it screamed high and shrill when the water rose up to its armpits and splashed with its hands making wide arcs in the canoe parker was trying to aim over neals shoulder as he dug deep into the current forcing the canoe around he fired and one of the beaters on the shore squawked and pitched forward facedown into the muddy bank the others tripping over it and stepping on its limbs for a moment cass had a vision of the torn bodies clogging the river a peninsula of broken flesh permitting them to cross to her and ruthie the one in the water had rolled onto its front and began splashing its way toward the canoe the water went farther up its body until it went under only the top of its head visible black curls floating and after a moment it came up sputtering and coughing it flailed and slapped at the water and went under a few times but then it seemed to establish a rhythman inefficient and clumsy one for sure but enough to keep it from drowning yelling from the people in the boats and the people onshore competed with the beaters cries parker fired again but the shot went wide cutting the water harmlessly and the beater bobbed and splashed closer neal twisted his body in the canoe trying to get out of the way parker shouted something that cass couldnt make out over the din of the crowd but as he turned back around and aimed at the paddling beaterit was a cantmissshot only ten feetneal plunged the paddle deep into the water and spun the canoe hed exerted too much force and the canoe dipped far to the left parkers shot missed unbelievably landing somewhere in the inky water and as neal tried to correct the canoe lurched the other way and the two men scrambled for balance and cass sucked in her breath and swore she could feel it too when the canoe went over and both of them were dumped into the icy water screaming rent the air as john turned his own canoe toward the upended one glynnis took a knee and fired without seeming to aim at all and there was a burst of blood from the swimming beater the side of its head shredded and running with crimson the crowd called to the men in the water to hurry hurry hurry and then there was a splashing commotion in the water that took cass away to long ago with her dad when he took her fishing on lake don pedro hed borrowed a friends gear and they didnt catch a thing all day but as the sun climbed in the sky and cass got sleepy and leaned against her dad her tummy full of peanutbutter sandwiches her dads flannel shirt smelling pleasantly of coffee and tobacco a bird had swooped down to the water and hooked its talons into a sizable fish but the prey was too large to be carried off so easily the bird screamed and fought the mute desperate fish they flailed for their lives the water frothed by the fishs body slapping the surface of the lake and the birds wings beating at it and they spun and fought until their bodies blurred together and cass hid her face in her fathers shirt and cried until it was all over until the bird finally gave up and flew limpwinged away and the fish sank to the depths torn up but free to die it seized parker and sank its teeth into his neck parker screamed and fought but the bleeding creature held tight glynnis shot parker first a neat hole appeared in his forehead and he went still when she fired again the beater stopped flailing but it never let go and the pair sank below the water locked in their deadly embrace there was a shocked silence only glynniss voice never stopped as she yelled at john to turn around this is a goddamn train wreck dor muttered cass weve got to take out the boat ill row you shoot i cant cass said horrified i have ruthie leave her with the others it wont be for long its already getting dark dor panic sparked pain behind her eyes how could she tell him how they all hated her how no one trusted her who would be willing to help her now but as he looked deeply into her eyes whatever he was about to say died on his lips somehow he understoodnot the specifics but the shape of her fear okay he said okay then leave her with sammi tell her i said she should watch ruthie until we get back shes just inside the hall ill go grab my gun and meet you right back here in a few minutes butsomeone else cant you get someone else cass his voice exploded so loud and desperate that people turned to stare at him there isnt anyone else i dont know who can handle a boat and im not willing to take chances right now if we dont act fast those things might get bold and try to swarm andwho else is going to shoot with me dor was a rogue a renegade and he knew it knew how he had squandered the others trust to pursue his own hellbent pastimes in that moment cass finally understood how ill suited he was to new eden how much he must hate the collaborative government the council with its endless deliberations the constant hedging and search for concordanceit must have been torture for dor to try to find his place here no wonder he left the islands when he could no wonder he took the bruteforce jobs that left his mind free to stew and boil dana harris nealnone of them liked dor none of them had ever asked him to serve on a committee or take part in a planning session they were content for him to do the menial labor that kept him occupied and uninvolved it was true none of them would shoot with dorbecause none of them would take direction from him go dor said and then he bent in close and brushed his lips against hersonce and then a second time he lingered and it was not so much a kiss as a demand a promise an acknowledging of the need they never spoke of and his mouth on hers was hot and hard and bruising cass broke away and rushed toward the hall pushing the stroller in front of her it jounced over a root and ruthie woke and began to wail and cass pulled her from the stroller abandoning the thing in the middle of the yard and ran the rest of the way she was putting her daughter in danger once again trusting her to someone elses care once again what kind of mother set her child aside to go on a suicide mission casscass was that kind of mother shed risked ruthie for the bottle shed risked her for a moments pleasure in the sun for stolen moments of desperate passion and now she was risking her to plunge headlong into a mission that was bound to get her and dor killed a mission no one was asking her to undertake on behalf of a community of people who hated her if by some miracle she saved anyone they would never thank her but she had no choice because if she did nothing again then she didnt deserve to be anyones mother anyones guardian not in these times not in what the world had become chapter inside the hall she blinked and paused her eyes adjusting to the dim interior therenear the window all of them clustered on the long couches the boys in the front the girls huddled behind them sammi cass called her name already running toward her when the girl turned cass saw not the hatred she expected not the bitterness and rejectionbut pure terror it was written on all of their young faces and cass knew that they had seen the swimming and the upending of the canoe parker going down and the beater and glynniss two killing shots please i need you to take care of ruthie she said out of breath just for a little while your dad and me we have to help she kissed ruthieboth cheeks her forehead her eyelids mama ruthie whimpered mama needs to go help dor you stay with sammi and be a good girl hear and ill be right back i promise i promise should we come one of the boys saidkalyan the reckless one do they need us right now they need you to stay here she said as calmly as she could someone will come soon to tell you whats going on sammi held her hands out for ruthie who snuggled into her arms as cass turned away and ran she passed the stroller in the yard pitched sideways with one wheel lodged in a divot in the earth shes fine shes fine shes fine shes fine she told herself sammi would keep her safe sammi might hate cass but no one could hate ruthie no one could hate her beautiful baby girl ruthie was innocent ruthie had never hurt anyone it was just her terrible bad luck to be born into this world this time and no matter if sammi told everyone in the world that cass had suffered the fever and somehow gotten better she knew now that the girl would never reveal that ruthie had too the crowd near the shore had grownit looked like every edenite was there cass scanned the crowd and found dor near the front he held the glock against his leg and in his other hand was a gun cass didnt recognize a small steel semiauto she hadnt fired a gun since coming to the delta the last time had been during their escape from the rebuilders and her last kill had been a citizen not a beater something only dor and sammi and the girls theyd rescued from colima knew something she had hoped to put behind her and never ever let ruthie find out but already her fingertips thrummed and twitched to touch the cold steel her palm was ready to wrap around the grip i am a killer cass thought and the thought made her neither happy nor sad only ready dor was standing near the edge talking to neal who had made it back to the shore someone had given him a blanket and he was standing wrapped in it and shivering his lips blue the overturned canoe hadnt traveled far downstream and cass saw the reason for this small stroke of luckit had snagged on a tree that had fallen on the opposite bank but the current tugged at it and there was no telling how long it would hold there were other boatshalf a dozen skiffs and aluminum rowboats all stored on the other side of the island in typical new eden fashion they were secured and cleaned and well maintained and hardly ever used everyone used the onelane bridgewell tended and even better guardedif they wanted to get to the mainland besides there was little sport to be had from floating downstream or fighting the current on the way back glynnis and john preferred the canoes to the other craft for their maneuverability and the two of them had been able to handle the mostly unnecessary duty of shore patrol by themselves when they werent working the canoes were simply stored on the grassy banks having two had seemed like a great backup plan but the second had never been needed until now a woman took neals arm and led him away talking to him softly i need someone to swim out and get the canoe dor said his deep voice carrying over the crowd well need both of them everyone stared at him making way for cass to pass and she joined him at his side she began strapping on the hip holster hed brought there was murmuring and then voicesangry voicesbegan to be heard why dont you swim out someones gone for the rowboats howd you get those weapons i said i need someone to swim out whoever goes will be too cold and exhausted to also paddle effectively after dor yelled silencing them before we lose more peoplelook out there do you see theyre still coming cass turned along with the crowdit was true the beaters had to number close to a hundred now their milling and jostling making it hard to count the sun had sunk nearly to the horizon illuminating them from behind outlining their ghastly silhouettes glynnis and john were upstream picking off a clump that had ventured ankledeep into the water all along the shoreline now dead beaters bobbed gently bumping up against the bank in several places the mud was red with blood directly across from them a beater had gone down but was not yet dead glynnis must have missed the spinal shot and it twitched and spasmed two of its closest companions grabbed its hands and legs and dragged it up onto the bank up the incline depositing it on dry land while others looked on for a moment cass thought she was seeing some sort of new ritual honoring the fallen but then several of them bent over the dying thing and began to bite it tearing off shreds of skin and crowing the way they always did when they ate blood poured from the downed body and it twitched harder they were usually unenthusiastic about feeding on each other once finally dead but something about the death throes apparently made the prospect more appealing and it was not uncommon to see them devouring their wounded oh god someone said nearby im gonna throw up this is ridiculous they cant keep this up forever cass didnt know if the speaker meant the edenites or the beaters but she knew that dor was losing them they wouldnt listen to him they held him in contempt and things were only getting worse here please she yelled please someone get the canoe id do it but dor needs me to shoot getting in that waterll kill you a woman said its got to be forty degrees do you know how long i know cass turned on her furious i know it its a risk but do you just want to stand here and wait for them to come get us look neal made it he didnt have to go as far its true and we need a strong swimmer you go an angry female voice said ill shoot ill go with dor everyone turned to see who spoke it was valerie incredibly since the voice sounded nothing like hers she stood off to the side of the crowd her face knotted in fury her hair released from its band tumbling around her shoulders shed forsaken her pendleton jacket and skirt for a pair of tight black pants and a mans coat and her hands were bare clenched into fists do you even know how to shoot someone demanded how hard can it be she screamed her eyes drilled into cass glinting with fury and cass noticed for the first time that valerie was actually quite beautiful with her dark features and pale skin her arched brows and long neck if she can do it i can this is not the time dor said his voice hard he had lowered his tone but in the hush of the shocked assembly it carried just fine roger you go dor turned his back on valerie and cass whod been watching the other woman saw her deflate saw the fight leave her when she realized her desperate gamble had failed valerie had been willing to sacrifice everythingher life his the lives of everyone in new edenjust to force him to acknowledge her to claim her and love her but there was no more time for that roger taugher was staring at the canoe trying to gauge whether he could make it he was in his twenties strong a former soccer player who often led pickup games in the yard and entertained the little kids with tricks with the ball ruthie adored him he started to tug off his jacket and kicked off his boots youll freeze the young woman next to him protested clothesll just slow him down dor said everyone else give him room the minute he gets back with the canoe you all take him to get warmcass and i will head out im almost out of ammo glynnis called as they paddled toward a group that was splashing farther downriver dana go to the storehouse bring back the box of gauge shells glynnis uses the browning but shes good with a handgun too so bring one dont forget extra ammo for that take someone with youhank you go hank nodded but dana hesitated staring at dor with a mixture of contempt and anger look dor we need to consideryou cant just what the fuck do you think im doing dana if i let you all take charge youll still be deliberating while the rest of us are being dragged off now are you going to go or do i need to take the keys off you myself for a moment it seemed like dana was going to refuse but he looked around the assembled crowd and seemed to sense what cass did what the rest of them dida turning of the tide of sympathies she knew that few people liked either of them herself or dor especially after sammis revelation and valeries outburst but they also knew that dor could lead them roger was down to his long underwear and he threw himself into the river and came up already stroking powerfully toward the canoe this was the easy part since the current was in his favor a gasp went up from the crowd which turned to watch him get the shit dana earl said id go myself but im too slow hank clapped a hand on danas shoulder and they took off at a brisk jog toward the sheds earl can you coordinate getting the other boats dor ticked off on his hand get the bronco from the shed hook it up to the trailer sharon elsa can you give him a hand the two women who ran the auto shop nodded drive right across the yard dont bother to take the road dont forget oars when dana and hank get back dor searched the crowd his gaze falling on harris the quietest member of the council harris you need to take charge of arming people okay you can do that good candidates would be terrence shel fat mike do not give a weapon to anyone without experience do you hear me thats important its worse to have them in the wrong hands than to leave them unarmed harris nodded i got it good i doubt youll be able to get all that coordinated by dusk and with any luck theyll be gone by then but this isnt wasted because were going to be ready in the morning and i have a feeling well need to be roger reached the canoe and was struggling with the branch sharon and elsa ran in the direction of the auto garage harris moved among the crowd assembling his shooters everyone else focused on roger he got the canoe unhooked with little trouble but as soon as he started dragging it back toward shore it was clear that he was in trouble he sidestroked with only one hand free kicking hard against the current but the canoe dragged in the water and slowed him down go roger a man said near cass another man repeated it and then they were all saying it quietly though the struggling man could not possibly hear them cass felt their energy their frantic hope the sun slipped a little lower in the sky and orange brilliance shone along the horizon the last gasp of the day in an hour the sky would be velvety dark blue and the beaters would not be able to see their tiny pupils altered by the fever so that they were no longer able to expand would not let in enough light for them to make out rough shapes much less details if they could hold off this wave until then roger paused his hand on the lip of the canoe and treaded water for a moment cass saw him gasping for breath for a moment he went still and was it her imagination or was he sinking down down under the water damn it his girlfriend exclaimed do something dont you see he cant make it someone do something save him cass wasnt the only one to turn to dor he was deliberating his jaw pulsing the way it always did when he focused on a problem you could send someone else in for him and lose two men dor answered quietly their conversation was not meant for anyone else to hear valerie was as good as forgotten in the moment and cass saw that she knew it her face blanched the shade of parchment defeat contorted her fine frail beauty and she turned away rogers our best swimmer dor continued reaching for casss hand she didnt think he was even aware of touching her and in that moment she understood she was his mooring the source of his steady courage no one else could have gotten as far as he has no one else could bring him back inthats what he was saying around him the voices had turned imploringroger go you can do itbut when his girlfriend screamed his name again he finally shook the water from his eyes and resumed his weak strokes the canoe came closer only a matter of inches but closer this is taking too long dor muttered cass looked where he was looking saw glynnis pat her jacket frantically for more ammo knew she wasnt finding it saw john using his paddle less accurately now his arms shiveringthey had to be in excruciating pain his muscles in revolt roger cried out a guttural almost inhuman sound of desperation he flung out his arm on the water and stroked again and again he drew himself painfully against the drag of the water and he came closer you can do it the crowd screamed roger roger come on just a little farther when he was ten yards out people threw themselves into the water half a dozen of them women and men some of them linking arms they splashed and yelped at the cold and hands grasped the canoe and others cradled roger who seemed to slip into unconsciousness his eyes rolling back in his head and cass knew she could not spend one more moment worrying about himshe had to give all her attention to the canoe which was being handed along the row of people in the water it was dragged up on the shore tugged onto the hardpacked mud get in get in cassill push us off she didnt hesitate but stepped nimbly over the prow feeling the canoe bottom grind against the silty bank then steadying herself as it listed sharply dors strong hands gripped the edges to steady it and then others did too there was shouting from the path hank and dana ran toward them dana looking as though he was about to have a stroke his face beetred and his fine hair waving in the breeze they were carrying the boxes of ammunition half a dozen guns dor released the canoe and ran to meet them taking armfuls of weapons he was back in seconds but the panicked swell of cries from the crowd told cass they were running out of time across the river emboldened now that glynnis had stopped shooting more of the beaters were taking to the river fifteen of them maybe in twos and threes they waded and shuffled and stumbled into the water plunged forward went under came up gasping and shrieking john and glynnis had retreated ten feet or so but the crush of beaters in the water made their craft look impossibly vulnerable dor swung his body into the canoe and jammed his oar into the shallow water pushing them away from the shore a dozen hands seized the canoe walls and when they were free of the land it felt for a second as if they were weightless suspended in air in nothingand then the current found them and tugged and dor dipped his oar into the water and they were off their speed belied the fact that dor was far more powerful than john his navigation skills were not as precise but he was heading them straight for the other shore and cass knew that accuracy was not his goal get thethat one he yelled that ditty bag its got the shells when i pull up close get them in their canoe but cassmake sure you dont miss we only get one shot she carefully reached for the weapons aware of how easy it would be to tip over if they did all was lost but the canoe glided on closer she could make out individual beaters cries and then john talking steadily intently slurring she caught the words hold on and brave and saw that glynniss head was bowed and her eyes closed as though she was praying so focused was john that when dor shouted his name he startled glancing wildly around his eyes going wide when he saw them utter looselimbed exhaustion radiated from his body and steam rose off his back he stared dumbly at dor were coming in dor yelled weve got the shells a hundred hundredfifty rounds and the i dont know what there is in the way of ammo enough to make this a fair fight anyway cass held the ditty bag felt its weight in her hands past john and glynnis she saw a beater sink into the water up to its chin and ears like a beaver or an otter it churned the water in front of it and then she realized that its feet were not touching the bottom it was keeping itself afloatswimmingand it was coming closer oh god she said softly i see it dor muttered through gritted teeth dont say anything until you get this shit safely in their boat i mean it cass knowing cant help them if cass alerted john and glynnis of the approaching beater they might panicrock the canoe too far miss when cass tossed the weaponsand then they wouldnt stand a chance against it thats what dor was saying cass nodded grimly be ready be ready she whispered and her eyes locked on glynniss five yards threeit was like softball twenty years ago when she played on the u team waiting in the dugout for her team to bat and then the canoes pulled even cass held the bag aloft with trembling hands and glynnis reached her hands closed on the bag tugged and then she had it and cass seized the and held it out by the barrel and glynnis took that too and then it was only a matter of the extra magazines and cass lifted them from the bottom of the boat and what the hell john roared turning as the beater caught up with the canoe and slapped at it with desperate hands it was close enough that cass could see that it was recently turned only the hair along its hairline had been pulled out of its scalp and its face was still recognizable barely bruised or lacerated the face of a young man the fresh wounds on its forearms were very much like those shed found on herself when she woke in the field she shivered with the realization that she could be among this throng or one like it if she hadnt recovered from the fever she could be one of these singleminded things throwing itself into the water driven by flesh hunger who knew what things she had done her attention jerked back with the thudding sound of john bringing an oar blade down on the beaters head but by the second blow the thing had already slipped below the surface and the oar slapped harmlessly on the water splashing him and glynnis instead the canoe was slammed from the bottom the beater trying to claw its way back to the surface it popped up a second later its wet greasy head dripping cold water its hands paddling air then its scrabbling fingers found the lip of the canoe and gave a yank glynnis screamed and an answering roar came from the far shore all the people of new eden helpless to do anything but watch cass cried out too but no sound came from her her throat was sealed with terror her body frozen the gun fell from her shaking hands it hit the water with a little splash and was gone heavy metal sinking indifferently into the depths oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god cass gasped watching the gun disappear she had failed she had allowed the old fears to drift up from the place where she had banished them and the fears had made her clumsy she had failed john and glynnis and she had failed dor and the pain of her failure burst through her body it doesnt matter dor shouted at her his hand reaching for hers his touch was warm even in the frigid air he was warm all determination and life and she responded snapped back to attention and forced herself to forget about the lost gun john slammed the butt of the oars handle directly onto the things disfigured hand over and over so hard that the canoe shuddered and the air was filled with the sickening sound of bones splintering and still it hung on miraculously the canoe had not dipped below the waters surface though it rocked dangerously back and forth as the beater hauled and tugged the water behind it churned and boiled rounded shapes rising above the water heads more of themthree or four more had swum nearly to the boat an explosion split the air only inches away and cass snapped her head around glynnis was crouched in the boat she must have pressed the muzzle of her gun directly to the beaters head because its blood covered the side of the canoe her pants the seat everythingand its skull as it slipped below the surface for the last time was cratered and broken another shot another and another and glynnis barely paused even when brain matter slapped wetly against the hull even when another of the infected hooked a bony hand over the side like the first one and when john smashed it with the heavy oar a skinned and crusted finger splitting off into the boat more and more and then the shots ceased and there was silencesudden shocking silence and the smell of the shooting acrid in casss nostrils she coughed almost delicately touching her mouth as though assuring herself that she had survived the shootout that she still lived you go down well go upriver dor yelled already dipping his oar in the water to pull them against the current john only nodded exhausted and laid his oar across his knees and bowed his head a few seconds respite while they drifted downstream glynnis didnt stop she dug in the ditty bag and lined up her extra shells on the metal bench there was no more time to worry about them get me in closer cass urged dor im not that good she might be able to hit a target from where they were but she might not and there were too many of them youre no good to anyone if they get to us dor said but he arced the craft around and headed to the shore so dont get me that close get me you know medium close cass was sure she saw his lips curve only for a second dear god hed smiled in the midst of this madness wearing the blood of beaters shed made a joke unconsciously and hed found a reason to be amused dor was strong when no one else was dor burned bright with life with vitality even when people and hopeswhen the world itselfdisintegrated around him cass reached for him touched her fingers to his wrist he looked at her questioningly god be with us she said for a moment he just looked back at her his eyes shining the blue of ceylon sapphires i dont believe in god he said barely more than a whisper then believe in me they werent the words she meant to say werent words she was aware of thinking but suddenly they were the plea that powered what she could do next that gave her the strength and the courage to brace herself with a knee jammed against the cold metal canoe wall to hold the gun in two hands the way her daddy taught her to line up the beaters throat in the sights and to pull the trigger a starburst of blood and the beast shuddered for a second and then crumpled to the muddy bank but cass was already lining up her next shot and her next some she missed most she hit her arm went numb from the recoil and she had to stop and reload and dor said things to her and she held on to the sound of his voice even though somehow shed lost the ability to comprehend what words came out and her teeth rattled and clacked against each other and still she kept shooting dor kept them to the shore going down the line of beaters assembled there and when they reached the huddled end it seemed that the crowd had thinned cass rested her gun against her knee feeling her muscles stretched taut and painfully cramped and twisted in her seat beyond the scattered bodies she could see the rest retreating limping away in twos and threes a whole line of them at the downstream end where john and glynniss canoe turned lazily in the water this too was terrifying however a retreat was evidence of forethought amid their insatiable drive of consensual thinking of responding to events no doubt the beaters had learned things tonight that would change their strategy tomorrow when they returneda fact cass was certain of theyd be back as soon as daylight allowed were heading to shore johns voice weakened and hollow reached them as though over a divide far greater than the water cass watched him dip his oar into the water painfully slowly and then their own canoe turned and headed for home dors strokes sure and strong undiminished by the effort he had made the effort they had made together a team cass had only worked like this with one other man in her life and that was smoke only once before had she been completely united in purpose as she had been with dor tonight each protecting the other each reading the others thoughts the sum of them stronger than they could ever be on their own with dor there was a hyperawareness of each others bodies almost an anticipation of their movements creating a total economy of motion nothing wasted working to each others strengths the shore loomed solid and welcoming lined with the people of new eden all of them shouting and crying and hugging each other and then the crowd thinned slightly and cass saw a figure limping slowly across the yard all alone hobbled over a stick pain evident in every step she was vaguely aware of the people calling her name as the canoe was dragged up onto the bank the warmth of dors hand on hers as he helped her up the solid ground beneath her numb feet she was aware of all these things but they were not real and they were not true not the way the man walking toward her as though he might die on the journeythe way he was real and true smoke saw her and his eyes found hers and held on and all the other sounds disappeared and all the other people disappeared and all there was was her and him and he lifted his hand he held it out to her and then he fell crashing down on the hardpacked earth of the island that he had never walked in all the time since he arrived in new eden all the time between sleeping and waking and every lost moment that lay between smoke fell cass ran chapter how could she have given up on him the minute she looked into smokes eyes saw him trying to say her name as steves strong hands helped him sit up she knew what a terrible mistake shed made leaving him alone in that place untended all because of fear she hadnt been strong enough for him are you he was struggling to speak his vocal cords rusty from a lack of use he cleared his throat and tried again are you all right cass me im fine oh sweetheart im perfectly fine but youim so sorry i havent been coming have theyhurt you he pushed weakly against steve trying to break free of his grasp no no no no she said realization dawning on her no one had told him where he was no one had explained smoke these are good people free people this isnt colima these arent the rebuilders this place is called new eden and youve been recovering here healing here smokes eyelids fluttered and he started to say something else but the words were garbled and almost unintelligible as he slumped against steve smoke no cass pressed her hands to his face his neck feeling for his pulse a sharp exclamation above hersunhi out of breath clutching her jacket front closed she cursed in korean before crouching down and switching to english smoke is awake he mumbled something his chin slumped to his chest sunhi reached for his wrist cass getting out of the way for her she used her thumb to pull up one of his eyelids and shone her flashlight at his face that got her a groan of protest this is amazing sunhi said he walked here by himself i think so i dont know how he couldwell it does not matter now he picked a bad moment for waking up i have to get all patients ready for evacuation steve you bring him now steve and a raider named brandt crouched down to pick the prone form up in a firemans hold linking arms to support him smokes head lolled the other way is he going to be okay cass asked is he going to wake up again i dont know how this is happening sunhi said i am very amazed but right now i must figure out cars pack supplies you come with me steve we will get ready together yes maam steve said we will take him back to the hospital cass sunhi promised take very good care of him now you go get ready too cass put her hand gently on smokes face his beard soft under her hand someone had kept it neatly trimmed it should have been her smoke was silent as they carried him away sunhi striding purposefully ahead of them toward the hospital smoke owed sunhi his life cass had no doubt and cass owed sunhi too and zihna and all the volunteers whod fed and bathed him held his hand and read to him talked to him despite the fact that hed been trapped in his mind as his body mended this should be her happiest day the one shed longed for dreamed of and finally despaired of and instead of holding him whispering the thousand things shed saved up to tell him she and everyone else had to try to survive a horror that lay waiting to overrun them come the morning aftertime had taken so much from her and now it threatened to take this miracle as well as sunhis little group disappeared around the back of the building cass headed for the doors of the community center now thrown wide open with dozens of people milling about inside she would get ruthie pack their things get back to the hospital make sure smoke had a place in one of the cars and thenonce everything was in ordershe would finally return to keeping the vigil she had forsaken she wouldnt let the world take this one from her sammi had organized the little kids to play a version of duck duck goose twyla and ruthie and dane ran in a circle around sammi and dirk who sat scowling at the floor old enough to know that something was terribly wrong but not old enough to understand what when sammi looked up and saw cass there was a moment when her resentment and anger didnt have time to catch up a second where she looked like a little girl again herself frightened and vulnerable then the mask came down she narrowed her eyes and got to her feet sammi ruthie giggled and smacked her goose goose ruthie hadnt noticed cass yet her skin was rosy from the exertion of the game and she threw herself at sammi and grabbed her hands wanting to play some more she looked so happy in recent weeks she had come out of her shelllaughed louder chattered more excitedly played more creatively she was doing so well hereand now she would be uprooted again it couldnt be helped it was the only way to save them all of course not all of them would make it on the road towherever better how many would die tomorrow how many the day after that how many of them would be alive in a week a montha year cass forced herself to stay focused it never helped to think about the future like thatshe knew better everyone knew better babygirl she said and ruthie spun around and ran to her laughing arms lifted to be picked up cass swept her up in her arms and spun with the momentum her little girls legs sailing through the air so can i go now sammis voice dripped with sarcasm her face curled into a sneer sammi what dont you have to like figure out which guy youre gonna hook up with later sammi this is serious all i want for youall anyone wants for youis to keep you safe your dad dads already been here i told him to fuck off only the faintest quiver of sammis lower lip gave her away it broke casss heart to see how hard she was working to preserve her anger at least lets figure out what you should bring ive got that covered im with kyra and sage were gonna share cass sighed if she pressed any further she risked alienating sammi entirely or drawing her focus away from the important tasks at hand okay i know you girls are smart youve got packs how about that jogger stroller can you pack some things in that sammi rolled her eyes and picked up dane whod fallen at her feet in a fit of giggles tell you what cass why dont you let me focus on my life and you can go back to screwing up your own okay chapter it had all started so well and gone so wrong the other women in the mothers house were welcoming at first they gave cass jars of wildflowers cakes decorated with thin kaysevsyrup icing books and toys and blankets and stuffed animals and good cheer they made her tea and sat with her clucking over the scrapes and bruises shed sustained in the rebuilder battle just before she got there all of them had jobs ingrid and suzanne both worked in the laundry jasmineat that time already six months pregnantwas in the storehouse assisting dana with disbursement they were happy to have another person to work into the child care rotation in the evenings coming back from meals there was laughter and sometimes singing and when the little ones were asleep they gathered in the living room and talked by the light of a single candle and then one day one bad day that cass wished she could do over she rose in the morning and began down the stairs only to overhear a conversation between ingrid and jasmine all im saying is a child doesnt get that way by herself jasmine said in her faint east coast accent wait until your own child starts sassing you and then see what you think suzanneunflappable suzanne always willing to give everyone the benefit of the doubtsaid mildly but i mean its like ruthies afraid half the time twyla talks like four times as much as she does some kids are just quieter than others jazzy suzanne said patiently and cass and she have been through a lot even kids need time to process things but look at dirk and dane i mean they lost their dad like one day he was there and the next day he was facedown in the front yard shot by the neighbor for heavens sake thats traumatic right right there was a pause a small silence in which the coil of anxiety inside cass pulled taut the silence meant that suzannesweet suzanne hummingwithoutknowingshewasdoingit suzannehad doubts i dont mean shes a bad mother jasmine said only you know shes so protective overprotective she never lets that child out of her sight she even drags her along to go see that poor man in the hospital i mean tell me thats not traumatizing right i heard his eyes were gouged out oh christ jazzy thats not true suzanne protested go see him yourself if you want i was over there getting some cream for twylas rash i saw him hes not that bad cass backed up the stairs at that point her face burning was she overprotective yes probably but how could she help it after everything they had experienced and seen and yes ruthie was quietbut a few months ago she didnt talk at all cass had been happy that she was simply talking again but these few words from jasmine threw a pall over her progress the doubts magnified and escalated all that day it wasnt the first time her parenting had been called into question it was far from the worst time so why did it hurt so much now as cass sat with smoke late that afternoon holding his hand smoothing the hair out of his face adjusting his covers her mind reviewed every interaction shed had with the others the way they instinctively knew how to fill the gaps in the conversation that always left her tonguetiedhad they been thinking she was awkward all along the way ingrid always brought a new book for ruthie from the librarywas it because she didnt think cass would do it on her own the games dane invited ruthie to playhad ingrid put him up to it out of pity for her awkward daughter and her inadequate mothering by dinnertime she had a stomachache and her face felt tight as she carried their tray of food and walked with ruthie across the lawn headed for the table she usually shared with the other women she saw dor sitting alone at another his meal was finished his cutlery laid across his plate and half a cup of water in his hand he was watching sammi who was talking to a group of teens over at the volleyball net in a splitsecond decision she went and sat with dor instead sliding her tray on the table across from him she gave him the best smile she could muster okay if i sit here she said dor looked surprised hell yeah i thought you were avoiding me then as if sensing hed made a mistake his face softened if you hadnt come to me i would have hunted you down cass i dont belong here the words stark and frightened were out of her mouth before she could stop herself worse yet her eyes stung with unshed tears cass covered her mouth and looked down at the table someone had covered it with a flowered clothsomeone no doubt who had no trouble making and keeping friends someone who was comfortable in the social milieu here in new eden dor smiled ruefully and held up his hands for cass to see the cuts and scrapes that covered his forearms hed spent the day helping to remove barbedwire fencing from a section of the lower island theyd been using it to cultivate kaysev but as cass had already seen for herself on a walk with ruthie they had barely cleared the land since new eden had been settled pulling the barbed wire like hauling trash or tilling the earth was a job for the brawny but not one that was prized such jobs were never given to council members despite new edens insistence on a cooperative society it was clear that some job assignments were more coveted than others and distributed according to the councils whims and dor had started at the bottom he didnt have the same reputation in new eden as he had in the box ahhhhell dors hands sought hers and drew them together holding them tightly come on girl dont go soft on me now blinking cass took a chance and peeked at him his dark scarred face was shadowed with concern his brows were lowered hed cut his silvertinged black hair since coming to this settlement and it now cleared the collar of his work shirt though the front still fell in his eyes the thin wire loops in his ears and the tattoos that wound up both armsthings that had never looked out of place in the boxseemed a little too edgy here a little provocative maybe that was why he sat alone a fact cass hadnt bothered to consider until just this minute neither one of them fit in here sammis making friends cass said lamely after dor finally relaxed his grip on her hands ruthie too just like that they acknowledged what neither had said aloud new eden was a good place for children and that had to be enough i justi dont know maybe its just that the others all knew each other already i mean ingrid and suzanne and jasmine and all theyre nice to me but sometimes dont let them get to you dor said theyre jealous i mean look at you cass looked up in surprise found dors eyes intent on her they were the nearebony that always signaled intensity the shade of dors strong emotion and he stared without blinking into her eyes and then let his gaze travel down to her mouth and it was almost a physical sensation as though he were touching her instead of just watching her and cass felt the stirring that she thought had not followed her to this place the hunger for touch that had been driven from her by the terror of almost losing smoke and thinking of dor touching her lips led to memories of him kissing her theyd made love twice on the journey that took them from the box to colima no that wasnt righttheyd fucked twice theyd seized on each other out of desperation terror need hopelessness anger slammed their bodies into each other as death threatened and the world yawed crazily on its axis theyd kept each other going no more and no less and wasnt that over when it was over wasnt that the nature of the deal theyd never discussed out loudto get each other through and then leave it then never speak of it again youre beautiful cass dor said and only then did cass realize that hed only loosened his grip on her hands not released them and he laced his fingers through hers and caressed her palms with his thumbs the sensation went straight to her core searing ignited from a spark to a roaring flame with no slow build every woman every man thats the first thing they think when they see you his words were a buzz in her ear confirmation of things she didnt want to hear these were things she didnt want to know they were a crushing rejection of the fragile hope shed nurtured that she could be just another mom in just another town raising a nice girl and having nice friends dor must have seen her expression slip because his hands went still he stopped touching her pulled away what did i say he asked urgently not unkindly nothing only dont stop touching me nothing onlypleasemake me forget again tonight cass swallowed nearly lost her nerve tonight after ruthie goes down what what do you need take me somewhere cass said miserably alone and he did chapter there existed on the survivors islands one pickup and one panel van a motorcycle a small atv with a trailer for hauling fuel nathans little hybrid and a dented accord all of which were maintained by sharon and elsa two women whod met at wyotech and worked at a toyota dealership in sonora until riots and crashes decimated most of the vehicles on the road a hasty midnight session of the new eden council divided the vehicles cargo and passenger space among the eligible citizens following a very specific set of improvised guidelines communal supplies would receive top priority medicine water prepared food mothers and children would ride at least some of the time as would the elderly the sick the disabled seventy of them and four passenger vehicles everyone knew that meant they would be able to take very little cass looked around the room knowing that the few sentimental things she clung to would only weigh them down elsewhere in the house she could hear ingrid and suzanne and jasmine throwing what they could into backpacks ruthie babygirl were going exploring she said as she sorted through their clothes choosing lightweight things that could be layered some of ruthies clothes were getting tight she had hit a growth spurt and had outgrown most of her pants her turtlenecks no longer pulled easily over her head even her nightgowns sleeves didnt cover her wrists her little girl sat crosslegged on the mattress and pouted i dont want to go oh honey itll be an adventure cass didnt have the heart to put any energy into the lie shed be found out soon enough horrors awaited around every corner is twyla going yes of course we can walk together except that suzanne had told her not to speak to her until shed cooled down dont call me ill call you shed said over a week ago a faint attempt at humor on a day when humor had no place by now ingrid would have told her the latest and suzanne was bound to be angrier still cass packed the largeframed pack that she used to haul a days worth of water and her tools every day it was good shed become accustomed to carrying forty pounds on her back she could not count on much help on the road and she already needed to ask a very big favor that would exhaust any goodwill she had left into the pack went her meager supplies of soap aspirin lanolin and dried rabbit jerky then hers and ruthies clothes with extra coats and scarves wrapped around her bottle of wine it was about halffull a fact she did not allow herself to dwell on the box decorated with the circus bear she left on the shelf along with the bowl of earrings into ruthies tinkerbell backpack a gift from twyla on her birthday cass packed a soft baby blanket that she liked to sleep with a few stuffed animals and the veterinarian play set she added a stack of books and then reconsidering took out all but two okay sugar she asked ruthie helping her try it on for weight okay ruthie answered through a yawn oh honey im so sorry its bedtime isnt it and well go to bed soon a lie cass would not sleep this night the entire settlement was leaving at dawn and she had to make sure that smoke was with them how she did not yet know and her anxiety over that fact curdled in her stomach she descended the stairs with ruthie using the flashlight she kept for emergencies its beam was still strong but she had no spare batteries and she was aware of every second that ticked by the house was empty the women had left without her just as she feared she swept the flashlights beam over the kitchen table the counter the living roomeverything as it had been before about to become part of a ghost town she stepped out on the porch and stopped for a moment caught up short by the scene in front of her flashlight beams and candles bobbed along the paths as people hurried about someone had built a bonfire in the yard and piled on firewood with abandon they couldnt take it with them so cass supposed it made sense to burn it the air was filled with people calling to each other and along the shore she could make out a growing pile of bags and boxes the islands vehicles were parked in a neat row in front of the bridge and men were milling around close by from this distance cass could not tell who was in the crowd but she suspected it was the council members and their trusted friends people connected to them would decide what went and what stayed already the mound of belongings at the shore was more than would fit into cargo cass the deep voice in the darkness startled her she spun around and pointed her flashlight straight at the speaker whod been standing under the overhang next to the house it was red he winced in the sudden light and held his hands up to his face they were empty hey easy there i was just ah going cass said backing away from him in the flickering light she saw how he braced himself against the wall his muscles stiff from waiting no wait wait cassie cass looked up sharply no one called her that not for a very long time she didnt like itit brought back memories of times and places that she couldnt reclaim even if she wanted to what do you want to help just to help help me the absurdity of the request made cass laugh and how are you going to do that you got a key to some underground bunker no one knows about a tenyear supply of ricearoni no no nothing like that in the light of casss flashlight which she directed at the ground reds face looked ghostly his beard obscuring all his features except those soft eyes nested in sunweathered wrinkles he lifted a hand and then cut the gesture short his shoulder drooped i wish iwecould offer more but well i just thought zihna and i we could watch the little one so youi mean smokes gonna need you to advocate for him theyre over there right nowand it looks bad no way theyre taking all the patients along and dana and a couple of the others want to leave them all what are you talking about casss voice went shrill with fear leave who only before red even answered she knew what he was going to say and was surprised she hadnt already thought of it four cars all that gear the water decisions were going to have to be made and a fullgrown man was a lot of cargo she knew they wouldnt necessarily help her but to leave smoke whod been a hero to so many when the rebuilders threatened all but of course dor smoke herselfnone of them were recognized for what they had been prior to their arrival for better or worse oh my god she breathed and the enormity of the truth finally sank all the way in oh no what had she been thinking that she could save them all it would be a miracle if she could even make it through the journey with ruthie an injured manbarely walking barely returned from the edge hed walked with death she felt the porch floor tilt underneath her strong hands steadied her as she struggled to hold on to ruthie let me red said and he eased ruthie out of her arms with surprising tenderness and hitched her up over one shoulder her little head lolled in the crook of his neck her eyelashes fluttering and her sweet mouth in a sleepy pout red put a hand at her elbow to steady her are you okay do you need to sit down cass took a deep breath no im all right i needi just needoh god she needed to get to smokebut she needed to stay here with ruthie she needed to get their things down to the pile and hope there was a chance they might be loaded otherwise it was only a matter of time before the packs became too heavy and they had to start leaving things behind leaving them at the edge of the road like people did in the impossible early days of the siege back when families tried to take everything with them youd come across abandoned pillowcases stuffed with silver paintings photographs suitcases bulging with clothes bicycles and chain saws and radios and clocks and dolls and things that defied logic vases and puzzles and garden hoses would their things end up like that and thena half mile down the road a mile twowould they themselves lie down too cassie red spoke urgently you cant give up now girl me and zihna we talked it over we have the trailer we think we can rig it so smoke can ride ive got steve helping me out right now he owes me one well have to take turns with ruthie but i dont expect thatll be a problem not with so many of us weve got the girlswell sage anyway cant be putting too much strain on kyra not with her goin on her sixth month and sammiwell shell come around youll see she just needs to cool off a little is all casss mind swam with what he was proposing all those peopleall the favors he was willing to trade on her behalf she wanted to know why what she asked instead was what trailer its a little old flatbed threewheeler it was the one zihna and me came in here with came from her place to be fair but i expect she wont mind sharing with her old man he said smiling what other choice did she have smoke wouldnt make it four steps down the road despite his amazing journey across the island still maybe there was another way maybe she could convince them to give him passage in one of the vehicles she had to find out who was in charge and could make decisions i dont know what youve been planning red began but there are some things you should know milt and jack already took charles down to the end of the island about fortyfive minutes ago charles didnt make the trip back with them charlescasss heart lurched at the memory of the frail scabbed man who was in the late stages of aids which he had controlled before but which ravaged his body now that the steady stream of medicine was gone do you understand what im telling you cass she stared out at the scene unfolding in front of her the bonfire was growing wood stacked high and sparks flying collette and her friends waving their hands at the pile of burning belongings luddy had his longboard under his arm for once it didnt seem like a ridiculous thing for a grown man to own two of the guys worked on upended bicycles what did they think they were going to do with thoseoutrun the rest of them then they would be traveling alone come daylight with no defense against the beaters speed not odds that cass would take but still at least they had plans of some sort but she swallowed raking her hair with her hands why why do you want to help us red hesitated and then searched her face with his intense gaze the one shed noticed so many times before it seemed like he was about to confide or confess something then the moment passed and he shrugged zihna and iwe like kids we like helping people and ruthiewell weve always thought she was special his voice broke oddly on the last word and cass saw that he rocked ruthie in his arms it was true that he and zihna had always been kind to ruthiein the days following the chill that formed between cass and the other women hadnt they been extra solicitous always talking to her at mealtimes taking the time to chat when cass and she walked around the island still cass was uncomfortable with reds suggestion hell she wouldnt be the first to raise an eyebrow at the two older people taking such an interest in the kids especially the teens even though no one had ever picked up on anything inappropriate going on with the couple cass had taken risks with ruthies safety that she never should have shed left her daughter with strangers so she could work or drink or date she wanted to trust her instincts sometimes it seemed like they were all she had left to navigate with but right now as the island descended into chaos all around her was not the time thank you she said formally but as generous as your offer of help is ill take my chancesmine and ruthiesalone reds face sagged the sadness in his eyes reflected in the eerie glow of the flashlight and he went still i cant let you do that cassie he said softly a strange premonition snaked up casss spine something so familiar and yet just out of reach why because this is too important because shes my granddaughter casslisten to me its meyour dad chapter this time when cass felt the breath leave her the ground rushing up to meet her and cave her in she did not yield to it no no no hes not the manher dadbecause of course it was him it was wily old silver dollar haverford shapeshifted anew more worn but no less crafty and elusive how could she not have recognized that voicethe one that had once sung her lullabies the one that called from the road with everdiminishing frequency always a new number a borrowed phone when times were tough as they nearly always were sometimes she heard a woman in the background other times the din of greyhound stations or taverns and always always she asked him the same question when are you coming home daddy how long did it take until she figured out that he never would oh but that was the genius of old silver dollarhe could make you believe he waited until youd just about given up hope and then hed show up all smiles and hugs and trinkets in his pockets embroidered blouses and clay whistles from tijuana bags of apples from washington a dress for her mother promises to stay this time and the next the two of them would go out for dinner come home laughing and loud then whispering in the living room him singing and her dancing and cass in her bed would be happy because surely this time it would last surely this time hed see that they all belonged together the last time he ever came home was her eighth birthday well a week later anywaythe delay broke his heart but was unavoidable of course and stupid stupid cass she believed him he took her to a baseball game called her his little lady said maybe they could go skiing that winter once it got cold enough and then he was gone forever shed tried to find him just once it was after her mother took up with byrn after her stepfather started coming into the hall late at night when cass was in her nightgown pretending to be on the way to the bathroom at the same time accidentally touching her down there when they passed cass had searched every town she could think of that her dad had ever mentioned she stole her mothers credit card out of her purse and used it for an internet service that promised to track down missing loved ones the fiftydollar report included six known addresses but the most she ever found were a few irate landlords who remembered her father well by the time she finally gave up her mother had gotten the bill and was furious and her anger only grew when cass tried to tell her what had been going on late at night that byrn lurked in the halls touched her through the thin nightgown followed her back to her room and whispered warnings while he fumbled with his zipper she told cass to consider long and hard if telling lies was worth getting thrown out of the house over and casswho was fourteen and had no idea how to even get a work permitgave up and sealed her heart forever against the man whod abandoned her to this fate and now this man this old craggy man her father had somehow become was actually crying his cheeks shiny in the flashlight glow suddenly that enraged cass more than anything else you dont you dont she gasped you dont get to cry she seized ruthie and wrested her from his arms her body floppy and hot and damp in sleep ruthie began to wail and went stiff in her arms but cass fought her holding her tightly and backed down the steps away from red away from her father stay away from us her voice rose to a wail rusty and choked with sobs justjust stay away she picked up ruthies tinkerbell pack the glittery wings shimmering in the dark then she turned and ran chapter sammi was doing her best to keep her shit together but it felt like she was becoming unglued from the inside sage was over talking to phillip through the slits in the windows and refused to come back to the house colton was nowhere to be found and there was something wrong with kyra she wouldnt get off the bed wouldnt help pack wouldnt even tell sammi what was wrong she just sat on the bed with her knees pulled up as far as she could her arms wrapped around her legs rocking and sniffling sammi had a duffel on wheels the sort of thing she would never have been caught dead with before it looked like something her dad took back when he traveled for business back before he went through the mother of all midlife crises back then her dad had the start of a beer gut a stupid haircut that he put gel on and he wore golf shirts with logos from all these different country clubs even though he never had time to play golf hell valerie wouldnt even recognize him which was weird sammi would have figured someone like valerie would have liked the old version of her dad a lot more than what he was like now sure he was a lot more buff these days but then again everyone was at least kind of cut everyone who survived anyway valerie and her dadsammi could just see them the way they would have been a year or two ago valerie probably would look about the same with her stupid skirts that hit her at the least flattering possible place on her leg her sensible shoes and her headbands she had good hair it was true and a great figure but she did her best to hide it all her dad never would have asked her out althoughthe truth was that sammi had never seen any of the women her dad dated other than her spanish teacher all she had to go on was her moms commentary on the subject and her mom was pretty bitter and casscass would never have looked at her dad before cass was sowhat was the word anyway sammi used to think she could be really nice when you were alone with her she could make you think she was listening really listening and not condescending but maybe all that was was her lame attempt to make sammi like her because she had a thing for her dad all along exceptback when they first met cass was with smoke she was still with smoke wasnt she supposed to be anyway sammi clenched the stack of underwear in her hand she had given up trying to talk to kyra and was packing for her her own bag was ready and shed jammed lightweight stuff as far down as she could leaving room for whatever she could scavenge from the storehouse those idiots had better have it opensammi wasnt about to count on the whole commie sharing system to make sure she got what she needed you could see how fast that was breaking downshed heard them all arguing earlier but what could you expect back in honors english theyd read this book by a guy whose motto was dont trust anyone over thirty sammi figured you might as well make it twenty luddy and cheddar and those guys they were what twentyfive twentyseven and they were all fuckups before they would probably have been homeless or living in communes or something hell theyd probably be the first ones to get picked off by beaters when the shit hit the fan theyd be throwing their stupid frisbee around at the back of the pack and bam that would be it well sammi wasnt going to let anything like that happen to her shed already survived one fullon attackright before cass and her dad showed up in colima shed escaped on her own and shed nearly made it too only a nest of the things had woken up and sniffed her out but shed nailed a few of them with this piece of wood shed yanked off a porchit had nails sticking out of the end it was the perfect weaponshe still remembered how it felt making contact with their stupid zombie heads somehow both hard and soft like a melon split open she was sure she had killed at least one and maybe more sammi realized she was holding kyras clothes so tightly that her hands had gone white and she was starting to shake too right now thinking about the zombies remembering the sounds they made and cass screaming her name as she came runningyeah so shed come to help her driven that truck of hers straight into a beater nightmare when she could have just hit the road and never come back okay cass had done at least that for herright now she was about ten times more afraid than shed been that night which didnt make any sense at all and she wanted her dad andshe really really wanted her mom but her mom was dead kyra sammi snapped a lot meaner than she meant to kyra turned her slightly unfocused dark eyes her way what she mumbled but at least she stopped rocking ive got your underwear your leggings your thermal shirt what else do you want she held up a couple of tshirts emblazoned with band logos kyra bit her lip twisting it around and sammi felt a little reassured because it was an expression that went back as far as she had known kyra hothouse shears she said okay sammi said hiding her relief i could have guessed that and stacy faith thats all you ever wear thats all that fits kyra said and lumbered off the bed im getting fucking huge she peered into her pack a black one with silverandgray trim i can trade if you want sammi said mines probably easier with the wheels and all kyra shrugged i think theyre gonna let me ride at least part of the time me and the other knockedup girls other than jasmine that club included leslie and roan both of whom had been impregnated at the rebuilders baby farm and escaped with sammi when her dad and cass came for her they were cool and all but since they were almost ten years older than sammi and kyra and sage it wasnt like they all hung out or whatever leslie and roan shared a place at the north end of the island and theyd told kyra she could live with them after her baby came which pissed sammi off because there were extra rooms at the house for wayward girls and if they all helped out how hard would it be to raise the kid right here themselves but now that they were leaving new eden who knew what was going to happen poor kyrabeing pregnant for this trip was going to seriously suck for one thing kyra still threw up sometimes not near as bad as a while ago but bad enough that she had days where shed just lie around and moan and she got these weird cramps that were supposedly kind of like labor but not really real labor which was a good thing because sammi was not interested in being any kind of emergency midwife although if push came to shove shed do it shed do anything for her best friends they were her family now girls zihna hurried into the room her face flushed and her tshirt damp with sweat under the arms sammi felt a twinge of guiltshed been so busy trying to get kyra moving that she hadnt even offered to help zihna and red speaking of which where had they been after the beaters finally went home everyone kind of split up and went off to prepare for the evacuation dana made some sort of pronouncement but no one was really listeningit was pretty clear what had to happen how hard was it to understand what the priorities were anyone who stuck around the island tomorrow was going to be treated to the worlds most terrifying swimming lesson and then end up served for dinner zihna stood with her hands on her hips and scanned the room quickly okay im going to go get sage and then i want you two to come wait with me you can sleep down there by the water but i want us all to be ready to move when the time comes wheres red kyra asked he had a little personal errand zihna said suddenly the room lit up with a flash of searing white light what the hell kyra knocked over the glass of water on her bedside table and the wet stain spread out into an amorphous shape on the carpet flares said zihna sorry i was just about to tell you about that theyre trying to alert any nearby shelters why the hell are they using flares sammi demanded isnt that like a giant neon sign that says hey zombies over here come eat us zihna shook her head not according to booth and them he says they only respond to sustained light its the pupil thinga flash like that supposedly just makes them dilate more i think hes a fake kyra muttered boothphil booth formerly a highschool teacher from sonorahad supposedly made a study of the beaters before finding his way to new eden he told stories of experiments hed conducted with a couple of other academics one of them on the epidemiology staff at a hospital there the only problem was that depending on the night and who was listening his stories tended to shift often he was featured as the guy who heroically stepped in when things went horribly wrong which was a little hard to swallow given the fact that booth was a hundredten soaking wet pale and practically hairless more of a geek than a hero also there was the problem of booths missing colleagues depending on the story theyd either died in a huge battlefrom which booth alone emerged unscathedor gone to the west and north the three of them having made a pact to spread their findings to whatever civilization they stumbled across but why are they trying to get the other shelters involved zihna spoke carefully which was her habit when any of them was upset she wasnt the huggy sort though old enough to be a grandmother she was hardly a grandmotherly kind of woman she showed her concern mostly in the way she took the time to think first and avoided saying anything that could be misconstrued i believe there was some hope that other communitieswhere they might have avoided the attention of beaters in these large numbersmight see the signal and come help help with what help us fold our underwear fear was making sammi sarcastic and she wished she could stop yelling but there was only one person who could calm her down fast anymore now that jed was gone and that was her dad she was still furious with him but hed always had a way of talking to her that made things seem like they would work out zihna paled the girls had lit half a dozen candles from their stockpile enough to illuminate the entire room and in the light of the candles you could see every wrinkle every valley on the womans face at other times sammi thought zihna pretty for an older lady she wore her hair long and loose and smiled a lot not in a fakey way like collette portescue and the rest of those uptight bitches but tonight zihna just looked old help us with the uh departure we cant leave until theres enough light for us to see where were going but hopefully still before the beaters are up and out but were bound to run into them soon after that all its going to take is stumbling on a nest of them and theyll start up their hollering and get the others all riled up i think thatthe thought of some of the council was that if some folks came from hollis or oakton they could give us a sort of escort until we got out to the truly uninhabited land once we get there we can handle the occasional pack ourselves its only the first few miles that have everyone worried wow was there like a whole meeting or something we missed sammi asked gathering a handful of cosmetics and jamming them into an old plastic ziparound tote that had once been a clinique gift with purchase a third flare went off and sammi dropped the tote spilling tiny tubes and bottles onto the floor a round eyeshadow rolled across the carpet and bumped into kyras leg shit she whispered fucking shitballs with lint but she looked like she was about to cry sammi crab walked over to her and pulled her into a hug on the carpet realizing too late she was sitting on the water spot oh well that probably wasnt the worst thing that was going to happen today or tonight or tomorrow or whatever it was what time is it anyway she asked zihna zihna who wore a watch all the time an oldfashioned one with tiny delicate hands that pointed to the numerals squinted at her wrist nearly three three hours until dawn think you girls can catch a little sleep once you get down to the shore i promise we wont leave without you are you sure i mean dont you want one of us to keep you company or take turns or something aw no honey zihna said red and me weve got it covered were a team right i meansammi you know we want you if you want to join us sammi realized what she was half asking if she planned to walk with her dador stay with zihna and red and her friends a team she repeated quickly before she could change her mind chapter cass had the foresight to go back for the stroller hoping shed get to it before suzanne or ingrid and then feeling guilty about the thought the stroller was exactly where shed left it earlier in the evening abandoned in the middle of the yard and cass realized how lucky she was that no one had taken it it would make a great little cart for someone who wanted to transport food belongings anything at allup to seventy pounds according to the government label engraved on the side something shed never given much thought to before because ruthie didnt weigh a fraction of that ruthie had settled down after the encounter with red a lot more than cass anyway whose nerves were still jangling im your dad cassie she was in a state of shock and denial but there would be plenty of time to sort it all out on the journey more than enough time out of nowhere cass thought of a picture book a babysitter had once given ruthiea childrens bible illustrated with watercolors in pale weak colors moses crossing the red sea looked more like moses wading through a forest of camellia blooms his placid smile making him and the israelites all appear stoned still ruthie had loved the story and liked to point to the people in the pictures and try to repeat the names cass read to her moses pharaoh jethro zipporah and now her dad red whoeverthefuck he was calling himself these days wanted to come and lead them to a promised land hell he wanted to be her dad again all of a sudden but it was too late for that too late by a long shot and if cass had to make some harsh decisions to protect ruthie the way mim ought to have protected her well so be itshe had fought harder for less twenty years was a long time and her father was a stranger to her and she would not trust her daughter with him all she had to do now was keep saying no and she figured she could more than handle that she settled ruthie into the stroller after wiping the chilly dew from its interior with her bare hands then wiping her hands on her pants her pants were not clean her laundry day was tuesday if the beaters had waited a few more days to come fuck with them at least cass would have started the odyssey with clean pants oh well cass pushed the stroller toward the hospital trying to narrow and focus her thoughts if smoke had made it out of the hospital building all the way up the path to the yard halfway down to the waterthen surely she could convince the council that he was healing quickly enough to justify bringing him along she would be responsible for him all they needed was one seat in one of the cars cass would walk alongside she would push ruthie and carry their belongings and it would all work out fine but when she got to the hospital it was dark she parked the stroller behind a rain barrel and picked ruthie up before she went inside but she knew the minute she set foot in the place that it was deserted and sure enoughthere in the light coming through the windows the light of the hundreds of candles and flashlights being squandered tonightthere was smokes empty bed the covers clumsily folded the pillow on top cass went into the other room therein that narrow bed with the crayon drawings that ruthie and twyla and dane had made pinned up on the walls behind the headboardthere was where charles had suffered through his waning and finally unconscious days cass would be hardpressed to denounce the men who dragged him to the southern end of garden island and did what needed to be done in fact maybe it was a heroic act stopping his suffering a little prematurely so he did not have to endure one more horror but not for a body on the mend like smoke sunhi must have found passage for him must have gotten him down to the vehicles somehow she and ruthie would ask around find out where they were maybe even get a little sleep before dawn perhaps they could pass the night in the car with him or barring that at least they could bed down close by and be there at his side when the group rolled out at sunrise cass came out of the hospital and deposited ruthie back in the strollershe whimpered no doubt tired of all the repeated resettlingand when she stood back up she was startled to see suzanne standing several paces away her arms folded across her chest oh suzanne casss heart fell not now she was not prepared to deal with this now i took a few things from the house for ruthie just things she had in her room i would have checked with you guys first but do you honestly think i care about a few toys now when were about to suzannes face crumpled in on itself but with a tremendous effort she righted it her jaw working and worry lines appearing between her eyebrows i just i have been very angry at you cass and i resent everything youveall the risk youve brought us and the children i know i know i wish i could i wishive just been so shut up shut up just for a minute im here becausewell i dont know why im here only i thought you should know suzanne took a deep breath and hugged herself tighter against the chill they took smoke after they took charles down there and you know and drowned him they came back for smoke about ten minutes ago i saw you over on the porch talking to red i should have come then i justi just want you to understand i where adrenaline surged through casss veins clutching at her heart which way down the east way suzanne pointed her tone still defiant i would have told you right away but after everything youve put the rest of us through but cass was already gone careening down the path pushing the stroller with its big rubber wheels absorbing the bumps ruthie sputtered as she bounced along but cass had secured the straps and she was held tight in place how could they justify this charles had been as good as dead anyway theyd only hastened the end saved the poor man from a final battle that hed be the first casualty of anyway but smokehe was getting better hed made it across the lawn hadnt he hed spoken her name touched her talked to her cass swung the arc of the flashlight back and forth wildly so theyd know she was comingso what she might surprise them before they began their task and then theyd have to deal with her before they finished him off thereup in the gray sedge growing along the bank cass had transplanted it herself in an effort to stem erosion and the plants had thrived and they were thighhigh now so it took her a minute to make out the figure of a man struggling with another on the ground when the flashlight beam hit him he wheeled around and held up a hand to shield his eyes cass stumbled over a clump of reeds and nearly went down but the strollers weight steadied her and she found her footing and stared in shock at the scene in front of her smoke clutched the shirtfront of a man who was kneeling in the dirt the mans chin bobbed against his chest and blood saturated his tan shirt and fleece vest more blood coursed over smokes hand and fell to the earth milt oh god it was milt secco and if he wasnt dead already he would be soon all that bloodcass put a hand to her mouth what happened cass he said and dropped the limp body it fell gracelessly facedown legs splayed smoke stood painfully and hobbled toward her he looked at his hands and seemed surprised to see all the blood there and stood awkwardly holding them at his sides thats when cass noticed the other body halfsubmerged in the river also facedown its head at an angle that suggested a neck broken but cass knew that red parka it belonged to jack oh my god she whispered you killed them both they were going to kill me drown me they told mei had to smokes leg buckled as though it would go out under him and cass rushed to help him draping his arm over her shoulder he was warm even through his bloody clothes so warm they said i ought to thank them what the hell is going on in this place oh smoke cass said softly what are we going to do behind themacross the fields shed so carefully tended the kaysev that both nourished them all and hid a traitorous poison within its cellsthere was frantic activity fear the shadow of death waiting for them and gnashing hungry teeth but here in this moment it was just the two of them i cant believe its you smoke said his words slurred against her neck cass could not find her voice to respond there was so much to tell him and no time at all to do it what day is it he asked february sixteenth ive been gone for almost three months we came a few days after you left the box afterwhat happened to you do you remember he was silent for a moment and then he pulled back and stared down into her eyes he touched her cheek with the hand that was missing part of his fingers but his touch was as gentle as ever i remember most of it i rememberthe ones who burned the school i think i got at least one of them maybe two two and one died later his mission of vengeance completed before he fell you killed them all smoke the bitterness shed felt at the trade he had maderisking his life for the momentary sweetness of revengewas lifting shed hated smoke the day he left the box with nothing on his mind but finding and killing those who had murdered his old lover and the rest of his old community at the time cass thought his wrath was proof that he loved them all more than he loved her and ruthie now in his arms she understood that the truth was far more complicated than thatthat his hatred had not been more powerful after all i dont remember after though he said ive tried a million times in that place that jail where are we cass there was no way to explain it all to him now and far off in the east a thin line of azure tinged with pink signaled the coming of dawn there was blood on their clothes and two men lay dead at their feet were at a place we have to leave ill tell you everything she promised but for now weve got to get back and get ready ready for what cass looked across the inky waters to the shore where the beach was choked with matted dead weeds not so long ago people had anchored their boats there set up their pop tents and their portable grills their coolers and their lawn chairs and whiled away long afternoons scented with sunscreen and charcoal children waded and splashed teens swam across to the island old folks watched the scene from under the shade of their sun hats ready to travel cass said sadly again happiness had once dwelled in that humble little strip of land in the morning the beaters would be back and perhaps they would trudge across that sand in their fetid rotting shoes into the water theyd only yesterday learned to navigate and follow the yearning that was the only emotion they had left if any of them had been to this place before they turned if theyd waterskied these waters or drunk pitchers of icy lemonade or read the latest romance novel or stolen a kiss under an umbrella that memory was as lost to them as the ability to speak or love chapter red saw them coming the man limping along with his arm around his daughter who was somehow managing to push one of those funnylooking threewheeled strollers at the same time the man walked like he was about to collapse leaning on cass for support so this is how they were to meet red had imagined this day a hundred different ways but never like this red would call for zihna she was good at this sort of thing he knew the only reason cassie had come to him was that she had no other choice and he accepted that but this was a start the trailer a little singleaxle flatbed utility model with a handle hed rigged from an old ski rope was as comfortable as he could make it earlier craig switzer and a few of his friends had come by and tried to talk him out of it and when he didnt budge the talk had turned ugly what are you fixin to do haul your guitars and shit along when theres people to be fed we could get a hell of a lot of water and supplies on that thing craig said eyeing the trailer with a calculating expression what brave craig didnt know was that zihna was in the next room cleaning their guns he didnt know what a good shot zihna was well there was a reason red had taught her in private a man would have to be a fool not to see that a day like this was comingand hed have to be a coward not to take precautions to protect the ones he loved red had been exactly such a coward for most of his life but no more no more and whos going to decide that brother he asked softly hand on his belt where a holster hed carefully modified over several long winter afternoons hid not one but two blades each of them specialized each of them very very comfortable in his hand you because last i heard no one had nominated any of you clowns for council an ugly grin spread across craigs face behind him his friends giggled and shuffled red knew that mario had been caught trying to break into the storehouse at least once no formal punishment had been meted out since there was no proof to contradict his story that hed been simply seeking a bandaid for a woman who had cut herself on a paring knife but a lingering pall of suspicion had followed him ever since councils in for some changes i bet craig said give it a week or two therell be all manner of staff changes resignationsattritionwhat have you i imagine youre right red said his mild tone hiding a growing anger why dont we wait until then and reconvene this discussion again meantime my wife and i have our own plans for our property and ill thank you to respect that and be on your way the men stayed only for a moment more looking around the garage no doubt trying to see if there was anything worth taking there was notzihna had helped the girls pack and sent them on ahead to the docks where everyone was assembling wife huh the dullest of the three tanner mobley said over his shoulder as they sauntered away you all have you a proper wedding i didnt get invited to indeed red said folding his arms over his chest and watching them go no he and zihna had never had a ceremony theyd met after red had nearly given up on life seven months ago red had in mind to hang himself in a neatly tended trilevel house on the outskirts of bakersfield who knew why he chose that house from the dozen on that blockbut when he went inside looking for a rope or a belt or even a sheet he could rip into strips instead he found zihna sitting calmly at the kitchen table shelling kaysev beans he couldnt believe his eyes he had been wandering for days and he hadnt bothered to eat or drink much since survival had ceased to be a goal he wondered if she was an angel sent to welcome him to the next world the one where he could start forgetting all the things that hed done wrong in this one but she wasnt an angel and she had no plans to allow him to forget or escape anything at all instead she guided him back he owed her everything and had pledged her everything where before there had been a broken man and a proud woman now there was a union that meant more to red than anything on this earth aside from his daughter if that didnt make zihna his wife no vow or ceremony or holy man on this earth would either now as dawn waited just over the horizon he waited with an old wool blanket over his lap and watched his daughter slowly approach when they were within a few yards of his front door red cleared his throat cassie im glad to see you and your friend cass saw him then and the door opened behind him and zihna came out carrying a lantern the porch was lit up and they could see the wounded man clearly zihna saw him every day of course but it was not reds habit to come inside the hospital where she worked red couldnt abide hospitals not even now so the face of the man his daughter loved was new to him he knew the stories of course well maybe the man was a hero maybe not time would tell for now though red owed him courtesy hed watch him like a hawk and if smoke made his daughter happy then he could stay he stood up with his hand extended smoke regarded him with unfocused eyes and it took him three tries to lift his hand high enough to shake he looked like he was about to pass out on the spot welcome red said gravely in his mind he added watch yourself chapter sammi followed the sound of her fathers voice without getting up from the spot theyd claimed their backs against the bridge supports where they took root fifty feet inland the road rose above the ground there and was in pretty good shape for aftertime someone must have kept it in good repair before sage was sitting next to her finally asleep dozing with her head on sammis shoulder and kyra was sleeping at their feet wrapped up in a blanket a little while ago roan and leslie and jasmine had stopped by to see if kyra wanted to go with them but she and sammi had barely managed to get sage to come with them practically dragging her away from the quarantine house and kyra had absently told them thanks maybe later it was too weird to think of her with jasmine who had to be the oldest pregnant woman sammid ever metshe was well over forty anyway what would she and kyra even talk about she could be kyras mom easy before kyra fell asleep she told sammi to make sure they stuck together and sammi was going to do that though she was secretly worried about whether kyra ought to be walking so much but then again who knew how far they were even going to go maybe theyd find the perfect shelter in a day or something it was unlikely rumor was that nathan and some others had driven out to all the known shelters within thirty miles that were still reachablemany of the major roads were impassable clogged with wrecksand none had room or the desire to add on a group of their size but it wasnt impossible right they could split up if they had to find somewhere like the first shelter sammid lived in back when her mom and jed were still alive the school had been fine it wasnt like new eden where there were no high walls nothing to separate them from the rest of the world but the river but it had been all right in fact she missed it in some ways missed how small it was how she knew everything about everyone how everyone always asked her how she was doing shed been a child there still it had been a long while since she felt like that her father was going around talking to people about what they wanted to bring along he was acting like some kind of expert like someone had put him in charge like he was king of the council all of a sudden when last week he was digging a new trench for the latrines sammi knewshed seen the way people talked to her dad like they thought they were better than him it was a long way from when her dad was a big financial trader that was for sure somehow here in new eden where there were rules for everything her dad never really fit in even when he took up with valerieand everyone liked valerie she was so perky and perfectpeople still didnt warm up to him and if sammi was really really honest with herself that had hurt hes not perfect she wanted to tell people but you have to know him like i know him only then shed seen another side of him and decided she didnt really know him at all it started with him getting all overprotective after not giving a shit what she did or where she went for all those years it was like he wanted to keep her locked up all the time her mom had been protective but at least she had reasons at least shed been like that as long as sammi could remember with her dad it was just stupid and then seeing him and cass togetheras though nothing else mattered not her not valerie not the job he was supposed to be doing but now he was like some kind of hero going around and talking to people and everyone wanting to know his opinion all because of what hed done today him and cass going out in the boat and shooting all those beaters sammi didnt know exactly how she felt about that shed been watching out the window of the community center with kalyan when they first set out in the canoe and shed been so scared she didnt have actual thoughts but just a crazy buzzing spin of fear that didnt go away until they were back onshore for a while there when her dad and cass were helping glynnis and john giving them the ammo or whatever it looked like they were all screwed for sure there were just so many of them it got to the point where sammi couldnt bear to look she turned away from the window and kalyan put a hand on her shoulder and she went very still until he got the message and went away and then sage came up and wrapped her arms around sammi and told her everything that was happening in a soft voice theyre paddling uprivercass has this one gun where you have to hold it with two handsdamn she nailed that oneoh shit theresno she got that one too sage kept that up until the beaters retreated and her dad turned the canoe around and only then did sammi stop shaking and find the courage to look again now she listened to her dad talking and tried to find in his voice the man she most missed but this was more like the dad he used to be before he moved out he used to order her mom around not in an asshole way but in a way like he was just used to being in charge it wasnt like her mom put up with it anyway she always did whatever she wanted maybe that was what finally broke them up they both had boss personalities he used to tell sammi what to do all the time too but back then she mostly didnt mind because he liked to spend time with her and they had their own things they did just the two of them like watching reality shows together and yelling at the tv or going out for gizmos garlic fries whenever they got a craving sure sure he was telling the patels one of those rare intact fairytale couples from before who clung all the more firmly to each other in the face of all the dangers around them i know you want to take all your family stuff but youre really going to have to pare it down see if you can get it into just this one suitcase here the one with the wheels and ill be back in a while to see how youre doing and then he was on to the next group sammi hadnt seen cass at all tonight since she came to get ruthie she hadnt come down to the shore with piles of bags like almost everyone else on the island for a second sammi wondered the decision shed made to tell mr swarmer about her drinking all shed wantedwhat had she wanted anyway at the time it had seemed pretty clear cass was drinking everyone knew itwell maybe not everybody but the other women in the mothers house for sure knew about it because jasmine had told roan and roan told kyra and kyra told them in the mothers house they werent happy about it not by a long stretch and supposedly theyd had a cometojesus meeting where they told cass if she ever drank while she was watching the kids she was not only out of the babysitting rotation but out of the house too somehow they all seemed to believe cass only drank late at night but that wasnt very likely was it addicts werewell the only ones sammi knew maybe they werent addicts technically meaning by whatever rules or whatever these things were determined but the girls at school who were stoners and pill poppers and the ones who brought vodka to school in water bottlesthey were for sure doing it during the day despite grosbeck academys zerotolerance policy and despite those letters they sent home assuring all the parents they had the best record on drug use of any private girls school in central california which was a blatant lie but then again that was part of what her parents used to pay grosbeck twentyfive thousand bucks a year for was to be lied to and feel good about it they all wanted to believe it so they wouldnt have to acknowledge that they were too busy or didnt care enough to pay attention to their kids themselves and thats what was going on here too right the other mothers didnt want to lose cass because they needed her to babysit jasmine would join in eventually she was going to have the kid any day now but shed been on bed rest for weeks because she was so old and sunhi thought she shouldnt move around much and after the baby came shed be too busy to watch all the other kids for a while so they didnt want to lose cass so that meant someone else had to be responsible and step up and say something because it was just plain dangerous for her to be left with the kids which was why sammi had gone to mr swarmer only if shed really wanted to punish her sammi would have told dana not mr swarmer underneath his whole nobodys in charge here thing dana totally thought he was in charge he was always ordering people around and pretending he had the council behind him or maybe he did but sammi would bet he did a lot of behindthescenes asskissing and favortrading and threatening to get his way and dana was such a goody twoshoes if he knew about cass hed probably make an example of her publicly humiliate her like he did when they found mitchell keller stealing the box of cocoa mix off the raider cart dana had suggested public stocks and while the council had voted that down they had given the thumbsup to the reparations chair mitchell had to sit there for two days with a sign hed written saying what hed done and how he was sorry and he wasnt allowed to say anything until the two days were done and then dana made a big deal about forgiving him in a big speech up on the steps of the community center all over a box of cocoa mix what would they do for something as serious as what sammi told mr swarmer because she hadnt exactly said that cass never drank on the job she said she didnt know which was true sort of but really sammi knew cass would never do anything to endanger a child especially ruthie no one could say that cass didnt love her daughter and even though sammi was angrier than ever if that was possible about cass and her dad she was starting to feel a little guiltyokay a lot guiltyabout telling mr swarmer that she didnt know what time of day cass drank or who she got it from at least she hadnt told them the other thing about how cass and ruthie had been infected sammi couldnt bring herself to spread that knowing what she knewthe immunity was superrare but if you were immune you werent a danger to anyone there were people in new eden whod completely freak if they knew idiots whod probably want cass gone just because shed been sick in the past and even angry sammi knew that going that far would be wrong besides if her dad found out shed talked to mr swarmer hed probably be furious he could be such a bastard but he was kind of rigid about right and wrong at least his version of right and wrong hed be all over her about lying even though hed been lying to valerie all alongone look at her tearstained puffy face when she came by earlier with her friends made it clear shed had no idea about cass but what went on between adults that way was a private matter the council would probably all disapproveand given what a bunch of tightass losers they were she guessed theyd disapprove a lotbut there was nothing they could actually do about it besidesif sammi told people about that then her dad would be implicated too and sammi wasnt ready to take that step she hated him true but he was all the family she had left and hed do anything for her to keep her safe she couldnt let go of that right now maybe if jed was still aroundbut no jed was dead so she couldnt bring herself to hurt her dad and she had a readymade way to hurt cass and that was what she had done and at first it had felt really good to imagine cass getting her wrists slapped having everyone spying on her all the time to make sure she wasnt drinking and if they were watching cass like a hawk then shed sure have a hard time sneaking out to meet her dad right which was a win for everyone except sammi was starting to think shed made a mistake a big one half an hour ago ingrid and suzanne had come by with jasmine between them and twyla holding danes and dirks hands and elsa had been with them and they were talking about a car a car for the moms with little kids and jasmine who was ready to pop so that was what three adults and three kids which was a full car right there and no one said anything about cass and ruthie which meant they werent getting a ride even though they had every bit as much of a right as the othersor they would have anyway if sammi hadnt started a rumor that might not even be all the way true and that still wasnt any big deal because sammi knew deep down inside that come morning it was going to be basically everyone for themselves sure thered be a lot of talk about sticking together and the smartest people would figure out ways to stay in groups while it suited them but in the end theyd all have to fend for themselves everyone would be so focused on saving their own asses there wouldnt be much left over for taking care of anyone else people would get left abandoned discarded but at least in that regard cass was in better shape than most despite her drinking thing she was strong and fit and brave and healthy but then there was ruthie ruthie wasnt like other little kids she spooked kind of easy and then she went quiet really quiet like she thought if she played invisible the problem would go away in the community center earlier tonight when cass left to help her dad ruthie wrapped her arms so tight around sammis neck that she was almost strangling her she put her little face against sammis and made a tiny little whimpering sound ruthie was not strong not the way you had to be to get through what lay ahead and she was only three three what if the thing that sammi had done had condemned both of them what if it was her fault that they wouldnt get to ride tomorrow safe inside a car protected by all that steel andas long as the gas held outable to outrun the beaters down by her feet kyra turned over and sighed unconsciously sammi couldnt believe anyone could sleep through this and sage was leaning all her weight against sammi and if she didnt move soon both of sammis legs were going to go to sleep carefully slowly she eased sage off her and scooted down next to kyra still neither of them woke up sammi wanted to walk to shake out her legs and work off some of this excess energy the boys were down helping pile things up and load the vehicles she wished she was with them helping out keeping her mind off things or maybe going for a walk with colton one last trip around the island just to say goodbyealthough colton had been acting weird for a few weeks hanging around with shane and that creeper owen mason the guy who grew weed and taught them how to roll owen liked to get high but he liked fires even morethe only useful thing he ever did was to tend the bonfires whenever there was a celebration there were rumors that he liked fires too much that hed set the brush fires up on north island owen was the kind of guy whoand sammi knew it was wrong even to think ityou wouldnt mind if hed died in the siege the kind of guy who made everyone nervous even if he held a certain kind of fascination at least for colton and the other boys with his personal stash of drug paraphernalia and weird martialarts weapons and who knew what else sammi hadnt seen the boys at all since phillip got locked up come to think of it and it made her uneasy wondering if they were with owen but she didnt want to leave sage and kyra alone she felt responsible this was new and sammi wasnt sure she liked itfeeling accountable for people her friendsand ruthie and cass it had been so much easier back when nobody expected much from her at all when she was just an ordinary kid who was bratty to her parents and maybe a little spoiled who loved soccer and listening to music and painting her nails and shopping who wasnt responsible for anything but keeping curfew and getting her homework done and half the time she didnt even manage that but it never mattered back then now it mattered the things she did mattered or maybe they didnt in a couple of hours the sun would rise and they would all set out it would be their last day on earth or it wouldnt and sammi had watched enough people die to know that none of it was in her control anyway sammi looked around one last time at everyone rushing around in the dark she sighed and let her eyelids flutter closed and thought about jed about the way they used to stay up talking until they were so tired they fell asleep in the middle of their sentences after a few minutes she stretched out her legs to get more comfortable and snuggled a little closer to sage just resting just for a few minutes it had been zihnas idea to wait until they heard the sound of engines turning over of the procession starting out this way theyd avoid any more of the others logistical arguments on the way off the island by then presumably everything would have been worked outwho was riding with whom who was going to be left behind there was the matter of the two dead cass had told red only that they had been trying to drown smoke red was mystified about how an injured unarmed man could kill two healthy ones but cass was not in a mood to talk in fact that was the last thing shed said to him after theyd agreed that smoke would ride with ruthie on the trailer and the other three would take turns pulling it red was a little concerned about that he was in a lot better shape than he looked he might not be able to erase the effects on his face from all those years on the road but his body had certainly benefited from several years of his abstemious new life no drinking or smoking even before the siege and the construction work hed picked up to supplement his income had hardened him on the island he kept busy he and zihna did yoga together and she could make him break a sweat practicing the most innocuouslooking poses the thought made him smile he and his lovely womanthey had a few surprises in them yet but still they were both in their late fifties roaming like a bunch of nomads with no camel probably wasnt amasanctioned exercise in their case but it would be what it would be he had zihna he had cass he had his granddaughtera granddaughter how the word could still bring him fresh amazed pure joyand though perhaps more problematic he had a fallen hero of the resistance a resistance to a rebuilder movement that no longer existed but still red had taken a little nap earlier but at the first sign of dawn zihna woke him smoke and cass were napping on the trailer with the little girl between them theyd moved the trailer to the space between the house and the detached garage which was hidden from the path by a lattice covered with dead vines if craig and the rest came backor anyone else for that mattertheir hiding place was far from perfect but it beat waiting in the garage like lame ducks zihnad handed him a glass of water and reminded him to drink it all and then she settled into the lawn chair hed dragged in for her and immediately went to sleep with her hands folded over her stomach it was one of her gifts this ability to control her breathing and her worries shed been working on it since she started teaching yoga all the way back in the nineties red was not nearly as good at serenity he could feel his heart accelerating with anxiety as the sky started to lighten it wasnt long before he heard the rumble of the first car the rest followed until the earth thrummed with the rhythm of the engines half a dozen vehicles when youd heard so few for so long suddenly sounded like a busy interstate red was on his feet in seconds remembering a motel he once crashed in for a few weeks in san diego that backed up to the highway night and day the earth reverberated with the traffic going by it used to help him sleep as a matter of fact and when he moved on he missed itbut now the sound filled him with dread time to wake the women a low voice said behind him red turned quickly and realized that hed momentarily forgotten about their cargo his daughters injured lover in the faint light of dawn he found the man making his way to his feet painfully slowly but with his jawclenching determination he did not look much like a victim today he did not intend to be counted out well that was interesting yes indeed friend red answered offering a hand to help smoke he was not surprised when it was ignored so he was not to be the only dog in this race after all red allowed himself the smallest of smiles hed had hundreds of friends through the years though besides carmy he couldnt name a single one who stuck or who he missed when the road beckoned and he moved on aftertime had brought all kinds of interesting times reds way forcing him to acknowledge things hed fully expected to go to his grave without knowing hed fully expected to protect these women all by himself theyd hate the notionzihna would at any rate and he suspected that his daughter would tooand insist up and down that they could protect themselves just fine but red took his latelife transformation seriously and he was damn well going to be a man and take care of his own or go down trying hed never anticipated that hed have company surprisingly the notion didnt leave him completely cold he hid his smile and clapped smoke on the shouldercarefully since the guy was still looking a little tender lets get this show on the road chapter cass knew that redthat her fatherwas right to wait but it was damn hard to watch the procession go over the bridge the vehicles in front followed by the walkers dozens of people dragging suitcases and pushing shopping carts and baggage carts and in one case a wheelbarrow carrying packs and gym bags and tote bags and not feel the terrifying loneliness of being left behind ever since she arrived in new eden that bridge had been the symbol of safety with the sturdy metal gate at the waters edge its roundtheclock double staffing of armed guards seeing the gate open wide the guard chairs empty it chilled her when the last of the pedestrianssteve that wasnt surprising as well as a few other people whod volunteered to form the rear guard behind the slowest walkershad gone a hundred yards down the road toward hollis red said softly okay now but before they could go more than a few feet red stopped her wait he whispered urgently looking back toward the community center cass saw it too two lean figures racing from the wideopen french doors across the yard toward the bridge one was owen mason a hawkfaced man around thirty who raided occasionally and worked at a few other jobs on the island none of them with much skill or attention and wasnt thatit looked like one of the boys sammi ran around with as she watched they caught up with the stragglers and melted into the back of the crowd no one seemed to notice what had they been up to if it had only been the boys cass might have thought they were saying goodbye to phillip throughout the night people had been leaving things outside the quarantine house magazines and mugs and tshirts and dried flowers a heartbreaking if macabre shrine to the feverish boy inside who was probably incoherent by now dementia taking over his brain as he picked at his skin and scalp sammis friends were good kids and all of them had been friends with phillip but owenshed gotten a bad feeling about him from the start and avoided him as much as she could he was justcreepy a shout from the front of the crowd interrupted her thoughts it was repeated voices joining in and in seconds it had gone from alarm to panic beaters it had to be theyd waited too long the council had been wasting time figuring that it was too dark to travel safely and undoubtedly that was trueeven if theyd used precious battery power they could not have safely covered any ground in such a large group in the darkness but apparently on this day the dimmest glow of dawn was enough for the beaters what do we do cass asked hollow with fear to the rear of the crowd they were safe perhaps for a little longer but they had smoke there was no way that he was ready to stand and fighteven if he could defend himself as well as anyone as long as he had a gun we cant stay here red spoke quickly firmly anyone on this island is as good as dead because theres no way to keep them from swimming across now all right lets go zihna didnt hesitate she pushed ruthies stroller with surprising speed and cass followed the trailer moved easily and it was not at all difficult to pull across flat ground let me help smoke protested in the early morning after several hours rest he seemed more recovered than last night he was sitting up in the trailer surrounded by the cans and water bottles theyd packed in a pile of mussed blankets cass put her hands on his shoulders hush now close your eyes rest please smoke please just trust me this time we can talk about it later go go red urged they caught up with the group by the time they reached the bridge but there was a problem the people running back across in the other direction back onto the islandjune karen and then collette the ringleader of their little group her hands raised to cover her ears as though she could protect herself by shutting out the screaming they raced past heading for the community center and others followed the crowd had stalled on the other side of the bridge people shifting around inside it strangely so that it was like a living organism ebbing and flowing across the road spilling over onto the land on either side a cardboard box lay crushed brightcolored fabric spilled out the sleeve of a shirt flung out as if an invisible arm was pointing the way cass scanned the scene for dor for sammi but saw neither and then she heard the cries above the din of the crowd there were five of them standing together on the other side of the road past the drainage ditch and the cattle fencing they must have come across ragged land rather than by the pathwayand worse they must have been making their way entirely by memory instinct smell because in this light they would be essentially blind only able to detect the most basic shapes judging by how the things clutched at each other and stumbled they might have been seeing almost nothing at all suddenly there was a deafening explosion behind the citizens on the bridge followed by a second smaller blast cass spun around to see the community center in flames the top of it blown clear off debris swirling in a redorange cloud behind it the quarantine house was nothing but a pile of burning rubble someone staggered out the front of the community center and collapsed on the porch hair on fire the screaming grew even louder the terrified crowd caught between the ruination of the island and the beaters ahead what the hell was that cass demanded holywho would have done such a thing zihna said and howwhere would they get the there were explosives in the storehouse red said grimly someone must have gotten into them after it was unlocked last night but why whats the point ofanyone in there was doomed anyway maybe this was a more compassionate death cass thought at least for phillip but if owen had been involved she somehow didnt think compassion was what drove him yet there wasnt time to worry about it the beaters had paused at the first flash of the explosions but now they were staggering forward again testing the air with their outstretched hands they must be able to hear our voices or the rumble of the cars red said theyve probably been here all night after they all took off what do you want to bet some of them came back too chicken to come all the way to the water but why doesnt someone shoot them cass cried but it looked like none of the people close to the beaters were armed an escalating roar came from the front of the crowd and then two vehiclesthe old dented accord and a motorcyclehurtled straight for the things the motorcycle gained speed incredibly fast and when it reached the edge of the ditch the driver leaned forward and lifted off the seat a few inches casss breath caught as she watched the bike shudder and jerk on impact but after a split second the rider miraculously righted the bike black hair flashing silver and oh my god it was dor it was dor on the bike and he was headed straight for the clump of beaters and cass was running running through the edge of the crowd knocking into peoplewhy was everyone just standing there letting him do this crazy thingand then there was an earthshaking crash because the car following seconds behind dor hit the ditch and couldnt make the jump its front bumper smashed into the earth and she saw it crumple saw the hood accordion against the berm what the hell had the driver been thinking and who would have even taken such a crazy chance cass ran past the smoking wreck a burning smell coming off it engine whining like no engine should and then going silent a pop another a small defeated dying sound and the windshield was red it was splintered and red and what was that oh god against the glass inside the car that thing that was someones head no matter how many times you saw the many ways a person could die you never got used to it not ever but cass was not fast enough to catch dor and he circled once and came back at the beaters who were moving at full sprinting speed now at full speed himself and smashed into them and two went flying and one went down and one somehow got latched onto the bike and dragged and the bike tipped and hovered defying gravity before it slowmo wobbled and fell and by then cass was there how had her blade come to be in her hand it was her nature now as running had become her nature in the days when she thought everything had been taken from her but she didnt know the half of it the days when she first found comfort in the tarry punishing blacktop of a summer afternoon sweat and ravaged lungs and legs pushed past their limit and now she was a machine of a different sort one who could wield a blade that had become like another arm slash it down on the beater who was crawling on top of dor watch the man whod held her only days ago as he was sprayed with the blood of the monster and heave the thing off of him and step on its skull as she leaped to the next one behind her there was screaming but where were they where was help the closest ones backed away and ran good god they were running didnt they know they couldnt outrun this they had to kill them kill them all because a beater would never stop the cunning hesitation of moments ago when they shuffled and snorted and bided their time that was all over now as their instincts kicked in kill them or be killed kill them or be eaten dor rolled to his knees and swung his arm up and he took his shot before cass could find the killing cut and its skull exploded brains chucking on the ground like a spilled snow cone and then she was being hauled roughly up by the armpit dor yelling to your right and with their backs against each other they stood in the field of gore waiting for the attack and finally finally someone else joined in the fight two more shots from the crowd and dor took the last one down with the gun barrel pressed to its throat as it reached for him hands scrabbling hummingkeening like a lover reaching for him and it never took its eyes off him even as it slowly dropped to its knees a hole in its throat its head finally toppling forward onto its chest as the rest of it sank to the earth are you hurt his hands on her arms hurt his grip was iron cass shook her head then did the mental checklistnone of them had been close enough to bite her the blood alone could not infect the pathogens were in the saliva it didnt matter anyway in her case because she was an outlier but dor already he was stripping out of his coat his shirt his body steaming in the morning chill the sun had inched higher in the sky and his burnished skin glowed rosy cass saw the fine hairs that trailed to his navel the smooth planes of his chest bisected by two scars she knew the map of his body like a town shed lived in forever and she did not look away she knew they all watched but she did not look away she was pushed roughly aside ill check him dana of course it was dana though where the hell had he been during the fight thats what cass wanted to know as the crowd pressed forward stopping at the edge of the rusted and ruined cattle fence some stood in the ditch many crowded around the busted car and then a gasp went up as a small man opened the door and pulled the body from the dashboard so they could see who had died who among them had been brave enough to fight dor grimacing put up his hands and turned slowly for danas inspection there were no marks on him no new ones anyway dor was blessed if you could say that hed been in a dozen beater attacks and survived them all he nodded curtly at dana and started getting dressed dana took off at a half jog to the car that cars not going anywhere but danall probably appoint a fucking committee to make sure dor muttered what were you thinking cass demanded trying to keep the hysteria out of her voice the odds of you landing that jumpyou could have gone on footthey werent going anywhereone more minute or you could have you could have shot them from this side of the fence you could have cass dor paused with only one arm through a sleeve and reached for her he cupped her face with one strong hand and forced her to look at him this isnt the box or havent you noticed that ten of these people arent the man george was or threehigh or joe or elaine if id waited the beaters would have split up and surged into the group and theres no way this crowd could have responded theyd still be standing there with their mouths hanging open and their pants down as they were tore into and theres no telling how many we wouldve lost he let go of her but cass could feel the mark of his fingers on her skin she felt bruised but he was right there had been no training in new eden like there was in the box no drills no security they had the bridge and they had weapons and they thought that was enough it was enough until the day it wasnt and no one including her had seen it coming who was in the car she asked softly acknowledging that he had been right dor frowned pulte shouldve been hank but he let pulte drive first oh no yeah they were going to take turns hanksthere he is hes got the fuel wagon cass looked where he was pointing thereon the other side of the crowdwas the threewheeler elsa had lovingly maintained and even took the kids for rides in it a few times in the yard on special occasions it was pulling a beatup uhaul trailer loaded with cans and gallon jugs and soda bottles all of them filled with gas fucking pulte cass said nothing shed known the guy a little not much older than roan and in fact the rumor was they were together but not until after hed tried with cass he ran hot and reckless and cass had known what attracted him to her and hated it and stayed away and hed found his thrills elsewhere like in that car i have to go cass whispered i hear smokes with you dor stopped her with a hand on her arm his voice hard his eyes unreadable that hes made a remarkable recovery cass only nodded at a loss for words i want to see him it was hardly the time for reunions but cass was not about to argue she led the way through the crowd her heart pounding with adrenaline and fear and something else some vague foreboding about dor and smoke smoke saw them coming and scrambled off the trailer dragging his bad leg he staggered toward them his face contorted in fear and anger dor smoke its great to see you how could you let her take a chance like that smokes voice was choked with fury and he did not take dors offered hand all she had was a blade she youve been gone for a while dor said tightly and slowly lowered his hand shes tougher than you think shes done what she had to do done what she had to do there was no mistaking the implication in his voice and cass shot him a furious look so he wanted their affair out in the open well it was just as well someone would tell smoke soon enough after the scene with valerie at the waters edge it was common knowledge smoke looked from one of them to the other his eyes narrowing i know shes tough macfall i lived with her remember hey red stepped between the two men now is not the time we can catch up later my friends everyones fine thats what matters what the hell cass smoke turned to face her his face twisted in fury and pain what were you thinking i had to they were about to attack dor had it handled he couldnt have held them off by himself then you should have let someone else no one else would tears of frustration stung casss eyes the aftereffects of the adrenaline surge had left her shaking and trembling and she felt dizzy you cant take risks like that you cant you dont get it smoke this isnt like the box these people theyre soft theyre afraid they dont ruthie needs you smoke took her hand and pulled her toward him turning his back on everyone else i need you he added more quietly dor made a sound of disgust and strode away back toward the front of the crowd cass did not allow herself to watch him go she stared into smokes eyes the pallor of his winterskin reddened by exertion and knew that he did not mean that he needed her in order to become whole again or to finish healing it was his spirit he was speaking of but he couldnt know how far shed fallen how little of what was good in her remained maybe hed forgive what shed done with dor but it wasnt just that she was weak now a drinker a shirker of duties if she hadnt given herself away to dor it would have been someone else some other path to release cass was weak she was barely able to take care of ruthie and there was not enough left even for her to care for her own damaged self how could she reconstruct enough of her shattered soul to be anywhere close to what he needed she shook her head zihna she said turning away i think i need to sit down just for a minute and zihna who made a specialty of knowing what people needed pushed aside the blankets to make a place for her and put ruthie in her arms and when the crowd started moving again a few moments later it was red who pulled the trailer and smoke who pushed the empty stroller using it like a walker his face set in such grim determination that cass didnt doubt hed walk to the end of the earth before he gave up chapter theyd gone less than a mile before they heard the cries start up again more beaters goddamn it red said who would have thought the fuckers would have it in them they always go back to their nests at night always cass jumped off the trailer carrying ruthie there would be no time for resting now she craned her neck to try to see but they were in the back of the crowd and all she could see was the others bodies with their burdens and in the front the remaining vehicles she searched for dor found him through the crowd walking near the front having abandoned the downed motorcycle red zihna muttered urgently we need to get everyone to the center smoke was already reaching for ruthie i can get this he said settling her into the stroller you know i have to go cass said his jaw tightened but he said nothing as he fastened ruthies buckle they need me there arent enough who can fight finally he looked at her and she saw the grim determination written on his face it should be me protecting you he said it will be soon i promise get me a gun a blade anything cass looked away yes fine ill see what i can do but meanwhile please please take care of ruthie okay yes of course smoke closed his eyes for half a second took a breath look im sorry aboutwith dor i know i overreacted i know i had no right i just want i need your place is here for now smoke zihna said firmly stepping in between them cass turned away from him so he couldnt see her face caressing ruthies cheek kissing her silky hair go zihna urged her adamantly you too red cass well be fine zihna sammi burst through the press of bodies dragging sage you have to talk to her she wont stay in the caroh my god smoke its really you i cant believe it ahead another of the beaters frantic cries and another gunshots and human screams mixed in with the other sounds in the field ahead the sun breached the horizon momentarily blinding all with the first rays of the day people jostled each other in an effort to see or to flee several ran backward dropping their suitcases headed back toward the island that sounds like moren a handful of em red said grimly god be with you cassie girl cass threw one last look at themzihna and red the girls smoke and ruthieand then she ran she caught up with dor and they dodged scattered and abandoned belongings the cars had pulled bumper to bumper making a barrier and the drivers were out of the cars yelling to each other what now she demanded i dont know dor shot back frustration in his voice theres no coordination nothing he stopped abruptly as they came around the side of the cars there lying in a thatch of kaysev were three dead beaters a man stood a few paces away holding his arm and trembling hes bit hes bit a woman was wailing a dozen paces away there was a commotion surrounding more dead beaters lying on the ground one of the creatures remained on his feet lurching toward a wiry man maybe nathan cass couldnt tell the man dodged close and jabbed and even from far away cass could see the spray of blood from its neck it walked stifflegged in a semicircle before falling to the ground the blood petering out while it twitched that was the last of them that cass could see all the beaters lay dead or dying there were shouts from the crowd triumphant cheers people began pouring around the cars now that it was safe the woman who had been wailing latched onto dor he tried he tried to kill them but that one it bit him youre sure dor said he seized her hand and dragged her away from the man i saw i saw it on the arm the arm the woman babbled and cass saw the bleeding puncture down near his wrist bone he was still staring at his wound at the blood dripping onto the ground his expression a mixture of disbelief and horror dor shot him he moved so quickly that cass didnt even see him reach for his gun and certainly didnt see him aim the man stumbled back and a hole appeared in his forehead so neat and round it looked as though it had been made by a giant paper punch the womans screams turned incoherent and she pounded at dor with her fists but he pushed her gently away and others came forward and led her away from the body what are you armed with dor demanded my blade cass said and i have a spare there are guns on the trailer red didnt think red is not in charge dor said angrily you got that cass you dont follow red i dont follow anyone cass snapped staring into dors flashing ebony eyes but it wasnt exactly what she meant to sayshed followed dor into the canoe hadnt she with barely a thought they found their rhythm immediately the canoe rocksteady as he rowed and she fired and again at the bridge youll follow me now dor growled he put a hand behind her neck and pulled her closer making her falter so she had to grab his arm for balance this isnt about you and me right now we can sort that out later this is about there being too damn few people who know what theyre doing and too many sitting ducks who are going to die if we dont do this right now ive got nathan and steve and brandt covering the other end you and i will take this end well get glynnis out in the front and everyone else will drop back you got that cass nodded it made sense better than anything she could come up with at least while his hand was heavy on her neck his face inches away his eyes reflecting the battleground behind her now take these he demanded releasing her only after he put a gun and extra rounds in her hands up ahead the others were silhouetted against the rising sun leading the edenites across the field but then she looked again it was wrong all wrong they were coming closer not moving away their gait was ragged jerking at least two dozen of the beasts and behind them cass could see more stumbling toward them in groups that split and reformed as they heaved against each other and thrashed their arms and howled gasps quickly turned to screams as the rest of the crowd saw them too dor stepped out in front and fired into the sky everyone listen to me if you are armed and you know how to use your weapon come to the front keep the children the old folks to the back stay put no one goes back to the island its not safe there anymore for a moment there was panic and then incredibly the crowd began to follow his orders cass spotted zihna and red on either side of the trailer pushing it to the back and smoke standing in front of the stroller protecting ruthie with his body he had a gun in his hand one of reds no doubt deal with the ones who come to you dor shouted to her dont worry about the rest ive got it cass readied herself crouching down weighing the gun in her hands getting used to the broad grip the extra magazines jammed under her belt were highcapacityat least a dozen rounds each that gave her thirty shots give or take assuming she survived to reload assuming she was steady enough she wished she hadnt allowed herself to become complacent with the rest of them all those mornings when dor went out alone on north island doing his target practice and running sprints working with the set of barbells he kept under a tarpshe should have been there too shed heard the way people made fun of him calling him rambo but they talked in whispers about her too and it meant nothing less than nothing she had allowed their judgment to matter it was the mistake she seemed doomed to make over and over and once she let their criticism in it became way too easy to go the rest of the distance to become the thing they accused her of but it wasnt who she really was it wasnt here on this field of death cass seized on the lesson shed forgotten in the past few months she was who she made of herself and no other she breathed deep and forced herself to exhale slowly feeling the steel warm to her touch and vowed to survive dor fired and a gangly thin beater whod sprinted ahead of the others suddenly jerked and staggered backward right into the path of another who fell sideways screaming a trio of them ran straight toward her the crowd had dropped back scattering in confusion and she was alone in the open field the target of their focus and their desperation she crouched lower putting one knee to the ground waiting fire too soon and shed waste a valuable bullet and risk scattering them the moment they split up they became ten times more dangerous she counted in her mind mouthing the syllables silently one onethousand two onethousand three down the line shots were fired screams and yelps erupting from the beaters who were hit but cass did not dare take her eyes off her targets closer closer and cass could see the bare swinging breast that hung out of the open shirt one of them wore it had no hair left on its scarred filthy scalp its mouth yawed in a lipless leer and one of its eyes had been ruined the socket red and pulped bone protruding from the edges cass shot that one first she hit its shoulder and cursed as it fell to the ground screaming and immediately started trying to crawl a poor shot nonfatal but at least one of the others tripped over it and cass was able to get a clean shot at its dropping head which opened like a rose the final one crowed waving its arms wildly and cass waited until it was only a few yards away she pulled the trigger and the gun jerked in her hand but did not shoot oh god oh god it had misfiredwho knew where dor had found this gun if this had been the box it would have been cleaned and maintained but no this was new eden land of peace and prosperity and complacency and the beater was coming closer cass fired again and this time the gun responded and the bullet went a little bit wide but it took a good chunk out of the things skull it wobbled on its feet close enough that had it still been human cass could have had a conversation with it spinning grinning lipless mouth opening in a slowmo scream reaching for cass as if it wanted to make a point caress her cheek fix a button cass wavered and wondered if the next second would bring its fetid teeth closing on her skin no no no shed beaten them before somehow she had to beat them again rage uncoiled inside her and she clenched her teeth and adjusted her position distributing her weight better she didnt trust this gun didnt know how many bullets remained and at this range she couldnt miss again she switched the gun to her left hand and grabbed for her blade that at least was as comfortable as it had ever been cass kept it sharpened because she used it for all kinds of tasks in the garden now she held it tightly and when the beater was only a few feet away she dodged around it reached out for its neck from behind and cut straight and deep across its throat she had killed them this way before not often a human throat was surprisingly tough to cut through cartilage and muscle and arteries knotted densely and a beater had been human once it might chew its skin off it might lose digits and eyes and chunks of flesh but underneath its gory exterior it was still wrought of the same innards and she threw herself into the motion and did not hold back and the beaters last cry was severed along with its windpipe as it landed facefirst on the ground the first one that had fallen was crawling toward her its useless arm bleeding from the shoulder wound it was making gasping panting sounds and these too ended abruptly when cass stepped on its shoulders and repeated the swipe of the blade this time leaving the side of its neck halfsevered it gurgled and jerked as it died and cass left it and went looking for dor hed left his own trail of dead behind him two of them mounded together as though they were embracing others splayed awkwardly alone he was standing in the brilliant glow of the rising sun arms loose at his side and for a moment cass thought he was prayingbut when he lifted his gun and jammed a fresh magazine onto it she knew she was mistaken there must be more she covered her eyes with her hand and squinted something sprinted into view and dor took a shot but missed and the thing ran between them it was heading into the crowd yammering as it ran hands flapping why hadnt it attacked them beaters always went for the closest prey it was gospel that the people in front were most likely to die so raiding parties always put their weakest members in the back but this beater had ignored them to go after the others had it figured out that cass and dor were its greatest threat that the weakest most vulnerable targets were the people in the midst of the crowd where ruthie was where smoke was up ahead cass theres more ahead but cass plunged through the crowd after the rogue beater instead she could not let it reach ruthie could not take that risk people screamed and knocked each other over trying to get out of the way but by the time she caught up with it it had seized the pink sleeve of a puffy coat wasnt that mrs princethere was her dull gray hair that shed valiantly tried to pincurl for so long until she finally gave up one day and had tildy cut it all off in a pixie that suited her surprisingly well but the beater knocked her over as easily as if shed been a bowling pin and fell upon her and when cass grabbed its hair because it still had a greasy topknot of the stuff studded with chaff and greasy in her hand she saw that its mouth was sodden with mrs princes blood and the poor woman was gasping through a hole torn from her throat cass stabbed at the beater with her blade slicing through the soft skin under its jaw bringing her arm down again and again until its head nearly came away in her hand and only then did she finally stagger away from the scene of carnage the edenites continued to retreat in every directionthe worst thing they could do inciting the beaters to evergreater excitement she didnt see red or zihna smoke any of them and she couldnt waste time searching she ran back toward the abandoned cars the beaters streaming past the paltry barrier they made there were so many where had they all come from where had they been hiding a couple dozen more at least and more dead on the ground to the right she saw brandt being set on by a clot of the things saw the gun fall from his hand as they slammed his body to the earth in their favorite technique and then each seizing a limb an arm or a leg and then dragging him away back the way theyd come ordinarily they went back to their nests but there were no buildings here only open fields dotted with shrubs and clumps of trees there was a leaning ranch house far in the distance to the east but the beaters did not head that way maybe they meant only to get their prey out of sight to hide in the tall grass to feast no matter what brandt was lost his screams fading as they dragged him away others approached too many it was impossible cass tried to choose among her targets a pair that were making an end run around the panel van bypassing her to get at those behind her and a knot of four or five that jostled each other as they ran she could not stop them all she would die here cass wondered if she could shoot herself at the last minute if she could be disciplined enough to kill as many as she could and save that last bullet for herself rage surged through her but rage would not be enough it could not make her faster or more accurate but she had to try she focused on a squat limping one steadied herself and was about to fire when it suddenly jerked and fell and then the one next to it spun its head burst in a cloud of blood who had shot not dor who was fifty feet ahead crouched over a fallen beater finishing it with his blade the ground pounded under her feet and a blurred form approached moving faster than any human or beater a man on a horse galloping toward them from the east as it grew closer cass saw that it was a brown horse with a white diamond on its muzzle its lips bared in furious effort as its rider dug into its flanks urging it faster leaning slightly out of the saddle as he fired again and there were othersthree other horsemen riding directly into the battle the blinding rising sun had obscured their approach but who were they cass had not seen a horse since early in the siege and the bioagent that killed the cattle and made mass slaughterhouses everywhere but these were healthylooking specimens large and powerful their hooves pounding the dry cold earth the beaters seemed confused catching the scent of the humans on the horses torn between them and the prey on land cass heard the sound of an engine and saw that someone had gotten back into the pickup and was heading straight for the beaters the undercarriage and wheel wells were red with gore from running over corpses it came too close to one of the horses spooking it and it reared up on its back legs for a moment the rider looked as though he would be thrown from the saddle but then the horse settled and braced stifflimbed with its ears flattened until the rider spurred it on again the horsemen circled the remaining beaters cutting them down efficiently in moments there were no more of them on their feet one of the horsemen galloped after the ones whod dragged brandt away and a series of shots proved that hed found them suddenly there was quiet on the field the screams of an injured beater were abruptly cut off when the pickup drove over it and seconds later the driver cut the engine dor turned to the scattered crowd everyone stay together until were sure there arent any more he yelled a few yards from cass mrs prince lay under the beater that had killed her her legs sticking out awkwardly behind her the crowd started to draw back together the silence punctuated with cries and sobs then a new voice rang through the air people anyone with an injury of any sort stand here to my right line up single file everyone else stand with four feet between you and the next person we will come around to check you out please do not fall out of line until you are told to the speaker was the rider of the brown horse a broad man with red hair and a graying red beard he wore sunglasses of the sort that were once favored by snowboarders and skiers his expression inscrutable behind them who the hell are you dor demanded my name is damon mayhew imwerehere to help he gestured at the other riders who had spread out along the front edge of the crowd now cass noticed the gear stowed on the horses packs all of it dusty and hardused we saw your flares we were sheltering a few miles from here to the northeast along the river took us a little while to break camp but we came as soon as we could were obliged for the help dor said but there was no mistaking the suspicion in his voice but ill thank you to let us handle this mayhew spoke impatiently look we can hash this out later right now weve got a real problem and we need to deal with it now we need to make sure no one was compromised we dor demanded his lip curled in contempt we correct me if im wrong but didnt you just get here a few minutes ago mayhews frown deepened but otherwise he didnt react to dors challenge instead he pointed at the ragtag crowd like i said therell be time for this later for now you get one person infected in a group this size think about how much damage he can do not even knowing it even what we have to do anyone who came anywhere near those bastards they strip and we check them out no exceptions all eyes were on dor who glowered at mayhew none of thats exactly groundbreaking he said we have our own procedures dana stepped forward from the crowd only then did cass realize that she hadnt seen him anywhere in the fighting againagain hed stayed behind in safety with the others despite the fact that he was armed and carried a weapon with him everywhere on the island an exception to the councils own policies im in charge here dana said why dont you and i discuss your proposal mayhew your men can start this safety check or whatever you want to call it no dor practically spat the words mayhews right about one thing we dont have a lot of time heres how well do it anyone whos armed who was in the fight we stay away from the others tonight or whenever we find shelter well check then the fever takes at least that long to turn but we can do that on our own mayhew these people dont answer to you they answer to me danas voice rose belligerently youre a laborer dor and a a philanderer were all grateful for your bit in the canoe yesterday but youre not a council member and this isnt the time to start pretending you are the crowd buzzed but no one contradicted dana cass knew it was a critical moment that whoever played the crowds fears most skillfully would lead qualified or not youre weak dana dor said not bothering to hide his contempt youll get us all killed and youmayhewwe dont know you we dont know what your agenda is why should we trust you mayhew was implacable behind his dark lenses you want to know my agenda fine ill lay it out for you we come from the east like beyond the rockies get it were here to help you but unless we get moving were all screwed he reached for his gun but dor was faster his own out and ready before mayhew had his out of his holster im offering to hand this over to you mayhew said tightly mine and the rest of my men as a symbol of trust dad stop it sammi burst from the edge of the crowd hugging herself looking miserable please youre just making it worse she pleaded her face was flushed with anger and embarrassment and cass realized she was ashamed of her father just do what the guy says okay everyone looked from sammi to mayhew to dor dana opened his mouth to protest but then shut it after it became clear that no one was going to be following his notions the resolve seemed to drain from dor as he watched sammi flanked by her silent friends fade back into the crowd dor whod taken the front line without a second thought who was wearing the blood of the creatures that hed killed bowed his head and turned away the crowd shifted its attention expectantly at mayhew i promise that tonight once we find adequate shelter well share everything we know mayhew said as though sammi hadnt spoken were not here to take over your people were trying to carve out a future for everyone and were all in the same boat now that the fevers gone east when you hear what weve got to say you can choose who you want to lead you but youll be doing it from a place of knowledge because right now my friends i think youre acting from fear understandably this man said his words gently his face sympathetic but behind his sunglasses cass was certain his expression burned with thoughts and plans that he wouldnt be sharing as everyone began to divide into the groups he had asked for cass watched mayhews frown curveever so slightlyinto a smile so brief that cass wondered if shed conjured it from her imagination the spoils of dors defeat chapter mayhews men dismounted their horses one of them stayed with the animals as the rest moved into the crowd if you were within eight feet of a beater go with bart here mayhew ordered indicating a tall broadbuilt man with ruddy skin and pale hair cut almost to his scalp if the person next to you was see that he goes those whod stayed with the crowd separated themselves from those who fought some sheepish some defiant soon eight people had assembled around bart cass and dor and five other men and darla piehl who had surprised them all by producing a little from her backpack and hitting a target some thirty feet off the examination didnt take long they took off their shirts and coats and examined each others bare skin cass shivering in just her sleeveless undershirt fat mike squinted at an old scratch shed gotten while pruning tracing its shape delicately with his finger then nodded his approval whats that terrence godin asked peering closely at owen masons shoulder everyone looked to see what he was pointing toa small gash smudged with drying blood got it when i fell owen said i tripped on the first one i put down when i was trying to get close enough to take a shot at the rest terrence was silent for a moment bringing his face closer to the wound i dont know i guess quarantine mayhew said its the only way what do you mean quarantine dana demanded cass wondered if he was beginning to bristle from ceding away his position of leadership and was now looking for a fight you see any like locked rooms we can stick him in around here mayhew stared at him from behind his dark glasses for a moment before answering off his horse he did not seem quite as imposing but he was still well over six feet tall and at least two hundred twenty or thirty pounds his hair held in a loose ponytail secured with a bit of leather cord way we handle it the man walks ten paces behind we post one armed man back there with him deal is if he comes closer than the ten paces he gets a warning three warnings and hes shot not shot to kill but in a situation like this being on the move i guess you dont need me to tell you thats a death sentence anyway there were a few protests from the crowd a crescendo of voices as the issue was debated owen started to object then appeared to think better of it he touched his wound his fingertips coming away bloody and he stared at them for a moment before wiping them on his pants come on dana protested theres no need for that hell be glad to stay back without a guard wont you mayhews right dor who had been standing silently off to the side spoke quietly hed regained his composure since sammis outburst but his eyes were deeply troubled we cant take any chances he continued and weve got to be a lot more systematic about these things you have my vote mayhew his tone implied that his vote did not necessarily carry much respect with it mayhew stared at him for a moment then nodded look youwhats your name owen mason he mumbled but that was nothing new cass couldnt recall a time when owen met anyones eyes when he spoke owen you need to understand that theres nothing personal about this what the hell man i dont even know you how could it be personal ill watch him dana said since youve decided to take over my job mayhew i guess i might as well make myself useful somewhere dont worry owen he walked through the crowd glaring at his fellow council members after a moment owen followed taking a wide route around the crowd already the leper already the outcast we need to get moving mayhew said we need to find shelter well before nightfall so we can set up sentry get everyone fed i think we could have figured that out at least cass muttered there was something about mayhews placid confidence that bothered her or maybe it was only her ageold issue with authority her difficulty with following orders that if nothing else had made the quikgo a perfect job for her after her boss showed her how to work the cash register the locks the lottery machine she was pretty much on her own and she liked it that way the gardening was the sameno one told her how to move from task to task when to start when to end her day im sure you could have mayhew said easily cass is it i dont suppose you want to ride with me no and if someones going to ride weve got some older folks some others who might be a better candidate mayhew nodded raising an eyebrow of course im sorry i should have thought of that maybe you could help me figure out whod be the best to give a breather to cass nodded but as the crowd gathered closer and she helped mayhew sort out rides she felt everyones eyes on her but she couldnt help what any of them thought not her dad or smoke or sammi or valerie she was like anyone else trying to make the best of a bad lot of choices but as two men watched her from opposite ends of the crowd she had a feeling her most difficult choice still lay ahead smoke insisted on walking cass held his hand ready to catch him if he stumbled but he was surprisingly steady tell me everything he muttered through clenched teeth she didnt know if he meant dor but she wasnt willing to go there and so instead she started with the night theyd freed him from the rebuilder headquarters in colima she told him that she and dor had killed four people that night and that other innocent people had died in the fighting when she described the baby farm he winced and squeezed his eyes shut for a moment god cass he whispered did sammi shes fine we got her out before theybefore anything happened but we brought some of the other girls with us pregnant ones one of them miscarried when she got to new eden but the othersones due in a couple of months the others not long after for a moment neither spoke considering the damage done to those girls just another new variety of horror cass told him about coming to the island about the welcome they received in the waning days of the year about the mothers house and the house for wayward girls the social committee and the friends sammi had made she described garden island and the many plants shed cultivated she said nothing about dor and smoke didnt ask that was not the only subject cass stayed away from she didnt tell smoke she was drinking besides she had quit even if she wanted to she couldnt drink now there was no liquor among the vehicles paltry supplies and shed abandoned her halfempty bottle at the last minute so far it wasnt too bad but then again the first few days of sobriety were never the worst the other two times shed quit shed had to deal with headaches clammy skin heart palpitations even a faint tremor in her hands but shed been drinking much more then on new eden she almost always limited herself to just enough to dull her edges which was sometimes harder than being sober she could do this she would do this and not just because she didnt have a choice the last two times shed quit for ruthie in the lonely nights on the back step of the mothers house she thought about quitting so she could gain the approval of the others for ingrid and suzanne and jasmine even last night she had thought she was quitting for smoke but now as she caught him up to the world he had missed recounting the details of the night when she and dor had rescued him from the rebuilders she realized something unexpected shed done a few things right she was far from perfect shed faltered once they arrived in new eden but she had come a very long way with little help shed been strong when the chips were down and brave when courage was called for today shed spilled beater blood and lived to tell about it and tomorrow she would get up and do whatever it took to protect her loved ones she would do everything for them except this one thing this time she was getting sober for herself when she had told smoke everything she could think of he was silent the crowds energy was beginning to flag the scenery changing very little as they traveled north on county roads but at least they had seen no more beaters the men i killed smoke finally said have they been missed cass shrugged weve already lost more than a dozen people people seem to have assumed those two were among the ones who ran back with the first wave ididnt correct them smoke thought about that for a moment before speaking softly were they good men no getting rid of charlesand then youthey took that task on themselves because it excited them i think no one on the council ordered it but but they didnt deserve to die smoke didnt say it but the truth hung between them like a palpable thing his actions were selfdefense she wanted to say and that was true but she also knew smoke knew how he thought and felt honor was everything to him and valor and retribution hed nearly died exacting vengeance and now she wondered if he would punish himself since there was no one else to do the job for him but werent his weeks of pain his scars his severed fingers and broken bones enough they resumed walking holding hands now the children stopped playing lulled by the motion of the trailer and fell asleep like a litter of puppies sprawled together in a heap red took over the trailer duties for ingrid and zihna moved through the crowd talking to the most distraught when they came to a prefab ranch house whose windows were all smashed the leaders in front pulled in and word traveled through the crowd that they were taking a break water and crackers were distributed after cass checked on ruthie still sleeping next to twyla and dirk she took her ration and found smoke sitting with his back against an old live oak whose gnarled branches had once shaded an aboveground pool now crushed and seeping brackish water he made room for her and patted the ground next to him look he said i just wanted to saywhatever went on while i was in the hospital im sorry oh smoke im so sorry i no i want to put it behind us starting now i dontnone of its your fault were together now and thats what matters i came to see you at first cass said unable to cast off her guilt that easily i came every day but you were sobroken cass he tipped her chin up with his fingers so that she would have to look at him please listen to me i mean really listen i dont blame you for not coming i dontif it had been you if i thought id lost you if i thought youd never wake up his voice cracked and he swallowed hard before he could continue i wouldnt have been able to come either i dont think i could bear it cass wanted to let his words heal her wanted to take hold of the branch he offered her but instead her guilt grew it hadnt been fear of losing him that kept her away not entirely smoke hadnt even been gone from the box fortyeight hours the first time she fucked dor and since then it had been practically every opportunity they got yes their coupling was a comfort a desperate response to fear to despair but it was a comfort she couldnt seem to get enough of if smoke knew how often shed been lying in dors arms while he was struggling for his life could he still forgive her if he knew that sometimes when dor touched her she was glad of the forgetting glad to have smoke out of her mind glad to have everything out of her mind would he still want her back what if he knew that the only time she didnt want a drink was when dor was inside her how could smoke ever look upon her with anything but disgust when he understood what she had really become he would turn away from her and it would be what she deserved he would reject her and she would know it was her due and in one small way it would make everything easier because if smoke didnt want her she would never have to choose between two men and if he didnt expect her to be good then she could continue to be bad to fail everyone and everything as long as she took care of ruthie cass could simply cease to try in any other way chapter they passed an uneasy night on a dirt track that had once been used for stockcar racing by the looks of it several years had passed since the stands had been filled with crowds but the travelers were exhausted and on edge despite their promises to explain what they were doing on this side of the rockies mayhew and his men kept to themselves taking posts around the perimeter of the track along with a few of the others and no one had the energyor temerityto complain dana and owen slept under the overhang of the sagging snack stand everyone else clustered close on the center of the track where grass once grew and kaysev now provided a soft surface in the morning a hasty meal quickly gave over to repacking the vehicles and other preparations for travel yesterdays fears seemed both distant and magnified few had slept well and there was a general sense of wanting to put distance between them and the bloody battlefield theyd left behind surely cass was not the only one to realize that the beater threat was undiminished no matter how much ground they covered todayas numerous as grains of sand on the beach they would always be out therebut by the time the pink dawn gave way to day they were on the road again the progress of the crowd was frustratingly slow they stuck to the road leaving the meandering waterways of the delta behind for the flat farmland south of sacramento passing skeletal orchards only now beginning to come back to life acres of table grapevines that were nothing but dead woody spirals clinging to supports at the end of the rows of vines the rosebushes planted to give farmers early warning of fungal diseases were beginning to send up new shoots from the hardy rootstock that had waited dormant for more hospitable times and cass tried to interpret the appearance of the reddish canes as a hopeful omen they skirted small towns taking farm roads to avoid the possibility of beater nests they passed shacks ranches commercial buildings fairgrounds and schools and stadiums and at a distance it all seemed almost normal from time to time a walk in the country on a longago day when ones only concerns were sunburn and getting home in time to catch the game on tv at least the day was warm and clear and the roads were mostly passable twice they had to go around obstructions using the bronco to drag the little hybrid up a steep grade next to a wreck at one point while the walkers edged past on the narrow shoulder and tried not to look inside the smashed cars at the longdecayed bodies inside they had spotted no beaters by the time they paused for lunch in the shade of a billboard advertising the silver bear casino a fact that buoyed flagging spirits and seemed to support the idea that the creatures were avoiding the sparsely populated countryside in the afternoon tempers began to fray smoke refused to ride until hed completely exhausted himself and it was hard to watch his limp get worse as the day wore on ruthie and twyla darted around him playfully when they werent riding on the trailer only the children were in good spirits they danced along the road gathering pebbles and picking the occasional dandelion or wild orange poppy growing at the side of the road occasionally ruthie would come to cass to be picked up snuggled reassured she would bury her face in casss shirt for a few seconds and then shed wriggle down again not wanting to miss any of the fun with the other kids cass marveled at this little cycle courage was not that hard to come by for children no matter the hardships they faced given a little love and encouragement their spirits rebounded and thrived after everything ruthie had been through she was a normal happy little girl again adults were different their habits and experiences made them inflexible welding their routines in place cementing their hurts and joys to create expectations of life that were not in line with the new realities all around her cass saw the dazed expressions and bleak weariness that were the hallmarks of the early days of the siege when the president made his final broadcast a few days before the media shut off forever already secured in the secret location from which his administration intended to navigate the crisis a phrase that was repeated first with reverence and then with derisionwhen the infected entered into the new phase of the disease and began picking at their skin and mumbling when riots destroyed entire neighborhoodsthat was when you began to see people with expressions like these that was when they first took to the roads driving their cars until obstacles prevented them from going any farther then carrying their suitcases and their children until in so many cases they simply sat down in the street and gave up this lot had not given up though they were the ones who survived who had been tough enough determined enough angry enough to keep going eventually finding their way to new eden but as cass watched mrs kristobal shuffling along with tears leaking silently down her face as she watched luddy and cheddar race along the edge of the crowd on their longboards taking greater and greater risks as she glimpsed dor walking alone face set in rigid fury disgraced and powerlessas she took in all of this she knew it was siege days all over again and she feared for their future first they faltered then they panicked and then they began to give up that was how the cycle went and cass knew in her bones they were going to see it all happen again when the sun was low in the sky they had gone a dispiriting ten miles mayhew and the other riders stopped in front of a big house set back along a road lined with dead saplings and the cars pulled off the road and the people followed well go in and clear but we wont say no to a couple of you coming along mayhew called out to the crowd as he jumped to the ground i can take care of the horses valerie stepped from the crowd cass had seen her a few times earlier walking with collettes crowd at lunch shed helped serve people gathering up the cloths and bags in which the cold kaysev cakes had been packed making sure everyone got some water cass had hoped this return to her usual generosity signaled that she was doing better that she was coming to terms with what had happened between her and dor but she meant to keep her distance now she went up to the white horse and stroked its muzzle and patted its muscular neck speaking quietly to it she and mayhew exchanged a few words that cass couldnt hear and then one of the other men helped her tie them to the splitrail fence that lined the drive smoke started to limp toward the men assembling in front of the crowd and cass ran after him stopping him with a hand on his arm what are you doing going to check out the place smoke dont be crazy youre not strong enough you cant smoke put a hand on her face forced her to look at him a couple of days in the sun had restored some of his color and he looked far better than he had in his sick bed ill do what i need to to protect my own he said coldly ill thank dor later for taking care of you when i couldnt but im here now and im taking the job back cass felt the sting of his words the unspoken anger smoke blamed dor not her and that wasnt right it wasnt the whole truth when they arrived in new eden dor had been willing to stay away from her hed kept his part of the bargain and for weeks theyd avoided each other until the day when she begged him to cass felt her face burn with shame remembering the things shed begged dor to do to her with her anything to make her forget for a little while anything to make her feel alive when her path had gone so terribly wrong all the time shed told herself she would stop that she could stop anytime she wanted but just the memory of him two nights ago or the time before that or any of the times just the flash of memory was enough to make her breath catch in her throat and she knew now that she couldnt have stopped he was her addiction her vice her crutch and just as she waited for that first burning swallow of kaysev wine each night so she waited for his touch thinking about it even while she worked the fields or waited for sleep to come or endured the judgment of the other women cass realized that smoke was waiting for her to say something to respond to his declaration i still cant believe youre here she said a poor substitute for what he wanted to hear and pressed her face against his chest so he wouldnt see the turmoil in her eyes for a moment they held each other and then cass finally pushed him away not having the right words to make a promise that she wasnt sure she could keep go she muttered and it was a condemnation as much as an entreaty chapter tildy carmichael joked that the house looked a little like her old pool house in sacramento but her eyes were red from crying her best friendscollette and karen and junewere all missing and presumed dead back on the island blown up in the communitycenter explosion rumors flew about the blast someone had been careless while packing the explosives for travel it had been a suicide bombing by milt or jack who had finally been missed enough for people to really begin to speculate upon it had been a mercy strike meant only for the quarantine house but had somehow jumped to the community center in a secondary explosion the dead had been counted and then not spoken of again as though the edenites feared that the mere mention of their names would bring more bad luck the house was enormous constructed a couple of decades ago when relatively cheap land was enough to entice people to build the houses they could never afford in a city maybe grow a few grapes or keep some cattle and retire a twentyfirstcentury diy gentleman farmer a forsale sign still stood barely in the yard rusting one of hundreds theyd seen so far sad reminders of the waves of financial crashes that came even before the siege whoever had built this house had gone in for details that might have looked a little more at home in tildys old neighborhood than in the dusty central valley the arched windows and columns and faux shutters had not stood the test of time well cheap construction that was easily defeated by the rigors of aftertime the stucco walls had been crushed in places window glass lay in shards on the ground and most unsettling someone had dragged a couple of roomfuls of furniture out into what had been a rose garden the brocade sofas and chairs were overturned and mildewed a home to rodents some were stained a suspicious redbrown that might have been blood baked by the sun still there was an empty fivecar garage that would make perfect shelter for passing the night people wandered the rest of the house while there was still daylight the dormant habit of browsing closets and master baths mindlessly awakened open houses used to be one of mims favorite pastimes shed pretend that she and byrn were looking for a little more space and poke around the most extravagant listings in silva running her fingers along granite countertops and custom draperies and fiveinch moldings with all the other lookyloos the few times cass went along as a teenager she looked for clues to the people who lived there reading the titles on the spines of books checking out framed photographs and the grocery lists people left on their fridges she was desperately trying to figure out how other people managed to live she suspected that the others exhausted from fear and the journey were doing something similar looking for stories that reminded them of another time looking for echoes of their own lost lives in the remains of the american dream the house had already been picked bare by raiders and vandalized mirrors smashed and the remains of unidentifiable food and cleaning products strewn across the floors there was an abandoned beater nest in the formal living room a pile of rags whose stench drove them to close the french doors still if you didnt look too closely if you let your imagination fill in the holes you could imagine the holiday dinners that had taken place in the dining room the kids who might have lived in the rooms upstairs with their wallpaper borders of ballerinas and airplanes cass took the kids to the backyard with ingrid and suzanne a play structure stood more or less intact and cass pushed the little ones by turns in the bucket swing trying to come up with the right words to talk to the others who sat at a picnic table chatting quietly dor came around the house and ignoring ingrid and suzanne joined her at the swing set with a stony expression on his face i want you and ruthie with me theres a room upstairs we can use i can secure the door we all shelter together cass said echoing what mayhew had announced when he and the others emerged from checking the house fuck that dors eyes flashed angrily im getting sammi too maybe her friends i can guard a door as well as any of these guys noi can do it better cass could sense the fury of his gaze on her and she felt her skin flush ingrid and suzanne glanced at each other and cass could only imagine what they were thinking shed caught people staringat her at dor at valerieand she could only guess where she fit into their assessment theyve got a system she said avoiding his eyes and its only one night we can its not only one night its every night were on the goddamn road and those dickheads dont know what theyre doing theyve gotten us this farwe havent lost anyone since they got here right cass dor muttered voice like grinding metal abrading her senses he was angry yes but something else as well not pleading but a man like dor did not plead he did not even ask but in his way in ordering her around he waswhat staking his claim on her reminding her that she belonged with him at any rate and cass knew she should rebel because no one told her what to do anymore she did what was right for ruthie and right for her and now for smoke and everyone else would just have to look out for themselves because she couldnt let them matter so why was she still standing here rooted to the spot the dangerous connection between them unbroken staring into his flinty ebony eyes letting her gaze drift down to his mouth that mouth that was both hard and soft and well talk later she snapped forcing herself to look away and then she took ruthie out of the swing and walked purposefully past the other women she gave them a fake smile to cover the fact that she was shaking all over and went around to the front of the house where they were setting up the evening meal at dinner she sat with red and zihna and the girls sammi was there and though she said nothing she moved over to make room for cass on the soft patch of kaysev where they were sitting wont smoke be joining us zihna asked and cass followed her gaze and saw that he was sitting with what cass supposed had emerged as the new leadership two of the men from the east were busy with the horses that left mayhew and bart along with shannon and harris and neal engrossed in what looked like urgent conversation at the fringe of the group sat dana his back to the others facing owen who sat alone twenty feet away by morning owen would be cleared to rejoin the groupthe fever never took more than a few hours to take hold and the physical signs quickly followed for a moment casss heart constricted at the thought of phillip abandoned in the quarantine house blown into a thousand pieces dead and disappeared on a deserted island where nothing human remained still that was a better fate than the alternative the slow madness the feverish twitching the picking of the skin and pulling of the hair that slowly morphed into an unnatural unquenchable hunger the first nip at your own skin finding it pleasing the pain was nothing against the need the hunger growing and overwhelming whispering in your ear as the last of your sanity slipped away stoking the furnace of desire until you went out into the world no longer human but a thing of singular purpose a hunter of flesh cass had known it she felt her blood warm in horror and shame this was a place she never let herself go this was dangerous but there was owenand in his expression was the faintest doubt wasnt there a darkness that weighed on his features even as he joked with dana and spit kaysev beans off into the side yard he was wondering wasnt he wondering what it would be like and cass was the only person here who could tell him except she couldnt remember frustration racked her stinging her eyes with tears and making her dig her fingers into the dry earth breaking her nails and scraping her knuckles pain helped pain always helped it was her last and often her only defense against the burgeoning anxiety cass was masterful with pain having learned early during the bad days with byrn after cass realized that even her mother would not listen and would not help she learned to use the pain to control the panic afterhe was done she would go to the bathroom and once shed scrubbed herself raw she would get the nail clippers out and use them to snip away bits of her flesh places no one would ever see the tough skin of her heels the calluses on her fingers and the soles of her feet and when that wasnt enough she got the xacto knife from the garage and made tiny delicate curved designs on her thighs her sides so pretty the way the blood bloomed in the tiniest droplets the stinging making her bite her lips why couldnt she remember the scars on her arms had disappeared completely the ones on her back where the beaters had torn into her had faded to burnished whorls one of the hallmarks of the very tiny percentage of the population to recover from the feveralong with the startling bright irises and the elevated body temperature and the speed at which her hair and nails grewwas the hyperefficient healing and even scars from childhood had virtually disappeared cass knew with absolute certainty that shed been attacked and then recovered it was everything that happened in between that haunted her several weeks were unaccounted for shed come to in a field in the foothills thirty miles down mountain from silva in clothes she didnt remember her wounds still weeping and excruciatingly painful her hair pulled from her scalp in a strangers clothes owen set down the plastic bottle of water from which hed been drinking and his gaze landed on her for a moment he just stared and then his mouth curved in a slow calculating cruel smile as if he knew what she was thinking as if he knew what had happened to her as if he knew cass looked away face burning she had been one of them a beater the thought never failed to bring a wave of nausea usually she was able to force it back with sheer will but this time her gut rolled and lurched and she knew she was not going to be able to contain herself excuse me she muttered hoarsely to zihna and sammi whod been talking across her she got shakily to her feet and hastened around the corner of the house where the remains of a pergola was twined with dead vines it wasnt a very effective screen but it would have to do cass knelt on the ground the thoughts swirling relentlessly along with the pounding of her head and the roiling of her stomach shed been a beater a devourer of flesh after she pulled out her own hair and savaged her own skin shed hunted they all did she would have she had hunted and if any human quarry had crossed her path she had done what beaters do because they were driven by one need cass had wished and prayed and offered her soul in the bargain those nights when she could not avoid facing the thing that had happened to her if only she had never hurt a person a man or woman or child while she was changed but that was stupid and she knew it her stomach heaved one last time and cass brought up bitter bile gasping and coughing and retching onto the cracked earth beaters did one thing it would have taken some miracle to keep this other her from following its need and cass was not a believer in miracles she had to face the fact that she had committed abominations that shed done unnatural things evil things cass emptied herself onto the ground while not far away children played and people shared a meal and survivors dared to hope she was only allowed to be a part of this community because they didnt know if they knew what she was they would most likely banish her they might even kill her and she wasnt sure she blamed them when she returned having wiped her face on her sleeve and chewed a few kaysev leaves plucked from a plant that had rooted along the houses foundation to cleanse her mouth cass returned to the gathering as nonchalantly as she could zihna gave her a concerned look but red was in the middle of a story so cass just forced a smile and pantomimed that she was fine then settled back into the group and watched people finish their meal dor was sitting with a group that included jasmine and sunhi jasmine had ridden in the panel van all day but she looked drained and exhausted her enormous belly clearly making it difficult to get comfortable on the ground when dor dragged over a dusty ottoman for her to lean against she smiled at him gratefully dor was incapable of sitting still he was always on the lookout for things that needed doing she was watching him rig a footrest from a sofa pillow when voices raised in argument caught her attention aw man let him luddy said he was talking to dana the sack that had held his dinner dangling from his hand luddy and dana had never gotten alongpunk and dogooder cass figured there were probably some sort of father issues going on thereand it looked like luddy was trying to provoke him as usual come on if he had it youd know by now owen looked on chewing on hardtack luddy was right he looked fine from a distance and it did seem cruel leaving him alone at the edge of the group after their long day dana said something quietly and shrugged but now they had the attention of the rest of the group come on are we really gonna sink to this on our first day out luddy demanded owen got uncertainly to his feet wiping his mouth with the back of his hand stuffing the plastic bag that had held his dinner into his pocket we need to be consistent enforcing the rules mayhew started to say but dor turned on him the only we here is you buddy dor snapped his hands in tight fists at his sides youve done all right so far but i wouldnt start thinking youve got a free ride to go around giving orders that was apparently all the encouragement owen needed he walked toward dana and was only a couple of steps away when a gunshot blasted and he went down a hole ripped in his thigh she whipped around to see whod firedsmoke his gun now aimed at owens heart nobody go near him he yelled not until were sure what did you do a woman screamed stay where you are put that gun away mayhew had drawn too and was aiming at smoke it wasnt an easy shottoo far too many people in the way smoke cass started but he cut her off his voice calm fine ill go myself i am going to walk over and check him ill leave my gun here he slowly lowered it to the ground in reach of cass and away from the children then stood with his hands in the air shoot me if you want but im telling you if you dont know if hes infected and hes close enough to touch a citizen hes the one you need to shoot owen was sitting on the ground whimpering his hands over his thigh blood coursing through his fingers dana had scuttled back a few steps mayhew said nothing for a moment and then nodded there was silence as everyone watched smoke limp painfully toward the downed man when he got close enough he knelt down slowly using a hand on the ground to brace himself for a moment the two men stared at each other cass knew what smoke was looking forthe same constricted pupils citizens checked for at the buddyups and the sheen and flush of the skin if smoke was wrong the man was still as good as dead unless the group was willing to give up a cherished spot in one of the vehicles as well as precious medication but if he was right suddenly owen sprang at smoke knocking him over he pinned smoke and pounded on his chest with his fist yelling curses people screamed as smoke struggled to hold off the attack owen was skinny and now he was also wounded but smoke was exhausted from the day on the road and cass saw that he was weakening fast cass snatched up the gun from the ground and ran stumbling over people and abandoned meals in the seconds it took her to reach them smoke had managed to force owen off him and had rolled to the side owen was snarling and desperately trying to grab smokes kicking legs cass shot him she was running when she took the shot and it went wide hitting his shoulder rather than his head but he stopped trying to grab smoke and lay in the dirt howling and bleeding from both his wounds mayhew came running followed by dor get him still mayhew ordered to no one particular you think im getting close to that dor demanded and then contradicting himself he went within a couple feet of owens writhing body stop flailing around goddamn it he yelled casss gun hand shook if owen wasnt infected then it was the second shot that had doomed him hers there was no way theyd risk transporting a man with two serious wounds a man who wouldnt be well enough to work for months if he recovered at all he didnt appear to hear them he was sobbing as he tried to stem the flow of blood from his wounds dor toed him in the good leg look at me you bastard or ill kill you right now that finally got owens attention bitch shot me he said turning his unblinking eyes up at dor they all saw itcass knew by the gasps from the crowd owens irises were tiny black pinpoints and though he was staring straight into the setting sun he didnt squint at all cass knew she only had a second she crouched down as close to owen as she dared it was you wasnt it she demanded you blew up the island didnt you owens expression turned into a smirk and he looked at cass defiantly were all gonna burn baby its just a matter of when he barely got the words out before someone shot his face off chapter sammi sat on a little swing that had been hung from a covered arbor that once had plants growing on it watching the sky go from purple to gray there were dead spikes on the arbor probably roses or something sammi had seen things like that before benches no one sat on ponds with fountains that no one ever threw pennies in paths that went nowhere just another way for rich people to spend money on nothing shed been sitting here trying to forget what owen mason looked like after hed been shot how half of his face looked kind of normal and the other half looked like a steak dipped in barbecue sauce and covered with pink cottage cheese there was no way she was eating anything ever again and she kind of wished she could just lie down and sleep and not wake up until the world was normal again wondered where you went sammi jumped but it was only colton hed sneaked up on hernot really but he never made a lot of noise he was quiet and sammi liked that most of the time she loved hanging out with kyra and sage but sometimes she just wanted to not talk thats what they did for a while colton put his arm along the back of the swing and sammi leaned into it and that was nice there wasnt anything going on with them despite what anyone thought after jed sammi wasntwell it would be a long time before she looked at a boy like that again if she ever did and colton wasnt like that anyway he never did anything maybe he was gay or something which sammi wouldnt care if he was that was cool but whatever everything was just so fucked up again tears leaked down her face and she didnt try to hide them colton said oh and dug something out of his pocket a rag or something and it wasnt all that clean but it was nice when he dabbed at her face with it that thing with owen jesus he said shoving the rag back in his pocket yeahi know sammi listen i need to tell you about something she said okay but a little warning went off inside people didnt say that unless it was something big something important well it cant be someone else dead right she asked trying for a joke no he sounded even more serious owenhe was into some really bad stuff no shit he blew up the island everybody says so yeah but coltons voice trailed off for a minute and then he took a breath and continued kind of in a rush that wasnt the first time he uh one time shane and me were over at his place he had like a whole drawer full of explosives electronic stuff timers and shit i dont even know what all like to make bombs seriously sammi he scared the crap out of me i think he was going todo something he was talking about taking out the whole island well he just about did no i mean before that he said he was working on something big enough to destroy the whole place i didnt believe him i got the fuck out of there but shane he stayed he told me that owen said there was all this stuff in the storehouse he was trying to figure out how to get it and then when the beaters attacked and we had to leave so fast he somehow got it all out of there owen did or shane owen he didnt have time to rig it up to the thing he was working on the remote or whatever but he and shaneit was them sammi they went back when everyone was on the bridge and they blew up the community center and they blew up the quarantine house shane only went along because he felt bad for phillip he wanted to put him out of his misery butbut listen sammi you cant tell anyone okay you cant tell anyone now owens dead it doesnt matter and shane no one would get it what he was trying to do sammis skin felt cold all of a sudden they blew up phillip she whispered only becausei mean sammi shane said he was thinking about him going crazy in there losing his mind he said hed want someone to do it to him if it was him in there but sammi thought of the last time she saw phillip of his hand reaching out through the narrow slot she couldnt do it no matter how much he was suffering there was no way she could pull the switch or light the fuse or whatever why are you even telling me this because i need a favor chapter in the morning cass woke to the clang of shovels hitting dirt she went out into the mistthickened dawn wrapped in a blanket and watched from the porch as a small band of people dug a shallow grave owens body lay nearby they had not wasted so much as a tarp on him and his corpse awkwardly arranged and graypale in the morning light stared sightlessly into the sky smoke was among their number and cass could see the perspiration on his face as he took his turn with the shovel he should not be exerting himself like that but who could stop him dor had been as good as his word watching over sammi and some of the other kids upstairs when they came down the stairs he scowled at cass she shrugged but her indifference didnt reach inside it was easy to believe as he stepped heavily past her and the other mothers washing their children from a shared tub of water in the houses mudroom that he might have stood sentry all night and she wondered if she were foolish not to take that extra measure of security his eyes were shrouded and tired but his body was tense with stored energy he walked like he was looking for a fight but when he assembled with some of the other new council on the porch as the group loaded up for the journey he stayed near the back and let mayhew do the talking he stared straight ahead detached and almost indifferent as the easterners addressed the edenites many of you have come to me with questions mayhew began he had tied his hair back in its leather string and trimmed his gray beard cass had seen him sitting at a window in the kitchen a small mirror propped on the sill leaning close with a pair of small scissors unmindful of the rottedfood stench in the place and i promised you answers i wont take up too much of your time now because we want to cover a lot of ground today but i want you to know that you can come to me and my men anytime questions concerns what have you last night i think we all learned something red tying down their belongings on the small trailer made a sound in his throat making no attempt to hide his skepticism zihna shot him a warning look id like to thank smoke here for his quick thinking and cass and all of you who shared in the unpleasantduty well its always difficult he pursed his lips and stared at the ground for a respectful moment he was good cass had to give him that hed taken little responsibility for the screwup with owen and yet here he was directing a moment of silence for him and people were going along with it she caught smokes eye he sat on the edge of the porch his back against a column resting his hip he gave little away in the tiny flash of a reassuring smile he gave her so neither of her men was going to challenge mayhew not over this and none of the others who were clustered near the groupshannon neal certainly not dana who was tightly rolling a ground cloth and stuffing it into a small nylon sack his mouth tight and his eyes loweredwould either until six weeks ago we were doing fine mayhew began weall of us herewere on the border patrol across the rockies wed stop people trying to come east now and then heard what they had to say about conditions west of the rockies before we sent em back no one got through no one then one day the blueleaf showed up in our lands too had to be avian migration were figuring but it doesnt really matter because in one weekone weekthere were six cases in town we locked the whole town down put everyone in a sixblock area until we could get a handle on whether it had spread any further but then a couple cases popped up in town five miles away and then suddenly theres rumors of people going missing from one place and the infected showing up wandering around somewhere else feverish its terrible over there now welcome to our world a woman muttered not far from cass but she was quickly shushed this was the first confirmation any of them had of the stories that occasionally reached new eden theyd heard rumors of the arming of the natural border created by the rockies a few months ago when people whod attempted to travel east returned to tell the story there had been a couple of guys in the box who claimed to have tried to cross at the eisenhower tunnel they told of seeing rotting corpses on the west side of i wouldbe émigrés who didnt take no for an answer and were shot for their efforts and left to serve as a warning there were only a few other places where a crossing on foot was even possible and these were all patrolled or landmined there had been considerable resentment of the east after that calls for quarantineyou could hold people for a week and it would be clear who was feverish from blueleaf kaysev and who was not at that pointwere rebuffed by the border patrol who were rumored to shoot not only those who attempted to force their way across but also those who merely argued too strenuously dana looked up from his task his face puffy and pale he evidently hadnt slept well and his expression was petulant so youre just getting a taste of what weve been dealing with he muttered cass couldnt help thinking that what new eden had been dealing with was largely keeping its head in the sand and going soft that until now theyd been well fed and comfortable maybe so mayhew said coldly but weve been sending patrols north too thats where were headed beaters cant tolerate the cold and neither can blueleaf weve got a plan and a destination now look we never meant to come barging in on you and take over but if our two groups pool our resources our intelligence we stand a lot better chance of finding a place where we can build a real community somewhere that we can actually thrive where were not looking over our shoulders every second of the day how far north are we talking phil booth demanded word is if we get up into the cascade range both threats drop off significantly jesus how far exactly how many days on the road mayhews expression didnt so much falter as harden but when he spoke his voice was calm and even encouraging i wont lie to you this is going to be a few hard weeks but think about the alternatives my friends we try to shelter anywhere around here were into the same problems youve already been up against silence people stole glances at each other shuffled their feet fidgeted with their things cass watched dor his arms folded across his chest his jaw set his gaze bored into hers and he did not look away then a woman near the front of the crowd raised her hand it was one of collettes dogooder friends cass didnt remember her name she was still soft through the middle fleshy and wan somehow the beaters the way they learned to swim she said breathlessly everything was fine until a few days ago when they decided to try to get in the water and then it was like they all decided to jump in the water all at once if they can learn that what else are they gonna do next theyve got their own language now a man called from the back of the crowd thats ridiculous dor snapped raising his head and uncrossing his arms craning his neck to see whod spoken theres absolutely no indication of that and spreading rumors isnt going to help you people need to calm down its okay dor ive got this mayhew said calmly everyones just a little on edge sure cass figured darkly watching your friends die horribly might put anyone a little on edge and yet people seemed to find mayhew soothing he stopped clear of taking any sort of vote and cass wondered if it was because he wasnt confident he had the majority convinced yet as they set out into the morning she saw the subtle shifts in the company people were keeping dana walked alone kicking stones and occasionally talking to himself shannon tried to talk to him when they stopped for lunch near a murky pond taking the opportunity to boil water to refill all of their reserves cass overheard a little of their conversation as she took ruthie and twyla looking for pretty rocks in the field next to the pond dont know who he thinks he is dana was saying angrily cass glanced back at them a few times while she and the girls strolled she saw shannon gesturing pleading maybe before finally giving up and going to join the others cass had volunteered to watch the girls to give suzanne a break but the truth was she needed a little time to herself no the truth was that she was fighting an urge for a drink not that there was one to be had but the unsettled feeling left over from mayhews little speech had spiraled into a fullon tangle of worries the sort that usually found her deep in the night days tended to be easier last time she quit drinking cass filled them with work with running with caring for ruthie and she could usually stave off a craving by throwing herself into arduous physical work digging stones from a field weeding between rows anything at all to drown out the anxiety on the road was different she had no sense of control she moved when the group moved stopped when they stopped everyone else seemed to be content knowing only that they were headed north but the uncertainty of the future only added to her anxiety she walked head down with her hands in her pockets reciting the litany of phrases shed picked up in her longago meetings inane little sayings that did nothing to boost her confidence in herself but sometimes occasionally could pull her back into that feeling of thin hope that she really might be able to get through this that she really could survive without a drink if god brings me to it he will bring me through it i am not failing as long as i am trying she heard in her whispered words dozens of other voices since the end of everything she had seen no one from the meetings not one of them they were all probably dead what would they have chosen cass wondered if they knew how few days they had leftto keep coming back or to go on a bender the likes of which no one had ever seen would they have drunk themselves to death she had the start of a headache a faint breathlessness nothing too terrible and food would help she could get through this she could cass looked around theyd walked to the far edge of the fieldstrawberries it looked like the longdead plants choked now by kaysevand there was a worn splitrail fence that might have been pretty if the vines twined around the wood werent all brittle and brown but though cass turned around a complete circle she did not see the girls ruthie she called her voice hoarse twyla oh god she hadnt been watching hadnt been listening shed been lost inside her own head her own cravings for a second cass was frozen in terror and mortification eyes darting everywhere gathering her breath to scream and then she heard their voices bright peals of laughter spilling from behind a tractor that had been abandoned in the field a second later twylas head popped up on the bench followed by ruthies mama ruthie called look were farmers cass forced a smile her stomach seized with adrenaline and fear she felt like she would throw up again but that couldnt happen not here not in this moment of the girls delight oh look at you two she called through a smile she dredged up from her paltry heart show me how you grow your crops and she hastened toward the girls fixing her gaze on their sweet faces if she couldnt beat her cravings then shed just have to outrun them keep running toward the next right thing and the next that night she had thought to speak to smoke to confess how bad shed gotten he would be disappointed in her but he would be compassionate too smoke was like that he wouldnt let her suffer alone and she was willing now to trade a little of her dignity for a few moments of his comfort but as they set up camp for the night in a feed and supply store after first clearing out several longabandoned beater nests and searching the muchlooted supply shelves for anything useful cass could not get a moment alone with smoke his limp was far more pronounced in the afternoons after the day of exertion had taken its toll his face was slightly ashen and she knew he was in pain and yet he wouldnt take a break he helped davis and bartand valerie cass couldnt help noticing with an uneasy feelingto feed and water the horses and then he and mayhew and terrence and a couple other guys made a tour of the other buildings in the town while there was still daylight looking for anything useful they made a decent raiding party well armed and cautious they came back with a few tools and several armloads of firewood terrence had found someones rainyday stash in a canister he shook it out upside down on the fire once they got the kindling going and dozens of bills fluttered down and caught flame the kids laughing at the spectacle but throughout the meal and the cleanup smoke stayed away he talked to mayhew to davis and nadir even to dor for a few tense moments he made his way around to the kids impressing colton and the other boys with a brief knifethrowing demonstration when cass came back from taking ruthie outside to wash before bed hed set up his bedroll near the front along with the easterners and others who were well armed and was already deeply asleep his face sheltered in the crook of his arm sleep was slow to come despite casss exhaustion she knew what smoke was up to because she had seen it before he was doing what he did best building the collective courage of the group just as hed once encouraged and developed the security team in the box and there was no doubt that it needed to be done without the cohesiveness he provided they could easily splinter into factions start blaming each other for the things that had happened so why did she feel so empty every time she spotted him in the crowd yet again smoke was not choosing her he was a good man a great man even these were the qualities that had made him a hero long before his last battle with the rebuilders but in his heroism he acted alone even when hed been working with dor he was solitary when he sought vengeance he sought it for himself he wanted cass with him she knew that but only in the moments left over after hed vanquished his greater thirst to fix a world that he could never forgive himself for allowing to go to hell in the first place cass knew there was something at the core of his drive that hed never shared with her the key to this crushing sense of responsibility the blood thirst he carried with him everywhere he went smoke had told his secret to only one man and that was dor and that was as good as any vault she knew she might never know whatever smoke had done it plagued him consumed him the truth was a lover from whose arms cass could not entice or drag or trick smoke she tossed and turned long after the room was silent dozens of her fellow survivors deep in their own private dream landscapes where the luckiest visited memories of before and others battled horrors real and imagined as people began moving from their homes to shelters during the siege it was hard to get used to the nights at first some people compared it to prisonovercrowding in california meant that many prisoners shared small spaces lined with backtoback bunk beds images of which frequently made the evening newsbut joe one of the guards in the box who had actually been in prison said it was worse worse because at least in prison there were clear hierarchies of power of who got the best bunk who could tell who else to shut the fuck up or quit snoring or crying or beating off joe said it was the politeness that got to him on the outsidewhen the siege made everything part of the outsideeveryone forced to lie next to people they might not even like to quietly endure their sounds and smells and proximity then get up and pretend to have had a good nights sleep cass forced herself to lie still trying to will the thoughts from her mind counting backward from a thousand anything to quiet her restless thoughts when someone whispered her name her eyes flew open to find red crouching next to her a ghostly presence in the glow of a lantern turned low and hung from a nail youre not asleep are you cassie wanna talk she hesitated only for a moment before getting up carefully so as not to disturb the others and following him into the house they felt along the wall in the darkness to the front door where one of the easterners was sitting on the ottoman that dor had brought for jasmine earlier she had nightmares red murmured to the guard were just going to sit out here for a bit okay suit yourself the man said there was enough starlight to find the benches that faced each other across a flower bed they sat close together and red unfolded a blanket hed brought spreading it carefully over the two of them aw cassie darlin who would have thought it he sighed cass couldnt help a cynical laugh who would have thought which part that the world would be taken over by zombies that wed be grazing like cattle on a plant invented in a lab just to stay alive or that by some miracle youd show up in my life again after abandoning me for twentythree years after the words were out cass wished she hadnt said the last part she knew exactly how many years it was since her dad left all those years shed kept track but why give him that satisfaction after all shed long ago quit caring that he was gone it wasnt a miracle red said softly okay a curse is that better you were cursed with having to run into me again in all the bars in all the no thats not what i meant i found you cassie it wasnt an accident a tickle started along her spine um well if you remember you were already living in new eden when we got there so technically i found you and since there arent all that many places to live left out here its not exactly a miracle that we both ended up in the same one know what i mean i dont mean in new eden i mean before that before that when before i came here i lived in the box and i know for a fact you werent there before that i lived in a library and i never saw the day you were taken cass the day you were attacked by the beaters i was there chapter hed still been going by silver dollar then or tom haverford his real name to his oldest and closest friend in the world carmy gomez with whom hed been traveling the highways and byways of the west coast playing in clubs and bars and music festivals opening for other acts and generally making enough money to cover their costs and salt a little away tom had even been paying for rockbottom health insurance really a lottery madoff scheme run by a local charity but even that was a bit of a trick given his lack of a permanent address but lately hed begun thinking about the past about things he wished hed done differently and the last thing he wanted assuming there was anyone who still cared about him was to be a burden to them now when hed managed to be a burden way too many times already in his sorry life his mother over eighty but still hanging on to the little bungalow he grew up in last he called a few months back his half brother burt burt hated him sure but tom figured hed given him cause the way hed tormented him during their childhood his exwife well there was no chance she gave a shit about him anymore still he added her to the list of beneficiaries shed more than earned it and cassie tom thought more and more about the past as the days ticked by he thought about telling carmy about it but carmy wasnt that kind of guy not someone you spilled your guts to even though tom knew his old friend would take a bullet for him carmy had always had a way with people he played bass could pitch in on a set when needed but mostly he was their managerfinagler of gigs extractor of payment riler of crowds and bedder of women he was goodnatured funnyand fond of anything he could snort inject or ingest but they worked around that it was a scheduling thing more than anything carmy could go three four weekends in a row keeping his shit together and then theyd just hole up somewhere for a while and hed go nuts and tom would find a used bookstore or a movie theater or a pretty waitress and while away a week the truth was that tom was content to sit on a beach or in a park or on a bench in front of a city hall or even in a motel room while the rain came down outside and play his guitar and hum along throwing in a phrase or two when it struck his fancy if hed written down a fractiona hundredthof the great lyrics that came to him when he was messing around hed have a million dollars but he was too lazy he just liked playing the things tom could do with a guitar on his best days rivaled anything knopfler had ever done and the crowds would always notice eventually if he and carmy had managed to keep a band together for more than a season they could have written their own ticket but the truth was that their lifestyle didnt suit that many people especially as theyd gotten older sometimes theyd pick up a young guy to sing or play horn or whatever but even they got worn down after a while so be ittom and carmy were content with their lot then in a cheap motel in a little town an hour north of la two things happened first carmy met a woman disappeared for a week and somehow ended up in the hospital with a gash in his chest that he claimed was accidental but which had nicked a lung and threatened to keep him laid up for a while and second tom saw his first case of the fever a woman whod been staying in the same motel even longer than he had and if he wasnt mistaken with whom he was pretty sure hed previously spent a drunken night her name was beverly or brenda something with a b and when he bumped into her on the stairs she reached out to touch his face and for a moment he thought it was an invitation his room was on the second floor hers on the first and hed been trying to figure out how to politely decline the comeon and edge past her he was headed for the bar across the street where he planned to watch the news on the bigscreen tv everything was so fucked up with the terrorists and now the rioting in the cities that tom was starting to get a little alarmed hey darlin in a bit of a hurry here hed said smoothly giving her his best smile thats when she pinched the skin of his jowl hard and pulled his face toward her her mouth opening and her eyes unfocused tom knew now that if he hadnt been so startled that he tripped over his own feet and fell down the stairs that would have been the end of him and he and bev would have been roaming the streets together before long looking for snacks instead he made it to the bar with only a little bruising talked to some folks and figured out that if there was ever a time for making amends it probably ought to be now his exwife wasnt hard to findten minutes on the librarys computer got him her address not five miles from the house hed last called home and within the hour he was hitching his way back to silva the trip was terrifying as traffic from the cities clogged the inland roads and gas stations started putting up signs that said no gas here and the cost of a slice of pie quadrupled he made the last six miles on foot after the driver of the car hed been riding in crashed into a stalled rv all that momentumand when tom got back he suddenly lost his nerve he walked to his exwifes new house and stood across the street for an hour cursing himself for not using the long journey to figure out what to actually say finally he walked another half hour to a bar and got good and soused drunk enough to bloody the mouth of the guy on the next stool over who told him not only did he know cass haverford but hed been a year ahead of her at silva high and had screwed her once in the locker room and once six years later in the parking lot of the same bar where they just now happened to be sitting and so had most of his friends one of whom happened to be at the same bar and who after some hard persuasion was happy to share that shed gotten knocked up and changed her last name to dollar and then he threw in her new address for good measure on the way to his daughters house tom thought about the fact that his little girl had changed her name the last time theyd been together hed taken her to a baseball game and promised her that hed be big someday that the name silver dollar would be up in lights in places twice as big as the stadium hed said she would always be able to find him just by looking for those bright lightsbut that had been a lie hadnt it when he saw the dump his cassie was living in tom suffered an even bigger setback because it had never occurred to him that his little girl despite the benefit of not living under his influence would grow up to be just like him he spent the night in an apartment building across the street from her trailer park someone had broken all the windows in the groundfloor apartment and the occupants had fled but the bedroom still had some furniture in it and tom slept on the sagging box spring with a knife under his pillow the next day while he waited for courage to find him he boarded up the windows and took stock of the place maybe it would do for a few days while he figured things out meanwhile he could keep an eye on his daughters comings and goings except she never went anywhere tom grew bold squeezing between her trailer and the thick oleander hedge that separated it from the next one and peering through the windows the oleander was dying its leaves curling and turning that bakedred shade that signaled death by the biological agent drifting in from its rural targets the government said the stuff didnt pose a threat to livestock or humans but tom figured once it got in the groundwater they were all fucked still he had bigger things to worry about cassie sat on her couch a lot she also cried a lot sometimes she lay on the floor and cried alsoeven worsethere were childrens things in the trailer a crib toys on the floor one of those things you stick them in to keep them still with all the bobbly devices attached to it to entertain a baby but there was no baby tom puzzled over what it all meant he supposed he could knock on the door and ask her tell her who he was and why hed come but all his instincts told him that she would not receive that news well and who could blame her it tore him up more than he could have ever imagined his daughter all grownup and heartrendingly beautiful even in dirty clothes and no makeup had clearly arrived at her own rock bottom as one day turned into two and then three tom began to understand that it was now his lifes purpose to help her back up maybehe sometimes thought during those yearning daysthat had been his purpose all along and every set in every nightclub had just been the sound track leading up to this moment he was determined not to screw it up he considered and abandoned dozens of ideas all around him the town was going to the dogs before long the apartment house in which he was squatting emptied out except for a few of the freaky fever people who moved into the other groundfloor apartment red talked to people in the streets who urged him to find a shelter thats what everyone was doing moving into movie theaters and city hall and grocery stores big open places where they could pool their resources and keep the scary fuckers outthe rumor was that they were starting to attack people and infect them too rabies theyd called it if only and frankly tom thought everyone was right that until someone got a handle on this epidemic holing up like scared little girls was exactly the right thing to do the fevered were terrifying as shit but he wasnt about to leave until his daughter did by then hed evolved a sort of planwhen cassie moved into a shelter hed just follow along and see if he could get into the same one when they were safe and maybe fedtom was getting damn tired of eating out of cans and he wasnt keen on eating the kwhateverthehell the government was calling it like a damn horsethen hed test the waters and figure out how to tell her who he was he almost missed it one morning she walked out the door carrying a duffel bag and tom only saw it because the plumbing had stopped a few days earlier and hed gone out to take a morning whiz against the side of his building he followed her not even bothering to go back for his few toiletries afraid to lose her when she went to her mothers house tom was surprised hed sort of thought they were estranged when she came out a little later carrying a little girl he was stunned he followed them to the library but when she went inside he stayed out he wanted to come in meant to planned to but this was truly the end of the line if she said no to him now if she didnt want to see him here where else could he go across the street that was where from the upper floor of the municipal center in a big room still decorated with crepe paper from a bat mitzvahmazel tov jessicahe watched the sun go down on the library and wondered if this was to be his lot until the end of time stalking his daughter too afraid to come close too desperate to make amends to ever truly walk away from her she came outside the next day looking like his little girl again the grownup version anyway the smile was back on her face her clothes were clean and shed pulled back her shiny hair her necklace glinted gold in the sun she walked tall cradling her own little girl in her arms pointing out the clouds and the mountains to her when they got to the curved drive cassie set the baby down to play and she toddled around the driedout lawn the little girl had the pale fine hair and big round eyes that cassie had had at that age and toms throat closed up with emotion and for a moment he felt like he was looking through a lens that erased time almost three decades and he wanted to run and swing her into the air and make her a promise that hed never leave her but just when he was thinking that this time he might actually take the first step someone screamed and tom had the terrible premonition that he had waited too long that fate waited to snatch away the daughter he did not deserve you were there cass asked softly i was there cassiei always wanted to be there with you i justwell i fucked it up i was a fuckup i admit it and i know admitting its not enough really i do id have to live nine lives like a cat to make it all up to you but all ive got is this one redher dadreached for a corner of the blanket that had fallen from casss shoulder and tucked it up around her again and she saw that he was shivering here we can share she said and shook the fleece out and let it drift down over both of them scooching closer as the soft fabric settled she leaned against him lightly it was probably wrong it was definitely stupid to trust him like this when hed been in her life for whata couple of months if he could even be believedand out of it for decades but aftertime had a funny way of jiggering the math of coming up with conclusions that werent supported by the facts because the factsdeath and infection rates life expectancies chemical hazards the evil hearts of humanswere devastating on their own unleavened with little miracles like hope and forgiveness and redemption tell me the rest tom was paralyzed leaning on the secondstory window frame and looking down at the scene across the street hearing the screams coming from the librarys little entrance area where a few people had been smoking and getting some air the entrance area would have been a good place to play because you could get back inside and slam the door shut in mere seconds but cassie hadnt stayed there she had wandered out to the circle drive with her daughter and they were bent down looking for bugs or something oblivious to what was going on around them when the screaming started cassie lifted her head and looked for the source of the trouble already scrambling for her daughter but the little girl pranced out of the way focused on whatever caught her eye on the ground and then tom saw the things four of them bursting around the corner running like a bunch of drunks on wobbly legs grabbing at the air and making gobbling soundsheaded straight for cassie then he ran too down the hall the stairs stumbling and slamming into the wall of the stairwell but he didnt care he got to the bottom andunbelievablythe door jammed tom heaved and kicked and when he realized there was no way he was getting through he ran back up to the second floor and down the hall to the front apartment he yanked up the window roughly and crawled out onto the ledge and dropped aiming for a hedge feeling the dead branches scrape his flesh as he landed and rolled and then he was on his feet and running and just in time to see the things dragging his beautiful girl away holding on to her legs and arms tom didnt hesitate for a second but he knew he had to be careful had to be craftier than they were because hed heard tales of what they could do and he would be outnumbered and outmuscled if they turned on him he didnt much care if they ripped him to shreds but he had to get to cassie first had to get her away from them before they bit and infected her it wasnt that hard to keep up with them racing along dusty backyards catching glimpses of them loping down the street dragging his poor little girl along the road swinging her from their crabbed hands shed gone limp and he hoped and prayed shed gotten knocked out somehow because he couldnt imagine anything more terrifying than to be carried by these monsters and know there was no one there to help you and no one around to care about your fate but thats what hed always done wasnt it hadnt tom left her behind half a dozen times before heading down the driveway when she ran out after him clutching his hand with her little ones holding on to the car door when he started the engine bursting into tears as he drove away hed always promised to be back againsoon you wont even notice im gonebut somewhere on the inside hed known that the promises were a lie there was always a new town a new gig a riff he wanted to try or a song he wanted to cover or a woman with long eyelashes and satiny shoulders and the roadthere was always the road calling to him seducing him making silvery promises that he couldnt resist tom ran faster sickened by his many failures hed trade his own future his own life to give cassie another chance the monstrous things turned onto a small alley and headed for a shed a nice one someone had built the right way timber construction over a poured foundation one of the barnstyle doors had come off its hinges and was leaning against the building letting light into the small building it was a mess garden tools and a rideon mower and cans of paint strewn everywhere in the center was a thick mound of rags and tom understood that this was their home that they had brought his daughter here to eat her now he didnt worry about staying hidden he ran into the open like he was on fire ignoring the burning in his lungs the pain in his knees he got there as they threw her facedown onto the nest and fell upon her he saw them pin her down with their knees watched them rip the clothes from her back they were screaming nonsense syllables now something that sounded like mammammammam and he thought he might vomit when he saw that one of them was actually drooling a long string of saliva falling from its mouth that was the one that tom tried to pull off first but it only lashed at him with surprising strength before returning to the exposed flesh of his daughters back red was flung back against the wall of the shed hitting his head on a bare stud knocking over a bottle of coolant that hit the floor and burst open pink liquid seeping everywhere a sharp note in the nauseating smell of the nest frantically red looked for a weapon he heard his daughter moan and saw the things bite into her tearing open her skin rich red blood pouring from the wounds later he would wonder why it didnt occur to him then that she was lostthat she was doomed to the disease in those seconds infected like the rest of them but he was frenzied in his purpose determined to stop them at the cost of anything his life the world the universe anything at all his hand fell on the handle of an axe tom swung the axe up and over his head before he was even fully aware of it its weight as familiar as the boots on his feet tom had been raised high in the sierras where it took two cords of firewood just to get through a single winter and as the only son of a working man hed split more than his share of good dry mountain pine the scent of the sap and the seasoned wood coming back to him now in a rush as he brought the axe blade crashing down onto the neck of the beater whod shoved him cleaving his head off and burying the blade into the floor inches from his daughters hip he took a little more care against the second one because he was for damn sure not going to hurt so much as a hair of his daughter and he sank the blade through its shoulders severing the spine and lodging the axe so that it took some effort to pull it back out only two of the things remained now and they looked at him curiously they were covered now with the blood of their companions cassie unconscious beneath them one crawled toward him right over the body of his daughter and for that affront earned itself a blow from the side the axe head hitting with such force that the skull cracked and splintered like an easter egg that left the last one and it glared at tom with its mouth wide open bellowing in rage and excitement tom saw with disgust that it had bitten off its own tongue leaving a ragged lump of meat bobbing in its mouth it sprang at red knocking him down the axe falling from his hands the thing was about his size and weight but as it threw itself on top of him and knocked the breath from his chest screaming one last time in triumph before lowering its bloodspattered scabbed and mangled face to feed on him tom realized that he was going to die here in this shed covered with the blood of the monsters that the earth had spawned and his daughter would die and would never even know that he died for her that realization twisted him savagely jerking him back he put everything he hadevery synapse every nerve ending every muscle and thoughtinto one last heave and the monster toppled its face hitting the floor and even though it recovered immediately and twisted like an eel to grab him again at the ankle red had found the handle of the axe and he was just a little bit faster a little bit wilier and a hell of a fucking lot more determined than some mindless feeder and it was an awkward blow that last one without the benefit of a good windup or gravity on his side and when the blade crashed down it didnt finish the thing off entirely so when tom used the last of his strength to pick up his daughter and carry her from that hell place the inhuman mass watched from the floor its neck broken and bleeding its eyes blinking and fluttering and though its cries weakened and its body twitched it was still scrabbling with its brokennailed fingers to reach her that night tom didnt get very far he found shelter in a house a few blocks away he dragged a dresser in front of the front door and ran the taps dry collecting the water in every pot in the kitchen as the sun slipped down and the light bled away into night he bathed his poor daughter so gently laying her out on a rug in the bathroom letting the water run onto the floor where it pooled in the tiled corners he gently squeezed the water from what was left of her hair and more water seeped into the cracks who was going to care if it ruined the walls below her wounds were horrible entire strips of her flesh missing muscle and sinew and even bone exposed but somehow the bleeding had slowed and he was able to bandage her roughly with sheet strips torn from one of the beds and supplies he found in the linen closet if she died that night it would not be for lack of effort on his part when hed wrapped her as well as he could finding some soft knit pants a sweater socks in a closet he placed her tenderly on the bed in the master bedroom and arranged the blankets so that they would not weigh on her wounds still she remained unconscious her eyelids twitching and small mumbled syllables escaping her from time to time he kissed her forehead her hair her fingers and then he gently closed the door to the bedroom and sat down in the hall outside a knife from the kitchen in his hands and several more on the carpet at his side and as he waited for the long night to pass he prayed for god to understand that he had done his best and would do his best again and again as long as he demanded it chapter cass barely remembered to keep breathing while her father told his story hed been there hed been watchingkeeping vigil reallywhile she and ruthie played outside in the sunshine how many times had she berated herself for her foolish choice she knew better than to risk venturing outside the walls of the library and for such a poor trade shed exchanged their safety for dandelions when surely she could have found ruthie a dandelion growing in the sheltered courtyard for the same breeze that blew through the screens in the conference room for a chance for a few moments of alone time with her baby girl when she was dooming them both to a solitary death cass had replayed those moments outside a thousand times in her mind shed opened the librarys heavy metal door giving the frowning door guard a sunny grinno one was forbidden from coming and going at least not back thenand let ruthie scoot ahead of her out into the bright sunshine of a spring day shed promised ruthie that she would show her the paving brick that had her name on it the one bought by her mother and stepfather during the librarys fundraising campaign the prior year before anyone realized that the world was about to end ruthie had skipped and sung clapped her hands in delight at the tiny yellow buttons of dandelions growing among the kaysev shed picked a handful marveling at the stems bitter milky juice and cass had been so busy being grateful for the moment that she never saw the beaters until it was too late but her father had been watching over them hed set aside his own safety for them and the novelty of that knowledge was warm and curious unfurling slowly inside her mind hed cared about her enough to search for her enough to fight for her and as for not being able to gather the courage to come straight to herwell cass was certainly not one to judge shame had prompted a thousand of her own missteps and mistakes and if things might have been different if her father had knocked on the door of the library before cass ventured out that day well she had learned that you could never rewrite history that fate would always prevail she had not winced and she had not looked away when her father described the carnage in the shed she was trying too hard to remember but nothing she had no memory of the things carrying her to the shed no memory of their teeth tearing at her flesh no memory of the axe and the blood and the screaming and her father lifting her cradling her rescuing her the baththere was something there a faint shadowy flicker a notion of floating of water sluicing away her blood cool and healing making her weightless maybe it was nothing but a sense memory of unconsciousness but cass wanted to believe she could remember something good shed seen reds gentle way with ruthie and the other kids surely hed been just as gentle with her already she was intoxicated with the notion that he cared for her that her father disappeared for so long loved her shed despised him for so long disguising the pain of his abandonment in stubborn fury but all of that was slipping away as he talked she knew it was supposed to take a long time she expected to take a lifetime to forgive him as so many of the people at the aa meetings made clear early hurts were often permanent but aftertime a lifetime was a luxury that could not be counted on if she ever hoped to forgive she had to start now if she hoped to absorb the fact that she had been loved she had to seize it and hold fast she wanted her father to keep talking to keep spinning this tale whose words felt like silken strands weaving themselves into a shield that would protect her evenespeciallyfrom her own selfcontempt onlythere was more to the story a lot more not least of it the fact that when she woke she was alone so i never woke up no not that night and not for a long time after cass was silent thinking about her father keeping sentry outside the room she wanted to know if he had the beard then or if he was cleanshaven the way she remembered him she knew it didnt matter and she wondered anyway what did you do in the morning she asked instead tom shrugged there was a car in the garage an old honda civic beat to hell my guess is it was a kids car or a second car or something keys on a rack by the door believe it or not it couldnt have been much easier i got you laid out in the backseat took everything i could from the house medicine and food and whatnot clothes pulled up the garage door and off we went kind of amazing now that weve all heard the stories cass knew the stories he meantby that time there were roving bands of marauders at the edge of town who waited for cars to come by and then shot out the tires they were after the gas the things people carriedthe sport later youd find these cars abandoned at the side of the road often with corpses with holes in their heads draped over the seats or on the ground shot in the back when they tried to run away so no one stopped you no but it might have helped that i went all back roads i knew enough to avoid any of the main roads but mostly i thought i was avoiding the beaters he laughed mirthlessly i guess i didnt understand them very well id a made a shitty anthropologist i figured theyd stick to the main roads because it was easier or somethingi was probably giving them too much credit well at least you were right about one thing if youd gone on the highway you probably wouldnt have made it far yeah as it was i just took farm roads and dirt roads a lot of em i hadnt been on since i was a kid but its funny how that stuff stays with you why did you go down mountain as opposed to up red shrugged no good reason i guess i mean if id had the balls i would have taken you back to the shelter i guess but i thought ruthie was dead and i figured you didnt have long for the world you mean because i was infected well hell yeah i thought there was no way youd survive so why casss breath caught in her throat and she took a minute to steady herself before trying again why didnt you just kill me red didnt answer for a moment but his eyes shone wetly in the darkness i couldnt he finally whispered cass nodded the strongest mensmoke and dor among themhad become killers in order to be merciful the ones who couldnt kill an infected person ended up bringing more misery for everyone but she wasnt in a place to judge she herself had walked away from a victim nearly senseless with shock and pain after the skin had been chewed from its body unable to do what needed to be done leaving the job for someone else its just that it was you red said someone elsein the days that came after that i did have to kill twice people who were infected one asked me to onewell no sense dwelling on that now anyway i got almost as far as the foothills but it took me all day kept having to go around wrecks and shit even on the back roads saw a couple beaters too scared the crap outta me so when it started to get late in the day i just picked out a farmhouse one of those ones on cattle acreage up on a rise drove up and moved us in thats right near where i woke up cass said haltingly the first thing i remember is lying in this field in clothes i didnt remember with all these halfhealed cuts but this could be good news if she had woken close to the place where her father had taken her then it stood to reason that she hadnt had time to travel very far and the less time had passed the less distance she covered the lower the chances that shed encountered any humans any victims if shed been alert and conscious long enough to escape from the farmhouse then she had to have been practically recovered shed tired obviously and lain down to rest spent a night perhaps lying under the moon in a field not far from where her father was frantically trying to find her but the next day she woke for real and that was when her real memories started and there was one other thing cass realized with growing excitement if shed been recovering the fever would have been driven from her body and it only made sense that its effects on the brain had disappeared as well simply put she wouldnt have been hunting whatever caused her to leave the safety of the room where her father had kept herhunger thirst boredom restlessnessit wasnt flesh lust she hadnt consumed for the first time since that day cass was sure that she hadnt attacked and feasted hadnt doomed another innocent to the fever the realization was dizzying and she felt for a moment that she would faint she clutched her fathers arm and a small exhalation escaped her sounding almost like a sob goddamn red said misinterpreting he wrapped his arm around her comforting her in a way cass had not been comforted in a very very long timenot since she was his little girl its my fault i didnt have a way to lock the doors to that place from the outside the day you disappeared i was only planning to be gone an houri just went looking for more food hell we could have survived on kaysev but i hate that shit and i wanted to feed you better the tears cass had been holding back spilled over how to tell him what she was feelingthat shed given up on being cherished like that no mannot even smoke whod loved her well and attentivelyhad made her feel as safe as she remembered feeling in her fathers arms but she felt suddenly shy this was all too new and she had to absorb it process it before she could trust the feeling to last she brushed the tears from her face counting on the darkness to hide the gesture kaysevs the best thing you can eat she said lightly its good for you i never was good at knowing what was good for me soyou fed me howd you do that werent you worried about getting infected well you were in and out kind of i know you dont remember it but youd kind of wake up now and then look around a little say nonsense things it reminded me of this one time when you were little and you got a really high fever i sat with you while your mom was at work you were just a little jabberer saying all kinds of crazy things you sang to me cass said suddenly remembering yeah i guess i probably did she had a thought did you sing to me this time i mean in the farmhouse red laughed honey when i figured out you were getting better i sang all the damn day long how long did that take just a few days at firstdont get mad cassie honey but i had you tied up i figured i had to you know i dont blame you i cass hesitated and then decided to take a chance share at least some of her fear with him thereve been a lot of times i wondered you know what i did when i was sick when i wasone of them red cursed and grabbed her shoulders turning cass toward him hard cassieyou were never one of them never you didnt do anything wrong sweetheart not one thing all the fear that cass had stored up threatened to tumble out she struggled to get herself under control and nearly succeeded and then a sob escaped her for real this time and her father pulled her close and hugged her hard and let her cry its just that i i saw what i did to myself i mean it had to be me on my arms even my knees and i thought if i could do that then was i out hunting did i attack people did i hurt them oh god i was so scared but cassie nothing bad happened after a few days your fever broke and your eyes got normal again i mean the irises anyway they stayed bright and that green like they still are so i wasnt positive at first but man i prayed like hell sometimesaw shit ill go ahead and say itsometimes maybe i thought i prayed you well the deals i was putting out there for god if you only knew i must have offered him my soul a dozen times over red squeezed cass even tighter crushing her against him but she didnt care you let me feed you almost like when you were a baby and sometimes id catch you chewing on your arms but you never came after me mostly you just slept a lot real restless like you were having nightmares so i sat in there with you and sang yeah and when you ran out of food yeah so i left and like i said i was going to come right back but it took me a while to find a house that hadnt been raided already and when i finally got backyou were gone i dont i dont remember it the house or leaving or anything i went nuts i looked for you for hours i finally went up and down the road used up the last of my gas before i figured out you must have left the road covered some serious ground im so sorry i put you through thatdad red went still hearing her say his name and then he awkwardly patted her on the back its nothing baby angel look at us in this whole damn state of california we found each other again if that aint the answer to my prayers well i dont know what is why didnt you tell me sooner because im a damn coward is why i just kept biding my time and biding my time zihna tried to get me to say something a dozen times but i was so scared id run you off that if you knew who i was you wouldnt want anything to do with me and then when youaw honey i dont know how to say it but youve got your share of troubles and i didnt want to make them worse ive tangled with the bottle myself cass felt her face go hot with mortification it was on the tip of her tongue to deny it to say it wasnt a problem that shed quit well she was oneday sober anyway and shed been in that scary place twice before and managed to stay for a while maybe this time it would be a longer while maybeno she wouldnt tempt the fates by asking for forever not yet you wont make it worse she said softly but you can help me make it better chapter it was another thirtyfour miles to the next big town where there was a huge shopping mall that was rumored to be sheltering close to a hundred citizens at least that was true a couple of months ago jay and terrence and the other raiders hadnt traveled this far since before the new year they didnt want to waste the gas since everything raidable this far north was the domain of the mall shelter by dint of the common law that had evolved as shelters consolidated bigger groups tended to be more successful since they could post roundtheclock sentries and assign specialized tasks and send only their strongest and fastest out to harvest and raid the last anyone knew the mall shelternicknamed macys after its onetime anchor storewas holding its own dor himself had sent a guard there earlier in the fall to spread the word about the box and find out what the macys people could tell him about the rebuilders progress this was the only reason cass could figure that the new leadership invited dor to participate in the earlymorning discussion she wasnt spying on them exactly they were sitting in a loose circle on the front driveway using the abandoned furniture and breakfast was being served under the houses broad front porch rain threatened the air heavy with stinging moisture thick gray clouds low in the sky cass had taken ruthie around the back for their turn at the bathroom and on the way back she stopped to tie ruthies shoe it was an old ruse cass didnt care the feeling she got from mayhewthat he was hiding something that he had an unspoken agendahad only grown stronger shed slept well after her talk with her father the night before but when she woke up the easterners were conferring quietly inside the house so this was their second meeting of the day and cass couldnt help wondering if there were things that had been said earlier that were being left out now that edenites were listening but no one else seemed to care once they got moving everyone stayed in more or less the same configurations as before though smoke joined those at the front keeping up despite his limp cass walked with her father and zihna though the other moms had invited her to join them in the car it seemed like their relationship was warming and suzanne thanked her for letting twyla stay with ruthie alternating between walking and the trailer as they had the day before throughout the morning the group had a bit of a festival air there was food for at least a week including all the cans theyd been hoarding in the pantry and theyd had a good breakfast the rain held off the clouds rolling and gusting no one spoke of those whod been lost though the bitter count lay just below the surface of everyones minds a week ago new eden had been home to seventy citizens after the battles on the water and on land the people dragged away and shot and blown up in the community center they were down to fiftyone plus the four easterners cass was walking by herself along the abandoned twolane highway pushing ruthie in the stroller taking a break from the company of the others to think about her father she had replayed the conversation from the night before a dozen times and every time she felt the thrill of relief when she realized shed never harmed anyone while she was feverish relief was not a big enough word to contain the feelingit was joy mixed with disbelief a sense of good fortune so unexpected that she was afraid it was illusory that it could disappear the same way it came to her but it had come to her via her father her dad cass smiled saying the word in her mind a word shed never expected to use again she knew she needed to be cautious to prepare herself for the inevitable disappointments that would surely follow to remind herself that her father had hurt her grievously and that leopards dont change their spots to use an old saying of mims that the more she trusted him the more she risked but she was just so damn tired of protecting herself all the time didnt she deservejust a little just for nowto see where this went to maybe enjoy it a little a glimpse of orange caught her eye off on the side of the road where the asphalt was broken and kaysev had taken root theregrowing practically sideways under the gray chunks and clodswas a california poppy its wiry stalk and fringy leaves strained to poke through to the air and it held one tightly rolled bud and one fragile bloom a tiny spot of brilliant tangerine that wavered and trembled in the breeze no one else seemed to take note cass pushed the stroller fast murmuring oh ruthie babygirl youre not going to believedo you remember but ruthie was dozing lulled by the afternoon sun and the rhythm of the big rubber wheels on the pavement and it was cass alone who stroked the tender petals caught a breath to see that there were others small and stunted seedlings close to this first one she thought about calling to someone zihna sammi her dadbut they were hidden in the depths of the ragtag group making its slow and stolid way along the road and her moment of ebullience would not withstand their indifference better this way keeping the bloom to herself remarking on the poppys return with the joy of one whod loved them before the poppy was a challenge to cultivate seeds often failed even under the best of conditions transplanted seedlings nearly always died but wherever the native plant rooted on its own it was tough and wily it could grow in the smallest crack the meanest soil it was not daunted by weeds or sought by predators up close it was indelicate even coarsely figured its leaves stubby and its stem workmanlike but from a distance there was nothing like that glorious shot of pure color cass smiled wondering what it was about this particular spot this homely stretch of road in the midst of dead fields that inspired the poppy to grow here it was not for her to knowbut perhaps it was no mistake that she was the one who noticed it she didnt pick the flower let it go to seed let the seed scatter and find its way across the healing land for now it would remain her secret by late afternoon the rain began people were tired from walking tempers were thin and fears had resurfaced and they spent a cold and uncomfortable night at a stable sleeping on the malodorous straw in the stalls the next day dawned clear and brilliant water sparkling on the kaysev leaves and spirits were restored near evening they disturbed a clump of beaters sunbathing on the turf of a mini golf course in front of an rv campground the things rushed out hollering but john and glynnis riding sentry with nathan in the hybrid at the front of the crowd picked them off easily the campground would have made decent shelter with its large bathhouse but everyone was too skittish from the beatersand who knew if there werent more beaters that belonged to this particular nestso they went a couple more miles and sheltered in a trucker rest stop smoke continued to keep his distance he was polite to cass solicitous of ruthie but he was dividing his energy between pushing his body to catch up from its forced inactivity and conferring with the new council each night he slept elsewhere bunking down with those closest to the doors the guards and the raiders zihna is he crazy cass asked as they walked along in a steady drizzle on the fourth day everyone was miserable their clothes soaked people were beginning to sniffle and cough and it seemed like a spring cold was starting to spread through the group sunhi was riding with jasmine who had started her labor that morning it looked like her baby was going to be born in a moving car zihna narrowed her eyes thoughtfully she was taking her turn at her insistence pulling the trailer ruthie and twyla were playing with a bowl full of pebbles that they had collected from a landscaping bed at the rest stop protected from the rain by a popup play tent that ingrid had brought chattering and laughing i dont think hes crazy she said i think he hasnt been entirely truthful what do you mean well you know im not a doctor but these last few weeks i couldnt figure out why he was gaining his strength back so quickly and now it makes sense he was awake he was pretending during the day it makes me want to kick myself course since i could have saved him a lot of trouble by just talking to him and you know ive talked to plenty of patients that didnt talk back only with smoke it had been so long and it was likewell nobody was coming around to see him anymore i know its my fault its no ones fault im just saying he started to seem like i dont know we were always so busy and we had omars burns crystal with the staph infection charleswe all just started treating him like an object ahouseplant and the whole time he was you know coming back to life well look at the man ive never seen that kind of determination smoke walked a dozen yards ahead hed set his cane aside today it was resting on the trailer a long tree branch trimmed and sanded for him by steve the first day of the journey thats smokedetermined cass said softly she could give a thousand examples of her own how hed scavenged lumber in the box until he could build her a bed frame how hed stayed up with ruthie two nights straight when she had strep throat how hed killed a man whod just saved his life but been bitten in a beater attack how hed gone hunting the rebuilders alone outnumbered outmatched hungry for justice and willing to sacrifice everything he cared about to get it how quickly do you think he could get backi mean i know hell never be exactly like he was before but you know back to himself hard to say when he really was unconscious his body was focused entirely on mending first order of business was to fight off the infection he had when he got here rebreaking his arm set him back but sunhi was right it was the right thing to do the limp hes gonna have that for a while maybe forever everything elsewell hes doing exactly what wed tell him to do work on those muscles rebuild kaysevs probably perfect fuel for him hes doing everything right darlin he just seems sospent at the end of the day well you would be too with a regimen like that bet every muscle in his body is screaming she smiled slyly or are you really asking me something else likehow soon he can expect to be sexually active zihna cass reddened in fact that hadnt been what she was askingand then she wondered why not why she hadnt been stirred by him the way she used to be in the box because let me tell you ive seen every inch of that man and i didnt see any evidence of injuries that would prevent a full recovery heck probably be good for him stop it i didnt oh come on its just us and its perfectly natural where do you think me and your dad get our robust good health oh zihna you do not need to be telling me that im barely used to the idea that hes my dadi dont think i want to know anything about hisabout hiseww zihna turned serious honey i know what youre saying its different when someones your parent but you might want to keep that in mind when youre dealing with sammi sammiwhat does she just your relationship with her is importantshe needs other adult women in her life not just me and the quality of that relationship is going to be dependent on how you and her dad are getting along or to be more specific the state of things between you tworomantically zihna cass said softly do you um i would hate it if you thought i mean things have been so weird with everything and ive done things i shouldnt i know i dont think badly of you zihna said cheerfully squeezing casss hand if thats one of your worries you make your own choices and as your friend my only hope is that you learn from the wrong ones and enjoy the right ones and while were talking like this i am very glad youre going to quit drinking i hope you dont mind that your dad and i talked about it cass blanched and for a moment she did mind she minded a lot and then the anger subsided and cass saw it for what it wasthe desperation of the addiction trying to maintain its hold on her shed been here before and she knew what she had to do fake it till you make it that was the programs answer andannoyingly frustratinglyit worked so she would pretend she didnt mind and pretend some more until one day it was a little bit true and the next day it was a little more true im glad you and he talk she said as evenly as she could i wouldnt be here without him i would have given up they walked in companionable silence for a while where did he get the name red cass asked she could see him up ahead walking with earl and old mike talking she recognized his gestures now that she knew it was him perhaps shed noticed them all along somewhere deep down there it wasthe way he rubbed the back of his neck when he was considering something the way he stabbed the air with a finger when he was making a point i was the one who gave him that name zihna said actually we named each other once we decided to make a go of it and we were on the road on the way to new eden though we didnt know it at the time we had plenty of time to talk and it turns out neither one of us much liked the names wed been saddled with what was yours zihna grimaced mary chastity oh no cass laughed and then zihna was laughing too your dad said that didnt fit me at all and then he told me that zihna means spinning in hopi and well i thought it was pretty and what about dad was he still going by silver dollar yeah he was showed me this old band flyer he used to carry aroundhammerdown featuring silver dollar haverford you knowi took his name when i turned eighteen cass dollar its legal and everything mostly i think i just did it to piss off my mom well how about that zihna grinned save that up maybe tell your dad the story one day when he needs a lift i think hed get a kick out of it sohow did you come up with red well i asked him if i should just call him tom but your dad said it brought back memories hed rather forget that he wasnt proud of being that man and hed just as soon start over with something brandnew and i said anything i want and he said yes anything and i was going to tease him and maybe call him skeeter or something but he was soserious her voice went soft and dreamy and cass felt like she was intruding on a private moment your dad can be a very serious man for someone who makes me laugh every damn day zihna said smiling but cass didnt miss the way she wiped her eyes with the back of her hand anyway when i was a little girl my grandfather used to listen to this old comedian named red skelton we kids thought that was such a funny name it made me think of a red skeleton you know the bonesanyway your dad has this amazing thick hair for a guy his age and when the sun hits it just right i swear theres these glints of red cass laughed i think youre just a little dazzled hes pretty much gray all over but secretly she was having a hard time keeping her emotions reined in it shouldnt matter to her what her father did who he was after all this time but then again why not let it matter but thats just it everyone has their own reality right i mean we see the same things but the thoughts in our head and the experiences weve had all of that changes things so the pictures we carry around with us are all different like look up therelot of folks would say thats a ruin a junk heap cass had been walking and thinking not focusing on the horizon but up ahead the torn flags and hulking wings of the mall stood out against the steely damp clouds but for a lot of folks thats home now i imagine its got a certain kind of beauty when you think about how it couldnt be much more secure how its probably got a pretty good stockpile of necessaries plenty of room to spread out cass tried to see what zihna saw but instead she got a deep foreboding a tightening in her gut that could not be entirely explained by the bad architecture and gloomy weather we shouldnt go to the mall she breathed whats that honey i have a bad feeling about the mall well lets just send these east coast yokels in then zihna laughed i dont much care for them theyre kind of uppity cass forced herself to brush the feeling off it was true that they all needed a rest and a chance to dry out as well as to restock their supplies if possible there was the unspoken but very real hope there might be room for at least some of them to live in the mall too at least for a while but the idea of all that concrete so few windows she wished shed appreciated the freedom of the island more the ability to step outside her home without worrying about beaters to walk in her garden without looking over her shoulder every second so many days and nights on the island she worked so hard to forget that she failed to take notice of the good thingsthe beauty of the moon reflected in the river the wind riffling the reeds that grew along the bank the laughter of the children playing in the yard the only time she let go of the tension lodged inside her was when she was with dor it was no wonder they came together with a passion that was almost violent they both had so much loss to obliterate and thats what it had been wasnt ittearing holes in their dreary and painful reality and letting in sensation longing even joy if only until the tears skimmed over and their lives were shut tight again and now even that was lost to her but she shouldnt need him anymorecass berated herself she had smoke now her heart her love dor was in the past just a phase shed gone through a crutch shed relied on as soon as smoke was well as soon as they were settled it would be as before the two of them together being everything to each other onlysmoke had been spending all his time with the new council reunited only days he was already strategizing and planning eagermaybe too eagerto work with the easterners it wasnt glory he was after cass was sure of that but something elsesomething familiar something she had thought had hoped he had left behind on the battleground where he killed the rebuilders he was still avenging even after the rebuilders were no longer a threat he was seekingsomething maybe not vengeance exactly but atonement and still she didnt know what he was atoning for the thing that had always been between them was still there he cherished his selfpunishment more than anything else in the world and nothing could banish it nothing could ever be enough hed almost given his life as trade but even that was not enoughas his strength came back he was already seeking ways to matter ways to give give of himself and there would never be enough left over for her knowing that had chilled casss feelings no longer did her heart race at the sight of him no longer did the brush of his hand against hers excite her he kept his distance and she if she was truly honest with herself kept hers maybe the mall would be a fresh start maybe she needed time to be alone without any man at all she had a lot more in her life than she had a few weeks ago there was red for starters a father shed given up for dead for lost there were the moms the fragile peace between them there was zihna and sammi and the other kids and always always there was ruthie it would be work all the complicated messy relationships shed damaged and scorned learning to trust and to earn trust to take risks and take deep breaths try again and again until she got it right but god willing there would be time for that too youre right she said to zihna as cheerfully as she could fake it till you make it its going to be fine chapter someone had been working on the mall parking lot the cars had been dragged away from the innermost spaces around the central entrance and an area had been walled off with chainlink that looked like it had been scavenged piecemeal and then welded together inside the fencing were mismatched outdoor chairs and tables that looked like they had been taken from several different restaurants a fire pit in the center made from stacked brick pavers was blackened and piled deep with ash they left the vehicles and horses at the far edge of the parking lot there had been an undercurrent of excitement buzzing through the crowd all morning a yearning to be indoors again to see other citizens but the council insisted on a break before they went inside a chance to eat something and drink water no one argued experience had taught them to take dehydration and hunger seriously enough that they broke their progress for a meal of kaysev chewing methodically and with little satisfaction the mothers coaxed the little ones to eatcolton and kalyan practiced tossing hard little dried kaysev chips into the air and catching them in their mouths people goodnaturedly cheering them when they managed a direct hit still the excitement and anticipation were palpable when the meal was finished the group hurriedly assembled and made its way through the parking lot threading through the maze of cars a few were parked neatly as though their owners had come for a final trip to buy a sweater or a tube of lipstick but many more were abandoned haphazardly crashed into others or blocking lanes nobody looked inside the cars the smells had abated but you never got used to seeing the decomposed corpses the hair that was still styled the way it was on the morning they died the leer of exposed jaws and teeth always making cadavers look cheerful and jaunty in stark contrast to the horror of the eyes which were often eaten away by parasites or dried to thin flaking tissue but there were always remains outside of cars in places like this people who waited until hunger or thirst drove them out of their cars who made it a few yards or even a few hundred yards until they were set upon and devoured these bodieslittle more than skeletons their clothing ripped from them and abandoned nearbywere the worst and cass and the other mothers held their children close and shielded their eyes from the sight of them dor had somehow managed to get sammi talking to him in the past couple of days and though she didnt look happy about it she and the other kids stayed close to him the girls whod escaped the rebuilders had remained silently loyal to him after they reached new edencass wouldnt be surprised if dor planned to protect them all other little cliquesvalerie and her friends luddy and his corryn and rachael and the other kitchen staffmerged into one tight group as they neared the doors a hand on her shoulder and there was smoke his cautious smile id like you to remain near me before she could respond mayhew leaped nimbly to the hood of a blue sedan at the edge of the cleared area the rain had abated and weak sunlight forced its way through the clouds and cass had to squint to look at him everybody his voice carried easily through the stillness of the parking lot rebounding faintly a trick of echoes davis and nadir went ahead to check things out they found a couple of old kills around the corner so we need to be careful i think were better off all sticking together and going in once we get the lay of the place we can send some folks back out to deal with the cars and the horses all of this was already in place of course so he wasnt so much asking permission as building consensus not so different it occurred to cass from the way new eden had been run and mayhew was good at it too playing on peoples fears at the mention of the beater kills the crowd seemed to press in on itself did they see the beaters a woman calledmaybe cindy cass thought the ones who did it or the nestdid they see the nest i think they may be using a mechanicals shed for a nest mayhew answered easily keeping his voice in a reassuring even timbre makes sense theyre around trying to get into the mall since theres folks sheltering there did you talk to anyone inside dor stepping out from the crowd not exactly we got a visual theres a what do you want to call it like a sunken lobby in the middle bunch of coffee shops and restaurants seating there were about eight or ten people there but davis couldnt get their attention from up here through the windows thats good glass by the way solid as all heck just needs some windex he smiled at this joke a gesture reminiscent of television so maybe we should send in one or two people first dor said ignoring the few titters mayhews joke earned his tone making it clear he thought mayhew was an idiot before we risk our entire population what do you think mayhew stared at dor without blinking and the people in the crowd looked back and forth from one to the other cass knew the popular opinion had swayed to mayhew but there was enough uncertainty that she knew the outcome hung in the balance between them the way to risk lives is to keep standing out here where theres a known beater threat he said impatiently davis saw citizens they were sitting together talking eating whatever just like you guys were doing a few days ago just like i was with my own loved ones a few weeks back look at least two of you have been here recently and confirmed that its a friendly group if you call two months recent dor cut in his voice rising angrily things change fast as i guess you might know mayhew and so i suggest we break into this door here and if nothing else well have a warm and dry place to let the kids run around a little mayhew continued as though dor hadnt spoken you wont have to break in this group doesnt lock their doors from the outside dor said disgusted the mechanical ones dont work at all but theres a safety latch on the emergency doors under the push bar the beaters havent had the dexterity to work them so they leave them unlocked so citizens can come in quickly they only lock them on the inside so much the better mayhew smiled his expression chilly he walked over to the door and ran his hand along the bar there was a click and the door opened okay look macfall if it makes you feel any better ill go first we can keep the women and kids in the back lets just get in there everyone can take off their packs rest a little while we look around talk to the folks only a damn fool would go in alone dor said and strode to the door guess were two damn fools then mayhew said sarcastically but i appreciate the company anyone else the easterners stepped up as well as a few others the rest of the crowd murmured approvingly clearly the popular vote was for mayhew again they entered single file nadir holding the door open inside there was a faint hint of the smell that permeated every mall before industrial cleaners and plastic and perfume but there was also the shelter smellnotes of burned food urine and bodies living in close contact with little opportunity to bathe oddly cass found it comforting i think you should carry ruthie smoke had appeared quietly at her side and stay in the back of the crowd with me so he felt the same as dor and as cass herself that there was something off here but she wasnt about to stay outside without protection from the beaters no matter how long it had been since theyd swarmed in the area she picked ruthie up without a word hello mayhew called as the crowd walked along the broad hallway into the malls upper floor the entire ceiling was made of glass and plenty of natural light filled the open areas many of the storefront windows had been shattered the contents looted but the debris had all been swept away and the mannequins and displays stacked against the walls leaving most of the stores clear in the center as they passed cass could see that many of the clearings had been made into homes shelves held personal possessions stacks of clothes stores of food curtains had been hung to lend some privacy to the living quarters posters and lamps and other merchandise had been moved into the spaces to personalize them other than the fact that everything was new the atmosphere was not so different from the middle of the box where the employees made their permanent homes but where was everyone the group reached the rail overlooking the atrium just as mayhew had described there were restaurants with tables arranged in the center area even evidence of a recent meal dishes and cutlery on the tablesbut no one was around so where are all these citizens you were talking about dor demanded they were right down there one of the easterners said puzzled we looked in from that window up there theres stairs up there from the parking lot there were at least eight of them before mostly women maybe theyre cleaning up they must have a separate area for the kitchen a hollow sound stopped him footsteps echoing from around a curve in the hall that led to another wing a man stepped into sight he was goodlooking exceptionally so with curly brown hair and wide blue eyes he wore an expensivelooking red sweater that fit him well his mouth curved in a hint of a smile and he moved slowly confidently a hint of swagger in his stride there were weapons on his belt but he made no move to reach for them hi he said from behind him three more people followed two women and another man all of them looked healthy and well fed if slightly disheveled hi one of the women said touching her hand to her face none of these others held weapons good to see you mayhew said stepping forward with his hand extended were up from the south a shelter about fifty miles from here new eden you know it eden said the man eden the uneasiness in casss gut unraveled into fullscale alarm something was wrong very wrong those people she said to smoke theyre not right mayhew reached the little group and stood awkwardly for a moment with his hand extended after a pause the man in front reached for his hand and they shook im damon mayhew the man stared at him with his mouth suddenly slack havoc havocim sorry sorry the man repeated with an odd little grin then he lifted mayhews hand to his face as though he meant to kiss it with a courtly flourish and cass screamed and kept on screaming joined by other voices other terrified edenites because instead of kissing mayhew the curlyhaired man licked his wrist delicately and mayhew who hailed from the east and had never seen a beater in the early airy stages of the disease who had time to run but didnt didnt didnt stood there doing nothing while the man smiled wider and then nipped into his skin with perfect white teeth mayhew yelped and jumped back grabbing his wrist with his other hand but not before cass saw the little jagged rip dotted with blood the man whod bitten him had been recently turned still had the initial shine of the fever and he would not attack this little group would not tackle mayhew and drag him away to feast upon even though cass now noticed the cuts and scabs on their hands and wrists a gash on one womans face the rosy sheen and bright eyes that were the hallmarks of the sickness in this phase they merely nibbled idly on themselves and each other their bites more exploratory than savage nothing like the ravenous hunger that would soon follow in their fever they practically glowed mayhew still didnt understand what was happening rubbing at his arm and scowling but the edenites did they ran most ran back toward the doors theyd entered through though a few raced in the other direction toward a t in the rows of shops cass had ruthie in her arms and smoke at her side and they were not as fast othersincluding the easterners who finally figured out what was going onpassed them by hurtling with a speed born of terror go on smoke yelled at cass take ruthie just go he was fumbling at his belt he had his gunthey had red to thank for that casss father had outfitted smoke with his secondfavorite piece in a gesture that seemed oddly oldfashioned a courtly tradition of another era now she was grateful now she understood what smoke meant to do and prayed for the bullet to find its target the curlyhaired man went down first his head canting to the side in a burst of blood his body thrown against the half wall overlooking the atrium his hands clutching air smoke shot mayhew second taking off the top third of his skull dropping him to his knees with a surprised expression on his face and as smoke fired twice more and casss ears rang with the echoing report the thought that came to mind was that mayhew would never know why hed been killed hed never know why the people of new eden turned on him but he should have on this side of the rockies at least everyone knew everyone had seen a new beater and knew they were every bit as deadly as the oldest ones that shambled flayed and broken toward their inevitable end the female beaters lay on the floor one of them silent and still the other gutshot and trying to move shrieking in pain and rage crawling over her own entrails toward them smoke fired again and she crumpled like a moth hit with a garden hose but the screaming continued and smoke grabbed casss arm and pulled her toward the walkway bridge that led across the atrium to a victorias secret store that still bore a pinkandred banner decorated with sequins and stuffed felt hearts thats not the that was all she got out before one of the easterners the barrelchested lisping one named davis ran past her knocking into her with his shoulder spinning her against the wall then she saw what he was running from three of them much further along in the disease old beaters whose flesh hung in ribbons from their chewed and wasted arms and whose faces were a ravaged tarmac of wounds and self inflicted assaults lips chewed away and broken teeth eyebrows and eyelashes long ago ripped out with the nervous savage fury of infection these creatures were not handsome like the ones whod greeted mayhew damned spirits with one foot in this life and one foot in hell gorgeous with the first flush of the poison their skin radiant and their eyes bright and depthless no these were the befouled foot soldiers of the curse their humanity drained from them as they mortified themselves obscene stinking mad lustful organisms of hunger and need these were the ones who mustve breached the mall somehow compromised a barrier or overwhelmed a guard forced their way in and found their prey captive and defenseless trapped in a prison of their own making who knows how many theyd devoured until momentarily sated theyd let some of their prey live and those the newly turned were the ones who doomed the rest just as owens curse would have spread like wildfire throughout the edenites had he lived the barely feverish had doomed the other malldwellers until the entire place was one giant festering nest of beaters all of them longing for uninfected flesh it was nothing she hadnt seen before nothing any of them hadnt seen before except perhaps for the easterners so perhaps davis could be forgiven his terror his desperate attempt at selfpreservation that left cass reeling and struggling to hold on to ruthie come on smoke yelled again waiting until she took his hand ruthie was heavy and restless in her other arm wakened from her peaceful afternoon slumber yet again by tragedy and disaster cass could tell that smokes strength was ebbing his body racked with pain and his muscles weak but he kept up the pace past a cosmetics store a kitchenware shop to a clothing store that still all these many months after the final shopper overpaid for the last logoembroidered shirt still reeked of a signature cologne cass had hated malls the chemical smells and lack of natural light the forced cheer of the window displays featuring impossibly thin mannequins and spotless suburban tableaus all of the tableware and underpinnings and electronic toys and scented candles the thousand varieties of crap that didnt even add up to a single decent meal aftertime all of this the entire compendium of suburban marketing fraud coursed through casss mind as she allowed smoke to shove her and ruthie inside the somewhat fortified store im going back for your dad and zihna he said and then in the dim motespeckled light of a postconsumer skylight in what had been a shopping mecca before he seemed to be about to kiss her he stared into her eyes and ran his fingers through her hair and pulled her closer but in the last minute one of them hesitated one of them flinched and cass would always wonder which of them it had been because all she remembered of the moment was the cornflowerblue of his eyes and the regret that he couldnt love her enough couldnt love her as much as his cherished ideal of justice in the next instant he was gone chapter smoke had seen carnage and smoke had killed men but the bloodslicked panorama before him caused him to suck in his breath for a moment he thought hed vomit and he leaned over the stuccoed wall heaving and gulping air ready to unloose himself onto the vinyl sofa directly below the moment passed in a second a fraction of a second disgust was not an emotion he could afford to indulge smoke swallowed down his bile and plunged forward at the entrance half a dozen citizens were throwing themselves against the doors using their bodies as battering rams locking the exits from withinthe shelterers had mistakenly believed they were making their small world safer protecting their number from the temptation of outside never anticipating the horror theyd accidentally spawned smoke could not help them now at this point his focus needed to be on the threat of the moment the beaters had dragged off their first victim a slender middleaged woman with long graying hair they wrapped through their decrepit fingers for leverage smoke recognized hershed asked him if she could help him when his bum leg gave him trouble offered him half of her lunch but now she was being shoved facedown on the floor in the entrance of a hallmark card shop behind the broken glass windows were canting displays holding mothers day and graduation cards and giftsbecause it had been that season hadnt it a year ago when things fell apart the woman screamed and gargled in terror as the creatures yanked her limbs straight out and knelt on them he could hear the ripping of her clothes as they were torn away her back was smooth and pale and then it disappeared under the four monstrous heads as they assaulted with their wide greedy mouths their sharp and tearing teeth anyone whos armed help me he bellowed shooting into the writhing mass one of the beaters squawked and fell away its face slimed with blood and its mouth wide and grimacing but immediately squirmed back into the feeding frenzy dragging one bloodied arm uselessly at its side no one seemed to have heard him so smoke shot at the doors hitting the reinforced metal above their heads the sound echoed all around them and several people screamed or fell and the crowd tried to run in both directions if no one helps me were all going to die here he yelled before turning back to the beaters he edged closer to the mass trying to find his opportunity he managed to get a clear shot at the woman when one of the beaters threw his head back to tear a long strip of flesh from her back down near her buttock smoke aimed for the back of her head and tried not to see it burst focusing instead on the beaters now sprayed with her blood and brains and enraged to find their quarry unresponsive their angry cries ricocheted and echoed down the mall and he glanced down the corridor to the farthest end where people poured out of a jcpenney a dozen two dozen more of them from this distance they looked normal orderly a congregation emptying out after church fans leaving a stadium patrons leaving a bar at closing timeonly they walked with a certain shuffling unsteady gait and they bumped into each other and occasionally lifted their fingers to their lips and chewed the new ones the ones who if theyd come a week earlier would have still been living here as survivors not so different from the people of new eden or the people of any shelter making the best of things trying to scrape together enough optimism to see them through another day when somehowa door forced open an hvac duct a tear in the cheap stucco wall the things hunger driving them to tear and chew through insulation plaster whatever it took until they reached the inside of the mallthe beaters got in and all it would have taken was a few bites a population like this trapped no light at night all those halls and empty shops and dark corners for hiding like thisit would have spread geometrically madly instantly with nowhere to go the mall sealed shut tight save the one breach the uninfected didnt stand a chance hordes of the things outside inside would still seem more survivable all of this flashed through smokes mind while he was shooting then reloading from the stash in his pocket there was more ammo on the trailerbut the trailer was out there in the parking lot the bullets were slippery in his hands maybe twenty of them and he jammed them into the cylinder with shaking hands while the beaters grew frustrated with their immobile unresponsive meal and howled their disappointment they liked it alive theyd eat a dead body if they had to but with far less zeal theyd wander away from it and circle back grazing on the corpse for a few days as children might pick at a fruit bowl if denied their halloween candy but for now with the air pungent with the scent of living citizens they would lose interest in the dead woman and come after the fresh uninfected in fact it was already happening two of them had turned away from the womans bloodsoaked naked body and were crawling slipping on her blood toward the crowd of terrified people one tried to rise slipped and fell down again its elbow cracking on the hard floor smokes damp and trembling fingers had not managed to load the entire cylinder but there was no time and he jammed it shut and fired the way hed practiced so many mornings in the box on the fly his body turning already to the next target but before he could aim the thing lurched sideways taking a shot in the upper chest not a fatal injury but enough to slow it down smoke looked for the shooter and saw three of the others nofour all armed one man with only a bladecoming tentatively closer smoke shot the last two uninjured beaters in quick succession and they collapsed on top of the poor dead woman one of the edenites a short wiry woman ran to the beater that was crawling along the bloodslicked floor jammed the muzzle of a gun against its forehead and fired getting splattered with gore smoke approached her wary that she might fire again hey he said gently putting a hand on her shoulder dont get so close if you dont have to thats taking a hell of a chance the woman looked at him wildeyed her mouth trembling its just i never shot a gun before she said i wanted to make sure i didnt miss damn the last thing they needed was weapons in the hands of people who had no idea how to use them whose gun is that its somesomebody dropped it over there you did good smoke said taking it carefully from her hand pushing the barrel down you didnt miss not one bit what do we do now one of the slacker guys the ones who had been skateboarding along the edge of the crowd was tugging on smokes sleeve like he was five years old smoke didnt bother asking him if he was armed theres more of them down there did you see did you oh jesus whatre we going to do i saw look maybe you can help out here okay smoke pointed to the entrance lobby where several people had been knocked down in the panic to reach the doors one woman had a gash on her forehead and was leaning against the locked door crying how about you see what they need okay the boy turned dubiously toward the fallen yeah i want to help and all but then do it smoke had run out of patience he scanned the mall in both directions saw a couple of the easterners conferring at the junction with the other wing past half a dozen storefronts they at least were armed and there there was dor working at the heavy door someone had hacked away at the hinge and the thick metal had split exposing wires from the security system and the mechanical closing mechanism next to him was sammi holding something a narrow tool of some sort her face was pale but as her father worked she remained steady handing him what he needed from a small leather bag smoke recognized that bagback when hed been secondincommand in the box he remembered dor carrying his tools with him on his belt back then theyd been useful for repairing sections of the chainlink fence that surrounded the boxor for opening the occasional bottle of beer after a good raid how many mornings had the two men trained together how many overcast days and chilly dawns had they raided together watching each others backs at each unfamiliar house each closed door theyd been as close as two men so stubborn could be aftertime sharing confidences and eventually trust as the weeks turned into months and they soldiered on together and all that time smoke thought dor didnt like cass shed told him so herself described the way he avoided her never looked her in the eye found an excuse to leave whenever she arrived at the fire or one of the foodmerchant stalls where hed been passing the time but smoke had never bothered to wonder why dor avoided her so studiously if he had if hed paid even a little more attention it would have been so clear dor had loved her even then and though hed respected smokes claim enough never to allow himself to be tempted once smoke left all bets were off no after smoke had nearly gotten himself killed after hed chosen a battle he could not win over a future with cass it was what she had been trying to tell him that last day when he left without saying goodbye because saying goodbye would have hurt too much would have stolen his focushe had chosen and shed come for him anyway saved him anyway but what was left after that battle was a broken man an unwhole manand who could blame cass and his old friend for letting down their guard for giving up resisting for seeking a little comfort he could he could blame them or at least dor and if it was wrong he didnt care and if it was pointless he didnt care he looked on his old friend and felt the burn of betrayal and the stirrings of hatred and he knew he had to master these emotions or they would all certainly die dor with his dexterity and determination and focus was their best and possibly only hope for finding a way back out smoke would have to fight the beaters without him he turned away forcing the bile of his hatred down down and thinking only of the challenge of the next moments he had learned the easterners names during the past few days of eavesdropping on their conversations mayhewnow dead davis was with the group that had pressed to the frontand smoke saw him now crouched next to mayhews body rifling through his bloodsoaked shirt what was he looking for his weapon blade but all the easterners were well armedin fact hed admired nadirs ebonyhandled tactical knife the other two were working at the entrancenadir the most outgoing of the four the one who chatted with the older folks and made wisecracks with the kids and the macktruckbuilt bart they were kicking at the emergency exit door a few yards from dor grimfaced and silent bart putting his shoulder into it and making the frame shiver with each assault it was possible that hed dent the thing but nearly inconceivable that hed break through and definitely not in time the mall architects and then its dwellers had made sure of that locking everyone in with great care the issue came up every time someone wandered out of the box drunk or bored or simply looking for a little solitude and managed to get themselves killed instead then there would be calls for securing the exits for preventing people from leaving these demands had been put down firmly by dor personal liberties were not taken for granted in the box but herein this temple of suburban consumerism it was not hard to imagine a different outcome smoke made his choice he didnt know any of the group other than dor well enough to be certain who would be best in a fight but the easterners were disciplined at least and armed nadir bart come on we need to deal with these fuckers the men joined him the crowd closing in around the doors behind them and considered the shambling crowd of newly turned still at the far end of the mall they moved slowly at this phase of the disease their languorous quality one of the things that made the early stages deceptively appealing the thing that caused people to call it the beautiful death like tuberculosis a hundred years earlier they stopped using that term when the suffering advanced to the cannibalistic stages of the disease theyre all infected arent they bart said and smoke saw that he was afraid which shouldnt have been a surprisewho wouldnt be terrifiedbut the easterners had accumulated in very short order a mystique around themselves one that all the edenites had bought into it was so easy to grasp onto anything when you had nothing smoke should have knownwould have known if he had been paying attentionthat theyd given away their allegiance too fast that theyd bought into the flimsy illusion the strangers held up giving too little thought to the dark side they were hiding because every man had a dark side smoke knew this more than anyone didnt he nadir you take the front line with me smoke said motioning them to hurry bart you next he scanned the people nearby for anyone who could help terrence shelyou too do you have extra ammo shel held up her handgun and nodded her face was pale but her hands were steady terrence stepped up without a word the streetsweeper auto he carried had seemed like a ridiculous affectation to smoke earlier but now its bulk and power seemed like a good idea so what if terrence was a boy with a mans weapon if there was ever a day to become a man today was it okay lets go smoke was conscious of his limp of the trembling that started in his chest and radiated out his arms he gripped his gun harder and made a fist with his other hand he knew it was more important to appear strong than to be strong right now the others would follow his example a lesson hed learned over and over in the box when he trained with the other guards hed never been the strongest the fastest the most accuratebut hed been the most determined he had the most to atone for and that was the thing he held in his mind as he led them down the mall walkway it was another day of atonement and that was all right and if his body screamed with pain and his thoughts fell away until all that was left was this bloodrimed shadow of the man hed been that was all right too the cowards way the easy way would have been to die back in the stinking concrete basement room where the rebuilders had taken their vengeance upon him where they left him to lie on a floor streaked with the blood of others but smoke did not die because he wasnt done atoning and because of cass he sought her out in the huddled crowd of edenites therethere she had retreated to the center with ruthie in her arms and her father close by red would keep her safe for nowanother man whod give his life for cass and that was all right with smoke nadir knew what he was doing he kept pace with smoke though smoke knew he itched to go faster and focused on the group ahead get em in the chute boss what do you say nadir said quietly smoke saw what he meantif they could get the infected to come across one of the narrow pedestrian bridges that crisscrossed the atrium theyd be tightly clustered a better target than they were now not yet close enough to catch the edenites scent they stumbled and wandered in a loose formation along the side of the mall momentarily distracted by the brilliant flashes of light being spun by some sort of crystal hanging in the display window of a hot topic good idea he turned to the others everyonewe need to get them to come across ill stay on this side withhow about you shel you and me then when theyre in the middle terrence nadir bart you guys get to the other side and well box them in but youll have to be fast because youre going to have to take the long way see he sketched the plan with his finger pointing out the circuit made by the two pedestrian bridges and the walkways on either side of the mall got it shel said the others nodded their assent okay were ready he was more aware than ever that he was the one slowing them down and smoke threw himself into the short journey holding on to the brass rail overlooking the atrium and favoring his good leg letting the other drag a little the edenites had stopped screaming at least though he could hear the moaning and whimpering from those whod been trampled and injured in the relative quiet the voices of the infected echoed a trick of the acoustics of the place the mumbled syllables and nonsense words blended together when there were so many of them almost losing their oddness they could have been a polite crowd at an art gallery a group of suburban parents at a middleschool open house when they reached the far side of the bridge smoke took one side of the opening and motioned them to spread out now we make some noise they started whooping and hollering and the infected paused and turned their heads the expressions on their faces were disturbingly stirringly innocent a combination of curiosity and goodnatured interest like children at a matinee when the curtains part their babble went up a few decibels and they turned gracelessly bumping into each other and squawking with irritation shoving at one another a couple of them lumbered toward the bridge but most of the others their attention fixed on the hot topic displaysunglasses and belt buckles and sequined tops all hung just out of their reachstayed where they were without warning shel ran forward onto the bridge she whooped and shot at the ceiling hitting the skylight with a tinkling of glass that rained down not far from them sparkling as it fell come and get me cocksuckers she screamed come on i know you want me im good im good im sooooo good you know you want to sink your teeth in me she danced along shimmying and waving her arms dangerously close to the other end if any of them decided to run for it she was doomed shel youre too close smoke yelled and then nadir burst past him sprinting to her grabbing her free hand and dragging her back shel fought him screaming no let go of me come on i had them it was their struggle that seemed to make the difference there was a swell of excited chatter a few garbled cries of excitement and the group of infected turned toward the bridge several pressed forward onto the ones closest to them knocking one of them over a middleaged woman with a fussy short haircut that was sticking straight up on one side and a necklace of purple beads that bounced against the ground when she fell an overweight man with his shirt unbuttoned exposing a hairy pale stomach stepped right on her outstretched leg and reached in front of him with grasping hands shit terrence breathed at smokes elbow keep it together boy he snapped he was trying to get a shot at the heavy infected but shel and nadir were in the way get back here bart screamed nadir come on smoke saw what had scared him a skinny beater in a velour tracksuit was pushing her way through the clump moving more quickly than the rest of them her mouth open and her tongue waggling nadir tugged shel dragging her backward and with his free hand he fired he hit the big man in the chest slowing him but not stopping him others pressed around him as he wobbled nadirs second shot took out the wiry woman seconds before she reached him go go smoke ordered bart terrenceyoull have to take the other side by yourselves they ran for it smoke could hear their footsteps ringing through the great empty cavern of the mall echoing through all the wasted space that had once cost untold sums of money to heat and cool before all that money all the shit in these stores mountains of crap that no one really needed the crowd of edenites was yelling a terrified sort of cheering smoke hoped theyd have the sense to stay where they were he heard banging and prayed dor was getting closer with the door twothirds of the infected were on the bridge now stepping on and around the bodies of the big guy and the wiry woman hold back smoke yelled to nadir the worst thing he could do would be to create a blockage on the far side of the bridge then the things would split off into two groups get distracted wander in different directions nadir seemed to understand he quit firing and dragged shel back with him in seconds they were back on smokes side of the bridge out of breath shels eyes red and watery terrence had made the circuit down the hall and across the bridge and back up the other hallway bart right behind him but they were going too fast they needed to let all the infected follow the first ones onto the bridge where they would be sitting ducks wait up smoke yelled terrence looked over at him and nodded then stopped pressing his back against the entrance of a candle shop there was a noise from below a scream and a great clanging from the first floor smoke looked over the rail a coffee shack in the center of the lounge area shuddered and four figures burst out of the door knocking over a café table beaters mature ones they must have been nesting inside the little shack and they were headed for the escalator the one that would take them straight up to the end of the mall where the edenites were huddled oh jesus god shel breathed and then without pause she shot over the edge down into the mall it was an impossible shot and smoke grabbed her arm no he yelled into her ear save your ammo focus on the ones here the others will deal with those it was the only thing they could do but once the beaters got up the stairs there would be nothing to stop them from attacking even if smoke and his companions laid every one of the things on the bridge to waste it could well be at the cost of losing everyone else but there was nothing else he could do the roving mass had nearly made its way entirely onto the bridge terrence was slinking down the hall toward them waiting for the stragglers to catch up bart was a few paces behind him looking like he was about to throw up he still had a couple more clipshow many rounds he wasnt sure hed just stand here and pick off the things that staggered toward him until he ran out counting on the others to herd them onto the bridge or blast them from the other side a scream rose above the din singular among all the others because he knew that voice cass smoke forced himself to stay focused on the scene ahead of him knowing that if he abandoned his post to go to her now hed doom them both and yet every fiber of his being rebelled as he lined up his shot chapter cass ran to the side and looked down just in time to see them reach the escalators three of them had no hair at all and one had a few greasy hanks at the back of its head at least one of them was missing fingers these beaters had been infected for a long time and their bodies were starting to disintegrate in a month maybe two theyd finally die from the sheer punishment they routinely suffered and inflicted on each othereven their hyper immune system couldnt save them after they lost enough blood and took enough blows to their savaged bodies but until then they were more dangerous than ever hungrier faster unstoppable she ran back to her father who was cradling ruthie rocking her and singing dad im going to help dor justjust keep her safe she pushed through the crowd knowing how ridiculous her words were there was no way to help there was no such thing as safe where are we at she demanded after forcing her way to dors side sammi made room for her her face white with fear last one dor muttered sparing her a quick glance with his flintspark eyes got the other two hinges out shot off the caps and pried out the pins but this ones corroded or something cant get it free his hands were bloody and the screwdriver he was using to chip away at the blockage slipped from his hands fuck let me cass seized it from him and wiped it on her shirt leaving his blood streaked on the fabric tell me show me and he did his quiet voice in her ear speaking slowly steadily the way hed done so many times before when it was just the two of them when hed cajoled and urged her to the dark heights where they both sought release she let everything else fall away until it was just her and him and the thing that must be done his voice his lips brushing her ear her hands and the glinting metal and the greasy mechanism and every bit of her energy focused on the task until suddenly the pin fell to the floor with a clang and then everything the sounds and the people and the fear came rushing back and she was pushed away from the door as the crowd surged forward back back dor yelled from three feet away that felt like a thousand and he and others jammed their blades into the space between the wall and the door and heaved and pulled until it gave a little just a little and down the mall there was screaming and shooting and cass could not bear to look so she turned away and found red and took her daughter back burrowed her babys sweet face into the crook of her neck and kissed her hair and swore it was going to be all right sunlight and screaming an earsplitting metalonmetal groan as the door was pulled away from the frame four five men grunting and sweating with effort and the metal door bent but did not break the opening grew until it was a foot eighteen inches wide and the crowd roared and pressed forward and they would not be stopped now but the space was not wide enough for them all to pass through they would kill each other trying there was craig switzer shoving mrs nguyen out of the way his hand on her face mad with fear and then his throat exploded blood everywhere his mouth open with surprise and his hand slipping slowly off poor mrs nguyen stand back or ill shoot again dor yelled and the crowd hesitated and backed up just a fraction of an inch enough to spare the ones suffocating at the front and the door budged a little more and a little more until there was room for a person to slip through sideways and phil booth forced his way out to the other side before dor could do a thing about it he cursed and shot at the floor chipping up a chunk of concrete at the base of the door you go when i say you go or youre dead harris benny go through and man the other side one of you help the people through and the other keep everyone together women first kids old people line up and so help me god you fuck this up ill shoot you so fast you wont know what hit you it was working the crowd had retreatedjust a little farther but enoughand the women were being helped along sliding through crying ingrid went with all the children and then suzanne and dor seized casss arm and tried to push her through but she fought him theyre going to be here in a second she shouted but dor had been so focused on forcing his way out that he didnt know he didnt know about the four struggling up the stairs and hed sent two of the only armed men through the door and cass knew he had to stay here to make sure the others got out who it doesnt matter she said and then she told a lie the only way she could make him let her go im just going to get my dad ill be back in a minute red was at the end of the line of older people him and zihna and cass handed him ruthie and kissed his cheek and he gave her his gun and whispered that he loved her her father understood what she was going to do his eyes were terrified but he took ruthie and followed zihna through the crack to the outsideand cass ran far ahead on the bridge there was fighting and screaming and dying but that was not casss fight behind her the terrified crowd continued its exodus she was alone she was the only one left to face the ones coming up the escalator they were terrible at stairs they stumbled and lost their balance and that was all that had saved her so far one had stumbled and was splayed upside down halfway down the metal staircase but the other three clutched each other in a grunting scrum that had nearly reached the top they spotted her and the closest onegod it was impossible to believe it had ever been human with its gaping mouthhole and sunken eye sockets and tornoff ears and pulped fleshit saw her and it screamed and cass couldnt help screaming back as she shot it the gun jerking in her hands she did not know this gun it was her fathers gun it was unwieldy and old and it was too heavy for her the report traveling up her arm through her elbow into her shoulder and her palm slipped as she tried to rack the slide and the thing kept coming shed shot it in the chest and it had gone clear through but too high too high a shard of bone protruded and one arm lay limp as it seized at her with the other no no no it was too late to run they were too close shed fucked it up it was an easy shot and shed failed and then it was on her its bonefingers clutching the fabric of her shirt yanking her toward it its mouth open and drooling and its rotting brown teeth shiny with saliva she put her hands on its head and shoved anything to keep the snapping teeth away but she was not strong enough the mouth closed on her forearm even as she fought it pushing and writhing with all her might but there was nothing in the world stronger than a beaters lust and this one was mad with its hunger for her and she felt the sharp pain as it bit down saw the blood spurt from her arm as it ripped her flesh explosions so close and the thing fell away from her rolling back onto the stairs falling on its companions who shoved it out of their way and kept coming then more shots a staccato burst of them and their bodies jerked and seized and went limp and there was terrence leaning over the edge with that insane gun of his and one more burst took out the last one and it died upside down on the stairs staring up at the skylights with empty eyes cass sinking to the floor her hand closing over her woundshe looked up and found that she was staring into the barrel of barts gun no no dont do it dont shoot her it was sammi racing toward them her hair flying behind her sammi stay back she screamed barts gun hand was shaking from adrenaline there was no telling what hed do in the heat of the moment go to your dad no bart dont you dont understand sammi ignored her her sneakers slapping on the smooth floor of the mall echoing around the giant space behind her was pandemonium the crowd pushing through the narrow opening dor yelling people screaming cass cant get the fever shes immune what the fuck are you talking about bart waved the gun back and forth between cass and sammi sammi go please cass said her heart caught in her throat as she prayed that bart would stay calm please just back away go outside and well illits going to be fine i promise no sammis voice turned into a wail and tears glistened in her eyes cass he doesnt understand make him understand bart she got attacked a long time ago and she got better and she cant get the fever again shes like immune bart stared at her for a long breathless moment his eyes narrowed and for a seconda quivering hopeful secondshe thought he might lower his gun but then instead he raised it and pointed it squarely between casss eyes look away little girl he muttered cass heard the click and squeezed her eyes shut and when the shot came she was thinking that she would have done the same down on all fours pain searing her forehead the echo of the sound filled casss ears blood poured into her eyes but she was alive in front of her bart was clutching his hand and screaming and his gun lay on the floor smoke smoke staggered toward them and then his leg gave out and he sank to the floor his strength had finally run out hed used every bit of adrenaline for the fight and then somehow hed made it close enough to shoot bart in the hand to keep him from killing her cass put her hand to her scalp found that the bullet had only grazed her felt torn flesh but no bone it was nothing sammi she said weakly and the girl knelt down and leaned into her sobbing and cass hugged her hard feeling her strong heartbeat against her neck weve got to move someone yelled his hand on her shoulder cass looked up blinking terrence he offered her his hand then withdrew it thats true he demanded youre really immune she is damn it smoke said and with a huge effort forced himself to his feet we need to get them out of here we all need to get out of here terrence said he helped sammi up supporting her with an arm around her waist and sammi leaned against him still snuffling wiping at her tearstained cheek despite the gravity of the situation cass felt a stirring of gratitude and hope the dam between her and sammi had broken the girl had let cass comfort her embrace her sammi could have left cass for doomed could have been rid of her forever but instead shed tried to save her let them go first smoke ordered terrence but he looked like he was going to fall again so cass hooked an arm around him and half dragged him to his feet terrence hastened sammi along toward the exit and bart followed after him bleeding a trail of droplets cass took one last look at the mall bodies lay everywhere blood pooling on the floor and dripping down the escalator there were undoubtedly more of them the shelterers whod made innocent mistakes as they tried to save each other whod paid with their souls even now they were probably rousing themselves from their delirious fevered slumber staggering out from their dark corners from the remains of the shops where they once bought their designer shoes and their thirtydollar lipsticks and their coffee grinders and cellphone accessories she and smoke were the last ones to leave dor pushed bart and terrence through and then he looked at her taking in his blood on her shirt the bite mark on her arm smoke nearly unconscious with surprising gentleness he lifted smoke dragging him to the opening and handing him off to the men waiting on the other side who pulled him through sunlight hit casss face and she blinked and ducked back into the gloom just for one minute more one second more he saved you dor said quietly outside cass could hear the shouting and cheers of the edenites whod made it but inside the mall it was stunningly eerily still dor put a hand to her cheek tenderly tracing a path from the superficial bullet wound down to her mouth brushing her lips with his thumb are you back with him then are you together his voice was a whisper his mouth so close casss body was so numb from terror and exertion she knew that she could collapse right here and sleep for a dozen hours a thousand years and even in that state she could feel the electricity between them the memory of the taste of him seared in her mind she wanted to kiss him wanted to consume him and be consumed by him to ignite and burn down to ash instead she had to go on they both had to go on i dont know she whispered and then she slipped out the door into the blinding sun chapter that night there was a memorial service for everyone who died in the mall they made a forced march north five or six miles along pretty country roads greening with budding kaysev and the clouds vanished and sun streamed down to earth they stopped at a chicken ranch the fowl had been among the first casualties of the siege laid waste by a bioterror agent believed to have come from north korea though it was never proved and remained anybodys guess even after all these months the place still reeked red who was walking with cass asked her if she remembered helping him in the garden unloading the chicken manure he got for free from a friend who kept a few dozen hens chicken shits the worstsmelling shit in the world red said oh sweetheart you should have seen the look on your little face what were you eight and your mom was so pissed at me but everything grew that year cass remembered smiling it was becoming a little more okay talking about things like this with her dad everythingevery storywas tinged with a little sadness a little anger over the fact that it had all come to an end when he left but it still felt right to talk yeah you remember the carnations carnations for her birthday every month had a birth flower january was hers theyd planted larkspur for her mother and narcissus for her dad when ruthie was born cass looked it upthe september flower was aster nobody really cared about things like birth flowers anymore but cass decided thatmaybe if they ever found a place to settle again if she ever had a garden again if red and zihna wanted tothey could grow a little patch of asters for ruthie the laying sheds were unusable layered with desiccated shit and straw a few chicken carcasses theyd somehow missed collecting and burning but the ranch house was pretty an old rambling square woodsided edifice with a wraparound porch whoever had built it had situated it well the back porch looked out over fields to the mountains miles beyond it was in the field that they had the service the sun was sinking behind the house when they gathered in its long shadow shannon had assembled a list of the lost there were thirtytwo names on it including the two easterners whod diednineteen from the beaters attack in the river and the day of their departure thirteen more at the mall shrae bellamy had done the services on new eden since the methodist minister died and she did so now she opened her bible to a page that she had marked and began to read but she made it through only a few words before she stopped and went very still she raised her eyes to the mountains in the distance and the evening wind whipped her long cape around her and the silence was deeper than cass could remember in a very long time there was only the wind and the mewling of the baby the soft sounds of crying from somewhere deep in the gathering after a while shrae found her place and began again from the book of isaiah she repeated do you not know have you not heard the lord is the everlasting god the creator of the ends of the earth he will not grow tired or weary and his understanding no one can fathom chapter the evening meal was a somber affair there was little conversation as the bedding was laid out in the various rooms of the house sentries were chosen four to a shiftit was not a particularly secure house with its front and back doors groundfloor windows screened crawl space belowbut no one seemed especially concerned about what might come in the night after the horrors of the day perhaps they were numb to fear she found smoke sitting on the steps of the porch as the sky deepened to indigo talking to nadir there were others on the porch red and zihna sat in rockers with blankets over their laps and a few people sat alone or in pairs staring off at the mountains disappearing into the night sammi and colton sat at the far end of the porch their legs dangling eating tender young kaysev pods and tossing the beans out into the darkness it was an evening for reflection tomorrow would be another day of travel and while they would not forget the losses and tragedies of today they would have to store them carefully and well so that they could go on cass had hoped to find smoke alone she asked awkwardly if she could join them and sat on the top step so that they made a triangle nadir had set up a small tripod flashlight that illuminated the papers that were spread out between them with a soft yellow glow you need to hear this smoke said without preamble mayhew lied to us nadir winced and shook his head we all did what do you mean the shelters theyve built up north theyre not meant for us definitely not meant for anyone from the west but whatthen who there are four new settlements that much is true nadir said two months ago the first wave went north they had the resources to build communities that could sustain three hundred people each for a year or more only thirty were in each party though enough to build and stock and secure the settlements men and women all of them strong and healthy so that if for some reason the others never made it they would have the seeds of a new civilization to build on it was all decided very democratically smoke said a trace of contempt in his voice they practice concordance in the east cass was surprised at his bitterness but youve always believed in cooperative government thats what we did in the library smoke stared into the space between them his eyes unfocused and what happened to the library burned and everyone dead or worse concordance was not the problem in our community nadir interrupted if i may be so bold as to share my opinion we had a good government a wellmeaning government the plan was a good one but when all of these good people went north who is left behindthe ones who are not so good yes the ones who are not so idealistic who are thinking maybe about themselves not about abstract values they had a lottery to figure out who would come in the second wave dor explained twelve hundred people thats all that would be allowed four groups of three hundred minus the hundred and twenty who went first that was less than half of the people living in their town mayhew was not chosen nadir said heavily nor was i nor bart nor davis cass was beginning to understand and those who were left behind there was an agreement one we all voted on the unlucky ones would stay and deal with what was to come we had reinforced our shelters much as you have here after today i can appreciate how small our efforts were against the threat of the fever we would have been caught unawares we would have made mistakes it would be just like here smoke said just like the west all over again they just knew what they were in for that was the only difference they knew what was coming the stories we heard from the borderthey did not prepare us not for what i have seen i could not imagine his words hung in the air cass understood until youd seen a beater they way they moved their childlike hungers and rages their sheer determination you could not imagine the terror and mayhew cass asked though she had a feeling she knew the rest he sought us out he went to davis first because of the horses davis owned many horses and he had given many away for people to ride but he had kept his finest for himself me and bart he chose us because we had weapons and we are strong and young mayhew said to us there is no reason we cannot go to this settlement let the others build it four more people that is not a lotonce we arrive they will not turn us away these are good people compassionate people davis taught us to ride we stayed out on his ranch and no one knew what we were doing we gathered the things we would need i taught davis to shoot the rest of us practiced we were biding our time to give the first group time to reach the destination and make everything ready we thought our chances were best if we arrived around the time of the second wave when everything was still confusing that was a mistake because you see we were not the only ones to have this thought we found out about the others people like us who were not content to be left behind who were also gathering weapons and among this group were bad people killers and criminals mayhew tried to meet with them to reason with them he said we should split the settlements among us each group should go to a different one but there was no agreement the more mayhew tried to lead this discussion the more it disintegrated it almost came to violence threats were made we left that night but mayhew had an idea he thought that we should make our numbers stronger that we should find othersfighters survivors people who already knew how to deal with beaters we would take the settlement by force if we needed to he thought we should come west for two reasons first of all anyone here would have the advantage of experience with the beaters and the fever he was convinced we would need that knowledge to survive even once we made it north and second the western settlement is the harshest the most difficult conditions it was taking a chance because there was some doubt about whether the first party could make it work that it might not be able to build the infrastructure but it was for that reason that mayhew thought the other groups would avoid it the first few days of the trip were difficult and we made mistakes but we learned we lost jarvis to the beaters during our first day on this side of the mountains he nadir paused his voice roughening he swallowed before continuing we grew closer bart and davis and i did anyway mayhewhe held himself apart we did not begrudge him leadership but we began to see that he could be cruel the night we saw your flares we did not come to help you not the way we said anyway but when we found that you were well supplied and already on the road he saw a way he could turn this to our favor but were not all strong cass said not warriors not what he wanted nadir frowned and stared at the ground no not all of you he agreed softly mayhew planned to take the women and the strongest men only he was willing to wait a few days because he thought the difficulty of the travel would soften people up to the idea of leaving the weaker ones behind but he was ready to kill them if that didnt happen he thought cass was incredulous mayhew thought that of us even after he got to know us nadir looked miserable we triedbart and davis and i we tried to tell himbut he didnt care to listen in every society some people get left behind not all your people made it off the island so i guess he was thinking it might work anyway he had other concerns he wanted um more women more women of childbearing age he thoughtwell thats why he was so determined to get into the mall his plan was to take their women too how the hell did he think hed accomplish that smoke demanded just walk in and issue an invitation hey girls wanna come with us he thought once wed spent some time with them maybe there could be a big meeting of the leadership a bargain could be made he thought they might be willing to come a few leaders and some of their women once he explained about the settlement and we would leave the weak members of our party there he said it was humane you see because they would be protected they would have resources the chill of this knowledge traveled through cass and you went along with this nadirs expression darkened further i am ashamed to say that i did at first i was very afraid seeing the beater what it did to jarvisi believed we did not have a chance unless we did what mayhew suggested but nowi cannot continue as he wanted to my heart is not in it either that or youve figured out the truth is your only option cass said bitterly she herself knew how powerful selfpreservation could be but shed also learned to part with her trust very reluctantly cass hes giving us everything smoke said the plans for the settlement the coordinates the notes on the conditions he doesnt even want to lead he says hell accept whatever role we give him oh no cass said angrily if we do this youre not getting off easy you know the most about this plan youre going to be one of the people making it happen i have seen what this man can do nadir said indicating smoke with a palm placed flat on the step between him it would be my honor to follow him all rightbut it cant just be me smoke said cass was stunned since the first day smoke and she had met he had been adamant that he did not want to lead even in his role overseeing security in the box he avoided anything resembling a hierarchy and rarely told anyone else what to do ill do this smoke said knowing what she was thinking his blue eyes bored into hers and when he spoke again it was only to her but you have to convince dor to do it with me what it was the last thing cass expected since the first day on the road the two men had barely spoken cass knew she was the reason before in the box they had been each others closest confidant each others best friend now they were rivals they both wanted herand she did not know what she wanted the months in the boxthe time on the islandthese were illusory brief expanses of peace when it sometimes seemed like life returned to the way it had been before exceptin the box cass had something shed never had someone to love who loved her back who loved ruthie who wanted to make a family with her wanted to be with her foreveruntil the day came when he wanted vengeance more when he left her and ruthie and their home and their dreams left everything behind to fight an impossible battle with dor it had been different theyd never talked about love the thing between them was dark needful sometimes almost violent it was an affair twisted from the threads of their hungers their losses their sorrows at times it seemed like it inhabited only the fringes of their lives especially because they always met in secret but when they were together it expanded to encompass everything when dor touched her everything else fell away and it was like the world had never broken no it was like the world had never existed like only they existed in a free fall from time and space and everything theyd known and yet when it was over they parted without promises without words of love without even a tender kiss and they pretended there was nothing there thinking about dor was an endless loop a puzzle with no answer she had to stop what is it that youre proposing cass asked nadir we have the location nadir stabbed the paper with his finger we have the exact coordinates we have routes here weather conditions population density from before everything the first wave should have gotten there a week ago theyll be putting up the frames for shelter figuring out the water source building cooking facilities and latrines and fortifying all points of egress if we stick to the schedule on here we can be up there in eighteen days cass examined the stack of printouts the topographical map on top where is that anyway mount karuk fourthlargest peak in the cascades its national forest land so it hasnt been densely populated but the site of the settlement nadir pointed to the star inked on the map has been used by humans for well forever because its got hot springs waterfalls great volcanic soil for farming its perfectexcept for one thing yeah nadir shuffled the papers selected one heres a detail map the settlement is on this land here you can see the river herewell technically its a stream but these cliffs are hundreds of feet high the falls here carved out this gorge and you can see where the river breaks off here so thats impassable most of the year bottom line its very hard to get to but theres some good news too whats that this bridge nadir showed them an aerial shot fuzzy in blackandwhite wait i can do better im trying to conserve battery but he took a cell phone out of his pocket and thumbed it on are you going to call up there cass asked looking at the little machine a bit incredulously she was aware that high emotion was making her sarcastic and she regretted it especially because this was the first good news theyd had in a long time tell them to order pizza nadir grimaced but didnt respond they waited for the phone to power up and he clicked a few buttons here he turned the screen face toward them and cass looked close a crystal clear photo of emeraldgreen treetops the winding break of the river and therea straight gray line a bridge smoke said four lanes put in by some multinational group that wanted to build a resort so assuming the bridge is intact thats a big assumption cass said dont you think nadir shrugged those photos were taken last march not even a year ago since then theres been no air traffic hardly anyone on the roads sure its possible to get there on foot but id say most people spent most of last year trying to go toward civilization and not away from it the cascades are hundreds of miles long smoke said and theres higher elevations why did they pick this one because its relatively easy to get to especially coming from the southeast they spaced the settlements out east to west and this was supposed to be the westernmost camp but if theyd gone up to washington or oregon thatd take weeks longer and they wanted the settlements to be forbidding enough that beaters couldnt survive but not so hostile that everyone else couldnt either i mean i wouldnt want to be in minneapolis right now know what i mean at least in the settlements a day on foot gets you down mountain above freezing almost all year round put in a few satellite farms and you got four growing seasons too couldnt really ask for much better cass considered nadirs argument trying to find the holes in it she had to admit that other than the uncertain welcome they were likely to receive it was better than anything theyd come up with so you really think this will work for all of us what about the slow onesthe weak ones everyone goes smoke said adamantly everyone nadir nodded i understand we have the advantage of the vehicles that should make up for anyproblems we could experience i mean anyone whos slower the kids the older folks if you dont mind me askingare you concerned about loyalty why do you wish to involve this other man smoke addressed nadir but his eyes were on cass i am not wellknown here ive been sick people might question my strength dors only been here as long as i have cass protested two months and no one liked him she wanted to add but things had changed so much of the council leadership only shannon and harris remained dana was dead and neal was among the missing dor had been a hero today in times of great upheaval people were judged by their last trial their last triumph without dor theyd all be dead she had a feeling that smoke was right that people would be expecting him to play a role in what came next is there anyone else nadir asked anyone who will challenge you smoke and cass looked at each other no she said slowly dana would have but hes dead nadir nodded and what role do you see for me what do you mean smoke asked am i toassist you in some way youre the one with the maps my friend smoke said youve put a lot on the table youll forgive me for assuming that you want something in return nadir raised his hands a new life he said a chance at something to matter toknow people what did you do before cass asked nadir shrugged i worked at a best buy went to community college i was engagedbut i was thinking of breaking it off i wasnt anything really just an average guy and now smoke asked what do you want from life im twentysix years old nadir said ive lost everyone i knew before a year ago id like to live to see twentyseven and have a couple of friends when i get there smoke nodded he looked at cass slipped his hand around hers thats not the worst goal i ever heard chapter people adapted to the new order with surprising complacency or maybe it wasnt all that surprisingand on second thought it wasnt complacency but more like stunned acceptance no one was unaffected by the terrible losses suffered at the mall people were silent much of the day prone to crying jags more likely than ever to wander off in search of solitude when they did stop for rest cindy who had treated rosita like a second mother had taken to wearing the scarf she took from the dead womans body outside the mall after she died from her head injury it was still stained with blood but cindy didnt seem to care sharon whose partner elsa had been among those crushed to death when people swarmed the door of the mall stopped speaking to anyone when people approached she turned away she seemed to blame them all she walked several paces behind the crowd and slept outside at night and cass worried that one morning they would find her gone having slipped away in the night to be alone with her grief no one seemed to miss craig switzer much or mayhew for that matter after a somewhat condensed version of his plan had been communicated at a meeting smoke led with nadir and bart dor doing his customary silentandglowering thing a few paces away a vote was taken and not surprisingly it was a unanimous decision to continue northward toward salt point people were given a quick glimpse at the images on nadirs phone before he shut it down to conserve the battery jay said it reminded him of skiing in whistler up in canada kyra who had begun talking about the baby from time to time said she thought it would be nice to have a logcabin school for the kids the days took on a rhythm early mornings around fires made from whatever lumber they could scavenge the last of the canned and preserved food doled out parsimoniously along with whatever form of kaysev was on offer that day a new kitchen crew had formed from a few volunteers includingsurprisinglykalyan who was a sort of apprentice to fat mike fat mike wasnt the least bit fat anymore but the name stuck and he and kalyan spent the evenings experimenting with kaysev and whatever other ingredients could be scrounged several times there was rabbit and even squirrel that nadir or dor or bart shot cass found wild shallots and ginger serviceberries squawroot and nutsedge tubers in her pack was the seed collection she had brought with her from new eden and she daydreamed about the garden she would grow if they reached salt point safely when she corrected herself every time when they reached salt point but optimism was in short supply despite everyones efforts to practice it one reason kalyan was spending more time with fat mike cass figured was that colton was spending most of his time with sammi only shane among the young men seemed to have failed to find a new diversion sometimes cass saw him with his slingshot shooting stones at billboards wrecked cars rabbitsthough he never managed to hit thosealways with the same vacant expression if he missed his friends company he didnt let on twice they encountered beaters once they pulled off the road at an orchard the dead trees eerie with their clinging brown leaves and withered fruit a pair of long sheds seemed like a reasonable shelter for the night especially after dor and some of the others went in to clear them and found nothing more vexing than a corpse lying next to an open refrigerator surrounded by empty beer cans but as the group was settling in a pack of four beaters came sprinting from the tiny farmhouse that had been nearly hidden by the trees since the travelers had taken to posting sentries the moment they arrived at a new shelter two of them were killed before they could enter through the open metal doors and the others after they tripped screaming with frustration over their comrades they were all old beaters except for one who had been a young man in his twenties recently enough that he still had all his hair and tattoos elaborate colorful skulls and roses on both arms he was the last to die exhaling for a final time with what cass imagined was a flicker of regret in his bright eyes the other beater encounter was more disturbing still late on a warm day when they were looking for somewhere to shelter they passed by a tiny town really nothing more than half a dozen small bungalows and a brick general store all were abandoned windows cracked and debris spilling from doorways a stench rose from several cars parked in the middle of the intersection and the group gave it a wide berth walking through the field on the other side of the road they passed this site by because it would be too risky to try to check the buildings anytime there were more than two or three buildings clustered together they generally stayed clear the paucity of beater sightings on the journey confirmed what theyd heard from the handful of settlers and freewalkers theyd encountered the beaters were generally concentrated in the larger towns and cities still though with their quarry more and more elusive as survivors dwindled and reinforced their shelters it wasnt unheard of to find a nest in a tiny town or ranch especially near the roads still nothing stirred in the dusty streets as the group rolled silently by the horses hooves clopping hollowly alongside the cars and trailers and wagons theyd gone perhaps twentyfive yards past the edge of the town far enough for a collective sigh of relief when a frightened yell pierced the air and a figure came sprinting toward them as he gained ground cass saw that it was shane his long hair flopping on his forehead his baggy pants sagging below his stomach a second later a pair of beaters came loping after him one of them had something wrong with its leg which dragged along behind it and shane quickly outpaced it but the other one had managed to get a hold of shanes flapping jacket before it tripped and let go as it staggered trying not to fall a bullet from smokes gun dropped it instantly but shane kept running gibbering with terror until he was in the midst of the group cass didnt like the boy but he was still a child as much as any sixteenyearold can still be called a child she wasnt the only one to feel that way it was clear because several of the women surrounded him checking for injuries exclaiming over him as smoke walked to the injured beater and shot it in the neck lets keep going lets just keep going shane repeated his voice thin and terrified what the hell happened son dor demanded shane was not a big kid and he had to look up to meet dors eyes what were you doing back there i was i was i just saw i thought i saw uh cans like food cans where through a window on a porch bart and nadir had their weapons out and had flanked smoke on either side neither of the downed beaters stirred and there were no further sounds from the camp but there was smoke and as everyone turned to stare a small popping sound shane turned away muttering as dor exclaimed softly under his breath stay here everyone he ordered as he joined the other armed men it didnt take them long to find the fire the shabbiest of the bungalows was in flames all along the back where the paint had long ago flaked off the siding and a porch railing made excellent tinder they were back in moments i smelled kerosene or something dor said cuffing shane on the shoulder the boy kept his head down his face burning i said something to you boy it was there it was sitting out and it wasnt kerosene it was deck stain dor cursed and spun shane around in the street cass was tornlike the others who kept walking she trusted dor to handle it but her father who had been walking next to her had backtracked to join the pair and cass followed so you found deck stain sitting on the street i dont didnt say it was in the street in the garage two of the houses had detached garages behind them both were missing doors and windows boy red said softly you like watching shit burn shane flicked a glance at him but didnt answer check his pack red said as he hooked a large hand under shanes chin and forced him to look at him a quick search turned up a ziploc bag full of small boxes of matches a motley collection of knives and a cheap imitation throwing star thats a lot of matches son red said softly anything else you might want to be getting off your conscience shane shook his head as red squeezed his jaw finally wrestling free and stumbling off at a jog i think you just found your firebug red said chapter everyone was talking about shane and sammi wanted to talk to him ask him if it was true if hed really done the things they were saying theyd taken everything sharp or flammable or conceivably dangerous away from him and spread the word among the entire group bart suggested leaving him behind at the next shelter they passed but he was quickly voted down watching the boy trudge along behind the group face flaming and an expression of utter dejection on his face seemed like punishment enough besides they had another problem to worry about jasmine had gone into labor that morning and it wasnt going well shed been riding in the panel van with sunhi all day and when they came to a long lowslung cinderblock building set at an angle on a giant gravel lot broken neon signs spelling out triplex girls liquor coors live nude it was decided that she and sunhi would stay in the van while everyone else made camp inside twenty yards behind the building was a surprisingly pretty creek the water was shallow and murky but grasses grew along its banks and butterflies and water bugs flitted among them the first anyone had seen aftertime a fire was built along the bank and dinner served there as the sun set people waded into the water the first chance for a bath or laundry in many days there was laughter as people emerged shivering and stripped behind blankets hanging their clothes from the branches of a sycamore tree sammi was helping to dry the little boys after a dip in the creek toweling dane off and smoothing his damp hair which had grown long enough to hang into his eyes sammi oh my god sammi kyra came running up holding her side wincing kyra what are you doing youre not supposed its jasmine sunhi sent me its bad the baby wont come and sammi exchanged a look with sage who was trying to get a struggling dirk back into his clothes go ahead well watch them sage said her face pale who does she want sammi asked does she want you to get zihna kyra nodded gulping air yeah i just i cant catch my breath ill go she ran over to a clump of people sitting on the ground on the stream bank zihna was sitting and talking with cass slightly apart from the others sammi skidded to a stop with her arms wrapped awkwardly around herself jasmines baby wont come she said out of breath kyra says its bad sunhi needs you take me there zihna transformed instantly from earth mother to all business though she held sammis hand as they ran and sammi squeezed back they raced back up the incline to the ugly building around through the parking lot to the front one of the side doors of the panel van was open and next to it on the ground in the shade of the car was a pallet made of blankets unpacked from someones luggage jasmine lay on it naked from the waist down her legs impossibly pale and still with bloodsoaked towels covering her belly and between her legs sunhi was holding a baby it was the ugliest thing sammi had ever seen there had to be something wrong with itit was purple and wrinkled and dented and covered with slime a disgusting kinked cord hanging from its belly its mouth wide with fury and its eyes squinched shut and it was wailing the most terrifying hiccupping cries sammi had ever heard it didnt sound like a regular baby evenit just sucked air and wailed over and over again dear god zihna said so it must be bad when zihna put a strong hand on sammis shoulder she stayed put wait here a minute she said and jogged the rest of the way she and sunhi conferred quietly and zihna examined the freak baby they looked down at jasmine who was apparently dead and back at sammi who was suddenly cold freezing even shivering as the wind blew trash up off the asphalt and skittered it along under cars sammi zihnas voice was gentler but still urgent this is important you need to get your dad and cass hurry okay cass are you sure sammi its obvious shes an outlier ive known it since i met her she has all the characteristics but some people think theyre just scared by morning theyll realize shes not a threat but for now we need her here so sammi made the trip back jogging more slowly this time her dad and casswell that was just great figured that theyd have to work together on whatever came along in there in the mall it had been the two of them that finally got the door unstuck it was like no matter what happened in their lives they were thrown together it had to be the two of them what did they know about babies other than theyd both had onebut then again a lot of the people in new eden had had kids once besides smoke was here smoke was doing fine hed made his miraculous recovery shouldnt cass be with him now he was a hero again after the mall so why wasnt she back with him why couldnt she just leave her dad alone for a minute sammi considered disobeying sunhi and zihna and bringing back smoke instead of her dad she was pretty sure he could do whatever her dad could only smoke looked like he was going to pass out and besides jasmine sammi squeezed her eyes shut hard for a moment nearly tripping on a clod of dirt shed seen about a million dead people some of them way more disgusting than jasmine people who were eaten or rotted or burned compared to that jasmine just looked like she was sleeping and it wasnt like sammi was a little girl or anything she didnt need her dad to tell her it was going to be all right because shed figured out a long time ago it wouldnt so it wasnt that but only yesterday shed seen jasmine in the morning with her hands on her huge belly stretching with her eyes closed and this little smile on her face and sammi had wondered what there was to be so happy about jasmine wanted that baby so bad shed told kyra that after she turned forty she figured shed never get to be a mom and she had about thirty names picked out for boys and girls and she said shed just know shed take one look at her baby and shed know what its name was meant to be so maybe it was a good thing shed died maybe it was a good thing she hadnt seen the disgusting thing shed given birth to sammi reached the others and practically collided with her dad and to her surprise she was crying so hard she could barely get the words out chapter sunhi shook her head when they ran up and cass knew that jasmine had died but then zihna lifted the soft blanket and showed them the baby in her arms and she was beautiful face bunched and lips puckered suckling air her tiny hands in fists and faint pink lines at the bridge of her nose angel kisses they called them harmless little birthmarks ruthie had them too but theyd faded away over time the babys head was a little misshapen from the labor unproductive labor they called it when the baby wouldnt comejust one of many horrible euphemisms for the pain of becoming a mother cass had delivered ruthie in a stark hospital room in the wee hours of the morning and it had been an unremarkable labor according to the doctors but to cass it had been one miracle after another shed suffered plentythey wouldnt give her painkillers because she was an addictbut thinking about what jasmine had suffered before she died before sunhi had taken the baby from her lifeless body made cass want to weep but this was not the time for weeping we can bury her by the creek dor said the soil will be soft there all right sunhi said she sounded exhausted cass could only imagine that the disastrous labor had crushed sunhi mentally and physically as she tried to hold on to jasmines life while the others battled for their own lives inside dor was already wrapping the body cass saw his tenderness his reverence such a sharp contrast to the man most people thought they knew i think theres a little bit of evaporated milk in one of the cars zihna said her brow furrowed with worry but not enough oh cass what are we going to do this poor little thing i have an an idea cass said the audacity of it making her stammer she told the others they were all silent for a moment it was far from ideal but nothing was ideal anymore and after a moment they nodded and she took the baby in her armsso tiny and precious memories of holding ruthie coming back like it had been yesterdayand she and zihna set out to try it was too dark to dig another grave tonight so while the others carried jasmines body carefully to the shed attached to the building cass found an unlocked extendedcab ford a few rows over and waited there with the baby zihna was back soon with ingrid whose flustered bewildered expression told cass that she didnt know when she saw cass her face went stony to what do i owe the pleasure she asked sarcastically for a moment cass feared shed made a terrible mistake ingrid with her judgments ingrid with her certainty that only she knew what was right with her righteous condemnationhow could she be the one please cass whispered justjust let me talk for a minute it took less than a minute there was very little to say a death a birth another aftertime tragedy marked with blood and loss cass did not embellish she did not entreat she did not even say the thing that had made her seek out the woman who probably despised her most of anyone in new edenthat only ingrid could save this child she opened her jacket and showed ingrid the baby who miraculously was sleeping oh my god ingrid whispered oh god oh she reached for the baby and cass knew she did it without thinking and was only a little bereft to hand her over you have to feed her she pleaded but ingrid was already unbuttoning her shirt in the morning dor and steve and earl and smoke dug the grave they had brought a shovel in one of the cars but the barns revealed a vast assortment of tools enough for all of them it did not take long jasmines body was brought from the shed and lowered in its wrapping of blankets into the ground everyone scooped a fistful of dirt and tossed it in shrae was ready with her bible she had a gift for gentleness and she chose her texts with care today she read from revelation when she got to the end many people were crying as her words drifted away on the morning breeze for a moment nobody spoke then sunhi crouched down and dug a fistful of dirt and tossed it into the grave she brushed off her hands and started toward the building not looking back the others followed cass held back until the end and when their turn came she set ruthie down ruthie had been quiet since the mall thoughtful almost staying close to her mother now she bent to the earth with her mouth pursed in concentration and dug into the ground with her small hand she dropped her fistful of dirt into the hole with a reverence far beyond her years the news of jasmines baby had spread quickly through the group during jasmines funeral ingrid stood in the back and when the baby began to fuss she slipped away out of earshot but when the service was over cass saw kyra sitting in an old glider chair on the buildings back porch cradling the baby gingerly ingrid showing her the proper way to hold her head back on new eden there had been lots of teasingnot all of it goodnaturedas dirk approached his second birthday the public opinion was that he was too old to still be nursing but no one said anything now chapter days passed a lengthening string of them until it had been nearly three weeks since they left new eden behind in two days time they would arrive in salt point nadir said they called it that because of potassium deposits in the soil but considering hed never actually been there sammi was skeptical the people who were trying to get the place set up would be in for quite a surprise the edenites were down to thirtythree now including baby rosie who turned out to be healthy and not nearly as badlooking once she was cleaned up and fed for a few days theyd lost five more since the mall old mike and terrence had died when they stumbled on a beater nest in the warehouse they were clearing one night a couple of weeks ago richy gomez and paolo had to be shot the next day after being bitten doing the good deed of trying to save old mike cheddar had hit his head on a stone outcropping while longboarding been unconscious for several hours and suffered noisy seizures for a few days after that until someoneno one had come forwardhad strangled him during the night sammi was ready to move into the next empty building they saw as long as it meant they could stay put for a while her blisters had blisters from all the walking and her body ached from the moment she woke up in the morning until the moment she went to bedif you could call it bed since most nights she was sleeping on the floor in some shed or barn or church worse she couldnt get warm unless she was walking when they stopped for the night she volunteered for every task she could think of because the alternative which was to sit still meant shed be freezing before she went to bed once she was lying down shed never get warm even though she and sage and kyra had taken to sleeping huddled together according to the plan that the new council had drawn up she was entitled to ride for fortyfive minutes twice a day that was the shortest amount of time since she was in the youngest age bracket with no health issues and she wasnt pregnant but the reason she skipped her allotted time most days was that she was only allowed on the trailers not in any of the three cars that still worked and that meant getting colder and colder until she could get off and walk again kyra took her trailer time most days she said the baby was starting to press down on her bladder and her back hurt they all felt the baby kickevery time it moved it was good for a little entertainment which was way hard to come bybut when kyra rode she liked to nap how she managed it sammi couldnt figure though kyra said she got something like hot flashes now with all the hormones zinging through her body part of the problem was undoubtedly that sammi was so skinny she wasnt the only onethey hadnt had much besides kaysev since the food ran out there wasnt time to hunt and though they raided every promising building they passed nearly everything had already been ransacked by others it was march now almost a year into the siege a year of desperation a year of people making do with whatever they could find lots of times theyd come to a house and there would be a pot in front of the door that meant it had already been raided of all the food and medicine anything worth taking but that didnt keep people from wishing hoping for a miracle sometimes when she and kyra and sage walked with the boys they played a game to see who could imagine the best meal the boys always won probably because they declared themselves the winners colton always started out with his moms caesar salad no one ever gave him a hard time about his lack of originality because his mom was one of the first to die she was the manager of a highend grocery store and was shot when she tried to stop looters from taking all the bottled water kalyan was the most creative he described elaborate feasts featuring all his favorite takeout menus in the oakland neighborhood where his parents once developed online content from home sammi would never admit to it but the meal she most longed for was the one her dad used to make her on her birthdaygiant ribeye steaks grilled black on the outside and practically raw in the middle with an iceberglettuce salad with tomatoes and a few slices of red onion on the side her mother had declared it inedible back when they were still together and sammi had called it disgusting the last time hed ever fixed it for her and only eaten the narrow band of meat that was cooked medium but her dad used to wear an old red apron that sammi gave him in first grade her handprints in acrylic paint on the front he paraded the plate of raw meat around the house acting like it was so heavy it hurt his arm hed bring a bone home from the butcher for chester too saying that since he was a mutt and no one knew when his birthday was he might as well share sammis her dad had kind of sucked as a dad spending way too much time at work and missing a lot of her soccer games and forgetting her friends names but at least hed cracked jokes and tried to spoil her on the weekends ever since the mall hed somehow gotten himself on the new council along with nadir the easterner who rachael and the de ceccos didnt trust because he was a muslim and shannon and harris and smoke at first sammi worried her dad would be upset because of smoke who was almost back to normal now and so everyone figured he and cass would just take up right where they left off only that hadnt exactly happened cass spent most of her time with ingrid helping with the boys since ingrid had to nurse rosie like fifty times a day but sammi thought the real problem might be that cass was avoiding both of them and to be fair there was a lot to keep the new council busy theyd given everybody jobs made up all these procedures for how to check and clear a shelter when they stopped who would cook and clean and all of that smoke was kind of like how he used to be back when they lived in the school he let other people make the big decisions but now he would have his own opinion a lot of the time instead of insisting everyone keep talking until they came up with a decision together theyd been off the main roads for a week now the terrain getting more and more uneven nadir had explained about how mayhew was planning to crash the shelter and in a lot of ways it seemed like that was still the plan but somehow it was okay now since they were just trying to survive sammi and her friends constantly discussed what would happen if the settlers werent happy to see them what if they told them to turn around find their own damn camp sammi couldnt imagine that her dad and the rest of the new council would fight people over what was to be fair theirs theyd probably have one of their stupid secret meetings where they went walking after dinner talking it all through then theyd come back and tell everyone they would just have to keep going and make the best of it theyd act like it was no big deal at least to sammi and her friends because they still thought of them as immature even though kalyan was going to be eighteen in july and the rest of them were all over fifteen if her dad could see what colton had given her well then he might change his mindbut she still hadnt figured out how to give it to her dad without getting colton into trouble the adults wouldnt understand how none of it had been his idea that hed thought they were just messing around that hed never realized it would go so far nadirs lists said that salt point would get below freezing at night through april that was almost two more months like this there was no way that they would be able to build adequate shelter for that not right away anyway and if they went down to lower elevations they would need beater walls just in case and they were right back to the same problem sammi wondered if they should have just picked someplace on the way and made the best of it like so many other people had done onlyshed seen what happened on the islands at the mall before that at the school and the library and almost every other place she could think of since the siege if the easterners thought the only place to make a new life was up north at least until someone figured out a way to get rid of the beaters once and for all then sammi had to admit they were probably right they crested a ridge and there on the other side was a scattering of farms with a few buildings at the center making a tiny town and in the center of that was a sweet little white church with a spire on top looking like a postcard against the blue blue sky its so pretty sammi couldnt resist saying you think ive been in a hundred of those sage said sourly thats a methodist church bet you anything they go in for the wooden pews no cushions huh sammi said as they trudged on sleeping in a wooden pew didnt seem like the worst thing in the world nadir might say one of his pretty muslim prayersthat would be kind of nice she knew it was all the same god just different ways of talking to him but in a way it would be better if there was a whole team of gods they could pray to sammi had a feeling they were going to need all the help they could get chapter in the vestibule of the old church cass found a brides dressing room it looked like it had once had some other function perhaps it was a supply closet before a steady stream of city brides discovered this perfect little setting that practically guaranteed enviable photos with the drifts of wildflowers and the mountain backdrop all those bridestheyd adjusted their veils in the mirror checked their makeup quelled their nerves and stepped out with breathless anticipation in their satin high heels and french manicures and updos constructed with a hundred tiny hairpins all of this to launch marriages that more often than not would end in tears and bitterness and regrets nevertheless here she was alone in the twilight of an early march day in the year wiping a years worth of dust from the mirror regarding her reflection and thinking about love when ruthie was born cass had sworn off all love but that which she had for her daughter back then it had seemed that her damaged heart would have to struggle the rest of her life to be worthy of her daughter that it would have to work overtime learning the lessons of devotion and faith and support but all of that had come instantly hard crushingly the moment she held ruthie in her arms then there had been smoke theyd come together in the threat of the unknown first loved each other while on the run and thenwhen shed rescued ruthie and they were safe at lastclung to each other and built something real from the tender shoots theyd had three months together in the closest thing to bliss that cass had ever known shed been shocked to discover that she had learned to trust him at the end of each day he came back to her and that was a sweet miracle that alone was enough but then hed left her it had to be he could never have been at peace knowing he hadnt tried that he hadnt avenged the loss of those he cherished smoke could not have continued to love her if he hadnt made the quest and now finally after this journey cass accepted it shed forgiven him for leaving hed forgiven her for dor and she trusted that he was ready to love her again why then was she hesitating cass leaned closer to the mirror dust motes swirling prettily in the last beams of fading light and looked at herself critically she was differentdifferent than she was a year ago different than shed been after the attack even different from the start of this journey there were the obvious things they were all thinner their bodies pushed to the limit each day with little to eat other than kaysev but the changes that eluded her things she noted as one sees shadows from the corner of ones eye were as compelling as they were subtle her eyes were still the startling clear green of those few who survived the fever her pigment altered forever but there were depths to them a weariness accumulated from all the stories of hurt and loss that shed not only witnessed but lived through phillip jasmine terrenceall the lives shed moved through had changed her both hollowed and intensified her her hair was startling too it had grown long and thick and fine silverywhite strands supplanting her old honey blond at times she thought it looked like a botched dye job but in this mirror it looked startling and lovely like an ice queen from a book of european fairy tales flowing around her shoulders and tumbling over her forehead no matter how many times she pushed it back but even these were not what she was looking for cass was convinced there were answers to be found in the set of her lips the cant of her cheekbones the fine lines that had appeared on her brow somewhere inside her was the knowledge of whether she could truly ever be with a man and if so who she was meant to be with and it was hard to resist the notion that if she just looked long and hard enough she might find it here in the glass but the harder she looked the more it eluded her there was a soft knock at the door and it creaked open smoke okay if i come in he asked ive got room service oh are they serving dinner yeah if you can call it that kaysev again but i have something special he rattled something in his pocket and took out a small can of smoked almonds not even opened oh wow where on earth nadir gave it to me hed been saving a few things for tonight he and dor and bart are drinking twelveyearold scotch right now if im not mistaken i asked him if it was okay if i took mine to go oh casss mouth watered at the thought of real food but she hesitated i guess someone probably told you by now that i was drinking again and that you stopped its been hard that was an understatement a dozen times each day she yearned for the sharp taste of the first swallow the oblivion that followed which is why im here and the bottles not cass smiled thank you she said softly smoke sat down on the upholstered bench and cass sat next to him he popped open the can but for a moment neither of them moved to eat its not going to work out between us is it smoke finally said quietly tears sprang instantly to casss eyes oh smoke he closed his hand over hers and squeezed gently theres something i need to tell you something i did before cass blinked and looked at him carefully his face was lined and scarred and the past months had left a permanent wistfulness that lifted when he smiled but always settled back into place afterward as long as cass had known him he had been a man of secrets hed told her only that hed done something that he could never make right but it was clear that guilt and selfrecrimination were never far from his mind she often found him staring into space or soaked with sweat from a workout that was never hard enough to drive the memories away shed asked him to tell her what was wrong a hundred times a thousand but hed always brushed off the question saying it was nothing or not saying anything at all and only now when shed finally let go of her need to know was he ready to tell her you dont have to do this she said softly im not telling you for your sake im i need to for me cass swallowed now that they were on the brink of it she wasnt sure she was ready to know but she owed him this the freedom he might earn from the telling it was one gift she could still give him all right i told you what i did before right you were a corporate coach the phrase hed used on the day they met as they walked through the streets of silva was career consultant of last resort yeah and i was damn good you want to know my specialty weak guys guys who lacked resolve guys who were smokes expression was pained as he made air quotes around his words weak on followthrough soft leadership unable to build consensus but those are all just euphemisms cassyou want to know what for his selfcontempt was as clear as if it was painted on him no balls those are all mbabullshit ways of saying a guys got no stones and when that happened theyd bring in the fixit guy me i charged heaven and earth for my services but i gave a guaranteeyou give me your hopeless case i give you back a man who can whip it out when he needs to six hundred twentyfive bucks an hour that was my top rate and there were half a dozen clients in san francisco who couldnt get enough of me hell i had a waiting listseemed like there was no shortage of guys who tended to freeze in the clutch or hide behind the other guys skirts what id do id get a guy on his own turf his office sometimes his house his club for the ones whod made it a little ways up the corporate ladder see cass they werent stupid they were never stupid they knew i was there because they were failing and they wanted to impress me it was fear that was what drove most of them fear that they didnt measure up as if my opinion of them mattered at all but a lot of these guys their daddies told em they werent worth shit and they got into the office and all of a sudden the guy in charge can seem damn intimidating bring in ed schaffer the guy who listens and theyd tell me their golf handicap the women theyd bedded hell the car they drove take me out and buy me drinks even though their companies were paying me a goddamn fortune i ate a hell of a lot of rare filet and drank my share of single malt in those days smoke laughed a hollow sound that chilled cass to the core id listen and drink their booze and all the time im reading them figuring out where their fear came from once i knew that i had all i needed i broke them down and built them back up tore down the fear taught them to go in for the kill to man up on the job theres a leader inside us allthats what i had printed up on my business cards cass but you know what it really should have said was theres a scaredshitless fuck inside us all and all you get for your sixfifty an hour is learning how to turn that guy into the bully go from the steppedon to the guy who kicks sand into everyone elses face and the amazing thing was that no one ever figured it out they loved me ed youve changed my life ed i feel like i can do anything now i just smiled and bought them a final round and cashed my checks and never told them what they were really feeling was power i didnt teach anyone to lead cass i taught em to take to look at the world as their candy store and start turning over the shelves hell i got christmas cards from guys saying theyd dumped their mousy little girlfriends and finally told their families to fuck off and wasnt it great and deep down i knew what i was doing was not something i could be proud ofbut i didnt care because i think my biggest client was me i was never a hopeless case i wasnt the class loser or the guy who couldnt get a date or the one who got stuck in an entrylevel job i was justunexceptional but when i hung out my coach sign it was like telling the world i knew things they didnt i liked the mystique hell i used the mystique cass remembered how smoke had described his old life the sports cars the mountain getaways the skiing and boating and women it was hard to imagine the man she knewso carefully unassuming so determined to maintain his low profilein the picture he was painting but she let him talk chapter so around the holidays a couple years back i get this call from travis air force base you might remember i told you i used to work in that area in fairfield and drink with some of the guys from the base after work that wasnt exactly true they hired me on a consulting basis to come in and work with one of their guys who was losing his shit big project top secret very hush i had to sign all these papers and i wasnt allowed to talk about the project itself when i met with him only about his job in general terms the brass was in a tough situation because their leadership on the base had been stretched thini mean its not hard to figure out why now in the summer of that year bioterrorists attacked livestock in the us and asia by fall there were reports of dead livestock on every continent overseas travel was halted and remote nations began to go dark and skirmishes escalated and nuclear tensions were on the rise banks began to fail and currency was devalued worldwide my guy charlielieutenant colonel charlie benson right out of central casting looked like hed been painted in his uniform by norman rockwellhe had somehow risen to be the numbertwo guy on the base only the top guy he got called to wrightpatterson after the christmas strike charlie was losing his shit because he had personnel problems discipline problems protesters every day right outside the gates they send me in and for a while things are going okay at first hes just repeating everything i tell him to say we take a tough stance zero tolerance a civilian guy misses a shift because his wifes injured in a protest at a bank we can him we go out into the protesters one day with tear gasnext day its rubber bullets the shit was hardcore cass and it didnt even matter because the media had bigger stories than a few tree huggers getting their feelings hurt only charliehe surprised me he may have been the only guy i ever worked with who wasnt a coward he just wanted to think everything to death how he got that far in the military ill never understand because old charlies response to everything was to commission studies and conduct interviews and draft plans and he didnt really have a taste for power either his heart wasnt in it at first he went along with what i told him to do because he was worried about his job but as the country fell apart and we started hearing from the top brass less and less he began to push back he didnt want to act he wanted to wait lets see what the outlook is in six weeks hed say lets not respond out of panic that was one of his favorites made me fucking nuts i guess by then i figured this was the last big job id have until things sorted themselves out it might sound funny but i wasnt too worried about my own future i had my place in the mountains it was well stocked because we were always having power outages up there anyway nobody really believed this was the end of the world back then more like a hell of an inconvenience that might wipe out the underclass and decimate a few island nations no one had ever heard of so one day we get this order the kiv order the one that went to all the bases around the country by then i was reading charlies mail before he did confidential and otherwise theres about three hundred pages of scientific crap about the plant but all we were concerned about was the flight schedule and maps its a direct order theres no decision to be made except that the order has an attachment for bases in california only says how down in uccolima theyve developed this second strain that appears to boost immunity theyre making it available on an optional basis recommending a seed mix that includes two percent of this strain which has some long name with initials and numbers just like kaysev did back then there wasnt time to get approval in any other state and on the back page theres a test schedule and you can see they havent done even a quarter of the tests and the results of the ones they have are either blacked out or marked inconclusive so charlie he gets on the phone with the other guys in beale and edwards and so forth he wants to know what theyre thinking of doing now this is exactly the sort of behavior weve been working on for a month now how hes going to be accountable immediate and decisive aid that was his acronym and i made him repeat it every morning when we started the workday so when i hear him dicking around should we do this should we do that i pretty much lose my shit this is where you take charge i tell him this is where you come out strong make a name for yourself i ask him if he wants to go back to driving a desk in a cubicle when this is all over or if he wants to be remembered as the guy who saved californias assat least a few more asses in his region than elsewhere and still he fights me there wasnt enough testing the results are inconclusive the blackedout data is troubling blah blah blah im ready to deck the guy myself weve got a pm deadline to make the decision and by three oclock all the other bases have checked in as no they all lack the ballsat least thats the way i see it thats what i tell charlie i lock the door to his office and i start screaming at him i can feel this vein in my forehead standing out im giving it everything ive got everything in the edward schaffer bag o tricks calling him names questioning his manhood and he just sits there staring at me shaking his head finally when i have to stop for breath he says to me in this calm tired voice ed the only way that calls getting made is if you do it yourself he didnt mean it of course he never believed id do it and cass ive thought about it a thousand times and i didnt ever think id do it either i was giving him one last chancethats what i really believeand i just wanted him to act he could have punched me in the face and that would have been better than him sitting there with his dick in his hands waiting for the apocalypse and letting the inmates run the prison so i pick up his phone and all the time im thinking hell stop me and then im dialing and were staring at each other neither one of us blinking and the guy comes on the line and i say benson here and he says yes sir and still im waiting i give it an extralong pause and the guy on the other line is like sir sir are you there and charlie he does something that he gets out of his chair and he goes to the window and he turns his back on me he turns his fucking back on me and i tell you cass every cell in my body turned into the bully id failed to make him into and i remember thinking id show him id show him what it means to lead and i gave the order smoke was perspiring as he came to the end of the story after that i went home it was the last time i ever saw charlie actually afterlateri tried to find him but you know what happened to the base andwell i didnt try all that hard after a week or so it didnt matter anyway and by the time i realized what id done cass listened horrified as smokes voice trailed away this was it the thing smoke had done for which he could never forgive himself the sin that he would spend his whole life atoning for putting ahead of everything and everyone elseincluding cass and she knew how he saw it smoke believed he had singlehandedly unleashed the beaters if he hadnt made the callif the mixed seed had never been loaded into the planes alongside the otherwise fine kaysev seedif the first blueleaf had never sprouted but you cant believe its all your fault the words burst from her before she had a chance to think there were a thousand parts to play in what happened the people who developed it who were supposed to test it charlies commander but she realized that smoke wasnt really listening he was looking off into space reviewing the story that would never leave him she wanted to make him see to shake him scream at him until he finally gave up his steadfast determination to suffer but smoke wouldnt even listen anger bubbled below the surface of casss sorrow it was a terrible waste throwing his life away like this over something he could not change a mistake he never intended but what was worsehed thrown away more than his life hed discarded their love the day he left the box abandoned it as though it was worthless it was no wonder cass realized that shed felt so hurt because even though his error had terrible consequences even though it had changed him irrevocably it still was not enough not enough to trade her for not enough to have made her feel so small so hurtto have driven her into the arms of another man but no that was wrong she would not blame smoke for that when she went to dor she went willingly and when she loved him she loved him fiercely cass held smokes hand for a while longer considering and eventually abandoning her anger forgiving a man who did not seek her forgiveness finally it was time to leave the darkening little room by then cass finally understood why smoke had to leave her back in the box why he would always have to leave her for one justice quest after another he could never fully give himself to her because hed already given himself over to the job of punishing himself forever one agonizing day at a time chapter two mornings later she was the last to linger at the foot of the trail watching the small party ride up the incline through the binoculars shed borrowed from bart bart had stayed back to tend to one of the horses who had picked up something in his hoof and been favoring it all day he was worried that a trip to the settlement and back would be too much for the horse besides three men were more than enough to do the reconnaissance there were only two possible outcomes the first was that the settlement party had reached salt point and were now in some state of construction the first wave would probably not be thrilled to see them but the new council had put a lot of effort into how to present their case and even cass had to admit that it was a compelling one focusing more on the skills and resources they brought and less on the challenges they presented though no one voiced the thought out loud theyd lost their weakest members they would not have to beg passage for their elderly or injured the other possibility nagged at her no matter how she tried to force it from her mindthat no one waited for them at salt point that there was nothing there besides beautiful scenery and spring snows a plot of land perfect for a wellsupplied wellrested party with the luxury of a plan and the means to implement it but the edenites had come with only what they could carry enough food for another week they had children and old people they were demoralized by loss and lacking clear leadership cass was certain that if nothing waited for them but bare land they would lose more people before the summer came still the little advance team seemed to lift everyones spirits as they took off at a brisk pace up the mountain dor and smoke had become competent riders bart had been training them for the past week after they determined that smoke and dor and nadir would ride ahead smoke had lingering stiffness in his hip and leg and getting in the saddle presented a challenge but by the third day he had mastered the move dor tended to impatience with the animals but once he started riding rocket who had been mayhews mount it went more easily rocket was as stubborn and headstrong as dor himself nadir was the key to the groups cohesiveness smoke and dor spoke mostly toand throughhim cass didnt miss the way the men avoided each other if one walked by the other would step out of the way or pretend to be engaged in some small task the few words they exchanged were brief and barbed it made cass melancholy to remember their old friendship in the box true dor had been smokes employer but theyd worked as partners from the start they talked for hours trained together most mornings fought and worked side by side now after so much had passed she finally knew the secret smoke had confided in dor and forgiven him for choosing to share it with him instead of her dor had never told anyone about the thing smoke had done and she understood that the secret would stay with the three of them and someday die with them at first shed thought that the secret should be enough to bind them all its terrible weight a burden they could only bear together but now she understood that loving her had driven the two men apart they were both proud men both passionate loath to compromise now that shed separated herself from them both she saw the way they drove themselves harder than ever smokes regimen of healing left him spent and exhausted each night but he didnt rest until hed done a full share of work dor often seemed to be everywhere at once consulting with the new council helping anyone who asked and throwing himself into the manual labor of breaking camp splitting wood hauling water anything to burn off his endless supply of glowering humorless energy paradoxically he seemed more and more at home the farther they traveled from civilization this was an inhospitable part of the country far from any mountain pass or even an improved road dor was undaunted by the lack of commerce power lines any evidence of community theyd been following the map the easterners had laid out and found this final camp exactly where it had been marked eight miles down mountain from salt point on what had been an old stagecoach road many years ago and in recent decades had served only the most intrepid sportsmen crosscountry skiers backpackers and fishermen on the map the camp was not named but a note scrawled in the margin read cabins well water no elec there was no sign of a well anywhere and only three cabins remained standing one reinforced sometime in the last decade with repairs to the board siding and a new handrail the other two in sorry shape elsewhere the remains of other cabins were stacked haphazardly on the positive side there was no evidence of beaters anywhere in the camp cass who had been on the lookout for the whole journey had not seen a single blue leaf in at least a week perhaps it was true that it could not tolerate the harsh winters of the north best of all neatly parked in a row at one end of the camp were three empty flatbed trucks and the trail leading up the mountain was deeply rutted the logical conclusion was that the first wave had arrived and used a compact tractor to take load after load of supplies up the trail last night theyd built a celebratory bonfire from discarded lumber and kept it going all night and since there was no threat of precipitation almost everyone slept on the ground near the fire volunteers took turns feeding boards into the flames an extravagance theyd think twice about if anyone expected to be here more than a single night in the morning there was an atmosphere of subdued cheerof hope people stirred from their fireside pallets pushed themselves up on elbows sat up in tangles of blankets the wood was damp the fire smoky but people leaned in close nonetheless warming their hands they pushed back their hoods and combed disheveled hair with their fingers and looked at the sky gasping at the beauty of the mountain face illuminated with the rising sun there were murmured goodmornings gentle inquiries as to how the night had passed for breakfast there was freshcaught fish as much as anyone cared to eat grilled over the fire the teens took over the serving and cleanup duties unasked a couple of the boys tossed a tennis ball with the little kids not everyone was holding up well a handful of edenites sat apart morose and uncommunicative the circles under some of the older folks eyes had deepened and they werent eating posttraumatic stress cass figured but there was little she could do for it now she brought food to ingrid took her turn holding rosie across the clearing valerie glared at her while she helped with the horse cass turned away dor smoke and nadir were surrounded by wellwishers when they took their leave a spirit of cautious optimism pervading the group cass stood near the back and watched dor hug sammi and then search her out in the group for a tense moment she felt both dor and smoke watching her and she looked away turning toward the path theyd climbed the day before and focused on a hawk that soared lazily above the valley below she waited until they were off the ground reverberating with the horses hoofbeats before she busied herself with cleaning up from the morning meal now with ruthie asleep on a cabin porch with twyla after a long and unseasonably warm day of playing at the edges of the stream and everyone else either fishing or napping or strolling taking advantage of their first day of rest in weeks cass slipped away from the camp following the trail where the men had ridden this morning she wanted to be the first to see them return she was still looking for clues and having failed to find any in the mirror the night before thought she might find them now two men had ridden away with nadir this morning both had loved her but she wasnt sure if her future lay with either of them for several days shed felt that the answer was tantalizingly close perhaps the feeling was nothing but the imminence of the journeys end but cass thought it had to be something more the horses had navigated the steep incline and thick forest growth well but cass had difficulty walking the rutted path as she ascended the mountain the air grew colder and thinner here and there in the hollows of rotting stumps in the loamy soil layered with leaves from seasons before there were pockets of grimy snow flecked with debris and slick from melting once or twice cass saw shoots poking through the snow pale green fronds tipped with tightrolled leaves plants whose delicacy belied their hardiness cass wasnt sure exactly what the plants werecheckerbloom perhaps that would soon grow tiny pink blossomsbut whatever they were she counted their presence a hopeful omen the notes said that after a couple of miles the path evened out and crossed a broad plateau before arriving at the river gorge salt point was on the other side a heelshaped promontory that had been carved by a bend in the river when prehistoric waters rushing westward down the mountains met the volcanic rock face and turned south beyond mount karuk rose sharply to the highest peak for many miles there were two ways to the point the longer of which took switchbacks up the eastern incline and featured steep dropoffs and a waterfall that made the path impassable later in the spring when the snowmelt was at its highest the other was the bridge built in the late eighties by the developer whose planned resort never materialized after cost overruns on the early development killed enthusiasm for the project among its backers it took cass an hour to ascend to the plateau but it was worth the effort for the spectacular view alone the path hugged a dropoff down to the roaring river a few pines clinging valiantly to the earth at the edge above the sheer rock face hundreds of feet below the water coursed over boulders rising from the bed of the river and formed deceptively placid pools here and there along the banks but the falls that fed the river were even more astonishing droplets misted casss face from all the way across the gorge its roar was thunderous rainbows arced above glittering against the blue of the sky darkening the rocks with water birds dipped and soared suspended far above the water between the walls of the chasm and it was dizzying to watch their aerial play the bridge lay far ahead on the twisting trail it looked out of place here its manmade symmetry in sharp contrast to the natural beauty carved by the vicissitudes of wind and water and time on the other side of the bridge the road disappeared into the forest that grew as on this side practically to the edge of the cliff the developers must have planned to cut down the trees to give access to the views that would have been the star attraction of the resort but for now they would make a perfect windbreak for the settlement that was located on the cleared land beyond in the grainy aerial photos cass had been able to see the stumps left from when they began work on the resort it was like a giant had gouged a huge square into the forest lifting away the trees and leaving the rich land exposed it really was a perfect location remote and easy to protect wouldbe attackers could be repelled in so many ways most of them ending with their bodies crushed and broken on the rocks far below she found a spot to wait a loamy patch of earth below a tall tree and leaned back against it enjoying the sun on her face shed worn an extra fleece tied around her waist and she pulled it on and reveled in its cozy warmth breathing in the good clean scents of sap and kaysev a bug crawled over her hand and she lifted it closer to her face an iridescentwinged beetle of some sort searching for tender leaves itself food for birds evidence that the earths insistent journey back toward life continued apace here in the north cass let her eyes drift shut and daydreamed about the settlement the home she might make there she and suzanne and ingrid would be the first mothers but there would be others before long new babies to join rosie new friends for sammi and the other young people and the garden shed have up here so many things she hadnt been able to grow farther south shed have beds of lettuces and kale and beans and squash an entire patch of pumpkins every kind of herb in one summer she could lay up enough to can produce a cutting garden a cold frame to see them through the winter in two summers she could have fruit on the trees apples and pears real pies she thought with a smile not the bitter ones made from hawthorn berries and she wanted to try growing grains give everyone a break from the kaysev flour wheat should be possible in this climate maybe barley as soon as things were straightened out with the settlement she and dor dor she was thinking of him again he had become the place her mind went whenever she let it roam the note to which her heart gave voice when she let her guard down but that couldnt be rightcould it her life was barely back on track again far from ready to share with anyone else besides ruthie she was eighteen days sober and she needed to get to and then she needed to stay sober forever she had to learn to live with the hurt and damage shed suffered and the rocky path she walked before and still walked now she would take one day at a time and be worthy of ruthie and this would be enough but dor dor with his ebony eyes and his voice like sandstone his breath on her neck and his hands tracing that place on her back she could not shake him she couldnt even pretend to try anymore smokes return had not eradicated him danger and battle and bloodshed and loss had not eradicated him and even more shocking she had lost her shame she was tired of feeling bad about valerie she was tired of secondguessing herself about sammi she was even tired of thinking of everyone elses needs before her own when what she needed was more of him more of dor without a plan or a pledge cass drank in the sun and dug her fingers into the earth and breathed the good air and allowed herself to wonder if maybe she was more than the sum of her addiction and her sobriety more than just ruthies mother if maybe shed done her penance and suffered enough and deserved something only for herself even with the scars and the regrets some of her spirit remained and some of it was good and some of it was worthy and at least some tiny part of her bid to live came from these depths from this place that had been there when she was born and hung in there during all the terrible years and survived the addictions and the bad decisions and the selfpunishment and this part of her this part that was not mother and that was not pilgrim or penitent or servant this part wanted dor wanted him savagely smoke had been her lover her salve as she had been his dor was her fire and as long as she lived she would burn for him dor she spoke his name softly testing it tasting it as though for the first time erasing for a moment all the history theyd shared the chaos in which theyd first come together her heart raced with the thrill of recognition and suddenly it was all so clear it seemed as though the earth itself trembled in response to casss new knowledge but then she realized it was the approaching horses pounding the earth with their hooves they crashed around the bend in a cloud of dust dor in the lead when he saw cass he reined in his horse and rocket reared and snorted to a stop the others circled around nadir in the rear and it took a second for cass to realize that the bundle he had slung over the saddle in front of him was a body cass what are you doing i just came to theres no time get up here with me smoke made room for her in front of him weve got to get back to the others now cass stood frozen to the spot searching their faces what what happened dor guided his horse forward in between the others he leaned down and seized her hand pulling her up as if she was weightless and she scrambled onto the horses heaving warm back sliding into the saddle pressed close against dors body she caught smokes expression his hand slowly falling to his side he saw he knew theyre coming he said numbly renegades from the east like nadir was telling us they picked the same settlement mayhew did we have to get there first nadir said grimly were going to help defend them dor wrapped his arms around her and spurred his horse into motion theres no one to help he said into her ear his breath hot on her neck the renegades sent a team ahead they burned the settlement and killed everyone inside chapter the renegades advance team had actually killed all the settlers but one as the edenites scrambled to gather their belongings dor summoned sunhi to examine the woman nadir carried on his horse sunhi declared that she would probably live the blow to the head that had knocked her unconscious had saved her shed been dragged to the center of the settlement and piled with the other bodies as the four men who attacked them soon after dawn lined up the people eight at a time and shot them executionstyle the woman moaned when sunhi probed the wound on her scalp and winced when she wrapped it in bandages made from a torn shirt janet almost got away she said listlessly she made it to the trees before they got her smoke and nadir stood on the porch of the sturdiest cabin and smoke whistled for attention he described the horror that lay up the trail the mismatched battle they faced i know who these men are nadir said barely controlling the anger in his voice they were trouble back home there are stories of things they have done bad things i do not know who they have convinced to come with them here if they recruited others like themselves but we must plan for the worst they have already killed dozens of innocent people they will not hesitate to kill more of them we could turn around smoke said we could retreat down the mountain reach our cars and be safely out of the area by the time these people arrive we could keep looking for shelter elsewhere but we will not do that he waited a moment for his words to sink in for everyone to grasp the scenario he painted cass knew she was seeing evidence of the talent that had made him such a good coach his conviction and charisma we will not retreat he repeated and there was silence among the gathering everyone was riveted if we do not take this settlement for our home odds are we wont survive the spring weve lost half our number so far and conditions here are nearly intolerable for those who arent prepared yes we will be living off the hard work of the slaughteredat first but i am not afraid to tell you that it is better for us to seize the spoils than for them to fall to murderers might does not make right my friends smoke paused again and searched the crowd making eye contact with each of them when he got to cass he lingered for a moment and the look they exchanged was tinged with a wistful sort of pain that she knew would only be cured by the passage of time and then he moved on but sometimes the right can be mighty we are in the right here i have not known you long but i think i have known you well ive fought beside you grieved with you and now i have the audacity to hope with you the applause started with a single pair of hands echoing across the camp cass was surprised to see that it was valerie she had not returned to her headbands and her tentative smiles she stood apart in her black clothes and her dark glasses and slickbacked hair and a scowl so fierce cass didnt doubt she was looking forward to a fight when the applause died down smoke outlined the plan such as it was get there first dig in deep shoot like hell and hold nothing back if the edenites were disappointed with this barebones strategy they didnt let on the procession set out grimfaced and silent the easterners led the horses at the front steve and fat mike carried dane and dirk and twyla squeezed into the jogger stroller with ruthie red and zihna pushing it up the incline ingrid strapped rosie to her chest in a papoose valerie had rigged from a blanket cass waited to take her place in the procession people filed past until finally it was just her and dor she fell in step next to him but theyd only gone a few feet when sammi came racing back down the trail she was out of breath unslinging her backpack and digging around inside it dont say anything dad because i dont want to hear it only i thought you should have this cass knew the tapedtogether package of plastic bricks and wires was the real thing because of the way dors face went utterly white where in the name of everything holy did you get this sammi sammis face looked like it was going to crumple i said dont you dont want to talk about it that would be fine if you were late coming home from the movies but thisshit sammi this could have killed us all theres enough here to blow up this entire camp this was owens cass said wasnt it sammi for a second sammi looked confused and then her eyes met casss and cleared cass had no doubt sammi had gotten the explosives from colton but whatever poor decisions the boy had made in the past cass felt that the time for punishing him for them was over yes the girl said shyly but how cass knew it was fear that raised dors voicenot for the dangers ahead but fear for his daughter for the fact that shed been ferrying this terrible load in her backpack but sammi would only hear the anger and the fragile peace between them was not strong enough yet to withstand such a test its not the time she said taking dors arm look at me please he did she saw the indigo sparks in his narrowed eyes the scars that started at his hairline and bisected an eyebrow the fine lines that had appeared at his eyes and the corners of his mouth sammi did the right thing she said softly she was brave and strong and you are so lucky to have her all of that is true and i wasnt saying so thank her dor frowned at her for a moment then turned back to his daughter youre he stopped his voice cracking youre my world sammi i couldnt stand if anything happened to you thank you for bringing this to me ohdad now she did cry fat tears rolling down her cheeks and splashing to the ground go go find your friends and stay with them stay with them no matter what sammi you promise me i promise she mumbled and kissed him on the cheek before dashing back up the trail after the others for gods sake put that thing away cass said and she held his pack for him while he settled it into the outermost compartment then set it down and grabbed her hand pulling her close he circled his arms around her waist but his touch was not gentle cass his voice was low and rough and he made her name sound like a threat youre he shook his head and cass understood that words eluded him because her own thoughts were in disarray declarations of love were not for them gentle endearments would never pass between them there would be no private names no anniversaries he would not sing her love songs or write her letters and she would not be his helpmate she would never wear his ring but they would continue to find each other as long as the fire burned within them and cass knew the fire was at the very heart of her that it would not dim until her life was at its end youre mine he said and then he kissed her hard his hands slid down to pull her against him and she felt her body respond the heat inside her unfurling as she returned his kiss it was over in seconds it was not the timeand yet it was always the time and as they headed up the trail lateafternoon sun filtering through the trees to dapple everything with enchantment cass wondered how she could have ever not known chapter they rested at the same clearing where cass had stopped earlier ingrid nursed rosie while the children played tag and bart watered the horses when they started out again the broad plain was a welcome change from the steep climb the sound of the waterfall grew louder as they drew closer and the air was chilly with mist the cold seeped into their clothes and by the time they reached the bridge they were thoroughly damp and miserable but the bridge itself was nothing short of miraculous it had never endured automobile traffic since the roads from the highway to the resort had never been built the asphalt here was smooth and pristine the yellow striping fresh other than bird guano and the litter of workmens lunches from long ago nothing sullied the surface kalyan gave a whoop when he set foot on the bridge and the mood brightened perceptibly there on the other side was their future they were so close now that it was tempting to forget the battle they would have to fight to keep it smoke and dor and nadir had decided their best bet was to travel past the cleared space through the thick forest to the steep face of the mountain and make camp there for the night only those who were armeda dozen of themwould spend the night in the settlement hiding behind the framed structures ready to defend their claim to it when the renegades came back in the morning depending on how many were in the renegades party they would either capture them kill them or fight them in the event that there were enough of the enemy to prevail even after being ambushed then at least the other edenites would have a chance to escape down the mountain circling back along the path that bisected the falls there was no guarantee the falls were passable though the snowmelt had barely begun that was a chance they would have to take the bridge was almost a quartermile long according to mayhews notes and as they walked cass alternated between staring over the edge at the breathtaking drop to the boulderstrewn river rushing below and the falls as they drew closer the falls force and volume seemed to grow and cass became increasingly doubtful about whether anyone could find solid enough footing behind the wall of water to cross to the other sideespecially a person carrying a child she did not share these fears the crowd had fallen silent except for the gentle snorting of the horses and the sound of their hooves the children rested in the arms of those carrying them sammi and her friends held hands near the front all of them except for shane who walked by himself off to the side the girls tossed the occasional pebble into the chasm beneath them but otherwise they were silent and serious when they had nearly reached the other side a sharp crack sounded all around them bouncing off the canyon walls and echoing back then there was another and anothera bullet flying a few feet from the crowd and people screamed and ran for shelter along the bridges sides where a small overhang on the waisthigh concrete walls offered almost no protection where are they shooting from nadir demanded frantically sighting along the forest in front of them which was dense and dark in the late afternoon there was nobody there but another shot was followed by screaming and tanner mobley fell to the ground with a bloody hole ripped in his side cass look dor muttered and she turned to look back the way theyd come there emerging from the clearing on the other side were men a dozen of them eighteen twenty wearing camouflage and hunting jackets all of them armed they were racing toward the bridge and a couple of them with longdistance scopes were shooting as they ran tanner moaned and spasmed as more bullets struck the walls of the bridge cass felt her entire body go cold with terror if the edenites continued ahead onto the point they would draw the battle into the settlement running might delay the inevitable but the fact was that they were mostly unarmed weighed down with children and pregnant women if those who were armed took up positions at the edge of the forest sheltered by trees they could pick off their attackers as they approached cass had no doubt that between her and smoke and dor and the others they would manage to kill a few of them but what then they had only the ammunition that they carried and most of them were barely adequate shots even if they took out half their attackers that left ten more who would make it into the clearing where the rest of the edenites would be waiting like sitting ducks the inescapable truth was the edenites were insufficiently armed unskilled and mostly untrainedmothers with children teenagers ordinary citizens with the perplexing luck to have survived more than most by contrast the men racing toward them looked as though they had been training for survival as though they were handpicked to kill deadly fit lean and determined their shouts carried across the expanse of bridge guttural cries terrifyingly close dor was unshouldering his backpack he lowered it gently to the ground then knelt and started unzipping it smoke cass nadir take everyone with younow go what are you going to do he pulled out the brick of plastic explosive and set it on the ground with great care he looked up at cass and for a second he went still his eyes wide with emotion then he looked away go damn it cass get the fuck out of here you heard him smoke said its the only way cass go nadir was already gone shouting ahead to the others who were running as fast as they could some of them already off the bridge scrambling up onto the grassy bank of the point he ran behind them shouting encouragement urging them to go faster more bullets flew around them and ahead a bright bloom of red appeared on a womans back and she went stiff falling slowly to the ground on her face the terrified screaming crescendoed come on smoke yelled it was only the three of them on the bridge now dor working frantically at the mass of wires and the pale doughy bricks cass looked beyond him searched out red and zihna ruthie in her fathers arms there were the kids sammi and the rest of them and the young mothers the seeds of a new community no she said the decision made before she even considered the alternative she would not leave him she would not leave dor you go go on ahead ill be right behind you go cass i dont need you dor muttered but the wires slipped from his fingers and he cursed frantically he picked them up again pressing the ends between his finger and thumb cass smokes voice broke goddamn it ill stay here with him weve got it taken care of please for the love of god just get the hell off this bridge the mens eyes met and cass knew they had come to an unspoken agreement that they were both willing to sacrifice themselves for her for the others for the future leads came out of the igniter dor said tightly and smoke nodded and took hold of the loose piece dor twisted something and pulled the two of them anticipating each others moves hold thathere steady no she shouted because without themwithout dorthere was no future for her no look i can more shots and cass looked up to see that the men were terrifyingly close close enough to make out the red logos on their jackets the muzzles of their guns she dropped to the concrete saw that the wires were back in place but the minute smoke took his hand away they slipped out again someone had to hold them in place smoke made a sound next to her a soft exhalation and when she looked into his face it had gone completely pale cass he whispered please something warm dripped onto her hand and she looked down and saw the blood an enormous round splotch on the back of her hand slowly dripping down through her fingers no she looked back up at his face and saw how his eyelids fluttered how his mouth was twisted in pain smoke whose face shed first seen on the broken pavement of a school parking lot in silva shed been broken stinking terrified a thing of need driven only to find her daughter but smoke had loved her he had helped her save ruthie but he had also loved her back to life his great gift to her and if in the end it had not been enough it was not his fault he had given her more than he gave anyone in this world more than he could ever give himself and she would never forget tears filled her eyes even as dor cursed and wrapped the wires tightly around smokes fingers and then gently pushed the ends back into place he knew he knew hang on buddy he said softly and smoke nodded and then his eyes closed and cass knew he was beyond speech but still his grip held he held on oh god oh no cass sobbed and she kissed his face his eyelids his lips and then dor pushed her and she got to her feet already running her legs moving like theyd never moved before dor right behind her pushing her still his hand at her back making her faster getting her there saving her and all the while she whispered smokes name and remembered that she had loved him once and would always love him for what hed given her for the gift of loving her first casss muscles burned and her lungs screamed and then it came then it came the explosion was all sound and blast and then a great shuddering quake below her feet heat at her back and grit pounded against her neck her wrists her face but the end of the bridge was still too far away they were not going to make it cass saw the truth reflected in the horrified faces of the people waiting she heard the ripping steel and crumpling asphalt behind her the screams of their pursuers the blast of debris hurled against the rock walls of the canyon and then the ground shifted beneath her as the bridge split and canted toward earth the sound was deafening the sound of hell itself the air swallowed by the echoing blast and she fell her knees cracking against the concrete so it was here she would die broken on the rocks next to the bodies of her enemies only the very last of the many deadly threats since the siege but at least it would be instant and she would be washed clean in the freezing water of the river before her body was deposited lifeless and pale on a gravel spit far downstream it would be consumed by animals picked to the bones dried to nothing while far above the new community took hold ruthie and dor and sammi and her father and all the others shed known the imperfect people shed loved sometimes badly but always with all of her heart and then she felt herself being dragged again her arm nearly pulled from its socket dor bellowed her name and she scrabbled on the crumbling asphalt as a huge chunk of the bridge split off a few yards away from her and fell toward the water she slipped back a foot another and then miraculously her boots found purchase and she propelled herself forward holding tightly to the hands reaching for her climbing with bloodied fingers up the sloping tearing edifice above them the bridges concrete footings began to separate from the earth into which theyd been poured like tree roots after a storm tearing off chunks of dirt and saplings with them she realized dor was trying to help her even though he was about to lose his own grip somehow hed managed to climb ahead and had one arm wrapped around an exposed root his feet kicking against the gaping earth and still he was reaching for her above him people screamed and reached for him but he did not take his eyes off her she slid another few inches nails scraping and breaking on the crumbling surface before she found her footing again and pushed herself upward toward the rough poured concrete it provided a handhold but too late too late as the footings separated from the earth and seemed to hang in the air for a moment before the entire bridge half slammed down into the gorge cass screamed and flailed wildly her hand brushing the feathery leaves of a wild honeysuckle vine she seized it and held on with all her strength getting her other hand around the branch as the bridge fell away beneath her feet and she was suspended in the air she looked down and knew it was a mistake when she saw the bridge span split into pieces on the rocks the water frothing and geysering around the detritus she thought a body bobbed on the surface of the water for a second before disappearing beneath smokeoh god smoke was down there smoke was dead he had died saving them her hands slipped on the vine and she realized the shrill screaming was coming from her desperately she tried to pull herself up her arms quivering with the effort but the vine tore away from the earth flinging clots of dirt into her face a thin network of roots was all that held the woody vine beginning to splinter at the base and then strong hands closed over hers and she let herself be lifted dragged across the muddy outcropping to safety she lay facedown heaving for air exhausted and aching using the last of her strength to lift her chin and search for dor and there he was on his knees in the dirt hed made it theyd lifted him to safety too and she was weak with gratitude as he crawled to her and took her in his arms and she lay there cradled in his safety while he kissed her hair and whispered her name when she got her breath she twisted to look behind her where the bridge used to be the earth was torn and jagged on either side of the gorge down below the rushing water had swept most of the bridge away a few broken edges jutting from the surface where pieces lodged among the rocks there was no sign of the attackers bodies the river had swallowed them whole and at its leisure would spit them out again indifferent as the rest of the earth to human struggles to right and wrong intent only on coming back to life itself chapter it was nearly nightfall in the camp theyd put out the smoldering fires around the settlement and built a new one in the center feeding it with the lumber from a ruined structure that nadir identified as the ornamental gate with the symbol of the new community designed by the people of his old town a clover with four leaves to represent the four settlements the attackers had actually left most of the place intact burning largely superficial structures or maybe they had intended to pile the bodies on a pyre to burn and run out of time for now the edenites carried the bodies outside the edge of the settlement to a grassy clearing tomorrow they would dig graves smoke would have no grave but cass did not need one to visit for her the river itself would be his memorial she would visit it in every season she would look down at the rushing waters crusted with ice in winter running with fish in summer and she would remember and honor him one building in the clearing was nearly complete a long wide dormitory with windows set high in the walls and a roof framed out and nearly finished the firstwave settlers had outfitted the building with bedding and a few personal items photos tacked to walls rolledup socks and clothing stacked on the floor they gathered these and stored them at one end before getting the children settled for the night pink insulation lined the walls and roof of the structure already the heat of their bodies was warming the interior everyone was silent the latest losses had stunned them the terrible memories of the attackers falling into the gorge the bodies of the four whod been shot while trying to cross the daunting tasks that lay ahead of them all of this was too much to bear at the end of this long and cursed day tomorrow they would take up the yoke of their futures yet again but for now they were spent and before long everyone went to bed cass waited until dors breathing became deep and even beside her and then she got up as carefully as she could her body ached from her scrapes and bruises and she limped painfully out into the night the moon lit her path back to the gorge glinting off bits of mica in the earth souvenirs from a volcanic eruption aeons ago she shivered in the cold but she would not be out here long at the edge she looked out over the river and the land beyond the sloping trail that led back down to the camp and finally the road back to civilization here on this side they were safefor a night a month a seasonno one could say the future was unknowable but she knew some other things she knew the sound of her daughters voice the touch of a strong man the friendship of people who were no longer strangers the love of her father she did not yet know the limits of her strength but she was ready to be tested and tested again she would be tempted and discouraged and broken but she would come back each time into this world that had been bequeathed to them into the dangers that threatened them and the joys that waited buried but not impossible for them to unearth and cherish thank you she whispered into the wind praying to a god she was not sure existed whose purpose she did not yet know her words were plucked from her lips and carried into the night no one to hear them but the spirits of the dead after a moment she turned and started back to the settlement tomorrow she would work alongside the other survivors her family her lover her friends she would do the next right thing and the next in small and humble ways she would begin to live again acknowledgments the aftertime series marks a turning point in my life as a writer because of the efforts of my
