ian rankin doors open copyright john rebus ltd the open door was only yards away and beyond it lay the outside world eerily unaffected by anything happening inside the abandoned snooker hall two thickset men had slumped bloodily to the floor four more figures were seated on chairs hands tied behind them ankles bound a fifth was wriggling like a snake towards the doorway straining with the effort his girlfriend was yelling encouragement as the man called hate stepped forward and slammed the door shut on all their hopes and dreams hauling the chair and its occupant back to the original line im going to kill you all the man spat face smeared with his own blood mike mackenzie didnt doubt him for a second what else was someone called hate going to do mike was staring at the door reminded that this chain of events had begun so innocently with a party and with friends and with greed and desire but above all with doors opening and closing a few weeks earlier mike saw it happen there were two doors next to one another one of them seemed to be permanently ajar by about an inch except when someone pushed at its neighbour as each liveried waiter brought trays of canapés into the saleroom the effect was the same one door would swing open and the other would slowly close it said a lot about the quality of the paintings mike thought that he was paying more attention to a pair of doors but he knew he was wrong it was saying nothing about the actual artworks on display and everything about him mike mackenzie was thirtyseven years old rich and bored according to the business pages of various newspapers he remained a selfmade software mogul except that he was no longer a mogul of anything his company had been sold outright to a venture capital consortium rumour had it that he was a burnout and maybe he was hed started the software business fresh from university with a friend called gerry pearson gerry had been the real brains of the operation a genius programmer but shy with it so that mike quickly became the public face of the company after the sale theyd split the proceeds fiftyfifty and gerry then surprised mike by announcing that he was off to start a new life in sydney his emails from australia extolled the virtues of nightclubs city life and surfing and not for once the computer kind he would also send mike jpegs and mobilephone snaps of the ladies he encountered along the way the quiet reserved gerry of old had disappeared replaced by a rambunctious playboy which didnt stop mike from feeling like a bit of a fraud he knew that without gerry hed have failed to make the grade in his chosen field building the business had been exciting and nerveracking existing on three or four hours sleep a night often in hotel rooms far away from home while gerry preferred to pore over circuit boards and programming issues back in edinburgh ironing the glitches out of their bestknown software application had given both of them a buzz that had lasted for weeks but as for the money well the money had come flooding in bringing with it lawyers and accountants advisers and planners assistants diary secretaries media interest social invites from bankers and portfolio managers and not much else mike had grown tired of supercars the lambo had lasted barely a fortnight the ferrari not much longer he drove a secondhand maserati these days bought on impulse from the small ads tired too of jet travel fivestar suites gadgets and gizmos his penthouse apartment had featured in a style magazine much being made of its view the city skyline all chimneypots and church spires until you reached the volcanic plug on top of which sat edinburgh castle but occasional visitors could tell that mike hadnt made much of an effort to adjust his life to fit his new surroundings the sofa was the same one hed brought from his previous home ditto the dining table and chairs old magazines and newspapers sat in piles either side of the fireplace and there was little evidence that the vast flatscreen television with its surroundsound speakers ever got much use instead guests would fix their attention on the paintings art one of mikes advisers had advised was a canny investment hed then gone on to suggest the name of a broker who would ensure that mike bought wisely wisely and well had been his exact words but mike learned that this would mean buying paintings he didnt necessarily like by feted artists whose coffers he didnt really feel like filling it would also mean being prepared to part with paintings he might admire solely to comply with the fluctuations of the market instead of which he had gone his own way attending his first sale and finding a seat right at the front surprised that a few chairs were still vacant while people seemed content to stand in a crush at the back of the room of course he had soon learned the reason those at the back had a clear view of all the bidders and could revise their own bids accordingly as his friend allan confided afterwards mike had paid about three grand too much for a bossun still life because a dealer had spotted him as a tyro and had toyed with him edging the price upwards in the knowledge that the arm at the front of the room would be hoisted again but why the hell would he do that mike had asked appalled hes probably got a few bossuns tucked away in storage allan had explained if prices for the artist look like theyre on the way up hell get more interest when he dusts them off but if id pulled out hedve been stuck with the one i bought to which allan had just shrugged and given a smile allan was somewhere in the saleroom right now catalogue open as he perused potential purchases not that he could afford much not on a banking salary but he had a passion for art and a good eye and would become wistful on the day of the actual auction as he watched paintings he coveted being bought by people he didnt know those paintings hed told mike might disappear from public view for a generation or more worst case theyre bought as investments and placed in a vault for safe keeping no more meaning to their buyer than compound interest youre saying i shouldnt buy anything not as an investment you should buy whatever pleases you as a result of which the walls of mikes apartment were replete with art from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries most of it scottish he had eclectic tastes so that cubism sat alongside pastoral portraiture beside collage for the most part allan approved the two had first met a year ago at a party at the banks investment arm hq on george street the first caledonian bank first caly as it was more usually called owned an impressive corporate art collection large fairbairn abstracts flanked the entrance lobby with a coulton triptych behind the reception desk first caly employed its own curator whose job it was to discover new talent often from degree shows then sell when the price was right and replenish the collection mike had mistaken allan for the curator and theyd struck up a conversation allan cruikshank allan had said shaking mikes hand and of course i already know who you are sorry about the mixup mike had apologised with an embarrassed grin its just that we seem to be the only people interested in whats on the walls allan cruikshank was in his late forties and as he put it expensively divorced with two teenage sons and a daughter in her twenties he dealt with hnws high net worth individuals but had assured mike that he wasnt angling for business instead in the absence of the curator hed shown mike as much of the collection as was open for general viewing mds office will be locked hes got a wilkie and a couple of raeburns in the weeks after the party theyd exchanged emails gone out for drinks a few times and become friends mike had come to the viewing this evening only because allan had persuaded him that it might be fun but so far he had seen nothing to whet his jaded appetite other than a charcoal study by one of the major scottish colourists and he already had three at home much the same probably torn from the selfsame sketchbook you look bored allan said with a smile he held his dogeared catalogue in one hand and a drained champagne flute in the other tiny flakes of pastry on his striped tie showed that he had sampled the canapés i am bored no golddigging blondes sidling up to you with offers youd be hard pressed to refuse not so far well this is edinburgh after all more chance of being asked to make up a four for bridge allan looked around him busy old night all the same usual mix of freeloaders dealers and the privileged and which are we were art lovers michael pure and simple so is there anything youll be bidding on come auction day probably not allan gave a sigh staring into the depths of his parched glass the next lot of school fees are still on my desk awaiting chequebook and i know what youre going to say plenty of good schools in the city without needing to pay for one you yourself attended a roughhewn comprehensive and it didnt do you any harm but this is tradition were talking about three generations all schooled at the same fusty establishment my father would curdle in his grave if i put the boys elsewhere im sure margot would have something to say about it too at mention of his exwife allan gave an exaggerated shudder mike smiled playing his part he knew better than to offer financial assistance hed made that mistake once before a banker a man whose daily dealings involved some of the wealthiest individuals in scotland couldnt be seen to accept handouts you should get margot to pay her share mike teased youre always saying she earns as much as you do and used that purchasing power to good effect when she chose her lawyers another tray of undercooked pastry was coming past mike shook his head while allan asked if the fizz could be pointed in their direction not that its worth the effort he muttered to mike ersatz if you ask me thats why theyve wrapped those white cotton napkins around the bottles means we cant read the label he took another look around the chatterfilled room have you pressed the flesh with laura yet a glance and a smile mike replied she seems popular tonight the winter auction was the first one shed fronted allan reminded him and it didnt exactly catch fire she needs to woo potential buyers and we dont fit the bill with due respect mike youre fairly transparent you lack what gamblers would call the poker face that little glance you say you exchanged probably told her all she needed to know when you see a painting you like you stand in front of it for minutes on end and then you go up on your tiptoes when youve made up your mind to buy it allan attempted the movement rocking on his heels and his toes while holding out his glass towards the arriving champagne youre good at reading people arent you mike said with a laugh comes with the job a lot of hnws want you to know what theyre thinking without them having to spell it out so what am i thinking now mike held a hand over his own glass and the waiter gave a little bow before moving on allan made a show of screwing shut his eyes in thought youre thinking you can do without my smartarsed remarks he said opening his eyes again youre wishing you could stand in front of our charming hostess for minutes on end tiptoes or no tiptoes he paused and youre just about to suggest a bar where we can get ourselves a real drink thats uncanny mike pretended to admit whats more allan added raising his glass in a toast one of your wishes is about to be granted yes because mike had seen her too laura stanton squeezing her way through the throng heading straight towards them almost six feet tall in her heels auburn hair pulled back into a simple ponytail she wore a sleeveless kneelength black dress cut low to show the opal pendant hanging at her throat laura allan drawled pecking her on both cheeks congratulations youve put together quite a sale better tell your employers at first caly ive got at least two brokers in the room scouting on behalf of rival banks everyone seems to want something for the boardroom she had already turned her attention towards mike hello you she said leaning forward for another exchange of kisses i get the feeling nothings quite caught your fancy tonight not strictly true mike corrected her causing her cheeks to redden where did you find the matthewson allan was asking weve one from the same series outside the lifts on the fourth floor its from an estate in perthshire owner wants to buy some adjacent land so developers cant spoil the view she turned towards him would first caly be interested allan offered little more than a shrug and the puffing out of his cheeks which is the matthewson mike asked the snowy landscape laura explained pointing towards the far wall ornate gilt frame not really your thing mike nor mine allan felt compelled to add highland cattle and sheep huddled together for warmth beneath trees with no leaves funny thing about matthewson laura added for mikes benefit is that they fetch more if you can see the faces of the animals it was the sort of titbit she knew would interest him and he nodded his appreciation any sniffs from overseas allan was asking laura gave a thoughtful pout measuring her response russian market is strong same goes for china and india i reckon well have plenty of telephone bidders come sale day but no preemptives laura pretended to swipe at allan with her catalogue now youre just fishing she chided him incidentally mike began ive hung the monboddo where she asked just inside the front door the albert monboddo still life had been his only purchase at the winter auction you said youd come see it he reminded her ill email you her eyes narrowed a little but meantime feel free to quash a rumour ive been hearing uhoh allan said snorting into his glass what rumour that youve been cosying up to the citys other less likeable auction houses where did you hear that mike asked her small world she replied and gossipy with it ive not bought anything mike said defensively poor swines actually blushing allan added you dont want me visiting the monboddo laura went on and have to turn on my heel because theres half of christies and sothebys hanging next to it well do you but before mike could answer a meaty hand landed on his shoulder he turned his head and was staring into the dark piercing eyes of robert gissing the older mans huge dome of a head gleamed with sweat his tweed tie was askew his blue linen jacket creased and stretched beyond saving all the same he carried real presence and his booming voice took no prisoners i see the playboys have arrived just in time to save me from this awful hooch he wafted his empty champagne flute like a conductors baton his eyes fixed on laura i dont blame you my dear it is your job after all actually its hugh who orders in the catering gissing shook his head theatrically im talking about the paintings child dont know why i come to these tragic affairs the free booze allan pretended to guess but gissing ignored him dozens and dozens of works representing the best each artist could muster a story behind each brush stroke each carefully considered placement of object or subject gissing had pinched his thumb and forefinger together as though holding a tiny brush they belong to us all part of our collective consciousness our nations narrative our history he was in his element now mike caught lauras eye and offered a wink theyd both heard the speech or variations on its central theme plenty of times in the past they dont belong in boardrooms gissing went on where only a security pass will get you into the building nor do they belong in some insurance companys vault or a captain of industrys hunting lodge or a selfmade millionaires apartment allan teased but gissing wagged a finger as fat as a sausage at him you lot at first caly are the worst offenders overpaying for undeveloped young talent that then gets too big for its boots he paused for breath and slapped a hand down on mikes shoulder again but i wont hear a word said against young michael here mike flinched as gissings grip tightened especially as hes just about to buy me a pintpot of whisky ill leave you boys to it laura said fanning out the fingers of her free hand as she waved goodbye sales a week today make sure its in your diaries there was it seemed to mike a final smile just for him as she moved away the shining star gissing was offering it took mike a moment to realise he was talking about the wine bar along the street it was a lowceilinged windowless basement with mahogany slats on the walls and brown leather furnishings in the past gissing had complained that it felt like being in a wellupholstered coffin after private viewings and the auctions themselves it had become their custom to drop into the shining star for what gissing called postmatch analysis tonight the place was half full students by the look of it albeit of the wellheeled variety living in daddys stockbridge piedàterre gissing muttered but still your bread and butter allan teased him they found an empty booth and waited for the staff to take their order whisky for gissing and mike the house champagne for allan need a glass of the real mccoy to wash away the memory he explained i mean it you know gissing was saying rubbing his hands together as if soaping them about all those paintings in purdah meant every bloody word we know allan told him but youre preaching to the converted robert gissing was head of the citys college of art but not for much longer retirement was only a month or two away at the end of the summer term it seemed however that he was determined to argue his various points to the very last i cant believe its what the artists themselves would have wanted gissing persisted in the past mike felt obliged to ask didnt they all crave patrons those same patrons often loaned out important works gissing shot back to the national collections and elsewhere first caly does the same mike argued looking to allan for support thats true allan agreed we send paintings all over the place but its not the same gissing growled its all about commerce these days when it should be about taking pleasure in the works themselves he balled one hand into a fist thumping the table for effect steady there mike said staffll think were impatient he noticed that allans gaze was fixed on the bar goodlooking waitress he guessed starting to turn his head dont allan warned lowering his voice and leaning across the table as if for a huddle three men at the bar necking a bottle of what looks suspiciously like roederer cristal art dealers allan was shaking his head i think one of thems chib calloway the gangster gissings words coincided with the end of a music track seeming even louder in the sudden silence and as he craned his neck to look the man called calloway caught the movement and stared back at the trio his bulbous shaved head rested on huge hunched shoulders he wore a black leather jacket and a distended black tshirt the champagne glass looked like it was being choked by his fist allan had opened his catalogue on the table and was pretending to skim through it nice going he muttered i was at the same school as him mike added quietly not that hell remember probably not the time to remind him allan cautioned as their drinks arrived calloway was a known face in the city protection strip bars maybe drugs too their waitress added a warning look of her own as she moved off but it was too late a hulking figure was moving towards the booth chib calloway rested his knuckles against the table and leaned across it casting a shadow over the three men seated there are my ears burning he asked no one answered though mike returned the gangsters stare calloway only half a year older than mike had not worn well his skin had an oily look to it and his face was chipped and dented evidence of past battles fought gone all quiet hasnt it he went on lifting the catalogue and examining its cover he opened it at random examining an early masterpiece by bossun seventyfive to a hundred for some wattle and daub he tossed the catalogue back on to the table now that my friends is what i call daylight robbery i wouldnt pay seventyfive pence for it never mind k he met mikes stare for a moment but as the silence persisted decided there was little else to detain him he was chuckling to himself as he went back to the bar chuckling as he finished his drink and headed out into the night with his scowling colleagues mike watched as the waiting staffs shoulders relaxed and they scooped up the ice bucket and glasses allans eyes were on the door he waited a further few seconds before speaking we couldve taken them but his hand wasnt at its steadiest as he lifted the champagne to his mouth rumour has it he added from above the rim of his glass our chum calloway pulled off the first caly heist back in ninetyseven he should be retired then mike offered not every retiree is as canny with their cash as you mike gissing had drained his whisky and was waving towards the bar that a further offering was required maybe we could get him to help us he said as he gestured help us allan echoed another raid on first caly the professor explained into his empty glass wed be freedom fighters allan fighting for a cause and what cause might that be mike couldnt help asking he was working hard at controlling his breathing bringing his heartbeat back to something like normal in the years around twenty of them since hed last seen calloway the man had changed substantially these days he glowed with menace and a sense of his own invulnerability repatriation of some of those poor imprisoned works of art gissing was grinning as the whisky arrived the infidels have held on to them for long enough time we took our revenge i like your thinking mike said with a smile why pick on first caly allan complained plenty of other villains out there and not all of them as public as mr calloway gissing agreed you say you were at school with him mike same year mike answered nodding slowly he was the kid everyone wanted to know to know or to be mike looked at allan maybe youre right be nice to feel that sense of power power through fear isnt worth the candle gissing grumbled as the waitress swapped his glass for its replacement he asked her if calloway was a regular now and then she said she sounded south african to mike big tipper he asked her she didnt like the question look i just work here were not cops or anything mike assured her just curious pays not to be she confided turning on her heel tidy body allan said appraisingly once she was out of earshot almost as tidy as our own dear laura stanton gissing added winking in mikes direction by way of response mike said he was heading outside for a cigarette can i bum one off you allan asked as usual and leave an old man on his own gissing pretended to complain opening the catalogue at its first page go on then off with the pair of you see if i care mike and allan pushed open the door and climbed the five steps leading from the basement bar to the pavement it had only just grown dark and the roadway was busy with midweek taxis seeking work pound to a penny allan said when we go back inside hell be bending someones ear mike lit both their cigarettes and inhaled deeply he was down to four or five a day but couldnt quite give them up completely as far as he knew allan only smoked when around smokers obliging smokers looking up and down the street mike saw no sign of calloway and his cohorts plenty of other bars they could be in he remembered the bike sheds at school there really had been bike sheds though they were only used for improvised kickabouts behind them the smokers gathered at break and lunchtime chib having earned the nickname even at that early stage in his career chief among them breaking open a pack of ten or twenty and selling singles at inflated prices plus another few pence for a light mike hadnt smoked back then instead he would hang around on the periphery hoping for some sort of welcome into the brotherhood an invitation that had never come towns quiet tonight allan said flicking ash into the air tourists must be lying low i always wonder what they think of the place i mean its home to us hard to see it with anyone elses perspective thing is allan its home to the likes of chib calloway too two edinburghs sharing a single nervous system allan wagged a finger youre thinking of that programme on channel last night the siamese twins i caught a bit of it youre like me too much tv well be in our dotage and wondering why we didnt do more with our lives thanks for that you know what i mean though if i had your money id be helming a yacht in the caribbean landing my helicopter on the roof of that hotel in dubai youre saying im wasting away mike was thinking of gerry pearson of emails with embedded photos of speedboats and jet skis im saying you should grab what you can with both hands and that includes the blessed laura if you nip back to the auction house shell still be there ask her out on a date another date mike corrected him and look what happened last time you give up too easily allan was shaking his head slowly it amazes me you ever made any money in business i did though didnt i no doubt about it but but what i just get the feeling youre still not comfortable with it i dont like flaunting it if thats what you mean rubbing my success in other peoples faces allan looked as though he had more to say but natural caution won him over and he only nodded their attention was distracted by sudden music pulsing from a car as it cruised towards them it was a glossblack bmw looked like an m thin lizzy on the hifi the boys are back in town and chib calloway in the passenger seat singing along the window was down and his eyes met mikes again he made the shape of a pistol with his fingers thumb curving itself into a trigger drawing a bead on the two smokers and then he was gone mike noticed that allan had been watching still reckon we couldve taken them he asked no bother allan replied flicking the unsmoked half of his cigarette into the road that night mike ate alone gissing had suggested dinner but allan had said there was work waiting at home mike too made his excuses then hoped he wouldnt bump into the professor later on in the restaurant thing was he quite liked eating without company hed picked up a paper from a lateopening newsagents walking towards haymarket hed decided on indian restaurants didnt much cater for readers the lights were usually too low but he was able to find a table with a wall lamp behind it in the paper he read that it was crunch time for indian restaurants rice shortages leading to price hikes tighter immigration meaning fewer chefs were entering the country when he mentioned this to the waiter the young man just smiled and shrugged the restaurant was pretty full and mikes table was too close to a party of five drunks their suit jackets were draped over the backs of their chairs ties had been loosened or undone altogether an office night out mike guessed maybe celebrating a satisfactory deal he knew how those nights could go people hed worked with theyd often commented on how he never seemed to get quite drunk enough never seemed completely elated whenever a major contract was concluded he could have told them i like to stay in control could have added a postscript these days the men were on to coffee and brandies by the time his food arrived meaning that they were getting ready to leave as he asked for his bill rising to his feet he saw that one of the men was losing his balance as he shrugged his arms into his coat with the diner threatening to back into mikes table mike held a hand out to steady him the bleary head turned towards him what you up to then the man slurred just stopping you falling over another of the group had decided to step in did you touch him he asked mike then to his friend he lay a finger on you rab but rab was concentrating on staying upright and had nothing further to say on the subject i was trying to help mike argued the men were gathering round him in a semicircle he knew how easily these things could turn tribal five against the world well help yourself right now and piss off rabs friend snapped before you find your face on the wrong end of a bottling one of the others piped up the waiters were looking on anxiously one had pushed open the nearby swing door to alert the kitchen fine with his hands held up in a conciliatory gesture mike headed for the street once outside he moved briskly along the pavement glancing back if they were going to come after him he wanted a bit of distance distance meant time to think to assess the situation risk versus return he was fifty yards away before the men emerged they were arm in arm pointing across the street towards their next destination another pub probably forgotten about you already mike told himself he knew that he would remember the encounter in the restaurant in the next few weeks and months thered be flashbacks and he would consider alternative scenarios that would leave him the last man standing the drunks sprawled at his feet aged thirteen hed got into a fight with a kid in his class and come off second best for the rest of his school career he had plotted elaborate revenge scenarios without ever carrying them out the worlds he moved in these days there was no need to watch your back the people were polite and civilised they had manners and breeding for all allans bravado at the shining star mike doubted the banker had been in a punchup in his whole adult life walking in the direction of murrayfield he thought about student days hed found himself in a few bar brawls another time hed tangled with a potential suitor over a girlfriend christ he couldnt even remember her name then there was the night hed been walking back to his digs with friends and some drunks had lobbed a metal rubbish bin at them hed never forget the fight afterwards it had travelled from the street into an adjacent tenement and out of the back door into a garden until a woman had screamed from her window that she was calling the police mike had emerged with bruised knuckles and a black eye his opponent had gone down and stayed down he wondered how chib calloway would have reacted to the situation in the restaurant but then calloway travelled with backup the two men in the bar with him werent just there for the conversation one of mikes colleagues had joked once that he should maybe think about a bodyguard now that youre so publicly rich hed meant the publication the previous sunday of a newspaper list placing him in the top five most eligible men in scotland nobody needs a bodyguard in edinburgh mike had answered and yet pausing at a cash machine to take out some money he looked to right and left assessing the level of threat a beggar sat against the shop window next to the bank head bowed he looked cold and lonely allan had accused mike once of being a loner mike couldnt disagree didnt mean he was lonely tossing a pound coin into the beggars cup he headed in the direction of home some latenight music and his collection of paintings he thought of the professors words those poor imprisoned works of art and then of allans grab what you can with both hands a pub door swung on its hinges expelling a drinker into the night mike dodged the stumbling man and kept on walking as one door closes another one opens so far it had been another bad day for chib calloway the problem with surveillance was even if you knew you were being watched you couldnt always know who the watchers were chib owed a bit of money all right a lot of money he owed other things too and had been keeping his head down answering only one or two of his dozen mobile phones the ones whose numbers only kith kin and close associates knew hed had two meetings scheduled for lunchtime but had cancelled both hed apologised by phone without bothering to explain why if it got out that he was being tailed his reputation would dip further instead hed drunk a couple of cups of coffee at cento tre on george street it was a pretty upmarket spot a bank at one time a lot of edinburghs banks had been turned into bars and restaurants with cash machines everywhere banks werent needed the machines had brought with them a variety of scams of course card numbers skimmed the cards themselves cloned devices attached to the machine that could transfer the necessary info to a microchip there were some petrol stations you didnt dare use they sold your details on chib was careful that way the gangs with the cash machine knowhow all seemed to originate overseas albania croatia hungary when chib had looked into it as a possible business proposition hed been informed that it was something of a closed shop which rankled especially when the gangs then targeted edinburgh it was a small city population of under half a million not big enough to attract the major players which meant a lot of the available territory belonged to chib he had understandings with a number of the bar and club owners the past several years thered been no need for a turf war chib had served his apprenticeship in turf wars building up a solid rep as a soldier hed worked as a bouncer for billy mcgeehan at his pool hall and at a couple of his pubs in leith just saturdaynight stuff regulars becoming rowdy as the evening dragged strangers getting uppity with the locals in his early teens he had thought himself a fair footballer but a trial with hearts had been a washout he was reckoned too big too awkward switch to rugby son had been the scouts advice rugby as if hed tried boxing as a means of keeping fit but couldnt seem to control himself got in the ring and wanted to lash out with his feet his knees his elbows thrash the opponent to the floor and keep on thrashing switch to wrestling son had been the advice that time round but then billy mcgeehan had come to him with another proposal one that suited chib fine he could sign on pretend to be looking for work and do some cashinhand at weekends enough to see him through to the next government handout slowly billy had taken him into his confidence which meant that when chib switched allegiances and started working for lenny corkery instead hed taken a fund of knowledge with him during the war that followed billy had decided to up sticks to florida signing over the pool halls and pubs leaving lenny corkery king of the hill and chib his trusted lieutenant but then lenny had dropped dead on the eleventh fairway at muirfield and chib had made his move hed been thinking about it for a while anyway and lennys men hadnt made any complaint not to his face at any rate a smooth succession is always best for business one of the club owners had commented smooth for the first few years anyway trouble had been brewing for a while not his own fault not entirely the cops getting lucky with a shipment of coke and eccies just after the money had changed hands meaning a double whammy with chib on its receiving end this was unfortunate as he already owed on a shipment of grass that had come into the country by way of a norwegian trawler the suppliers a hells angels chapter from a town with an unpronounceable name had given him ninety days to settle that was a hundred and twenty days ago and counting he could have gone to glasgow secured a loan from one of the heavyweights there but that would have meant word getting around it would involve loss of face any sign of weakness thered be vultures hovering and worse hed demolished those two cups of italian coffee without tasting them but knew from his heartbeat that theyd been extrastrength johnno and glenn had accompanied him all three of them squeezed into a booth by the window while goodlooking women took the other tables not giving them the time of day stuckup bitches he knew the type shopping at harvey nicks cocktails at the shining star later on and a lettuce leaf to sustain them between times their husbands and boyfriends would work in banking or as lawyers bloodsuckers in other words big houses in the grange skiing holidays dinner parties it was an edinburgh hed hardly been aware of while growing up as a young man his saturdays had been about football if hearts were at home and a rumble with the away fans seemed probable or the pub maybe chasing skirt along rose street or attempting chatups in the st james centre george street all boutiques and jewellery windows with no prices had seemed alien to him and still did which didnt stop him coming here why shouldnt he he had the same cash in his pockets as anyone else he wore nicole fahri polo tops and dkny coats shoes from kurt geiger socks by paul smith he was as good as any other bastard better than the bulk of them he lived in the real world warts and fucking all whats that boss glenn asked making chib realise hed spoken the words aloud chib ignored him and asked a passing waitress for the bill then turned his attention back to his two footsoldiers glenn had already been outside on a recce reporting back that there was no one loitering in the vicinity what about office windows chib had asked i checked in one of the shops maybe pretending to browse i already said glenn had bristled if theres anyone out there theyre better than good they dont have to be better than good chib had snapped back just better than you then hed gone back to gnawing his bottom lip the way he sometimes did when he was thinking until having paid the bill hed come to a decision okay then the two of you can eff off boss johnno this time trying to work out if hed heard right chib didnt say anything but the way he saw it was if it was the angels or someone like them theyd be more likely to make their move if he was alone and if it was the cops well he wasnt sure but at least hed know one way or the other it was a plan it was something the look on glenns face however told him this didnt mean it was necessarily better than nothing chibs idea was to hit the shopping crowds on princes street cars werent allowed down there so any tail would have to come after him on foot he could then climb the steep flight of steps at the side of the mound and head for the quieter streets of the old town streets where anyone following on foot would be easy to spot it was a plan but not much better than nothing as he soon learned hed told glenn and johnno to stay with the car he would call them when he needed them then hed headed down frederick street crossing to the quieter side of princes street the side with no shops the castle loomed above him he could make out the tiny shapes of tourists as they leaned over the battlements he hadnt been inside the castle for years seemed to remember a school trip there but hed sneaked away after twenty minutes and headed into town a couple of years back hed been cornered in a bar by someone he knew the man had confided a carefully thoughtout scheme to steal the scottish crown jewels but chib had given him a slap across the jaw for his trouble castles not just for tourists hed explained to the hapless drunk its a working bloody garrison how you going to sneak the jewels past that lot eh he crossed the foot of the mound at the traffic lights and walked towards the steps kept stopping casting glances back no sign of anyone bloody hell though peering up the incline he realised just how steep the steps actually were he wasnt used to walking the shoppers and tourists on princes street hadnt helped his blood pressure hed broken into a sweat just dodging the buses as he crossed the road what was the point of banning cars when the place just became a racetrack for taxicabs and doubledeckers he knew he couldnt face climbing those steps so stood his ground for a moment instead weighing up alternatives he could take a detour into princes street gardens couldnt stomach the thought of princes street itself again there was a big greekstyle building in front of him two of them actually one behind the other art galleries he knew that much one of them theyd wrapped its pillars last year to make them look like soup cans something to do with an exhibition chib remembered the three guys in the bar hed gone over to their table knowing a fifteensecond glare would put the frighteners on them and it had that catalogue theyd been perusing full of paintings now here he was outside the national gallery of scotland yeah why not sort of like a sign from above plus if anyone followed him inside hed know for sure as he walked up to the door it was held open for him by one of the staff chib hesitated hand in pocket how much he asked no charge sir the guard answered he even gave a little bow ransome watched as the door swung shut behind chib calloway now i really have seen everything he muttered to himself reaching into his coat for his phone ransome was a detective inspector with lothian and borders police his colleague detective sergeant ben brewster was in an unmarked car parked somewhere between the mound and george street brewster picked up straight away hes gone into the national gallery ransome explained meeting someone brewsters voice was tinny it sounded like he was being beamed down from a space station somewhere dunno ben looked to me like he was considering the playfair steps but then thought better of it know which id choose brewster was chuckling cant say i was looking forward to hauling myself up them ransom agreed reckon hes spotted you not a chance where are you doubleparked on hanover street and not making many friends are you going to follow him inside i dont know more chance of him clocking me indoors than out well he knows someones watching him so why ditch the two stooges thats a good question ben ransome was checking his watch not that he needed to a blast to his right was followed by a puff of smoke from the castles ramparts the one oclock gun he peered down into the gardens there was an exit from the gallery down there no way he could cover both doors stay put he said into his phone im going to give it five or ten minutes your call brewster said my call ransome agreed he slipped the phone back into his pocket and gripped the railings with both hands it all looked so orderly down in the gardens a train was rumbling along the railway track making for waverley station again all very calm and orderly edinburgh was that kind of city you could live your whole life and never get any inkling of what else was going on even when it was living next door to you he turned his attention towards the castle it appeared to him sometimes like a stern parent frowning on any impropriety below if you looked at a map of the city you were struck by the contrast between the new town to the north and the old town to the south the first was planned and geometric and rational the second higgledypiggledy and seemingly chaotic buildings erected wherever space permitted story was back in the old days they kept adding floors to the tenements until they started collapsing in on themselves ransome liked the feel of the old town even today but he had always dreamed of living in one of the new towns elegant georgian terraces that was why he took a weekly lottery ticket only chance he was ever going to get on a cid salary chib calloway on the other hand could easily afford the new town life but chose instead to live on a tickytack estate on the western outskirts of the city only a couple of miles from where hed grown up there was it seemed to ransome no accounting for taste the detective didnt think chib would linger in the gallery to someone like him surely art had to act like kryptonite he would emerge either from the main door or from the one in the gardens ransome knew he had to make a decision but then again how much did it matter in the great scheme of things the meetings chib had arranged the ones ransome knew about were no longer going to happen no evidence would be gathered several more hours of ransomes life wasted as a result ransome was in his early thirties ambitious and alive to possibilities chib calloway would be a trophy no doubt about that not perhaps as much of a trophy as four or five years ago but back then ransome had been a lowly detective constable and unable to direct or even suggest to his superiors a longterm surveillance operation now though he had inside info and that could mean the difference between failure and success one of ransomes first cid cases had been a push against calloway but in court the gangsters expensive lawyer had picked apart the evidence to the cost of the youngest member of the team of investigators detective constable ransome youre sure thats your correct title only ive known plain constables with more apparent ability the advocate smug and ruddycheeked in his wig and chib calloway braying in the dock wagging a finger at ransome as the young detective sloped from the witness box afterwards his team leader had tried telling him it didnt matter but it had it did all the way down the passing years the time felt right to him right here right now everything he knew everything he suspected led to one imminent prospect chib calloways life was about to implode it might well be messy might happen without any interference from ransome himself but that didnt mean he couldnt be there to enjoy it nor did it mean he couldnt take the credit chib calloway waited in the foyer for a couple of minutes but the only other arrivals were a middleaged couple with australian accents and leathery skin he pretended to be studying a floor plan of the building then gave a twitch of the mouth signalling to the guards that he was quite satisfied with arrangements taking a deep breath he walked inside it was quiet in the gallery bloody big rooms too echoing with coughs and whispers he saw the aussies again plus some overseas students who were being taken round by a guide no way they were locals too tanned too fashionconscious they shuffled slowly nearsilently past the huge canvases looking bored not too many guards in here chib craned his neck seeking out the allseeing cctv cameras they were just where he thought theyd be no wires trailing from the paintings though meaning no alarms some of them looked fixed to the walls by screws but by no means all of them even if they were thirty seconds with a stanley knife and youd have what you came for most of it anyway the canvas if not the frame half a dozen pensioners in uniforms no problem at all chib sat himself down on an upholstered bench in the middle of one of the rooms and felt his heart rate begin to slow he pretended to be interested in the painting opposite a landscape with mountains and temples and sunbeams there were a few figures in the foreground dressed in flowing white robes hed no idea what any of it was supposed to mean one of the foreign students a bronzed spanishlooking lad blocked his view for a moment before moving to the side to check out the information panel on the wall oblivious to chibs glare hey pal this is my painting my city my country another man walked into the room older than the student and better dressed a black woollen overcoat fell to just above his feet his shoes were black glossy and unscuffed he carried a folded newspaper and looked like he was just killing time cheeks puffed out chib gave him the stare all the same and decided he knew the face from somewhere his stomach clenched was this whoeverd been tailing him didnt look like a villain but then he didnt look much like a cop either where had chib seen him before the visitor had given the painting the briefest of glances and was heading away brushing past the student he was already out of the room by the time chib placed him chib got to his feet and made to follow mike mackenzie had recognised the gangster straight away hoping it wasnt too obvious when he exited the room pronto this collection wasnt really his thing anyway hed only come into town to do a bit of shopping shirts to start with not that hed found any he liked then some eau de cologne and a slight detour into thistle street and joseph bonnars jewellery shop joe specialised in nice antique pieces and mike had gone there with laura in mind hed been thinking of that opal around her neck imagining her wearing something different something unusual something bought by him but though joe was a master of his craft mike had a pocket watch back home to prove it he hadnt managed to work his charms this time mainly because it had suddenly dawned on mike what the hell am i doing would laura thank him for the gesture what exactly would she read into it did she even like amethysts and rubies and sapphires call again mr mackenzie bonnar had said opening the door for him its been too long so no shirts and no jewellery one oclock had found him on princes street not quite hungry enough for lunch and within a stones throw of the national gallery his mind felt clogged hard to say why hed been drawn to the place there were some nice pieces hed be the first to acknowledge as much but it was all a bit stuffy and reverential art is good for you the collection seemed to be saying here have some the past few days hed been mulling over professor gissings argument about art as collateral he wondered what percentage of the worlds art was actually kept in bank vaults and the like like unread books and unplayed music did it matter that art went unseen in a generations time it would still be there awaiting rediscovery and was he himself any better hed visited regional galleries and viewed their collections knowing he had better examples of some of the artists hanging on his walls at home wasnt each home and living room a private gallery of sorts help some of those poor imprisoned paintings to escape not from public galleries of course but from wall safes and bank vaults and the unvisited rooms and corridors of all those corporate buyers first caledonian bank for example had a portfolio running into the tens of millions most of the usual suspects they even boasted an early bacon plus the cream of new talent snapped up at all those annual degree shows around the uk by the banks portfolio curator other companies in edinburgh owned their own hauls and were sitting tight on them the way a miser would sit on a mattress filled with cash mike was wondering maybe if he made a gesture opened a gallery and placed his own collection there could he persuade others to join him talk to first caly and all the other big players make a thing of it maybe that was why hed felt drawn to the national gallery the perfect place to do a little more thinking on the subject the last person hed expected to see was chib calloway and now turning around here was calloway stalking towards him smile fixed but eyes hard and unblinking you keeping tabs on me the gangster growled wouldnt have taken you for a patron of the arts was all mike could think of by way of an answer free country isnt it calloway bristled mike flinched sorry that came out all wrong my names mike mackenzie by the way the two men shook hands charlie calloway but most people call you chib right you know who i am then calloway considered for a moment and then nodded slowly i remember now your pals couldnt look at me but you held eye contact throughout and you pretended to shoot me as you drove away calloway offered a grudging smile least it wasnt the real thing eh so what brings you here today mr calloway i was just remembering that book of paintings the one you lot were poring over in the bar i take it you know about art mike im learning so this one were standing beside calloway took a step back guy on a horse so far as i can see not a bad likeness he stuffed his hands in his pockets how much would it fetch unlikely it would ever come to auction mike gave a shrug couple of million he guessed hells teeth calloway moved along to the next painting and this one here well thats a rembrandt tens of millions tens mike looked around a couple of the liveried custodians were beginning to take an interest he gave them his most winning smile and started to move away in the opposite direction calloway catching him up only after a few more seconds of staring at the rembrandt selfportrait its not really about the money though is it mike heard himself say even though he knew only a part of him really believed that isnt it what would you rather look at a work of art or a framed selection of banknotes calloway had retrieved one of his hands from its pocket and he was now rubbing the underside of his chin ill tell you what mike ten million in cash wouldnt be on the wall long enough to find out they shared a laugh and calloway ran his free hand across the top of his head mike began to wonder about the other hand the one in the pocket was it holding a gun a knife had calloway come in here with something other than browsing in mind so what is it all about then the gangster was asking if not the money money plays a big part mike was forced to admit he glanced at his watch look theres a café downstairs do you fancy a quick coffee ive had a stomachful calloway said with a shake of the head might manage a cup of tea though my treat mr calloway call me chib so they headed down the winding staircase calloway enquiring about prices mike explaining that hed only been interested in art for a year or two and wasnt exactly an expert one thing he didnt want calloway to know was that he had a collection of his own a collection some would doubtless term extensive but as they queued at the service counter calloway asked him what he did for a living software design mike said deciding that he would elaborate as little as possible cutthroat business is it its high pressure if thats what you mean calloway gave a twitch of the mouth then got into a discussion with the girl behind the counter about which of the many teas on offer lapsang green gunpowder or orange pekoe tasted most like actual tea after which they took their table with its views on to princes street gardens and the scott monument ever been to the top of the monument mike asked mum took me up there when i was a kid scared me stupid thats probably why a few years back i dragged donny devlin up there and threatened to sling him off owed me money you see calloway had his nose in the teapot smells a bit weird this but he poured some all the same while mike stirred his own cappuccino wondering how to respond to such a warped confession the gangster didnt seem to realise that hed said anything at all out of the ordinary the memory of his mother had segued seamlessly into a momentary depiction of horror mike couldnt tell if calloway had set out to shock him maybe it wasnt even true the scott monument was a stupidly public place for such a scene allan cruikshank had hinted that calloway had engineered the first caly heist difficult now to envisage him as a criminal mastermind anyone ever tried breaking into this place calloway asked at last studying his surroundings not that i know of calloway wrinkled his nose paintings are too bloody big anyway where would you stash them a warehouse maybe mike suggested art gets stolen all the time a couple of men in workmens uniforms walked out of the burrell collection with a tapestry a few years back really this seemed to tickle the gangster mike cleared his throat we were at the same school you and me same year actually is that a fact cant say i remember you i was never on your radar but i recall that you more or less ran the place even told the teachers what they could and couldnt do calloway shook his head but seemed flattered nonetheless im sure youre exaggerating mind you i was a tearaway back then he eyes lost focus and mike knew he was thinking back to those days a solitary ograde i ended up with metalwork or something one project we made screwdrivers mike reminded him you put yours to good use persuading the nippers to hand over their cash chib agreed youve got a good memory so how did you get into computers i stayed on for highers then college after that our paths diverged chib said nodding to himself then he stretched his arms out yet here we are meeting up after all these years proper grownups and no damage done speaking of damage what happened to donny devlin chips eyes narrowed whats it to you nothing at all just curious chib pondered for a moment before replying he got out of the city paid me back first mind dyou keep up with anyone from the old days nobody mike admitted took a look at friends reunited once but there wasnt anyone i particularly missed sounds like you were a loner i spent a lot of time in the library might explain why i dont remember you i only went there the one time took out the godfather was that for recreational purposes or for training chibs face darkened again but only for a second then he burst out laughing acknowledging the joke and so the conversation continued fluidly lightheartedly neither man aware of the figure who twice passed by the window the figure of detective inspector ransome mike was standing at the very back of the saleroom just inside the doorway laura stanton had taken her place at the lectern and was checking that her microphone was working she was flanked by plasma screens on which images of the lots would be shown while the genuine articles were placed on an easel or pointed to if they happened to be hanging on one of the walls by a team of wellrehearsed staff mike could tell that laura was nervous this was after all only her second sale and so far her performance had been judged solid at best no real treasures had been unearthed no records smashed as allan cruikshank had observed the art market could go that way for months or even years at a stretch this was edinburgh after all not london or new york the focus was on scottish works youre not going to be offered a freud or a bacon allan had said mike could see him now seated two rows from the back not in the market to buy anything just keen for a final glance at each painting before it vanished into private hands or some corporate portfolio from where mike stood he could take in the whole room there was whispered anticipation catalogues were browsed one last time staff from the auction house were seated at their telephones ready to hook up with distant bidders it intrigued mike who were those people on the other end of the line were they hong kongbased financiers manhattan celts with a penchant for highland scenes of kilted shepherds rock stars or movie actors he imagined them being given manicures or massages as they yelled their bids into the receiver or pushing weights in their home gym or seated aboard private jets somehow he always imagined them as being more glamorous than anyone who actually took the trouble to attend an auction hed asked laura once for some gen on the telephone bidders but shed just tapped the side of her nose letting him know there were secrets she couldnt share he knew probably half the people on view dealers for the most part who would then try to sell the paintings on plus the curious dressed drably as though theyd only stumbled indoors for want of anything better to do with their time maybe some of them had a couple of paintings tucked away at home a legacy from some longdead aunt and now wondered how much the artist was fetching there were two or three people like mike himself genuine collectors who could afford pretty well anything that might come up there were also a few faces new to him and seated right at the front in newcomers row but with no paddle and therefore only satisfying his curiosity chib calloway mike had spotted him the moment hed walked into the room but had managed so far to go unnoticed he realised that the two men leaning against the wall to calloways left were the same ones from a week ago in the shining star when mike had bumped into calloway in the national gallery the gangster hadnt seemed to need his henchmen mike wondered what had changed maybe it was because he wanted to be noticed wanted the people around him to know he was the sort of man who could boast protection a very public show of his importance the gavel came down to signal that the auction was underway the first five lots came and went in a blur fetching the bottom end of estimate a figure filled the doorway and mike gave a nod of greeting with retirement looming robert gissing seemed to have more time on his hands for previews and auctions he was giving the room an allencompassing beetlebrowed glower while allan might regret the whisking away of so many paintings gissing had been known to rise to a state of apoplexy in salerooms storming out his voice booming down the corridor works of genuine genius sold into servitude and wrenched from the gaze of the deserving mike hoped he wasnt going to cause a scene today laura had quite enough on her plate as it was he noted that gissing too had failed to collect a bidding paddle and began to wonder just how many people in the room were interested in actually buying something the next two lots failed to reach their reserve adding to mikes fears he knew that some of the dealers would get together beforehand to express their individual interests making pacts to ensure they didnt get into bidding wars this tended to keep prices down unless there were collectors in the room or on the ends of those telephones mike thought he could see the blood rising up lauras neck colouring her cheeks she gave a little cough and paused between lots taking a few sips of water and scanning the room for signs of interest there was little enough atmosphere and oxygen seemed to have been sucked from the place mike could smell the dust from antiquated picture frames mixed with tweed and floor polish he tried to guess at the secret life of each painting at the journey they had made from imagination to sketchbook sketchbook to easel finished framed displayed and sold passing from owner to owner handed down as an heirloom perhaps or dismissed as worthless until rescued from a junk shop and restored to glory whenever he bought a painting he made sure to spend time examining its rear end for clues chalked measurements calculated by the artist on the frame a label from the gallery where the first sale had been made he would check the catalogues tracing the line of ownership his latest purchase the monboddo still life had been painted during a trip to the french riviera and brought back to britain shown as part of a group exhibition in a townhouse in mayfair but only sold a few months later by a small gallery in glasgow that first purchaser had been the scion of a tobacco family much of this information had come from robert gissing who had written more than one monograph on monboddo daring a glance in gissings direction mike saw that the arms were folded the face stern but something was happening at the front of the saleroom calloway had raised a hand to make a bid on something and laura was asking if he had a paddle do i look like im in a canoe calloway responded bringing laughter from those around him laura apologised that she could accept bids only from those who had registered at the reception desk and explained that there was still time if the gentleman wanted to never mind calloway said waving the offer away this seemed to relax the room and things perked up even more with the next lot one of the matthewsons sheep in a snowdrift late nineteenth century laura had mentioned at the preview that there was interest in it and now two telephone bidders were going head to head focusing the attention of the room on the members of staff who held the receivers the price kept cranking up and up until it was double the top estimate the gavel eventually came down at eightyfive thousand which would do no harm at all to lauras bottom line this seemed to give her a renewed confidence and she made a wellreceived joke which in turn brought a little more life to the room as well as a delayed guffaw from chib calloway mike flicked through the next few pages of the catalogue and saw nothing tempting he squeezed past the crush of dealers next to him and shook hands with gissing isnt that gissing muttered with a nod towards the front of the room the rogue we had the runin with at the wine bar you cant always judge a book by its cover robert mike whispered into the professors ear any chance of a word later why not now gissing shot back before my blood pressure gets the better of me at the far end of the hallway were some stairs leading upwards to floors where antique furnishings books and jewellery were displayed mike stopped at the foot of the staircase well gissing prompted enjoying the sale as little as usual mike nodded slowly but couldnt think how to start the real conversation gissing smiled indulgently its been preying on your mind michael he drawled what i said to you that night in the wine bar i could see that you understood straight away understood the absolute validity of what i was proposing not a serious proposal though surely i mean you cant just go around stealing art for a start first caly wouldnt be too thrilled at the idea and what would allan say maybe we should ask him gissing sounded serious look mike argued i agree its a nice thought i like the idea of planning some sort of heist gissing listening intently had folded his arms again its been preying on my mind too he said eventually for some considerable time as you say a nice little exercise for the grey cells it occurred to me early on that first caly wouldnt do their securitys too good but what if there were a way to emancipate a certain number of paintings without them even being noted as missing from a bank vault gissing shook his head nothing so onerous he patted his distended stomach do i look like i could break into a bank mike gave a little laugh this is all hypothetical right if you say so okay then enlighten me where are we stealing these paintings from gissing paused a moment running his tongue along his bottom lip the national gallery he said at last mike stared at him for a few seconds then gave a snort yeah right absolutely he was remembering his encounter with calloway anyone ever tried breaking into this place no need for sarcasm michael gissing was saying so we just waltz in and then out again and no ones any the wiser thats pretty much the size of it i can explain over a drink if youre interested the two men stared one another out mike was the first to blink youve been mulling this over for how long probably a year or more id like to take something with me when i retire mike something no one else in the world has got rembrandt titian el greco gissing just shrugged mike saw allan emerging from the saleroom and waved him over maybe that bossun you bought wasnt such a bad punt allan informed him with a sigh ones just gone for thirtyeight k this time last year he was lucky to break twenty he looked from one man to the other whats up with you two you look like kids whove been caught with their hands in the sweetie jar we were just going to have a drink gissing said and maybe a little chat what about robert here mike began to explain has been stating his intention to lift some paintings from the national collection without their absence being noticed a little retirement gift to himself beats a gold watch allan agreed thing is i think he might actually be serious allan focused his attention on gissing who offered a shrug drink first talk later the professor said detective inspector ransome watched the three men leave the auctioneers and head just half a block along the street to a basement wine bar called the shining star he recognised one of them the one hed seen a few days back drinking coffee with chib calloway in the national gallerys café first a gallery and now an auction house ransome had checked the notice in the window the sale had commenced at am calloway had arrived twenty minutes early buying a catalogue from the receptionist and being pointed in the direction of the actual saleroom what the hell was he up to hed brought glenn and johnno with him as if some deal might be about to do down johnno had come out for a cigarette about fifteen minutes in looking bored checking for texts and calls on his mobile no chance of him spotting ransome who was standing eighty feet away behind one of the pillars outside the concert hall but with no clue what was going on he was on his own today ben brewster was back at the station working through a heaped intray ransomes own desk wasnt exactly empty but the phone call tipping him off could not be ignored and now he had two for the price of one calloway and the handsome welldressed man he was torn between going to the wine bar maybe overhearing something and staying put he wished now hed dragged brewster out with him it was another halfhour before the auction house started to empty ransome watched from behind his pillar as calloway emerged flanked by johnno and glen johnno lighting up at the first opportunity but calloway seemed to change his mind and darted back inside again leaving the two goons to roll their eyes couldnt be easy working for a nutter like calloway johnno and glenn both had form theyd served time at saughton prison and further afield casual violence threats intimidation johnno was the less predictable the one likely to reach for the switch marked berserk glenn had at least a bit of sense about him did as he was ordered but otherwise kept pretty quiet it was a couple of minutes before calloway reemerged he was talking to a woman ransome recognised calloway gestured along the street suggesting a drink maybe but she was shaking her head trying to be polite she accepted his handshake and headed back indoors johnno patted his boss on the back as if to say worth a try calloway didnt seem to like that snapped some remark back at him then the three men started making their way towards well well well the selfsame wine bar decision time again and this time ransome didnt hesitate he crossed the road and threshold both smiling in the direction of the receptionist as he followed laura stanton into the deserted saleroom not quite deserted actually chairs were being stacked by staff in brown overalls telephones were being unplugged from wall sockets a lectern was being dismantled plasma screens taken down someone had handed laura a sheet of numbers with a total circled in red at the foot of the page her face was difficult to read hiya stanton ransome said it took her a moment to place him then a tired but genuine smile appeared ransome long time no see the two had been in the same year at college shared a mutual friend so tended to be at the same parties the same nights out theyd lost touch for over a decade until a reunion had taken them to their alma mater a few more reunions had followed though theyd last bumped into one another months back at a jazz concert in the queens hall laura stepped forward now and pecked him on both cheeks what brings you here she asked ransome was making a show of studying the room and its contents i remember you saying you worked for an auction house didnt realise you actually run the show youre way off the mark but she sounded flattered all the same if id arrived a bit earlier would i have caught you in full flow more of a constant trickle she glanced at the sheet of numbers markedly up on the winter sale though which is encouraging im not interrupting ransome tried to sound concerned no its fine only i was passing and i thought i saw you enjoying a têteàtête with chib calloway who he met her stare you know the gorilla with the shaved head was he shopping for anything in particular she knew who he meant now didnt seem to have much of a clue he was asking at the end how did all the bidding work her face tightened is he in some sort of trouble since the day he climbed out of the cot youve never heard of chib calloway im assuming hes not some distant relation of cab the detective reckoned this deserved a smile but it was gone by the time he spoke streak of violence a mile wide fingers in many and sundry dirty pies is he trying to launder money ransomes eyes narrowed what makes you ask she gave a shrug i know it happens i mean ive heard of it happening elsewhere other auction houses not here though god forbid her voice drifted away its something i might look into ransome rubbed the underside of his jaw ive half a feeling one of his associates brought him here today there were two of them laura started to correct him but ransome shook his head im not talking about the performing monkeys theyre called johnno sparkes and glenn burns they provide muscle for calloway when he doesnt feel like doing his own dirty work no i mean the tall fellow wears a suit well brown hair combed back from his forehead and over his ears he left here with a big bear of a man in green corduroy and another guy skinny short black hair and glasses she smiled at the description the three musketeers thats how i always think of them they seem to get along so well even though theyre different ransome nodded as though this made perfect sense to him thing about the three musketeers though what as i recall there were four of them having said which he took out his notebook and asked laura for their names wasnt one of them porthos she teased but the detective her old drinking chum from college was past jokes and attempts at humour anxiety flashed in lauras eyes theres no way any of them would have anything to do with a character like that she said defensively meaning theres no reason you shouldnt give me their names theyre potential clients ransome theres every reason i shouldnt tell you anything christ laura youre not a priest or a clapdoctor ransome gave a heavy sigh im a detective remember i could stop them in the street if i liked and make them tell me i could haul them down to the station he gave this a moment to sink in and im sure youre right theyve got nothing to do with calloway but this is me being nice trying to be as inconspicuous as possible if you give me their names i can do a quick background check without them ever knowing much better all round dont you think laura considered this i suppose so she eventually conceded winning a conciliatory smile from ransome were agreed then he checked this is going to be kept between us as she nodded he stood with pen poised against his notebook and at the same time asked her how shed been keeping of late gissing seemed in no hurry to tell his story he was swilling the malt around in its glass nosing it now and then as if reluctant to take that first fragrant sip it was too early in the day for mike and allan was due back at the office having lied about meeting a client for coffee he was stirring the froth that covered his cappuccino and making regular checks of his watch and mobile phone well mike said for the third or fourth time his own drink was a double espresso it had come with a little almond biscuit which hed placed to one side the shining star was near empty just a couple of women taking a break from their shopping they were at the other end of the room well out of earshot purchases at their feet electronic music was playing through the speakers but kept just audible gissing reached across and placed his fingers around the biscuit proceeding to dunk it in the whisky he started sucking on it eyes gleaming with humour id better get back allan started to say shifting in his seat they were at the same booth as a week ago same waitress too though she hadnt seemed to remember them gissing took allans hint its actually pretty simple he began a few crumbs flying from the corners of his mouth but you head off if you like allan while i tell mike here how to steal a painting without really trying allan decided he could manage a few more minutes gissing having finished the biscuit tipped the glass to his mouth and drained it with a satisfied smack were listening mike told the professor all the galleries and museums in this fair city of ours gissing leaned over the table resting his elbows on its surface they dont have room to display even a tenth of their collections not even a tenth he paused to let this sink in with you so far mike commented drily and those sad artefacts sit unloved in the dark they sit there for years michael and no one ever sees them gissing started to count on his fingers paintings drawings etchings jewellery statuary vases pottery carpets books from the bronze age onwards hundreds of thousands of items and youre saying we can walk off with a few of them gissing lowered his voice still further theyre stored in a huge warehouse on the waterfront at granton ive been there on several occasions and the place is a bloody treasure trove an itemised inventoried treasure trove allan speculated ive known stuff get wrongly shelved it can take months to track a piece down and its a warehouse mike watched gissing nod with guards cctv maybe a few german shepherds and some razor wire its secure enough gissing admitted mike smiled he was enjoying this little game the old man seemed to be enjoying it too and even allan was looking intrigued so what do we do allan asked dress up as commandos and storm the compound it was gissings turn to smile i think we can deploy a soupçon more subtlety allan dear boy mike leaned back and folded his arms okay youre the one who knows this place how would someone get in and even if they did how come nothing would be noticed as having walked out with them afterwards two excellent questions gissing appeared to concede to answer the first they would walk in through the front door more than that they would have been invited and the second gissing held his hands out palms showing nothing would be missing the one thing missing from all of this is any notion of reality allan complained gissing looked at him tell me allan does first caledonian ever take part in doors open day sure we do and what can you tell me about it allan shrugged its exactly what it sounds like one day a year a lot of institutions open their doors to the general public so they can take a look around last year i went to the observatory year before that i think it was freemasons hall very good gissing said as if to a prize pupil then to mike youve heard of it too vaguely mike conceded well the granton warehouse is another participant im assured theyll be throwing their doors open again to the masses at the end of this month okay mike said so we can just walk in as members of the public walking out again might be the problem thats true gissing agreed and im afraid such things as guardrooms and cctv are outwith my area of expertise but heres the rub nothings going to be missing everything will appear to be just the way it was see youve lost me again allan said fiddling with his watch strap and starting to text his secretary theres a painter gissing began breaking off as a shadow loomed over the three of them getting to be a regular occurrence chib calloway said to the silenced table when he stretched out a hand for mike to shake allan visibly flinched as though a punch were about to be thrown has mike here told you we were at the same school calloway had slapped a hand down on mikes shoulder we did some catching up the other day didnt see you at the sale mike i was standing at the back shouldve come and said howdy mightve saved me making a prick of myself by heading up shit creek without the necessary paddle the gangster laughed at his own joke whats your poison gents this ones on me were fine gissing snapped just trying to have a private conversation calloway returned the stare thats not very friendly now is it were fine chib mike said trying to defuse whatever was threatening to start roberts just well he was in the middle of telling me something so its sort of a business meeting calloway nodded slowly to himself and straightened up well head over to the bar when youre finished mike i want to pick your brains about the auction i did try asking that tasty auctioneer but she was too busy counting the shekels he turned to go but then paused and i hope the business youre discussing is all above board walls have ears remember he returned to the bar and his two bodyguards mike allan said warningly suddenly you and him are buddies never mind about chib mike replied quietly eyes on robert gissing tell me more about this painter before i do gissing reached into his jacket pocket for a folded sheet of paper heres something i thought you might like mike opened it up while gissing spoke it was a page torn from a catalogue last year at the national gissing was reminding him the monboddo exhibition thats where allan introduced us if you remember i remember you bending my ear about monboddos strengths and weaknesses mike stopped talking as he realised what he was holding this was your favourite wasnt it gissing was saying mike just nodded it was a portrait of the artists wife painted with such passion and tenderness and looking uncannily like laura stanton someone else hed met for the first time that night mike had thought he might never lay eyes on it again this is in that warehouse he asked indeed it is went straight back there after the retrospective what does it measure no more than eighteen inches by twelve yet they cant find regular room for it on their walls and such an exquisite piece you start to see what i mean michael wed be freeing them not stealing them wed be doing it out of love i really do have to get going allan said getting to his feet mike calloways part of your past remember and probably best kept there he glanced in the direction of the bar i can look after myself allan ive a parting gift for you too gissing interrupted another page from a different catalogue was handed over allan cruikshanks mouth fell open better than any of the coultons in your own banks portfolio gissing said reading allans mind i know youre a massive fan and there are half a dozen others to choose from if these dont suit seeming still in a daze allan found himself taking his seat again now gissing continued satisfied with this reaction the painter i was going to tell you about a young fellow of my acquaintance he goes by the name of westwater hugh westwater westie to those who knew him well enough was sitting comfortably amid the chaos of his topfloor tenement flat smoking yet another joint the baywindowed living room had become his studio grubby bedsheets draped over the old sofa and chair that westie had claimed from a skip canvases rested against the skirting boards newspaper cuttings and magazine photos were taped to the walls greasy pizza cartons and beer cans littered the floor some of the cans torn in half to provide makeshift ashtrays wonder was westie thought they still let you smoke in the comfort of your own home these days you couldnt smoke in pubs clubs or restaurants or at your place of work or even in some bus shelters when the rolling stones had played a stadium gig in glasgow and keith had lit one up onstage they had considered prosecution westie always thought of the authorities as they one of his first portfolio pieces had been a manifesto printed in black against a glossy bloodred backing they are out to get you they know what you do they see you as trouble at the very bottom of the canvas the printing had switched to whiteonred for westies coda but i am better at art than them his tutor had only just agreed scoring him a narrow pass the tutor was a big fan of warhol so westies next piece had been calculation itself a stylised irnbru bottle against a custardyellow background the mark had been more favourable sealing though he couldnt know it then of course westies fate he was in his final year now and had almost completed the portfolio for his degree show it had struck him only recently that there was something odd about the whole notion of a degree show if you studied politics or philosophy you didnt attach your essays to the walls for strangers to read if you were going to be a vet you didnt have the general public watching as you put some poor animal to the knife or stuck your arm up its backside but every art and design college in the land expected its students to parade their shortcomings to the world was it attempted humiliation preparation for the harsh realities of life as an artist in twentyfirst century philistine britain the space for westies showcase had already been allocated deep in the bowels of the college building on lauriston place next to a sculptor who worked with straw and a video installationist whose main claim to fame was a looped stopmotion animation of a slowly lactating breast i know my place was all westie had said influenced retrospectively by banksy and spurred on by his experience with the warholesque irnbru bottle westies stock in trade was pastiche he would copy in minute detail a constable landscape say but then add just the tiniest idiosyncrasy a crushed beer can or a used condom almost his signature according to the other students or a scrap of windtossed rubbish such as a tesco bag or crisp packet a stubbs portrait of a proud stallion might feature a jet fighter in the distant sky in westies version of raeburns the reverend walker skating the only perceptible difference was that the man of the cloth now found himself sporting a black eye and stitches to a cut on his left cheek one of his tutors had gone on at length about anachronism in art seeming to think it a good thing but others had accused him of simple copying which is by no means the same as art merely capable draughtsmanship all westie knew was that he had a marketablesounding nickname and only a few more weeks to go before the end of term which meant he should either be applying for postgraduate places or else looking for gainful employment but hed been up half the night working on a graffiti project stencils of the muffled face of the artist banksy with the words money in the banksy and some dollar bills painted above and below the stencils were anonymous he was hoping the local media would pick up on the story and make the scottish banksy a fixture in the public imagination it hadnt happened yet his girlfriend alice wanted him to become a graphic artist meaning comic books she worked frontofhouse at an artsy cinema on lothian road and reckoned the way for westie to become a top hollywood director was for him to start drawing cartoons he would then move into promo videos for indie rock bands and from there to the movies the only problem with this as hed pointed out to her several times was that he had no interest whatsoever in film directing she was the one who wanted it but youre the one with the talent shed responded stamping a foot that gesture said quite a lot about alice an only child raised by doting middleclass parents who had praised her in everything shed ever attempted piano lessons were going to turn her into the vanessa mae of the keyboard her songwriting would see her sharing a stage with joni mitchell or at the very least kt tunstall shed thought herself a prodigy as a painter until her teacher at the feepaying high school put her right having dropped out of university film and media studies with creative writing she was pinning her scant hopes on westie the flat was hers no way he could have afforded the rent it was owned by her parents who dropped by sometimes and never failed to be unimpressed by their daughters choice of livein boyfriend hed overheard them one time asking her a heartfelt question are you quite sure dear knowing they were talking about him their golden childs bit of rough hed wanted to barge in trumpet his workingclass credentials the fife coalfields kirkcaldy high nothing given to him on a plate but hed known how it would sound to their ears cretins another time hed told alice about a screen academy that was setting up in the city she could do it parttime learning all about filmmaking her excitement had lasted until a trawl of the internet had revealed the potential financial outlay mummy and daddy will be happy to pay westie had suggested and shed blown up at him accusing him of accusing her of being a leech of bleeding her poor parents dry another stamp of the foot and shed bounded out of the room slamming the door after her and causing one of his drying canvases to fall from its easel on to the floor hed managed to calm her down eventually with tea and a cuddle in the flats cramped kitchen i only need to work for another ten years and ill have savings enough she had sniffled maybe i can bump up my prices at the degree show westie had offered but they both knew this wasnt exactly feasible he was probably going to sell next to nothing no matter how good his draughtsmanship in terms of actual artistry he was still that same narrow pass at least in the eyes of the people whose marks counted most the head of department old prof gissing had never been a fan westie had looked up gissing himself once and had found that the grumpy old sod had pretty well stopped painting in the s meaning all hed done these past thirty years was write articles and give boring lectures yet people like him they were the ones whod give the thumbsup or thumbsdown to westies whole future as an artist westie the son of a postman and a shop assistant sometimes felt that there was a conspiracy afoot to stop the lower orders being recognised as any sort of creative force having finished the joint westie arms folded took a stroll around the room alice didnt come in here very much any more she stuck to the kitchen and bedroom the mess irritated her yet she was reluctant to tidy up in case it interfered with his creativity shed explained about a poet shed been friendly with at college whose flatmates had done this big springclean of his bedroom one time and surprised him with it hed tried to be grateful but hadnt been able to write poetry in there for weeks afterwards westie had considered this then had asked just exactly how friendly the two had been cue another lovers tiff when the doorbell sounded he realised hed been practically asleep staring out of the window at the passing traffic for at least a few minutes bed was one answer but alice would be expecting him to have achieved something with the day the doorbell rang again and he considered who it might be did he owe money would alices parents want a quiet word maybe slip him a few quid to clear out someone rattling a tin for charity or needing to know his political leanings last thing he needed in his life were these constant interruptions he was meant to be working putting the finishing touches surfing the junkyards and bricabrac merchants for cheap gilt frames into which to place his stubbs his constable his raeburn instead of which he found himself opening the door to one of those people whose marks counted most professor robert gissing in the flesh and apologising for the intrusion looked for you in the studios and then in your allocated exhibition space i keep most of my paintings here tend to work on them at night hence the bleary expression eh gissing was smiling would it be all right with you mr westwater if we were to come inside for a moment rest assured it wont take long we because there were two other men with him gissing introduced them as two friends but didnt mention names and westie didnt recognise their faces dealers perhaps or maybe collectors here to make preemptive bids on the contents of his degree show he didnt think so but he led the way into the living room gissing had taken charge and was gesturing for them all to be seated one of the friends made to remove the covering sheet from the sofa i wouldnt if i were you westie warned him got it from a skip a few interesting stains and the aroma of turps the visitor decided to cover the more interesting smells gissing was sniffing the air its not turpentine im detecting mr westwater its something much more akin to our old friend cannabis sativa guilty as charged westie said helps my brain to get moving the three visitors nodded slowly and silence descended westie interrupted with a cough id offer tea or something he apologised but were all out of milk gissing waved this aside then rubbed his hands together making eye contact with the classierlooking of the two strangers it was this man who eventually spoke what wed like to do he said is help you buy yourself a new sofa and maybe a few other bits and pieces besides he hadnt sat down and was inspecting some of westies work instead the accent was local and hadnt travelled too far from the tenements youre in the market for a painting westie shifted a little i didnt think the professor was my biggest fan i can see you have a talent gissing objected with a thin smile and im enough of a fan to ensure that you pass the course with distinction you know what that would mean a real chance of being accepted for something in the postgraduate line is this some sort of what do you call it faustian pact gissing offered not a bit of it though there would be that cash incentive the stranger reminded him as head of the college of art gissing added ive taken a look at your file westie each year youve applied for every bursary and hardship grant going and been turned down for all of them the student reminded him so whats your debt up to now five figures im guessing fresh start clean slate thats whats on offer here well id be happy to show you some of my work im looking at your work mr westwater the talkative stranger said everyone calls me westie the man nodded im pretty impressed he had picked up the stubbs horse its coat shone like a freshly peeled chestnut youve an eye for colour besides which we already have it on the professors authority that you know what youre doing when it comes to copies but we wouldnt be buying off the peg westie a commission westie was almost bouncing on the spot even though he still didnt feel comfortable why didnt the other stranger say anything he just kept checking his phone for text messages a secret commission gissing was correcting him no questions asked but now the talkative stranger was looking at the professor thing is robert i can see that westie heres not stupid hes suspicious and rightly so we can hardly keep the project a secret from him can we hell find out eventually he was homing in on westie now still holding the stubbs in one hand as he walked to within a foot of the student but when he spoke gissing still seemed his target we need westie to be part of it and that means trusting him he smiled for the young mans benefit the professor tells me you have an anarchic streak you like to poke fun at the art establishment is that right westie didnt know which answer would serve him best so he just shrugged instead the man who had yet to talk made a show of clearing his throat he had finished with his phone and was holding up a used stencil which had been teased out from below the sofa ive seen these around town he said posh edinburgh tones keeping his voice low as if fearing being told off the other stranger examined the stencil and his smile broadened you want to be the next banksy there was a story in the papers the second stranger said police seemed very keen to talk to the artist responsible thats the antiestablishment stance i was talking about the first stranger faced westie again and waited for him to say something this time westie decided to oblige so you want me to copy a painting he blurted out half a dozen actually gissing corrected him all of them from the national collection and its to be done without anyone knowing westies eyes were widening was he stoned and imagining this whole thing theyve been stolen is that it and the gallery doesnt want any of the public to get an inkling i told you he was smart the visitor was leaning the stubbs back against the skirting board now then westie if weve whetted your appetite maybe we can take you to the professors office and show you just exactly what were after the four of them sat at individual desks in robert gissings room he still gave occasional tutorials hence the chairs with writing surfaces attached his secretary had left for the day at gissings request mike and allan had eventually introduced themselves to westie by their first names having decided that it would be too cumbersome to use aliases after all it wasnt as though gissing could use one and if westie went to the police with the professors name it wouldnt take a columbo or a frost to connect mike and allan with him mike wasnt sure why allan had said so little back in westies flat cold feet perhaps or maybe it was because mike had already stated his intention to bankroll the operation stood to reason theyd need funds and mike was the one with cash to spare for a start he was sure westie would need paying payment for his silence as well as his expertise at this stage of course it was still a game they were playing making the copies didnt mean they had to take the scheme any further allan had seemed to accept this but maybe also thought that mike being willing to pay for the privilege should be the one to do the talking whatever i end up forking out i might still be getting a masterpiece on the cheap mike had assured him not that were doing this for the money gissing had growled the professors room was chaotic he had already cleared some of his bookshelves into boxes in preparation for retirement there was a stack of mail on his desk along with a computer and an old golfballstyle typewriter more books were heaped either side of the desk and piles of art magazines were threatening to topple the walls were cluttered with prints by giotto rubens goya and brueghel the elder these were the ones mike recognised there was a dusty cd player on one shelf and half a dozen classical titles von karajan seemed to be the conductor of choice the blinds had been closed leaving the room in semidarkness a screen had been pulled down from the ceiling immediately in front of the bookcases so that gissing could show them a wide selection of slides from the collection of the national galleries everything from old masters to cubism and beyond on the way over mike had explained a little more of the plan to westie who had slapped his knees laughing with glee maybe it was just the dope kicking in if i can help count me in hed said between gulps of air dont be too hasty mike had cautioned you need to think things through after which if you still want in gissing had added youll have to start taking it a bit more seriously now as they looked at the slides westie slurped cola from a vending machine can he sat forward in his chair both knees pumping i could do that was his refrain as the slides came and went gissing allan and mike had already pored over the slides all of them showing items held in the overflow warehouse where possible gissing had found reproductions on paper to accompany them these sat on the various desks but mike and allan felt no need to study them further they had already chosen a couple of favourites apiece as had gissing himself but they needed to be confident that the young artist would cope with the different styles and periods now how would you begin here gissing asked not for the first time westies mouth twitched and he began drawing shapes in the air as he explained monboddos actually pretty straightforward if youve studied the scottish colourists nice big flat brush laying the oil on in thick swirls hell go over one colour with another and then another after that so youre left with hints of what was there before bit like pouring cream on to coffee where you can still glimpse the black through the white hes after harmony rather than contrast that sounds like a quote gissing commented westie nodded its george leslie hunter from your lecture on bergson would you need special brushes then mike interrupted depends how thorough you want me to be you need to defeat the naked eye the gifted amateur but not the forensic specialist westie checked thats not an immediate concern gissing reassured him it would be nice if we had access to the right papers and ages of canvas brand new canvas looks just that brand new but you have ways westie gave a grin and a wink at mikes question look if an expert comes along theyll spot the difference in a few minutes even an exact copy isnt an exact copy a point well made gissing muttered rubbing a hand over his forehead yet some forgers get away with it for years mike offered westie shrugged his agreement but these days with carbon dating and christ alone knows what else waiting in the wings dont tell me youve not watched an episode of csi the thing we need to keep reminding ourselves gentlemen gissing said removing the hand from his forehead is that nothing is going to be missing meaning theres no reason for any of these boffins to become involved westie chuckled not for the first time got to say it again professor its mad but brilliant mike was forced to agree walk into the warehouse on doors open day and replace the real paintings with westies carefully crafted copies it sounded simple but he knew it would be anything but there was a lot of planning still ahead of them and plenty of time to pull out were like the ateam for unloved artworks westie was saying he had calmed a little only one knee was pumping as he drained the can of cola but was no longer concentrating on the slideshow he turned in his chair to face mike look none of this is really going to happen right its like radiohead might say a nice dream no disrespect but you three are what id call establishment guys of a certain age and cut youre suits and ties and corduroy nights at the theatre and supper afterwards he leaned back in his chair and crossed one busy leg over the other concentrating on the wagging motion of a paintspattered trainer youre not master criminal material and no way can you pull off something like this without a bit more firepower secretly mike had been thinking the selfsame thing but he didnt let it show thats our problem not yours he said instead westie nodded slowly but heres your other problem i want in in allan echoed his first contribution for some considerable time westie switched his attention to him i dont just want to be the grafter who churns out a few copies for you im on the team you want six paintings why not make it seven he folded his arms as if it was a done deal you understand mike asked slowly that if you take a painting youre as deep in this as any of the rest of us youre not just a paid employee any longer understood and were not selling the paintings on they can never ever hit the open market westie was still nodding and if it ever got out that wed im not going to grass you up isnt that actually another incentive with me on board ive got as much to lose as anyone westie opened his arms to reinforce the point i totally agree with the whole crazed concept its just that i want to be more than a brush for hire in return for which we hand you a painting mike asked ill earn my painting mikeyboy ill also earn all that cash youre going to pay me weve not talked sums yet allan ventured ever the banker westie pursed his lips and leaned forward again in his chair im not greedy he stated i only want enough to see a friend of mine through film school when westie left there was silence in gissings office for a couple of minutes the professor kept the slideshow coming seemingly for his own amusement while mike stared at the torn page from the catalogue showing monboddos portrait of his wife allan cruikshank was the first to speak all getting a bit serious isnt it something wed do well to remember gissing muttered he switched off the projector and got up to open the blinds worstcase scenario wed all go to prison lives and reputations in tatters for the sake of a few paintings allan said quietly you getting cold feet allan mike asked him allan thought for a moment before shaking his head hed removed his spectacles and was polishing them with a handkerchief we need to be sure in our own minds gissing added why were prepared to go through with it thats easy allan said replacing his glasses i want something at home my employers could never have or your exwifes boyfriend come to that mike teased gissing gave an indulgent smile when i retire to spain my two go with me i could be happy all day just staring at them mike studied his two friends but said nothing himself he didnt think theyd want to hear him say he was just bored to high heaven and looking to be challenged for the first time in a long time and then of course there was monboddos wife to consider young westie had a point he said at last even with four of us its going to be far from easy he looked at gissing have you had a chance to draw up the plan gissing nodded and reached into his desk drawer the three men stood over the sheet of paper holding its corners flat against the table as gissing unrolled it as a professor and a noted art historian gissing had visited the warehouse dozens of times in the past problem was this made him a known face dangerous for him to be part of any actual heist on the other hand he had drawn a beautifully rendered plan of the site complete with guardroom security cameras and panic buttons you did this from memory mike asked duly impressed and in such a short time allan added i told you ive been mulling this over for quite a while but be warned they may have made some changes to the layout since my last visit but the measurements are accurate mike was studying the route from the loading bay to the guardroom gissing had marked it with a thick red dotted line fairly accurate id say and youll do another recce before we hit the place allan added gissing nodded after which ill be useful to you only as the getaway driver better watch a few episodes of top gear then mike said with a smile prof allan asked youve been to doors open day before right gissing started running his finger along a line marked in blue it started at the main gate to the compound and continued through a door into the warehouse itself this is the route im hoping theyll take cant really see any alternative the tour is limited to a dozen visitors every hour on the hour tour itself only takes about forty minutes leaving them twenty to prepare for the next lot of arrivals names are on a list at the gatehouse one guard stays there the other three are inside usually drinking tea in the guardroom and watching their cctv screens staff from the museums and galleries department conduct the actual tour and they dont do background checks on visitors gissing shook his head not last year at any rate so fake names wont be rumbled mike persisted gissing just shrugged they ask for a contact phone number but in my experience theres never any contacting mikes eyes caught allans and he knew what his friend was thinking we need more bodies mike was thinking much the same thing the problem was whose at the end of the meeting allan hopped into a cab heading back to the office his phone already pressed to his ear mike preferred to walk standing with allan on the pavement outside the art college he had touched him lightly on the forearm sure youre ready to go through with this are any of us allan asked in return i like all the oceans stuff the profs detailed plan of attack it makes me think we really could pull this off if we wanted to do we want to you seem keen enough allan studied mike then gave a twitch of the mouth not sure about westie though how far can we trust him mike nodded his agreement well keep an eye on him christ listen to you allan was laughing you sound more reservoir dogs than george clooney mike offered a smile it could work though couldnt it allan thought this over for a moment only if we can get the guards scared and keep them scared we have to convince them we really are the mean team think we can manage that ill practise my snarling and how will they see it behind the mask youd be wearing good point mike conceded theres a lot we need to think about there is allan agreed stretching out an arm to wave down an approaching cab the profs done the groundwork and youre fronting the cash allan stared at mike not exactly sure what the pair of you think i can offer he pulled open the cabs back door youre our details guy allan stuff like the masks just keep mulling over all the potential flaws and glitches and youll be earning your stripes allan gave a mock salute as he closed the door behind him mike watched the cab pull away then crossed the road and headed down chalmers street towards the meadows this had all been farmland once but was now playing fields edged with trees cyclists were out in force students he assumed on their way to and from lectures there were a few geriatric joggers too and he wondered if he should make an attempt to get fit would it help cow the guards if he added some muscle to his upper body probably not not as much certainly as a big fat handgun or maybe a machete of some kind or a hatchet there would be shops in the city where such items could be bought not real guns of course but replicas some of the tourist shops sold claymores and even japanesestyle swords passing a couple of dogwalkers he had a little smile to himself probably no one in the history of the meadows had ever been thinking such thoughts as these youre a regular little gangster mike he told himself but he knew he wasnt all the same he knew a man who was alice rule was late getting home from the cinema she was trying to set up a sundayevening film club and had been finalising the mailshot european arthouse of the s and s she knew there was an audience for it just wasnt sure she could attract enough of them on sunday afternoons the cinema ran a quiz in the bar that was popular and she wanted to capitalise on it wanted to see those people stick around for a meal and an actual film shed run a short season of hitchcocks early work the stuff hed done in britain it had broken even and shed handed out questionnaires on the door asking for suggestions french new wave antonioni alexander mackendrick hong kong cinema plenty for her to think about as she climbed the stairs to her topfloor flat she wondered what sort of day westie had had hed said he would be sourcing picture frames plus putting the finishing touches to some of his portfolio she just hoped he hadnt been sitting on the sofa rolling spliffs all day it would be nice she thought to walk into the flat and smell supper cooking but she knew better than to expect anything like that eggs on toast was the sum total of westies painfully proletarian style or meals out meals she ended up paying for as she unlocked the door and stepped into the hall she caught no aroma of fresh paint never mind fresh cooking westies coat however was in a heap next to his shoes evidence that he had been out somewhere as she walked into the living room refusing even after all these months to bow to pressure and call it the studio glancing around in vain for signs of frames purchased there was a loud popping sound followed by a spume of foam from the neck of the champagne bottle westie was holding and what exactly are we celebrating alice asked aware that it would have been her salary paying for the bubbly she had shrugged herself out of her jacket and was placing her shoulder bag on the floor westie was pouring the champagne into two wine glasses it didnt look as if theyd been rinsed too thoroughly from the previous night some men came to see me he explained handing her a filled glass men businessmen westie clinked glasses and took a huge gulp swallowing and stifling a belch they want a few of my originals for their offices he started to do a little dance and alice her drink untouched wondered just how much hed been smoking their offices she echoed thats right what company how did they hear about you westie proffered a huge wink which told her hed already had a few drinks to go with the dope its all very hushhush he confided in a stage whisper hushhush theyre offering enough money for you to do that film course westie nodded slowly making sure she knew he wasnt joking you mean thousands alice couldnt manage to keep the disbelief out of her voice for some of your paintings whats the catch westie he looked crestfallen why should there be a catch theyre canny investors alice the kind who like to ride a wave just before it explodes on to the shore to paint this picture more fully he started making sounds approximating to just such an event then he tapped alices glass encouraging her to drink i need to get started though its a big job seven paintings from scratch theyre not buying off the peg alice its a commission alice was looking for somewhere to sit but not one single surface appealed your portfolio she argued you need to finish your degree show but westie was shaking his head dont you worry about that its all in hand and he had a little chuckle to himself are you sure about this alice asked she experimented with a small sip of the champagne it was chilled to perfection and sharptasting the real thing westie held his glass out towards her and this time she did the clinking all very hushhush she had to smile at that westie was terrible at keeping secrets he would always blurt out the identity of her birthday and christmas gifts before she had a chance to unwrap them when hed snogged a girl at a party once a party alice had missed because of work hed admitted everything to her over breakfast the next morning she didnt think he could lie to her even if his life depended on it she doubted shed have any trouble finding out what the story really was especially when she was so intrigued the last thing chib calloway ever expected to see squatting on his parked beamer was a sixfootthree hells angel in a tailored doublebreasted suit the man wore polished black brogues on his feet and a crisp white shirt with a mauve silk tie his long brown hair was tied back into a presentable ponytail and he sported just the single studded earring though with lobes pierced for plenty more he had removed any other facial jewellery and was cleanshaven cheeks glowing when he raised his head there was a giveaway blue dotted line across his throat a prison tattoo as he scratched his hands down his face chib noted more tattoos on both sets of knuckles hate on the right hate on the left blue ink again homemade the guy sported laughter lines around his eyes but the eyes themselves glowed with milkyblue malevolence now this is more like it chib thought to himself this i understand sort of it wasnt the most genteel part of town nearer granton than leith and not yet part of any regeneration scheme leith itself had changed there were more michelin restaurants there than in the city centre it made chib wonder what the trainspotting tours made of the place the guy who did those tours chib had tried persuading him that he should feature one of chibs pool halls chib also owned a couple of neighbourhood bars and had just been into one of them to do the weekly check he was realistic enough to know that the staff would be skimming but needed them to know that he knew that way nobody got too greedy and if temptation proved too much leading to takings below the norm chib would get out the photos of donny devlin and tell the staff this is what i do to friends who cheat me so consider what ill do to you if that cash doesnt magic its way back into my till by next week exiting the bar happy enough with its turnover chib had started gnawing his top lip the place was run almost too well the manager had come to chib from a big pubgrub chain in the south said he missed edinburgh and wanted to come home overqualified for the job but never complaining it was making chib wonder could the guy be a plant some kind of grass or cid undercover thing johnno and glenn had checked him out as best they could but that didnt mean much they were with chib now as he crossed the road towards his car flanking him in the approved manner across the street was a park not much of a park just playing fields for football crisscrossed with paths and a few benches where teenagers could gather of an evening to scare their elders twentyodd years ago that would have been chib swigging cheap booze and blasting the ciggies shouting and cursing eyes on the lookout for intruders strangers victims top of the world and wanting the world to acknowledge the fact hells going on johnno had been the first to spot the hells angel chibs car was a series bmw solid but not too showy there was a bentley gt in the garage back home never used for business the stranger had parked himself on the beamers bonnet sitting there crosslegged in his suit hands rubbing up and down his cheeks as he watched the three men approach though he wore shoes his ankles were sockless there were tattoos there too chib clicked his fingers and glenn reached a hand into the front of his jacket even though there was nothing there the stranger couldnt know that of course but he still grinned at the gesture seeming to dismiss it his eyes bored into chibs better not have scratched the paint chib warned the man respray could end up costing you an arm and a leg the man eased himself off the bonnet and stood with his hands either side of him fists bunched hate and hate you were not expecting me mr calloway the accent was foreign stood to reason i represent some people mr calloway people you should know better than to disappoint by which he meant the norwegians the biker gang from haugesund chib had known thered be some trouble there you owe your friends for a shipment mr calloway and you have not been forthcoming johnno had taken half a step forward but chib swiped a hand against his shoulder ive already told them the moneys on its way he rasped repeatedly so mr calloway but it is hardly a sustainable bargaining position is it chewed a bloody dictionary glenn snorted johnno adding a low chuckle the hells angel turned his face towards glenn you mean because i speak your native language better than you yourself do you dont just come barging up to mr calloway glenn barked back you show him some respect the same respect he has displayed towards my clients the question sounded genuine youre not part of the gang then chib interrupted i am a collector of monies due mr calloway for a percentage the man shook his head slowly i work for a straight fee half of it in advance do you always collect the other half so far first time for everything johnno spat while glenn pointed out some marks on the bmws bonnet the man ignored the pair of them he had eyes only for chib calloway tell them chib said the moneys coming ive never let them down before and frankly im insulted theyve sent you he looked the stranger up and down a grocers boy running their errands for them chib decided a wagged finger might even be in order you report back to them and well talk again next week that wont be necessary mr calloway chibs eyes narrowed why not the man offered a sliver of a smile because by next week theyll have had their money paid in full johnnos face broke into a snarl and he lunged forward but the man sidestepped him neatly and grabbed his wrist twisting until johnno buckled in pain chib noticed that there were spectators the manager from the bar had been told by a couple of pavement smokers to come look kids bunking off school had stopped their bmx wheelies to follow the entertainment glenn was ready to wade in but chib stopped him hed never liked playing to an audience not since schooldays let him go he said quietly the stranger held chibs gaze for a few more seconds and then pushed johnnos arm away johnno was left sitting on the roadway rubbing at his injury the look the stranger was giving chib said it all johnno and glenn were as much use as infants in a playground when the artillery comes calling ill be sticking around the man was saying i need to hear from you today tomorrow at the latest after that the talking will all be over do you understand johnno took a petulant swipe with one foot trying to make contact with the strangers shins the man ignored him and handed chib a folded scrap of paper it was a row of digits a mobile phone number when chib looked up he was walking away making to cross the park hey chib called out to him whats your name big man the stranger paused for a moment people have a habit of calling me hate he called back over his shoulder striding past the serried ranks of bmxs that figures chib muttered to himself glenn had helped johnno to his feet dead man walking johnno yelled next time i see you thats a promise pal he jabbed a finger in hates general direction glenn was patting him on the back trying to calm him down johnnos eyes were on his employer we need to take him out chib see him taken care of send a message to anyone and everyone reckon youre up to the job johnno chib asked i wouldnt say you looked rusty back there but ive known scrapyards with merchandise in better nick and thats after the compactors had a go at them we could follow him glenn was saying find out where hes staying what his real name is chib nodded thoughtfully knowledge is power glenn reckon you could track him without him noticing we can give it a go glenn offered but the giant was three quarters of the way across the playing field no way they could go after him on foot without him knowing about it there was no cover make some calls instead chib suggested by way of an alternative bed and breakfasts to start with say youre from the tourist office and some norwegian blokes gone and dropped some money glenn was nodding i want to get his money back to him and put out his description among the dossers and the jakeys that lot have got eyes in the backs of their heads and would pimp their granny for a bottle of buckie glenn was studying his employer can i take it youre not planning on paying up lets see was all chib calloway said unlocking the car with his remote i dont like this mike mackenzie was saying he was in robert gissings office the door locked and the plan of the warehouse spread across the desk weighted down at its corners with oversized art books gissing had paid another visit to the warehouse and had amended the plan accordingly you turned up there unannounced mike stated might make them suspicious come the heist the professor patted mike on the back i never thought of that michael youre quite right and ill be sure to check with you first in future but to put your mind at rest i do the same thing once or twice a year and i dont think my presence was much noticed theyre too busy finding space for all the new arrivals by which he meant the extensive overflow from the royal museum the place was getting a major overhaul and a good part of its collection needed shifting elsewhere for the duration as gissing had explained it might make their job harder on the day items could have been moved to make space but he didnt think the paintings would be relocated hed made the trip to assure himself of that mike was studying the plan gatehouse he recited cctv cameras guardroom staff acting as guides plus everyone on the tour if youre sitting in the getaway van that only leaves three of us to cope with it all and at least one of you will need to be collecting the actual paintings mike nodded slowly then began shaking his head instead well never manage cold feet young michael just want to make sure were covering all the angles gissing seemed to accept this maybe its allan whose feet are getting chilled allan hadnt been able to make the meeting mike had called it at short notice and allan had apologised by text there were things at work he couldnt get out of mike tapped the plan a final couple of times and then walked over to one of the chairs sitting down on it heavily running both hands through his hair while he looked around the room the office was emptier than before some of the boxes of books had gone pictures were missing from the walls allans fine he wants you to make a copy of the plan so he can study it at home ill arrange it but meantime put my mind at rest what somethings worrying you it just seemed so straightforward back at the start mike admitted with a sigh most plans do when you first think of them gissing offered bottom line robert weve been through this a dozen times a dozen latenight phone calls mike pacing his living room deep in thought you know it comes down to the same thing we need more hands gissing folded his arms and rested his backside against the edge of his desk he was keeping his voice down aware of his secretary outside the locked door hed warned mike not too many more meetings or shed start to have suspicions of her own remember he said now the old adage about too many cooks mike just shrugged the only other alternative is this stays on the drawing board a nice dream just as westie said never to be realised i was under the impression michael that thats pretty much been your attitude throughout a little challenge to keep the grey cells active or has the pull of lady monboddo finally become too strong to resist im every bit as serious about this as you are professor thats good to hear because with your help or without it i intend going ahead with the plan mike ignored this his thoughts were elsewhere one other thing he said the switch we cant do it in the warehouse itself well be in there maybe twenty minutes no way we can walk away apparently emptyhanded not even if weve raised the alarm ourselves mike shook his head determinedly gissings plan had been swap the real paintings for westies copies once that was done hit an alarm and make a run for it pretending the thieves had been spooked into leaving before they could take anything when the cid arrive first thing theyre going to wonder is what were we up to in those twenty minutes how come we didnt just grab something and run when we tripped the alarm then maybe we should take something mike shook his head again better yet we take everything the originals and the copies we only get frightened afterwards and abandon the van with one lot of paintings in the back everyone will be so relieved to get the stuff back theyll not be thinking about anything else gissings eyes grew unfocused and mike knew he was running it through his mind then he smiled you really have been doing some thinking michael and maybe youve struck on something but it does throw up another problem we need a van we can jettison meaning it cant be traced back to us any good at a spot of hotwiring professor what do you think me neither and i doubt either allan or westie has the necessary skills so now we can add a van to the shopping list alongside some weaponry and a few spare bodies mike got up from his seat so he was facing gissing at eye level as he went on what we really need is someone who knows about heists someone allan mentioned right at the start of this project the raid on first caly remember gissings eyes widened in disbelief wed be mad to let him near this he gasped mike had moved a step closer think about it robert calloway has the knowhow and the manpower he can find us that van and the necessary firearms i believe the gangland terminology is shooters mike gave a conciliatory smile i mean if theres anyone else who springs to mind anyone equally qualified because if we bring in any more amateurs like us how do we know we can trust them are you telling me you think chib calloway is a man to be trusted hes got more to lose than any of us with a record like his the law would come down on him like carl andres bricks a fitting enough analogy gissing conceded folding his arms but why would friend calloway be willing to offer us any form of assistance mike shrugged maybe he wont but at least i can sound him out on it maybe ill persuade him its good for art calloways getting the bug and i know from experience what that can do to a man gissing had walked back around to his own side of the desk im not sure michael he said slumping into his chair im just not convinced that he wont try to push us aside well we can always call it off mike offered at this stage theres no damage done except to my bank balance if westie demands some sort of compensation gissing smiled at this maybe youre right my boy the more i think about it the clearer it becomes that calloway would bring certain qualities to the project his eyes met mikes how exactly would you pitch it to him i think calloways a man who understands the value of a wad of notes was all mike could think of to say then you have my blessing to talk to him which left mike to wonder at his own powers of persuasion except that really the professor hadnt needed much persuading at all good for art chib calloway echoed laughing out loud ill tell you mike ive been needing a bit of light relief all day so bless you for that thats cheered me up no end they were seated in chibs bmw the two had exchanged phone numbers after their drink together at the shining star and mike had called chib as soon as hed left gissings office the meet had been arranged for two chib had picked mike up from outside the last drop pub in the grassmarket johnno and glenn in the back eyes open for anyone following safer this way chib had explained from the drivers seat before introducing mike to the two henchmen mike had met them that day in the shining star but chib had been too busy with questions about art auctions to be bothered with names mike nodded a greeting and then asked if there was some trouble no trouble hed been assured all the same chib had taken right turns and lefts and more rights doubling back on himself so that at one point they ended up passing the last drop again know why its called that chib had asked isnt it where they used to hang criminals mike had answered meaning people like yours truly the town would turn out in force to watch make a sort of party of the whole thing wasnt just thieves and muggers either they hanged you if you were a covenanter or a witch theyd slaughter anyone in those days things have moved on bet youd still get a crowd for an execution though eventually a voice from the back seat had declared that they were clear which was when chib had pulled the car to a stop and ordered his men out theyd put up a bit of resistance until their boss handed over a twentypound note for a cab and told them to meet him at the snooker hall sure about this johnno had said with a glare he kept rubbing his wrist as if hed sprained it probably mike reckoned after belting someone im sure chib had said but what if the viking chib had ignored this and raced off leaving johnno and glenn on the pavement mike hadnt felt able to ask who or what the viking might be instead chib had turned to him with a question of his own so whats on your mind mike and mike had told him starting at the beginning almost as if it was some story hed heard somewhere theres this collection of artworks in the city and not many people know about it and theres a way apparently to get hold of some of these paintings without anyone twigging to the mans credit it hadnt taken chib long to work things out by that time they were sitting in a car park halfway round arthurs seat in holyrood park mike seldom ventured up here it was a place for dogwalkers and tourists you rounded a bend and were met by incredible windswept panoramas of the city but at other moments you felt surrounded by wilderness the humped shape of arthurs seat itself fooling you into imagining you were miles from civilisation yet edinburgh surrounded you the chimneypots church spires and housing schemes just out of view good for art chib said again shaking his head but then he sniffed and rubbed a finger across his nostrils and asked mike to reprise the story only this time chib had questions concerns and ideas of his own the ideas were too elaborate but mike listened patiently his heart racing hed experienced a frisson from the moment hed stepped into the car actually even before that waiting outside the pub as office workers and visitors hurried past hed wondered what they would say if he blurted out the identity of the man he was waiting for and the reason for their meeting im putting together a team im leading a gang the heist of the century and then the car had pulled up hed felt uneasy with those two gorillas hulking in the back couldnt help thinking of all the other people who down the years had taken a ride with chib calloway and his men many of them fearful or plain petrified some never seen again but what mike had felt chiefly was exhilaration there was something feral about chib mikes first week in high school the weakest newcomers had been selected and given a halfhearted kicking by the older boys but chib had been there too already accepted by his elders his reputation preceding him it hadnt bothered mike better to be picked on than ignored completely but afterwards that was just what chib had done ignored him and a couple of years later he was gone from the school expelled after a headbutt on his chemistry teacher leaving behind only the legend there had still been bullies and gangs but nothing like chib by fourth year mike had been the one laying into the new kids afterwards mike had studied at college found himself a flat on the edge of the new town and a few brawls apart hed succeeded in leaving his upbringing far behind parents dead his only sister living in canada it interested him that chib wasnt merely about anger and the need to be the alpha male there was intelligence in those piercing eyes and a hunger for something knowledge perhaps maybe the gangster was beginning to realise just how narrow his world had become and just maybe mike conceded the same thing was happening to him he watched as without saying anything more chib got out of the car and walked to the edge of the car park from where he could stare out across a nearby pond mike decided to follow getting a cigarette lit as he exited the car his hands were trembling but only just there was a small island in the middle of the pond a swan nesting while its mate swam in protective circles a woman had brought her toddler along so they could toss chunks of bread to a nearby cacophony of ducks coots and moorhens but it was the swans that interested chib hed slipped his hands into his pockets as he watched them mike wished he knew what the man was thinking maybe he wanted the same sense of poise and certainty the same equilibrium mike made the offer of a cigarette from his packet but chib shook his head it was another minute or so before he spoke you lied to me mike back in that gallery said you were in computers i suppose its sort of true but you didnt want me to know all of it mr success story mr millions in the bank a tenner to a kid in an internet café and i had more gen on you than i knew what to do with he glanced towards mike scared id come calling on you one cold dark night hand stretched out for a sub mike gave a shrug i didnt want to look like i was showing off we scots are bad that way chib eventually acknowledged you ever been back to the school have they not invited you to hand out the prizes inspire the kids with a few words of wisdom no your old college gave you an honorary degree though was it the cash they were after one day i suppose mike conceded kid says youre not signed up to any of those sites that put you in touch with old pals like i told you thats because i dont have any old pals no me neither chib leaned forward to spit on to the surface of the pond doubt most of the folk i was at school with would give me the time of day they organised some anniversary do last year for kids in our year did you get an invite to that i think so you shouldve gone rented a roller for the night and a couple of nicelooking escorts rubbed all their noses in it you couldve done that too mike offered causing chib to smile dont go thinking it didnt cross my mind but in the end well fuck it he made a little writhing motion as though a cold wind were blowing then he turned his body so he was face to face with mike the hands stayed in their pockets mike was reminded of their meeting at the gallery and his fear that the gangster carried a gun or a knife he doubted it now but calloway had worries in his life maybe to do with the viking and mike had given him something to take his mind off them a fresh challenge youll need to be tooled up mike you do realise that youre going to have to put the fear of god into everybody make them think youll do whatever it takes but the gun doesnt need to be real right chib shook his head just needs to look real if thats what you want thats all well need better be sure of that just takes one of the guards to be exmilitary you poke an airgun in his face and hes going to know it replicas then even better is the real thing with the firing pin out youre the expert chib damned right i am he was silent for a few more moments four additional crew i reckon one apiece for the gatehouse and guardroom and two to keep the visitors quiet that leaves the three of you clear to do the actual finding and fetching quicker were in and out the better for all concerned still cant see it though mike you and the old professor guy and that poofylooking pal of yours more i think about it more im convinced its a windup you dont think itll work actually it sounds all right its the planners rather than the plan im thinking of neednt concern you chib if it falls apart its our problem youll still get your fee and so will the four crew have you got anyone in mind you want them young chib stated means theyre hungry on top of which theres all that testosterone makes them even scarier how much will they want but chib shook his head guns and bodies arent a problem crew dont even need to be told who theyre working for a word from mell be enough all theyll see is a warehouse wont know whats being taken they will if theyre in the back of the van speaking of which getting a vans easy enough maybe with faked number plates something plain something like a transit nobody looks twice at blackedout windows in the back of one of those fair enough so really were back to your fee how does a hundred and fifty thou sound mikes adams apple bobbed as he swallowed bit on the high side actually he was able to say eventually are you in some sort of trouble chib barked out a laugh and slid a hand from his pocket so he could slap mike on the arm with it tell you what he offered id be willing to take a painting off your hands so long as it was worth that sort of money what auctions dont make much sense to me mike youre planning on lifting seven paintings seems to me one extra wont make much difference youd never be able to sell it not on the open market im not planning on selling it if one forgerys identified mike persisted the others wont be far behind chibs face hardened thats my price mike unless you want to stump up the cash equivalent mike thought hard our forgers pushed as it is was all he could manage then we push him harder chib had leaned in towards mike although the gangster was a good couple of inches shorter than him mike felt he was being towered over the city he knew was no longer visible and the temperature had dropped the birdfeeders had disappeared no cars passed no other humans within hailing distance have we got a deal chib was intoning or do i start to get narked again that you lied to me back in that gallery one of the ducks had vanished beneath the surface of the pond mike was beginning to understand how it felt the oversized envelope had been left at reception by a courier allan opened it in his office relieved afterwards that he hadnt delegated the task to his secretary a scale photocopy of gissings drawing of the compound you silly bugger robert allan muttered no forewarning no sense of danger and now a receipt on file at the courier company urgent delivery of documents from professor r gissing edinburgh college of art to mr a cruikshank hnw relationship manager first caledonian bank allan shook his head slowly the beginnings of a paper trail now existed where none had been necessary despite which he was glad to have the plans he would lock them in his briefcase and take them home with him at days end he would close his curtains and make sure his front door was bolted and only then would he spread them out on the table pouring himself a glass of rioja and commencing to study them determined to prove himself determined to pay his way he might even push the glass to one side keeping a clear head for later when a nighttime drive down to grantons industrial estates and warehouses might be in order chib was having dinner that evening with a woman who ran an escort agency a couple of years back he had offered to help her with the business an offer shed turned down out of hand all the same chib had grown to like her she was tougher than most of the men he knew tougher certainly than glenn and johnno the latter still nursing his wrist along with his wounded pride the morning visit from the viking seemed a lifetime ago chib was supposed to be talking to him tonight tomorrow at the latest he had the slip of paper in his pocket but what was he supposed to say chib and this woman it wasnt serious between them just dinner now and then maybe a film or a show they swapped news and gossip rumours and anecdotes sometimes he even let her pick up the tab his wife had died a few years back from lung cancer it was a terrible way to go his own mum had been the same he used to say to liz long before they were married that he didnt want kids didnt want them going through what hed had to go through with his mum his dad hadnt been much use either hitting the bottle and falling asleep in his clothes every night cheery bugger arent you had been lizs response the first time hed told her itd made him angry that she made light of it but he hadnt done anything about it that was how much hed loved her tonights venue was a newish restaurant in one of leiths gentrified sections chib remembered leith when it had been all about the docks and the hard men drinking dens with knocking shops upstairs and tattoo parlours along the street with wraps of speed under the counter for those in the know there was still that side to it but a lot of the dockside had been spruced up style bars opening bonded warehouses turned into flats chib often wondered what happened to the oldtimers when these makeovers took place all across the city neighbourhoods were changing where chib lived there hadnt been any houses at all until ten or twelve years back now it had its own railway station sometimes it was hard to keep up hed been chewing over mikes crazy scheme the remainder of the afternoon to the extent that hed lost three frames of snooker in a row johnno teasing him that there must be a woman behind it there was a smell in the snooker hall chib wasnt sure hed registered it before it was nasty and vinegary and it caught in his nostrils old mens sweat and desperation bad diet and wasted time nothing like that here the chef had his first michelin star so chib had been told seafood was cooking and the staff were busy dicing vegetables in the kitchen there was a window between them and the tables so you could follow every move chib liked that back as a child the owner of his local chip shop used to hawk into the fryer to test how hot the fat was the thought of it now made chibs stomach turn he was early for his assignation and had driven there himself in the bentley he didnt like bringing johnno and glenn even when they stayed with the car or ate at a distant table they always made jokes next day about whether his lady friend snored and how did she like her eggs at breakfast when hed told them they werent needed theyd been quick to warn him again about the viking questions had been asked in town feelers were out but no one had reported any sightings of him could turn up at any moment sure you dont want us around boss positive seated at his corner table with an uninterrupted view of the entrance area chib noticed that hed been studying the art on the walls not even reproductions of anything worthwhile just splotches bought as a job lot to cover the pale yellow plasterwork hed been reading up on the subject ever since visiting the auction house a bookshop in town had suggested various primary texts the very words the assistant had used primary to chib meant junior school so hed started to argue that he wasnt thick thank you very much until the assistant had explained what she meant her voice shaking after which theyd gotten along fine now primary got him thinking back to high school funny he didnt remember mike recognised the type though still wanted the hard kids to notice him even twentyodd years on the scheme wasnt really that daft hed encountered plenty worse and a good number of those had come off if anything went wrong this time round well chib wouldnt be there to take any of the rap the kids he talked into helping theyd know better than to blab better to spend a bit of time behind bars than have to face a grassedup chib calloway mike and his pals might well want to cooperate with the filth but that wouldnt get them very far chib would stay at one remove and nobody would ever be able to lay their hands on the painting the valuable painting christ yes of course he reached into his pocket and took out one of his mobile phones along with the slip of paper punched in the numbers and waited he saw his friend walk in and offered her a wave she was being fussed over as usual by the maître d her coat removed now and then a wealthy visitor to one of the citys better restaurants might be tempted to pick the brain of the maître d theyd want to know where they could find a girl for the night just someone to spend a bit of time with and the maître d would know just the place very nice girls all very discreet after which hed pocket a tip from the customer and another next day this time from chibs friend she was pressing her hand to the maître d right now and chib didnt doubt that there was a twenty or maybe even a fifty there his call was picked up and he moistened his lips with his tongue is that you hate calloway the one and only i cant help thinking we got off to a bad start and i want to make it up to you im listening well while im putting the funds together for your employers how about a peace offering something you could place under the heading of collateral thing is its going to take a few more days to organise maybe as long as a week so i need you to persuade your employers that itll be worth waiting for youre playing games with me believe me im not im talking about something the mafia does all time you wish to put the head of a racehorse in my bed is that why you are working so hard to locate my place of residence shit this guy is good i think i can do better than that hate a whole lot better im listening mr calloway by the time chibs dinner guest reached the table the offer had been made the phone switched off for the rest of the evening chib stood up to kiss her perfumed cheek you he said look especially stunning tonight and you look she considered for a moment smugs the word that comes to mind like a cat thats just got the cream and whos to say i havent chib teased sitting down again and grabbing at his napkin before one of the waiting staff could unfurl it and start laying it across his groin he hated that really hated it the phone was ringing as mike emerged from the shower by the time hed towelled himself dry noting in the bathroom mirror that he needed to refresh his gym membership the ringing had stopped no message left but he recognised the number robert gissing calling from home mike slid his feet into flipflops and his body into a towelling robe then pushed the buttons on his phone exiting the bathroom and making for the balcony whats up robert he asked when the call was answered i was just curious is friend calloway on board i think so and how much exactly is that going to cost us he wants a painting mike held his breath knowing what was coming but the mans a bloody infidel wouldnt know good art if it bit him on the arse nevertheless mike listened as gissings breathing grew less ragged i suppose it all depends on whether theres enough time for westie to come up with another fake well ill leave that negotiation in your capable hands michael gissing still sounded irritated you seem to have the measure of students and criminals both im not sure about that mike gave a little laugh but was pleased all the same and besides the professor was saying ive been thinking that calloway may prove more useful to us than we first thought how so the night air was chilled mike retreated back inside sliding shut the door theres a curator at the national gallery gissing was beginning to explain and charles calloway may be the very chap to deal with him deal with him mikes eyes narrowed he wondered if hed misheard deal with him professor gissing confirmed it occurred to allan cruikshank that the reason he made a good banker was that he was intrinsically boring he had barely taken a risk in his life this meant he was cautious and prudent and therefore good at not losing his clients money but banking had also made him cynical it was a truism that those who already had money would find it easy to increase their wealth and they never seemed very grateful for allans work on their often unmerited behalf some of the high net worth individuals on his books owned three or four homes yachts racehorses private islands and innumerable works of art yet they seemed to appreciate very little being too busy amassing yet more he found them dull and blinkered and wondered if they thought of him the same way then there were his fellow account executives at first caledonian bank some of whom hardly registered his existence the chief executive had met him a dozen times yet never seemed to remember him from one occasion to the next with a drink in one hand and a canapé in the other he would regale allan time and again with the same anecdote while allan smiled and tried not to scream out youve told me that before you fuckwit he had perfected the art of looking interested and could gasp in surprise at any and every predictable punchline i want something he cant have allan would think to himself i want something none of my feckless clients could ever own i want those two coultons but he didnt want to go to jail these past few nights he had been waking in a sweat adrenaline shuddering through him he would sit in his dressing gown at the dining table poring over the plan how many years would he serve for his part in the scheme how would his kids react to a father banged up at her majestys pleasure would it all be worthwhile for just a couple of desirable paintings paintings he could never show to anyone never boast about to clients colleagues boss then again his exwife margot had chided him for years that he was dull his conversation was dull his cooking was dull his dress sense was dull and his lovemaking too when shed moved out hed realised he loved her but by then she had found herself a new man a younger model who wore black lambswool polo necks and a smug seemingly permanent halfsmile this hadnt stopped allan calling her every few days for a catchup suggesting lunch at various trendy bistros she seemed already to have been wined and dined in each of them well there was one thing allan could do that mr lambswool couldnt pull off the perfect crime which was why despite the sweats and the bad dreams he was determined to go ahead with the heist hell his kids might actually like him a little better even supposing he went to jail notoriety beat anonymity in most teenagers eyes youre sure mike asked him for the umpteenth time as they climbed the stairs to westies thirdfloor flat positive allan replied hoping he sounded convincing mike had stressed that his job was to study the fine detail but every time he made a suggestion or spotted a potential problem it seemed mike had been there before him with chib calloway on board bringing muscle and firepower mike had explained that allan could jump ship if he was anything but one hundred per cent behind the project you wont be losing face or anything hed said mike allan had replied are you sure its not you that wants me out to which mike had shaken his head maintaining eye contact but saying nothing they had reached westies landing and stood for a moment outside the door catching their breath then mike gave a slow nod before pressing the bell westie however looked more nervous than either of his visitors something mike was quick to point out as the student led them inside your fault westie snapped back know how much sleep ive had this past week im running on caffeine cigarettes and the odd bloody mary tabasco or worcester sauce mike asked westie just glared at him they were in the living room by now it smelt of fresh paint varnish wood westie was using old wood where possible for the stretchers no need for frames theyd be swapping them on the day where old wood hadnt been available he was staining new pine with several coats of instant coffee works a treat he explained as mike picked up one of the frames and sniffed it fairtrade i hope he commented westie ignored him he actually seemed prouder of the stretchers than of the copied paintings themselves but as allan studied them he could see that they were marvellous and this was the very word he uttered mike making a noise of agreement while westie preened gissing had provided reproductions of the paintings and these were pinned to the walls of the makeshift studio theyd been torn from books and catalogues there were also closeup photographs showing sections of individual paintings courtesy of the college of arts own library printed information sheets some sourced from internet sites detailed each artists working methods and where possible the exact colours and producers of the paint used there were tubes of oils everywhere some squeezed dry squares of plywood and cardboard had been used as palettes brushes sat in jars of turps others had been discarded stiffened beyond repair westie was dressed in a crusty tshirt and a pair of baggy kneelength shorts it was hard to tell what colour either item of clothing had been at the start of its career told you i could do it he was saying but as he made to light a fresh cigarette from the butt of an old one he gave a hacking cough and pushed the greasy hair back from his eyes you need a liedown allan told him try stopping me westie snorted plenty of time for that once the jobs done mike cautioned how many are ready see for yourself westie stretched out an arm towards the relevant canvases five down two to go three mike corrected him westie glowered we said seven two apiece for you lot and one for me another partner has come on board cant start changing the goalposts now yes we can our new partner is insistent the two of them began to argue westie pushing for more cash but mike stood his ground as allan watched in silent appraisal his friend had changed had grown into the role he was now playing dealmaker tough guy criminal maybe hed been spending too much time with chib calloway but allan thought it went further quite simply mike was enjoying himself for the first time in an age the electricity that coursed through allans body was coursing through mikes too but to very different effect mike was ready for anything a tall man hed always affected a slightly roundshoulded posture as though embarrassed by his size but now he was more comfortable in his skin shoulders back spine stiffened he made eye contact more readily and spoke slowly but with growing authority this was what he must have been like in business allan thought this was how he got to the top which meant that selling the company had brought mike wheelbarrows of cash but only at the cost of his vigour the problem was allan liked this new mike just that little bit less in the past they had gossiped like fishwives telling jokes and sharing anecdotes now it seemed the heist was their only currency and what about afterwards was it likely to galvanise their friendship or drive a wedge into it allan was almost afraid to ask so he watched and listened and wondered about chib calloway hed argued against the gangsters involvement until giving in to the combined will of mike and the professor still he knew it was a mistake as a move it was anything but cautious the men calloway provided would be his he could make them do whatever he liked but would they do whatever mike or allan or gissing told them to do and what was to stop calloway ripping them all off afterwards they could hardly run to the authorities to complain mike had nodded throughout then had argued his own corner did allan want to go find some guns steal a van talk a few hooligans into helping them out doors open day was less than a week away calloway was the only realistic option they had we could buy a van secondhand fake names and paying cash and do we really need weapons defeated by a show of hands two against one so much for his role as the details guy the five completed forgeries sat on their individual easels paint glistened on several allan didnt doubt theyd be tacky to the touch oil took a while to dry days he seemed to remember and would they retain that newly painted smell mike had come here today because he wanted to make sure westie hadnt been tempted to add any flourishes no drinks cans or aeroplanes tucked away in a corner of the canvas when he started peering at each painting in turn allan did the same these look good westie mike said at last the student accepted the reiterated praise with a bow and allan knew then that he would complete the necessary eighth canvas mike was in charge and the bow acknowledged this allan watched as mike pulled five folded sheets of paper from his pocket gissing had cherrypicked them they were valuable but obscure and should prove relatively easy to copy your choice mike allowed handing the pictures to westie whichever ones going to be easiest and quickest hes not fussy then our new partner westie started sifting the shortlist hell take whatever we give him yeah youre a fast learner westie now choose westie held up one of the pictures this one nodding mike turned towards allan what do you think the question caught allan unawares think he echoed about these mike jabbed a hand towards the easels they look fine be even better once theyre framed but are they really going to fool an expert depends on the expert mike answered he was studying monboddos portrait of his wife it wasnt quite finished yet the background needed to be filled in but from a distance of only a few feet allan was hard pressed to tell it apart from the original he remembered the exhibition and mikes reluctance to move on from the painting to the dozens of others in the show allan had made two circuits of the room before mike could be tempted away it looked like the same thing might be happening today but then allan caught movement out of the corner of his eye someone was standing in the doorway what the smile for the birdie it was the voice of a young woman she was holding a video camera up in front of her training it directly at them westie gave a little wave whos this mike was asking it was the woman herself who answered this is alice she was still holding the camera in front of her at head height as she walked slowly into the room and one of you is mike the other allan thing is though you know westies full name where he lives and he knows almost nothing about you mikes attention was on westie is there anything youve not told your girlfriend here why would he keep a secret from me she was lowering the camera as she approached mike she wore a short black skirt and thick black leggings her tshirt had a photo of al pacino on it from the movie scarface are you mike or allan this is mike westie said he had the good grace to look embarrassed by the stunt alice was pulling all the same allan got the feeling hed known about it in advance no surprise in his face no questioning in his voice alice had transferred the camera to her left hand so she could reach out with the right but mike was not in the mood for social niceties she quickly realised this and tried allan instead allan right she asked right allan said shaking the proffered hand no point making an unnecessary enemy something he tried to communicate to mike with a look mike however was concentrating on alice she was making a show of perusing the paintings giving the artist a peck on the cheek as she passed him so so talented she murmured she stroked the cheek shed just kissed and then turned towards mike again is that thing still on he asked but pointed floorwards she felt it necessary to say still picking up our voices though mike shot back alice studied him for a couple of seconds then smiled and switched the camera off she waved it in front of her face call it insurance our way of making sure were all in this together if westie gets dumped on at any point from any height this ends up at the local cid you have to appreciate that im just looking out for his best interests allan was wagging a finger at her i know you he stated quietly ive seen you at the filmhouse she acknowledged this truth with a twitch of the mouth but was not to be deflected her eyes remained fixed on mike westie says you offered him a cash payment as you can see hes earning every penny but just now i overheard you trying to squeeze another painting out of him without adding anything to the price hardly sounds fair does it what do you want i want whats best for westie it sounds insane to me but he says hes keen to go along on the raid itself hes also getting a painting one we both happen to like very much so thats all right i sense a but but she obliged something up front would seem to be in order we were thinking a grand mike made a show of patting his pockets i dont seem to have that sort of cash on me you could always write a cheque she paused for effect but then that would mean us knowing your surname mr mike her smile was full of mischief the tip of her tongue rubbing itself against her top lip mikes face had hardened and hed slipped his hands into his pockets allan sensed the right hand curl into a fist and he was grateful the guns had not yet been delivered when his friend spoke it was in an ominous monotone i can get you the money but ill need something in exchange this alice guessed waving the camera mike nodded slowly its a nice piece of kit she teased pretending to examine it not sure i could bear to part with it for five hundred pounds i think you can a grand she corrected him mike had his hand stretched out palm upwards you want it now she raised an eyebrow before weve even seen the colour of your money cant leave it with you alice mikes voice still lacked all emotion you could copy the footage download it anything but handing it over would mean trusting you then make your decision mike was brushing something invisible from his tailored jacket just so long as you know youre part of this now and that means all our futures are linked like worry beads alice offered or dominoes only takes one to fall the wrong way her smile was more expansive this time the camera was placed in mikes waiting palm one goes they all go alice was saying thats right mike slipped the camera into his pocket and although his eyes were still boring into alices allan couldnt help thinking that the whole exchange could just as easily have been aimed at him your boss detective inspector ransome said is getting good at losing us he was seated in a coffee shop on the high street just up from the parliament building talking into his mobile phone the man he was talking to was seated three tables away they held eye contact and their phones to their faces but couldnt risk an actual meeting thats because he wont let me drive glenn burns said into the mouthpiece or johnno come to that you think hes suspicious if i thought he was on to me id have packed my passport and fake beard by now hes the one wholl be going away glenn ransome stated with confidence leaving his little empire going begging and you just let me take over how do i know you wont try shafting me same as youre doing to him weve been through this before glenn ransome said with a grin of reassurance i will try shafting you but youll be top dog not just a spearcarrier and youll be wise to me plus youll owe me one that too of course ransome broke off eye contact long enough to lift the oversized mug of coffee to his lips the liquid was scalding and tasted mainly of frothed milk is that the latte glenn asked into the phone ransome nodded whatve you got hot chocolate with whipped cream sounds disgusting ransome wiped the foam from his top lip so whats your employer up to glenn dunno thanks for sharing no need to get sarky glenn said huffily hes up to something though you just said he wasnt what i said was i dont know what hes up to but there is something glenn nodded the door opened with a tinkling of its bell and both men looked round checking the new arrival in case it was someone they should avoid but it was just another young mum pushing a buggy they should ban nippers from places like this glenn was commenting staring at the table of mothers and infants that was greeting this latest arrival one of the kids was griping and didnt look like stopping any time soon i agree ransome said and id stop students coming in too he glanced over to where a solitary teenager coffee long finished had spread laptop and coursework over a table intended for four the laptop was sucking electricity from a socket nearby but then the place would be half empty the detective relented and wed stick out all the more suppose so glenn agreed so thats the important issues of the day taken care of maybe we can get back to your employer hes keeping me and johnno out of it glenn sounded aggrieved and ransome knew now why the man had asked for a meet he had some steam to blow off but a couple of the pubs weve been to hes been asking about kids kids glenn saw that hed been misunderstood tearaways soccer casuals not kiddie kids with a nod towards the table of young mums so give me some names glenn shook his head no idea what does he want them for dunno it all started when he bumped into this guy he was at school with i mean he tells me they were at school but i cant see it the other blokes a class apart if you get my meaning chib and him went for a drive a few days ago and when chib came back he was starting to think about putting together this posse of kids reckon youre being put out to pasture glenn even at a distance ransome felt the power of the big mans stare nobodys putting me out of the game mr ransome all the same if hes putting together a posse theres got to be something theyre after something or someone glenn let his words hang in the air between them youre talking about a hit ransomes eyes widened who could he be planning to whack well theres this big tattooed guy foreigner comes from iceland or somewhere hes in town to collect a back payment on some merchandise problem is your lot grabbed our goods hells angels still want paying and chibs unwilling to cough up four or five schemies with pool cues might be his way of thinking glenn paused again i doubt theyd cause this guy too many problems though not unless they were seriously tooled up and even if they were thered be others where hate comes from ransome thought hed misheard hate he repeated thats what he calls himself ransome jotted down glenns description of the man then flicked back through his notebook a few pages hed run a check on all three of the names laura stanton had given him mike mackenzie allan cruikshank robert gissing hed drawn a blank with cruikshank though shed said he worked at first caly gissing had done a bit of painting a while back and had also written lots of boringsounding tomes about art mackenzie well mackenzie was some sort of computer fatcat what does chibs old school pal look like ransome asked into his phone glenns description fitted mackenzie like a glove we were in a wine bar when chib bumped into him dunno what happened after that but suddenly theyre pals ransome tapped his pen against the notepad could mean something or nothing he admitted yeah glenn agreed so whats the deal with hate is he just scratching his arse while he waits for the cash weve been looking for him bastard must be camping under the stars on arthurs seat or something nobody in town seems to have seen him and trust me hes a hard man to miss is chib bricking it he thinks hes got something up his sleeve and whats that hes keeping it to himself maybe this hit hes planning maybe ransome sighed christ on a bike glenn youre supposed to be my guy on the inside fuck you too mr ransome last thing i need right now is any more grief from you the detective made a show of incredulity you think this is grief glenn ive not got started yet im still in the home team changing room with my kitbag zipped up griefs what im saving for the moment im placing the cuffs on chib calloways wrists but i dont want to grow old in the process and neither do you point taken glenn glanced at the front of his phone and ransome knew he was checking the time got to go im supposed to be collecting from a pub at the top of abbeyhill careful not to skim too much before you hand it over to our friend there was silence on the other end of the phone skimming was a sore point with glenn it was how hed ended up where he was walked into one of his bosss bars one day to check the takings walked out again twenty minutes later carrying a bag but with one side of his jacket weighted more heavily than before ransome stepping out in front of him and squeezing the jacket pocket feeling the weight of coins there the tightly banded banknotes tutting and shaking his head and to think i had you down as the brains of the operation glenn still gives us a chance to have a little chat glenn risked a fullblown glower at the detective as he stood up and shoved his phone into his pocket then he stomped out of the coffee shop barging past a couple of female tourists in the doorway one of them carried a map and had been about to ask glenn something but the look on his face had changed her mind ransome had a little smile to himself as he lifted his mug to his mouth ever handled a gun before mike not since i was a kid they tended to be made of plastic and fired caps mike felt the heft of the handgun it had a dark sheen to it and an oily smell its a browning chib explained best of the bunch so i hope you like it they were in the workshop of an mot garage in gorgie not far from where theyd both grown up walking distance to their old school there was a rustylooking sierra sitting in the only bay cranked up above the examination pit wheel hubs and tyres were scattered around the place corroded exhausts headlamps with wires curling from them a couple of venerable topless calendars on the wall above the workbench the mechanics had clocked off for the night the forecourt had been in darkness as mike walked across it hed felt it as he approached the door last chance to back out with a few shreds of dignity intact moment he went in and accepted a gun that was it chib had been waiting for him arms folded and a smile scratched across his face knew youd be game the look seemed to say the other guns were in a flimsylooking cardboard box that had once contained forty bags of prawn cocktail crisps while mike got used to the feel of the browning chib brought out the sawnoff shotgun bit rusty he commented but good for the fear factor he pointed it at mike and chuckled mike pointed the browning back at him chib cocked the gun and angled it upwards before pressing the trigger there was a dampsounding click decommissioned as promised normally theyd cost you a double ton a day im good for it mike stated oh i know you are mike makes me wonder what this is all about im guessing you can afford to buy near as dammit anything that takes your fancy but what if its not for sale like that is it chib was watching mike switch hands with the browning tuck it in the back of your waistband see how it feels mike did as he was told i can tell its there me too thats a problem might want to think about a longer jacket and something a good bit more roomy theres a couple of starting pistols theyve got blanks in them just in case you need to make some noise plus a replica of your browning and some old piece of junk from the falklands or iraq or somewhere its a revolver mike said lifting the gun in his right hand i didnt know the army still used them chib just shrugged the student and your pal allan should get some practice in theyve got to look comfortable when they go crashing through that door mike nodded and the rest of the crew my lads will have handled shooters before dont worry about them mike placed the revolver back in the box keeping the browning tucked in against the small of his back he tried the shotgun next it felt awkwardly heavy and lacked balance he shook his head and handed it back when do we meet your lads on the day itself theyll be primed and theyll be under orders to do everything you tell them to mike nodded and the van nicked this very evening its safely garaged fake number plates are probably being installed as we speak not here though chib shook his head ive got a few places like this dotted around the city so if you ever need an mot on a dodgy motor mike managed a smile ill bear it in mind you need to tell your crew that therell be disguises to wear and we dont want them toting any flashy jewellery anything that could get them recognised listen to the resident expert chib said with another low chuckle is that us then all set mike nodded slowly day after tomorrow i just hope the paints dry on the fakes chibs phone sounded and the gangster lifted it from his pocket checking the number on the screen got to take this he said by way of apology turning away from mike as he answered i was beginning to think youd gone awol mike pretended to be checking the guns again as he listened hes going to go for it chib was saying head angled downwards as if studying his shoes thats good definitely no funny business believe me just good honest collateral two or three days tops cheers then he ended the call and turned back towards mike with a wide smile collateral mike echoed chib just shook his head is that us then he repeated keen to wrap things up i suppose so but then mike gave a little wince no not quite actually theres something i forgot spit it out mike slipped his hands into his pockets as though wishing to make the request seem more casual theres this mugging victim chibs eyes widened slightly and then narrowed as if in comprehension you want me to find out who did it have them made an example of not exactly mike paused for effect you see this particular mugging hasnt actually happened yet chibs eyes narrowed again i dont get it he conceded keep listening mike advised and you soon will chib was disappointed mike said when i told him the national collection doesnt stretch to a vettriano gissing snorted into his drink the two men were seated in an anonymous bar near the railway station it was a nononsense place meant for drinkers only no tv or jukebox and only crisps to stave off any hunger pangs not having indulged in the best part of a decade mike had found himself ordering two packets of prawn cocktail thinking of the box of guns that was hidden for want of a better place in the boot of his car three oldtimers were seated on stools at the bar itself and had ignored mike completely as he ordered the drinks and snacks gissing had chosen the table furthest from the door he wrinkled his nose at the crisps and stuck to alternating between sips of malt and gulps of ipa vettriano isnt universally admired he commented wiping foam from around his mouth popular though mike countered knowing full well the professors views on the subject gissing decided not to rise to the bait so what exactly is our gangland friend settling for an utterson dusk on rannoch moor thats the one westie didnt think hed have any trouble painting it you showed a picture of it to calloway i did and he liked it he asked what it was worth gissing rolled his eyes well good riddance to it i suppose he took another swallow of beer and mike realised how nervous the professor was while mike himself was growing calmer with each passing hour from the internet he had printed off an aerial map of the streets around the warehouse charting the best route for the van hed arranged with chib where to pick up the four extra crew and where to drop them afterwards the crew would take the guns and dispose of them looking at gissing he felt glad the old boy wouldnt be storming the warehouse firearm at the ready the hand reaching for the whisky glass was trembling itll be fine mike assured him my dear chap of course it will you dont think im having doubts a lot could still go wrong youll handle it mike the professor gave a tired smile you seem to have developed a taste for all of this maybe a little mike conceded but it was your idea remember still i wont be sorry when its done and dusted while i have the sneaking suspicion you just might be so long as we dont end up in jail christ imagine it with chib calloway as our disgruntled cellmate gissing raised a hand palm out as the americans might say lets not even go there they shared a smile and concentrated on their drinks just one more day to go mike knew hed have to fill tomorrow with activity so that he didnt start to fret theyd gone over the plan on paper rehearsed the details a dozen times allan had been through it with a fine toothcomb they knew what they had to do and how much time would be available but there were factors they couldnt determine mike wondered if that was why he felt so calm a case of que sera sera as a businessman hed always liked to be in charge knowing what would happen in control of the various sequences of events but when hed picked up that browning hed felt a thrill of electricity the weight of it the machinetooled detail it was a work of art in itself hed loved playing with guns as a kid had a huge collection of plastic soldiers cowboys and indians hell give him a banana and hed have been aiming it at the nearest target an aunt had brought him back a boomerang from australia same thing point aim with one eye closed then make that plosive sound of the bullet and its trajectory he remembered chib aiming a nonexistent pistol from the passenger seat of the series and back at the garage hoisting the sawnoff shifting against the back of his chair he could feel the browning tucked into his waistband it was rash to carry it what if anyone glimpsed it and reported him but he couldnt help himself he only had it until saturday afternoon he thought back to the indian restaurant and wondered how those drunken suits would have reacted if hed pulled a gun on them not in the restaurant itself too many witnesses but outside waiting in the shadows for them to come reeling out when the door to the bar opened mike swivelled his eyes caution mingled with mistrust but it was just another drinker a scant week or two back he would have paid no heed the world ended at the length of his stretched arms but this was different he wondered how he could go back to his old self again seated in his flats spare bedroom the one he kept all his computer stuff in staring at the monitor or checking the shelves for signs of his relevance the business initiative awards and framed citations outstanding achiever creative spirit scottish entrepreneur what did any of it mean the drinker had joined his friends at the bar the door was swinging shut again reminding mike of that day at the auction house when one door opens another closes and vice versa obviously were really going to do it arent we gissing had punched his right fist into his left palm and was rubbing the one against the other oh yes mike confirmed no getting away from it now getting away from it may not be the problem we need to focus on getting away with it and what happens afterwards michael were freedom fighters remember afterwards we get to feel good mike shrugged he had nothing else to offer as yet the professor was silent for a few moments then he sighed staring into the remains of his beer cezannes boy in a red vest was stolen you know not so long ago from a museum in switzerland they reckon it was taken to order someone has it on their wall at home i heard about it interpol reckon six billion dollars worth gets stolen each year know how much of it they recover not much mike saw the enquiring look on gissings face ive done my research robert few clicks of the mouse and there it was fourth largest criminal enterprise in the world after drugs armsrunning and moneylaundering which is good news for us means that if and when our little undertaking is discovered the police will be focusing on criminal gangs and were not one of those not the way the local plod would understand it you see yourself more as thomas crown gissing teased does that make laura your faye dunaway im a long way short of steve mcqueen prof or pierce brosnan come to that they had another little laugh to themselves the still watches of the night gissing eventually said sounds like a quote a victorian cat burglar called adam worth some say hes the basis for moriarty he once stole a gainsborough and said it was so he could worship it in the still watches of the night i hope he worshipped it in daylight too gissing nodded deep in thought another mike offered gissing shook his head early night for me he said what was allans excuse this time dinner with a client wasnt sure how long it would go on but hes cleared his diary for tomorrow well thats something i suppose gissing rose slowly to his feet then noticed there was a trickle of whisky remaining so drained it and exhaled noisily ill see you in the morning michael try to get some rest do you need me to run you home gissing waved the offer aside and made for the door mike waited a couple of minutes then emptied his own glass and nodded goodbye to the barman as he exited his car was on a single yellow line fifty yards along the road there was no sign of the professor this was a street of galleries mike peered through the window of the nearest but couldnt make out anything other than vague shapes on the walls he looked to left and right but saw nothing to trouble him unlocked his car and slid into the drivers seat he decided to take the long route home the one that would lead him past allans flat it was just off leith walk in an undistinguished part of the new town nice flat though and never any trouble in the vicinity due in no small part to the police station directly opposite mike kept his indicators on as he stopped adjacent to two patrol cars they were parked kerbside locked and empty allans flat was two floors up the lights were on behind the curtains didnt mean he was home of course could be for security didnt mean hed lied about the dinner didnt mean he was becoming a liability not yet the problem was in the detail mike had asked allan to look for chinks in the plans armour meaning he spent all his time on negatives what could go wrong rather than getting any sort of buzz from the adventure allan had been to granton driving past the warehouse skirting its perimeter noting movements and personnel then had reported back with news of several dozen potential problems and setbacks and it seemed to mike had begun believing the task to be altogether more fraught than was manageable while mike himself felt the opposite even chib calloway chib calloway was bending to his will he rubbed his spine against the drivers seat feeling the gun in his waistband with a welllit police station not fifteen feet away in charge in control senses heightened mike switched off his flashers and let the maserati rumble down the hill into the heart of the new town they met at mikes flat in murrayfield gissing spent the first few minutes studying the works of art that lined the walls while allan wanted to see mikes den asking questions about the spec of his computer and commenting on the display of awards mike knew what they were doing deferring the inevitable he busied himself making coffee miles davis providing the soundtrack the flat was fitted with a centralised music system meaning anything on his ipod could be piped into any or all of the rooms the speakers were in the ceilings but a couple of them had stopped functioning same went for the display panel on the living room wall that was the problem with a smart home the smarter it got the more could go wrong one of the recessed lights in the kitchen needed replacing too but it was a halogen thing and fiddly to install mike would sometimes joke that when the last bulb fizzled out hed have to find somewhere else to live he took the tray into the living room and placed it on the dining table next to the cardboard box everythings ready he said his guests accepted their drinks with silent nods trying not to show any interest in the box or its contents gissing had brought a list with him fake names of the seven individuals booked on to tomorrows tour how long ago did you book the tour mike asked it tends to fill up pretty quick gissing commented how long mike persisted the professor shrugged three four weeks back before we started planning this gissing acknowledged as much with a twitch of his mouth i told you mike ive been thinking about this for a long time i did the same thing last year reserved a block of names for the tour you bottled out allan guessed didnt know who might be willing to help the professor slurped some coffee i hardly knew you back then allan and youd yet to meet me mike added gissing nodded slowly its one thing to have an idea another to carry it to fruition he toasted mike with the coffee mug were not there yet mike warned how did you make the bookings by phone but without using your own name fake names throughout they asked for contact details as i knew they would so i used the phone numbers of some indian and chinese restaurants they wont need to phone unless the tour is being cancelled and its not going to be cancelled this year gissing shook his head i had my secretary call them yesterday to see if there was any chance of adding a student to one of the tours she was informed that all the tours are full meaning theyre going ahead mike thought for a moment okay he said trying to sound reassured he then opened the box and lifted out the first of the guns he placed it on the surface of the table and another followed it followed by a third and a fourth take your pick whatevers left goes to chibs men and the sawnoff allan had spotted it still resting in the box barrel pointed upwards thats for them too gissing was weighing up one of the starting pistols believe it or not i used to shoot as a lad my school had cadet training sometimes we were allowed live ammo not tomorrow mike said heavier than it looks allan commented picking up another of the guns he studied it i thought you were supposed to file off the serial number theyre untraceable mike assured him according to your friend chib allan countered he was taking aim at the window one eye squeezed shut thing is if we go in there waving these around the guards might get spooked start lashing out chibs men are there to lash back but say one of them rushes me allan persisted do i pull the trigger and shout bang just improvise gissing growled the starting pistols fire blanks mike explained the noise should be enough to freeze anyone in their tracks gissing picked up the revolver this ones genuine isnt it exfalklands or gulf war mike confirmed you know a bit dont you actually i think thats my knowledge of these things pretty well exhausted how about you michael any preference mike reached around into the waistband of his denims he was wearing a loose shirt and the browning emerged in one fluid movement jesus mike allan said you make that look almost too practised mike smiled i had it on me last night in that pub did you now gissing said id no idea i bet service would have improved if youd whipped it out allan added once youre happy with your choice mike went on nodding towards the guns i want you to keep it with you try to get comfortable handling it not that i should have any reason to use mine gissing stated not if youre outside in the van no but we dont know what the situations going to be like in the compound just needs one extra guard to be patrolling the perimeter and weve got a problem thats why youll be carrying it he pointed towards gissings gun understood the professor said with a nod that was my idea by the way allan added compounds a huge area which makes it vulnerable good to see youre pulling your weight gissing responded when you cried off last night i admit i started having doubts that reminds me mike interrupted how did your dinner go fine allan replied just a little too quickly his eyes everywhere but on his friend gissing and mike shared a look the professor was passing his chosen gun from hand to hand he tried fitting it into the inside pocket of his tweed jacket but it threatened to fall out maybe ill wear something with bigger pockets tomorrow whatever you wear its got to be disposable mike reminded him no favourite shirts or coats whole lots going to have to be got rid of right allan said hed pushed his own gun into the front of his trousers going to do my groin an injury if i try sitting down he complained he shifted the gun round to the small of his back that works he decided then were all set arent we mike waited for his two friends to nod their agreement there was a slight niggle at the back of his mind seven false names for the tour booked weeks ago by gissing so the old man had known they would need backup he said as much to gissing thats not what i was thinking the professor corrected him my rationale was the more ghosts i could load on to the tour the fewer actual participants id have to deal with on the day there happened to be seven spaces left so i gave seven names end of story mike turned his attention to allan his details guy allan gave a twitch of the mouth then cleared his throat the one thing i still dont like he said is westies girlfriend agreed gissing growled i might have a word with our young friend about that particular little stunt not until hes finished his work mike advised we need him focused we all need to be focused allan added which may mean missing the occasional dinner party gissing chided you want me to change my routine allans got a point mike interrupted on the surface it has to be business as usual at which moment allans mobile sounded it was a text message and he started to check it mike felt like swiping the phone from his friends grasp but doubted it would do much for team spirit gissing noting mikes conflict of feelings gave a lopsided smile and mouthed the words business as usual before pointing the revolver at the phone and pretending to shoot it to smithereens mike had suggested they take his quattroporte but allan had pointed out that it was the sort of car that got noticed so they travelled in his audi instead gissing in the front passenger seat mike in the back but leaning forward so that his face was level with the front seats gissing had proposed sitting in the back until allan reminded him that hed be driving tomorrow better if he got used to the view from the front you really have thought of everything gissing said probably not mike warned him hence this mornings recce there was no fast route to anywhere chunks of the city centre were being turned into tramlines meaning roadworks tailbacks and temporary traffic lights classic fm on the radio ostensibly to calm the nerves gissing asked if this was the same route theyd be taking tomorrow depends on whether you want to rendezvous at mine mike said or make your own way to the pickup point and wheres that allan asked gracemount were headed there now i dont know exactly where the vans going to be chibs going to text that to me first thing in the morning so we dont get to try the van out beforehand gissing sounded sceptical isnt that risky thats exactly what i said allan chipped in chib assures me itll do the job mike stressed hes an expert is he mike stared at the professor so far id have to say yes he is certainly compared to us then ill have to take your word for it mike reached into his pocket and brought out a couple of sheets of paper folded in four i printed this from the internet best route from the gracemount area to westies flat and from there to granton he handed them over to the professor saturday so therell be no rush hour to speak of but ive factored out leith walk because of the tram works allan was nodding appreciatively i didnt even know where gracemount was gissing muttered staring at the map and accompanying instructions thats why were headed there now mike explained hed already decided that gracemount drive just beyond the school would be their starting point for todays adventure when they arrived allan asked gissing if he wanted to swap places but received a grizzled shake of the head easier for me to learn the route if im a passenger which begs the question allan commented you need to be in the van while were in the warehouse but do you need to do any of the actual driving you think im not capable gissing had turned to fix allan with a glare i used to drive an mg sports car in my younger years what happened to it mike asked with a smile i didnt think it seemly for a man in his sixties one of the other staff members bought himself a porsche at fiftyfive and thats when i decided the mg had to go because the porsche trumped your car allan guessed not at all gissing barked but i could see for the first time how bloody ridiculous a man of advancing years looks in a sports car my quattroportes a sports car mike reminded him and youre just the right age for it gissing stated i think allan informed mike the professor wants to drive the van then he has my blessing mike conceded gissing just gave a loud sniff and went back to his studying from the school they headed back into town towards westies flat theyd be picking up him and his paintings tomorrow sat for a minute outside his tenement block and then when a warden started taking an interest signalled back into traffic and made for the mound and the new town what are you going to do when you retire allan asked the professor sell up and ship out gissing replied with the money i get from the house i can buy a cottage somewhere on the west coast fill it with books and art and enjoy the scenery wont you miss edinburgh ill be too busy enjoying walks along the beach got somewhere in mind mike asked ill put the homestead on the market first see how much cash itll give me to play with theyre going to miss you at the college allan said gissings silence did not dispute the fact mike cleared his throat you sure about the west coast a while back i thought you said youd be heading for spain mans entitled to change his mind gissing barked anywhere except this bloody city soon they were on inverleith row passing the botanic gardens and then ferry road glimpsing the firth of forth in front of them as they headed along starbank road allan asked if mike was sure this would be the quickest route in the morning maybe not the quickest but definitely the easiest google earth had given mike an aerial printout of the area around the warehouse the trading estate would be near deserted at weekends but was busy with lorries and vans this friday as lunchtime approached the drivers mike guessed would be thinking about a trip to the pub after work and maybe the football or shopping tomorrow and a liein on sunday he got the sudden and outrageous notion that maybe there was another wouldbe heist crew out there who had figured out what gissing had figured out and were making their own plans but as they drove at a measured pace past the gatehouse the cars parked kerbside were empty awaiting their owners at workdays end the only van was selling hot food to a small orderly queue the men smoked and joked and shuffled their feet mike had a craving for a cigarette only his second of the day allan pulled the audi into the nearest available space and stopped the engine mike asked him to turn the key again so the electrics were working then slid down the back window and lit a cigarette allan took one and slid his own window down can we stretch our legs or are you worried cctv might snap us mike asked im not sure allan conceded there are cameras he gestured in their direction but theyre pointed at gates and inner compounds i doubt any are picking us up but all the same youve been here before gissing asked more than once im guessing mike offered before opening his door and getting out after a moments thought allan followed but gissing stayed where he was mike leaned down and spoke to him through the window not joining us you forget michael im a weelkent face in these parts if one of the security men should decide he needs a burger or a bacon roll i might be recognised mike nodded his agreement while smoking allan was pretending not to be studying the building theyd just passed looks anonymous enough doesnt it he commented there were certainly no signs posted nothing to alert passersby to the multimillionpound contents of the grey concrete warehouse the guard in the gatehouse was reading a newspaper and snacking on a chocolate bar the fence was high and in good repair topped with razor wire but then the same could be said of all the other compounds in the vicinity one of which advertised itself as a doubleglazing showroom a sign on the fence warned of twentyfourhour security and guard dogs mike caught allans eye guard dogs on the night shift only a bloke in a van does the rounds mike nodded and concentrated on his cigarette again feeling peckish he asked allan do we really want greasy joe to be able to give cid our description mike shrugged his acceptance of this all the same he had sudden hunger pangs how exquisite to walk over there and strike up a conversation pistol tucked into waistband and criminal intent in ones mind it was almost unbearable irresistible and outrageously stupid another car a rover had pulled into a gap four cars ahead of the audi the man who emerged was overweight and wearing a pinstripe suit which like its owner had seen better days he locked up and was heading for the van which meant passing the two smokers he offered a nod of greeting and kept going but then paused and turned around nice motor chief thanks allan replied as the suit headed towards the snack van allan could see that the men in the queue were interested in the car now too he flicked his halffinished cigarette into the gutter thank christ we didnt bring the maserati he commented having said which he got back in behind the steering wheel mike stood his ground however finishing the length of his own cigarette before stubbing it underfoot only then did he slide on to the audis back seat reckon the mobile chippie will be there on a saturday he asked doubtful allan reasoned starting the engine not enough workers around here at the weekend to make it worth his while he moved off and turned the first available corner then braked again this is the spot for tomorrow he said we can see the gates but the guard cant see us gissing confirmed so we can watch the punters come and go mike added allan executed a threepoint turn and paused again at the chosen location facing the warehouse now making sure his instinct was right any cameras trained on the roadway none the route was a dead end meaning no passing traffic at the same time they had a clear view of anyone entering or leaving the compound it was about as perfect as they were going to get so youre parked here robert he intoned we go in and you give it a couple of minutes then start moving mike took up the commentary one of chibs lads will be in the gatehouse by then hell lift the barrier for you and i reverse up to the loading bay gissing recited after which mike tested him i wait came the response and if we dont start coming out within the quarterhour i drive off and leave you to your fates gissing gave a cold smile but do i need to pick up the gatehouse felon or do i abandon him too thatll be your call mike decided everybody happy with things as they stand i have a couple of concerns allan piped up from the driving seat chibs guys are going to come to this cold so long as we know what were doing that shouldnt be a problem it actually works in our favour if they dont know too much mike paused next concern please why isnt westie with us hell be here tomorrow too hes got his hands full finishing the utterson copy mike said but ill go over it with him later dont worry allan was nodding apparently satisfied but mike held eye contact with him in the rearview mirror until he was happy that his friend really was reassured i still cant believe were giving that bloody thug a painting gissing muttered well we are mike snapped back so get over it there was silence after that the three men staring at the warehouse their thoughts kept to themselves okay mike said eventually the only thing now is the getaway car i was planning to leave the maserati on marine drive but im not so sure the audis a safer bet allan agreed it wont pick up half the attention and youre willing to risk leaving it on marine drive for a few hours i dont see why not im assuming its not going to die on us its only just been serviced allan rubbed his hands down the steering wheel as if to assuage his cars feelings why dont we just rent some cars gissing asked best not to mike cautioned means leaving a paper trail is that what your friend calloway told you mike ignored this instead he had another question for allan you boots big enough to take the paintings check for yourself do you want to park it overnight or first thing in the morning early morning allan decided forecasts for rain so even the dogwalkers may be dissuaded ill meet you there then we can do breakfast at my place and then head to gracemount is it best if i meet up with you at gracemount gissing asked up to you professor mike told him ill probably do that then ill order a minicab in which case pay cash allan interjected dont use an account or anything that would leave one of those paper trails weve been talking about in fact mike added best take a bus into town and then transfer to a cab bloody hell gissing grumbled you both sound like the real thing thats because we are the real thing allan reminded him now fasten your seatbelts gentlemen its a short hop to marine drive but i dont want us getting pulled over by the traffic cops westie was a wreck but he was enjoying the challenge hed complained to alice about the lack of food in the fridge and booze in the cupboard shed reminded him that the nearest shop was only a twominute walk do i look like i can afford two minutes hed screamed at her if you stopped rolling joints every quarterhour you could take the whole sodding afternoon off shed snapped back im doing this for you remember yeah sure with which she had flounced out of the studio kicking an empty pizza box out of her way but the box had rattled meaning it wasnt quite empty two crusts with a trace of tomato paste on each a feast under the circumstances westie worked with music in the background bob marley john zorn jacques brel pj harvey the brel had been turned into an accidental drinks coaster at a party a while back as a result of which it skipped on some tracks not that westie minded he didnt speak french anyway the singers passion was what he wanted passion elegance and striving same wavelength he cooed to himself picking up yet another paintbrush grinding its hardened bristles against the edge of the easel then he had a smile to himself as he remembered his little secret if he looked closely he would see it staring back at him westie placed a finger to his lips sshhh he said and with a quiet chuckle he popped the last morsel of pizza crust into his mouth lit what remained of his previous spliff and got back into the swing ransome was reminded of the old cliché things were quiet too quiet hed tried tracking down the man called hate with no luck whatsoever nor had glenn fared any better despite every neerdowell in the city having been alerted to the search hate had to be staying somewhere outside edinburgh which was why ransome had widened the net to west and east lothian and even over the forth bridge to fife constabulary all to no effect plenty of campsites and caravan parks but so far ransome had drawn a blank there too hed then decided to start at the other end so to speak there had been a slight frisson in contacting interpol he was ashamed to admit it but it was true nevertheless full description possible hells angel affiliation scandinavian how much more did they need well a name for a start one of his email respondents had joked as a last resort ransome had contacted a mate at the scottish criminal records office though he doubted hate would have form in the uk i share your scepticism the mate had said but i can run it through a few databases here and there ransome had also gone into the shining star and asked staff there about chib calloway and michael mackenzie mackenzie they barely knew and calloway they were unwilling to discuss never causes us any trouble the manager had opined he will ransome had warned her liked the line so much hed repeated it to ben brewster back at the station ben had given a halfhearted laugh his eyes on the paperwork piling up on his colleagues desk ill get round to it ransome had chided him but calloway was consuming too many of his waking hours along with some of his sleep in his dreams he was chasing the gangster on foot through the streets of a sprawling city his prey seemed to know the place better than him and would lead him a merry dance through hotels and office blocks and factories at one point ransome had been chatting up a goodlooking woman in a hallway while slowly becoming aware that calloway had squeezed himself into a cupboard right next to them and was eavesdropping on the seduction jesus he needed a drink hed tried calling laura to see if she might be free after work so far hed left three messages he was seated at his desk in the cid unit at torphichen place and finding it hard to breathe it was as if all the oxygen was being sucked from the place hed been to the toilets splashed water on his face too much coffee he told himself too much stress his wife sandra had been studying cookery at night school thai chinese kashmiri fusion the nightly assaults of spiced concoctions previously unknown to him were playing havoc with ransomes digestion not that he could say as much to sandras face he kept a supply of rennies in his desk drawer but the indigestion tablets could do nothing about the pungent sweats he broke into occasionally if only he could open one of the windows his request for surveillance on calloway had been met by his bosses with a hoot of derision cutbacks were biting where was the money for overtime going to come from cid was shorthanded as it was ransome had taken it on the chin and walked out of the room with his pride intact hed even driven out one night to the newish housing scheme where calloway lived car in the driveway lights on in the living room no sign of either johnno or glenn glenn someone else who owed him a text a phone call a message glenn the gullible who would be easy meat for cid once calloway was behind bars always supposing johnno let him climb on to their old bosss throne unopposed glenn might be the clever one but johnno could boast a wide streak of viciousness with calloway gone he was bound to fancy his own chances who would chibs old team be the more willing to follow brain or brawn didnt much matter to ransome the whole setup was coming crashing down at goinghome time brewster suggested a quick one but a quick one was never quick for a start they couldnt drink anywhere near the station too strong a chance theyd be sharing the place with people they didnt want to meet villains fresh out of the holding cells scowls with a grudge so that meant a jaunt and ransome didnt feel much like a jaunt with his colleague doing anything at the weekend he asked instead trying to sound interested its doors open tomorrow im taking the girls to st bernards well and whats that when its at home its down by the water of leith used to be some sort of health spa kept under lock and key these days i meant whats doors open doors open day people get to go into lots of buildings ones theyre normally barred from masonic lodges and banks and stuff i think leith cop shops throwing open its doors sounds a riot its fun ellie says itll be good for the girls too well good luck with that ransome knew that brewster had two daughters just shy of adolescence and a wife who like sandra always got her way the girls were being educated privately which kept funds tight elsewhere as good a reason as any never to have kids not that sandra had shown much interest in that department ransome sat at his desk until the office had emptied he liked the cid suite when it was deserted and silent staring at his screen however he realised he couldnt think of a single thing he wanted to do there was the paperwork to be got through but it could wait maybe hed come in tomorrow or sunday a couple of hours would clear the backlog and give brewster something to think about on monday morning an hour and a half later ransome had been home eaten lamb peshwari changed clothes and was seated in his local on balgreen road there was a darts match and normally he would have pitched in but not tonight teams were wanted for a pub quiz but he steered shy of that commitment too he was thinking about chib calloway and all his money and michael mackenzie and all his money sure enough theyd been at school together a check of the records had confirmed as much and it could well be true as glenn said that theyd just bumped into one another but glenn could be pulling a flanker or chib could have lied to glenn mackenzie had made a mint from computers calloway had to want him for something either to fleece him or to bully him into paying protection or there was some skill calloway needed and mackenzie was privy to it hacking came to mind it was a stonecold fact that these days to rob a bank like first caly you didnt need to ramraid it or pick the locks you just had to chip away at its digital defences and that could be done from anywhere he held out another hour before phoning the station asked if anything had been happening he did this some evenings and on days off too hed call the central switchboard at bilston or the comms room at torphichen place its ransome here usually that was all he had to say they knew him well enough by now and would reel off the details cars nicked or torched breakins fights domestics dealers busted flashers collared shoplifters hunted down friday nights were second only to saturday in the number and variety of offences tonight was no different still on the lookout for a few stolen cars and vans ransome was informed two drunks ejected from a stag do on lothian road and taking umbrage and one poor old chap mugged down by the canal ransome wasnt surprised like a lot of edinburgh the canal was more dangerous than it looked probably kids from polwarth or dalry what was he doing down there he asked nothing suspicious far as we can tell he lives in the new flats by the old arnold clark showroom just bad luck then wrong place wrong time anything else he asked couple of shoplifters earlier on today and a hitandrun in shandon teenagers smoking dope in the meadows give it till later therell be the usual booze casualties and fights ransome gave a sigh and put away his phone hed promised sandra he wouldnt be late even though friday had always been his night out but looking around him he wondered why he bothered the darts players were going through the motions the quiz hadnt found enough bodies to make up the requisite teams nobody was playing the bandit ever since the smoking ban the place had been dying on its feet too quiet ransome muttered to himself finishing his pint and deciding enough was enough mike was sitting on his balcony smoking a cigarette when the phone rang he answered and there was a lengthy pause filled with static hiss then a voice he recognised michael you old bugger hows tricks mike smiled to himself and sat back down the past few days whenever his phone had started ringing hed assumed the worst westie had exploded or allan had gone running to the police for absolution but this was just his old business partner calling for a gloat where are you mike asked sydney of course what time is it tomorrow bit of a breeze out here on the deck but balmy with it what are you up to mike considered all the possible answers open to him not much he eventually said ive got half a cigarette left to smoke and then i was thinking about bed youre a desperate man michael isnt it friday night over there shouldnt you be out making merry and draining the spuds i could ship you over one of the girls i know here i bet you could so what have you been up to make me jealous just the usual parties more parties sun sand and surf chartering a boat later on today sounds awful there was laughter on the line yeah well you always did prefer the quiet life behind the scenes i mean so did you gerry what happened life happened mate it was the answer he always gave maybe itll happen to you some day in edinburgh good point you need to drag your sorry carcass down here how many times do i have to ask its on my list gerry and why not what exactly was keeping him in scotland then again what was waiting for him elsewhere hows your portfolio doing moved out of property just in time mike could hear his friend exhale noisily minerals and gold plus a smattering of new technologies you should get back into the game gerry the world needs brains like yours pickled you mean mike heard a female voice gerry covered the mouthpiece with his hand as he answered it who is she mike asked just someone i met its considered courteous to get a first name at the very least harsh michael there was a pause but fair followed by an explosion of laughter from the other side of the world suppose i better go see how i can keep her happy you do that come visit mike just picture the fun wed have night gerry morning cobber their usual signoff routine mike was still smiling as he placed the phone on his lap he took a deep breath and stared out across the city a jagged silhouette dotted with points of light what happened life happened wasnt that the truth of it he knew he could have told gerry about the heist probably would tell him about it some day if it turned out a success or even if it didnt come to that gerry would whoop and slap his thighs and shake his head in wonder same as he had when mike had walked into the office with news of the cash offer for their company from the consortium shouldnt you be out making merry who with now that his friends had become business associates what would chib calloway be up to bars and nightclubs wine women and song fine and dandy but mike needed a clear head for the morning needed to rehearse each and every step one final time at what point would there be no turning back hadnt that point already been reached what happened a door opened he told himself flicking the cigarette butt out into the night sky saturday was doors open day in edinburgh there was a light drizzle and a chill breeze but that wouldnt deter the sightseers for some locals doors open had become as welcome a part of their year as the various festivals they would plan an allday itinerary perhaps taking in the castle or freemasons hall the observatory or the citys main mosque sometimes sandwiches and a flask of tea would be packed the bulk of the buildings earmarked for public inspection stood in the city centre all of it dubbed a unesco world heritage site others lay further afield and included a power station and the sewage works not forgetting the seafront warehouse at granton where the national galleries and museums stored their overflow much of granton had yet to succumb to the modernisation evident in neighbouring leith potholed roads led past trading estates and abandoned factory units the grey north sea could be glimpsed now and again behind some of these fences and buildings reminding visitors that edinburgh had yet to make the most of its largely coastal location likewise the warehouse served as a reminder that the citys museums and public galleries while arguably making the most of their collections were forced by circumstances to hide the bulk of their holdings which is what happens professor gissing muttered when a culture gets greedy he was seated behind the steering wheel of the stolen van his disguise comprised sunglasses a flat tweed cap and a check shirt no corduroy today robert allan cruikshank had joked nervously when theyd rendezvoused in gracemount allan himself was now wearing a brown wig beneath his blue baseball cap and had forsaken his business suit for a pair of baggy denims and a shapeless sweatshirt the rest of the team sat in the back of the van mike mackenzie westie plus the four young tearaways supplied by chib calloway the teenagers had decided that the only disguise they would endure was a baseball cap with the brim tugged low over the eyes and a burberrystyle scarf to cover the lower half of the face all anyone had heard from them so far were grunts and guttural mutterings no names no pack drill which was just fine by mike he glanced at his watch again they were parked on the side road with the view of the gatehouse fifteen minutes had passed since the previous tour had made its way out of the warehouse allan counting twelve individuals forty minutes theyd been inside twentyminute gaps between tours meaning the next group would start gathering in around five minutes time limited to twelve names prebooked this time round seven of those names would be fake seated in the front of the van gissing and allan had a much better view of the arrivals and departures no one would contemplate coming here on foot too far from any form of public transport a couple of cabs had arrived to pick up prosperouslooking couples leading mike to wonder again what the odds were of anyone he knew turning up the prof would stay with the van but mike and allan would be in the warehouse most of the people who bothered with doors open were mildly curious attracted by the notion of passing through doors normally kept locked to the public but this was an extension of the national gallery chances were it would be artlovers who made the trek the very sorts of people mike and allan knew from the various exhibitions and auctions they attended gissing had been warned you dont step out of the van except in the direst straits but now mike was wishing the raid could be carried out without the need for either allan or himself saying anything or westie come to that artlovers usually visited all the college degree shows and voices could be identified as readily as faces there was a thin trickle of sweat running down mikes spine all these factors they hadnt taken into account if chibs crew had been briefed sooner they could have been the ones doing all the talking so far all theyd been doing was listening and mike was afraid that the conversation between gissing and allan had given too many clues theyd talked about building projects in the city and the financing of same allan sounding too knowledgeable then gissing had started rattling on about the various art and antiquity holdings showing he knew a fair bit about the topic how hard would it be for the teenagers to put two and two together if they were arrested at any point in the future might they try cutting a deal by telling what they knew was the fear of chib calloway enough to keep them silent in the long term one bonus the chippie van was locked tight for the weekend one potential witness out of the running thats the first two arriving now allan piped up mikes heart was pumping he could hear the blood singing in his ears he saw that westie had clamped his hands between his knees as if to stop them shaking hed done well though the vans first stop had been his flat where theyd loaded the fakes into the back gissing giving each of the eight a final onceover before declaring them first class adding that this was also the mark westie could be confident of getting for his degree show this had probably been meant to relax the student but it had the opposite effect on mike chibs lot seated in the van as the paintings were loaded and inspected now knew they had a student in their midst and probably someone who taught him too westie had declared himself shattered by the experience and he really didnt look too good pale and pasty and with eyelids drooping towards sleep mike had the feeling only caffeine was keeping him going last thing they needed was one of the team nodding off or losing his concentration during the actual heist heist the very word made mikes nerve endings jangle but here they were ready and waiting two more allan said only one to come there had been no sign of alice in westies flat mike had come across with the money shed asked for confirming that it was by way of an advance rather than extra cash and had then driven his maserati forwards and backwards over the video camera until it was flattened hed been sure to scatter its constituent parts around the city leaving nothing to chance but who was he kidding there were plenty of loose ends already with more to come he stared down at the pile of unframed paintings on the floor of the van as they were leaving westies hed pleaded that no one accidentally put a foot through one of them youll have me to answer to if you do westie had snapped at which chibs crew had just smiled to themselves the morning had gone well so far mike had rendezvoused with allan on marine drive at seven leaving the audi and travelling back to the penthouse in the maserati theyd toyed with their bacon sandwiches but managed orange juice and coffee before donning their disguises mike had burst out laughing when allan had walked into the living room wearing the wig and with contact lenses in place of spectacles got it in a junk shop allan had said of the wig feels a bit itchy at gracemount gissing had been waiting looking agitated and failing to blend in with his surroundings as he paced up and down mike had parked the maserati hoping no one would take a shine or a dislike to it five minutes later the van had arrived with its crew of four but no sign of calloway mike had exhaled in relief hed half expected the gangster to want to come along for the ride hed tried a bit of chat with the teenagers hoping maybe to break the ice until told that mr calloway had said they should do what they were told but otherwise keep their gubs shut nae offence one of them had added before clambering into the back of the van since when it had been grunts and gutturals and a steady stream of nicotine which now mike came to think of it was illegal smoking having been banned in all scottish workplaces vans included tuttut he thought to himself breaking the law he rubbed a hand across his face like everyone else he was wearing latex gloves bought from a chemists shop in bruntsfield thats the last one going in now allan suddenly piped up voice half an octave higher than previously twominute countdown mike stated lifting his watch to his eyes normally he wore a cartier other times he carried the antique pocket watch from bonnars but allan had suggested something not quite so showy it had cost less than a tenner from the same chemists shop as the gloves but still seemed to work though the second hand was now appearing to crawl around the dial could the battery be dying on him ninety seconds he was trusting allans head count didnt want any other visitors arriving after them sixty no backing out now he found himself glancing in westies direction westie was staring back at him grimfaced or maybe just zonked his disguise sunglasses and a woolly hat the sunglasses were just going on now thirty awright lads nae fuckups one of chibs kids was telling the rest of them nods and yet more grunts adjusting their baseball caps and scarves even gissing was nodding his agreement hands welded to the steering wheel coast clear mike asked hoping his voice sounded okay clear allan confirmed mike took a deep breath but couldnt bring himself to bark the command gissing half turning seemed to sense this and did it for him go the van doors opened with a creak seven of them moving briskly turning the corner coming into the gatehouse guards line of sight should have staggered it mike thought we look like a gang one of chibs crew was at the front doing everything but breaking into a jog mike had visualised their walk as something like the start of reservoir dogs calm collected going to work but his knees were only just locking the guard didnt seem too concerned however he had risen from his comfy little chair sliding open his window and reaching for his clipboard there was a peaked cap he usually wore but not today youre late he started chiding them if i can just have your names turning his head at the sound of his door being opened brought up short by the sight of the sawnoff appearing from under a jacket bundled back on to his chair by one of chibs lads the rest of them didnt pause kept walking down the path towards the warehouse door it was to the side of the main loading bay one of the museums vans was parked up but there was space to squeeze a new arrival next to it mike could hear a motorised click behind him and knew it would be the barrier starting to rise this is it he said hand gripping the door handle lets do it then he was told he pushed open the door and stepped inside it was just as expected a warehouse plenty of shelving lots of items smothered in hessian and bubble wrap guardroom to the right the five ontime visitors were being addressed by a member of the gallerys staff maybe it was his van outside he wore a suit and tie and had a name badge on his lapel one of chibs crew was already heading for the guardroom he walked straight in before lifting out his gun there were two guards inside seated at a bank of cctv screens mike watched through the window as their hands went up eyes fixed on the firearm drawing his own gun mike realised it was his turn to speak probably only ten or fifteen seconds had passed since hed opened the door but it felt like minutes he had rehearsed the words rehearsed the voice he would use gruffer than his own an instant snarl harking back to his roots up against that wall all of you the visitors hesitated thinking maybe some tasteless practical joke was being played the staff member had begun to remonstrate but one of chibs remaining two boys stuck the revolvers barrel against his ear dyou want your brains splattering the bastardin floor the curator didnt think so he lifted his hands in surrender and started backing towards the wall the tour party following his lead mike realised that allan and westie were already on the move striding into the warehouse proper mike walked into the guardroom ignoring the hostage situation and removed from an already open wallmounted box the keys he would need he had memorised the numbers helped by professor gissing who had also explained that the box was normally kept locked but not for doors open there was a split second where one of the numbers escaped him but he remembered it christ mike he told himself how hard can it be only three bloody numbers three vaults well not really vaults gissing had explained that they were more like walkin cupboards but with metal walls exiting the guardroom mike gave a nod and the visitors and their guide were marched inside it would be snug in there the surveillance cameras were being switched off the blinds closed no one would see what was happening less chance of disguises being noted physical descriptions tucked away for future reference it took mike longer than expected to find westie he thought he knew the layout but they had reckoned without the additional overflow from the museum on chambers street some of the pieces were huge and necessitated detours westie rolled his eyes when he saw him mike didnt bother apologising just tossed him the key then went in search of allan he tried to stay focused difficult when surrounded by so many treasures shelf upon shelf of artefacts only a few of which were identifiable celtic mayan greek roman no telling just how many cultures and periods were represented he passed a pennyfarthing bicycle and a vast swaddled shape that could have been an elephant you could spend weeks in here just as gissing said and not have exhausted your sense of wonder mike had a sudden thought this was his first and last visit he would never be able to come here again indeed it was doubtful the place would ever again open its doors to the general public allan was grinning through a sheen of sweat and had removed his wig to claw his fingers through his hair so far so good he asked mike felt that the wrong answer would turn his friend to dust he nodded and handed over the key while allan replaced the wig did you spot anyone you know in the tour group mike remembered to ask allan shook his head dislodging the hairpiece again wasnt really paying attention he apologised same here mike confided turning in search of his own vault it was number the key had a little tag to that effect gissing had warned him that the strong rooms were not sequential to one side of the warehouse lay the even numbers with the odd numbers on the opposite wall crossing the floor at a gap in the shelves mike worked his way down the numbered row tucking his pistol back into his waistband there were no other guards no stray visitors plenty of cameras but hopefully turned off what if chibs crew missed one allan with his wig off clawing at his scalp too late to be worrying about that vault he turned his key in the lock and pulled the heavy door open it creaked on its hinges only slightly there was an overhead light inside just as gissing had promised framed canvases dozens of them he knew which numbers he was looking for the paintings were stored sideon cocooned in two layers bubble wrap and cloth with labels hanging from them he slid out both paintings and tucked one under each arm before heading back the way hed come lord alone knew what he was leaving behind given time maybe he would have chosen differently he could feel the monboddo it was the smaller of the two if he had to sprint he knew which one hed drop first all was quiet behind the closed door of the guardroom he hoped chibs lads were behaving themselves one of them had opened the loading bay doors bringing natural light into the warehouse and the taste of fresh air and freedom mike could see that the van was waiting gissing had backed it into position and the rear doors were already standing open gissing was now in the back of the van he looked relieved at mikes arrival causing mike to wonder if there was a problem with allan and westie where the hell were they he handed gissing the first painting a cadell which the professor unwrapped while mike lifted its duplicate from the van floor gissing eased the canvas away from its frame his hands were practised and it took him only half a minute wooden wedges had been used to take up any slack and he removed these first his fingers strong and seemingly steady mike held his breath as the original frame was then placed around westies forgery it was a perfect fit and he let out a little hiss of satisfaction gissing pushed the wooden pieces back into place and examined the back of the original canvas seeking identifying marks on both it and its stretcher they couldnt hope to copy any he found not with any great skill they had only so much time but gissing pronounced it clean as he had predicted the markings and labels tended to appear on the frame rather than the actual artwork this was another reason why theyd opted for smaller canvases less chance of crossbracing which meant one surface fewer that could hold identifying details get it wrapped gissing growled already starting work on the second masterpiece the monboddo portrait mike heard a noise and turned round to see allan and westie emerging from the warehouse toting three paintings apiece how could he have been so stupid that was why theyd taken longer than him three each to his two no trouble he asked voice fluttering slightly no trouble allan confirmed sweat dripping from his chin mike entertained a wild thought could forensics take dna from sweat he didnt think now was the time to ask westie was already starting work unwrapping one of his own canvases like gissing he knew exactly what he was doing knew too that time was against them no telling how early the next party of visitors might be mike glanced around the side of the van towards the gatehouse there was no sign of the guard he must be crouched on the floor in his place sat chibs kid and he was wearing the peaked cap a nice touch but mike doubted it would fool anyone close up not with the scarf still in place across the bottom half of the teenagers face back at the van mike saw that gissing was breathing hard he still had his wits about him however and reminded them to make sure the labels were showing when they reswaddled their copies theyve got to look just the same as they were we know westie complained adding i still say we could be doing this elsewhere mike had heard the argument before but had sided with allan first time round no alarm would be raised until they were off the premises that was when time really started to be against them best to make the switch now meaning a cleaner and faster getaway later when the cops were on to them three down allan intoned watching westie and gissing at work mike checked his watch again twelve minutes since theyd first walked into the warehouse it was going like clockwork no better than that it was going like digital he found himself forcing a smile and gave allan a pat on the back bit early for that gissing snarled wiping perspiration from his eyes back inside the pair of you and do the final check final check vault doors left wide open and keys in locks there would be trace evidence westie had said as much knew it from all the cop shows he watched with alice a stray hair maybe or fibres from their clothing faint prints from their shoes but the less they left the better standing together in the middle of the warehouse mike and allan shared a nod then allan made for the van again while mike opened the door to the guardroom a gun was aimed straight at him lowered once its owner recognised him mike held up three fingers meaning three minutes the hostages were crouched on the floor hands on their heads and eyes screwed shut the cctv screens were blank back at the van allan was in the passenger seat wiping his face with a handkerchief westie was wrapping another painting gissing was holding a hand to his chest but nodded to let mike know he was all right really just a bit breathless sit back mike told him ill drive he got into the driving seat and checked the key was in the ignition how are we he asked allan it would be nice to leave right now mike heard a noise and peered into the rearview mirror three figures emerging jumping in the back the van doors creaked shut and mike gunned the engine something was handed to him from the back a key locked them all in the guardhouse he was told thats great mike said dropping the key into the vans ashtray but unless you took away their mobile phones its not going to slow things down the van juddered towards the gatehouse not too fast gissing warned he was right last thing they wanted right now was to announce themselves to passing traffic or a cruising patrol car mike paused long enough at the gatehouse to pick up the final member the kid had brought the peaked cap with him causing his friends to laugh that stays in the van mike warned them allan was making a show of studying him mr professional he purred get going one of the crew yelled from the back in the wing mirror mike could see the guard emerging from his lair he stepped on the accelerator shouldve thumped him somebody was saying couldnt do it came the reply guys a hearts fan calendar fanzine the works he got the number plate allan commented much good itll do him mike turned towards westie thats why we did it this way round westie just sniffed saying nothing they drove in silence after that listening for sirens shouldve brought a cb one of the kids eventually piped up couldve tuned it to the pigs frequency mike and allan shared a look something else they hadnt thought of mikes senses seemed heightened to an incredible degree the sound of the rutted tarmac under the vans wheels was amplified his nose was picking up the aroma of hops from a distant brewery there was a tingling in his blood and a tang of adrenalin in his mouth this he thought is how it feels to be alive it was as if his nervous system had been fitted with a supercharger allans audi was where theyd left it there were no other vehicles to be seen except an antiquated rover its sills eaten by rust the rain had grown heavier dissuading the dogwalkers the unframed paintings were transferred to the audis capacious boot one of chibs lads went to close the van doors but mike told him to leave them open we were in a hurry remember he explained the rover was for the four teenagers its ignition key was tucked in beneath one of the front wheels mike held out a hand for shaking but the four young men just stared at it then one of them asked for the guns these were handed over mikes with great reluctance and placed in the rovers boot before they drove off he checked that the peaked cap had been left as ordered in the van allan gave a halfhearted wave lovely bunch of lads he commented watching the car roar off gissing was already in the audi and westie with him lets go gissing said hang on mike said heading back to the van he lifted out one of the bundles and dropped it on the roadway back in the audi gissing asked for an explanation the robbers panicked and fled mike obliged just as they were starting the transfer adds a touch of drama dont you think westie was punching numbers into a mobile phone hed asked to be the one to make the call the phone was a gift from calloway it had been in the box with the guns chib had promised it was untraceable and warned it only had about two minutes credit on it westie took a deep breath and gave an exaggerated wink to all around him then he started speaking is that the police his voice had reverted to its workingclass fife roots listen ive just seen the strangest bloody thing down by marine drive some guys at the back of a white van looked like they were dumping bodies or something i think i spooked them but i got the number plate he reeled it off ended the call and gave a little bow from the waist dumping bodies mike echoed youre not the only one who can improvise westie wound down his window and flung the mobile into a roadside ditch hey guys allan said can we take these bloody things off now he meant the latex gloves mike nodded his agreement they were safe they were on their way theyd done it theyd done it seven unframed paintings sat arranged on the two sofas and two easy chairs in mikes living room the three men stood gazing at them champagne flutes in their hands they had got rid of their disguises and had used mikes bathroom to freshen up sluicing off sweat and dust and the smell from the gloves allan was still scratching his scalp intermittently fearing beasties might have relocated there from the hairpiece the maserati had not been vandalised during its short stay in gracemount but fingerprints on the windows showed where kids had been peering in at its interior theyd dropped westie at his flat reminding him yet again to keep his chosen painting hidden hed asked mike about the rest of his money itll be in your account today or tomorrow mike had assured him westie had actually seemed reluctant to get out of the car smiling and telling everyone how well it had gone strikes me i should have held out for two hed grumbled dont go getting gold fever young man gissing had growled westie had raised his hands as if in surrender i was making a joke trying for a bit of light relief the looks on your faces youd think we were standing graveside get some sleep mike had told him and spend a quiet sunday with alice no splurging remember no splurging westie had echoed eventually opening his door and getting out his painting tucked beneath his arm i like your two better allan was now telling gissing as the two of them studied the miniexhibition tough the professor answered with a thin smile what about calloways utterson allan asked ill see it gets to its new owner mike stated but can we trust him allan countered he pressed a finger to one of his eyelids trying to still the pulse that had started there robert talked about gold fever isnt calloway the most likely to start wanting what weve got hell be fine mike tried reassuring his friend you can leave him to me he knows the painting has to be kept secret allan persisted he knows mike said adding an edge to his voice he reached down to the coffee table and picked up the tv remote switched on the plasma screen and started flicking through the channels looking for news may be a bit early allan said rubbing at his reddened eyes although he loathed them he was wearing disposable contact lenses part of his disguise mike ignored him really he wanted them all gone so he could concentrate on the portrait of monboddos wife hed only held it for a few moments gissing was making a circuit of the room hed hardly looked at his own picks and was instead studying some of mikes saleroom purchases ive just had a thought allan said what if somebody got there first to marine drive i mean what if they walked off with an armful of westies beautiful forgeries then the copsll pick them up and think theyve got their thief mike answered true allan seemed to agree his flute was empty but mike had decided one bottle of champagne was enough there was the journey home to consider at least as far as allan was concerned the professor would need a lift too at some point no way mike was calling him a taxi not when the passenger would be carrying an expensivelooking painting under his arm the words breaking news had begun scrolling along the foot of the screen above the newsreaders shoulder there was an old photo of edinburgh castle this changed into a map of the city zeroing in on the granton area here we go mike muttered to himself now the fun and games really begin he started to turn up the volume but a mobile phone was ringing it was gissings so mike switched the tv to mute instead when gissing offered him a smile mike nodded back they knew who it would be at least they knew who they hoped it would be gissing placed a finger to his lips in warning then answered the call professor robert gissing he intoned by way of introduction then after a few seconds yes im watching it now on my tv at home absolutely shocking did they take anything a slightly longer pause during which he made eye contact only with the window and the darkening view beyond it i see but how can i help jimmy allisons your man for gissings flow was interrupted he made a show of raising an eyebrow as he listened how awful nobodys safe on the streets these days alasdair confirmation as far as mike was concerned that gissing was in conversation with the head of the national galleries of scotland alasdair noone yes of course gissing was saying now soon as i can alasdair no ill make my own way there half an hour mike did a swift calculation yes from the professors home to marine drive was just about feasible in thirty minutes oh did you gissing glanced in mikes direction well ive been having some problems with it or maybe i had the tv up too loud sorry about that yes yes im on my way alasdair bye gissing ended the call and his eyes met mikes again he tried your landline mike guessed you didnt answer so he called your mobile but then you went and told him you were at home he wont make anything of it gissing assured him but the police might allan commented tiny details inconsistencies hes got enough on his plate gissing persisted id lay a hundred pounds its already forgotten he looked at his watch well id better be on my way give it a few minutes mike warned him its only fifteen minutes by taxi to marine drive from here good point the professor conceded and you need to relax a little maybe a small whisky dont want them smelling hooch on their experts breath ill fetch you some water mike walked into the kitchen allan following close on his heels its going to be all right isnt it allan asked placing his empty flute on the spotless worktop mike didnt think it was the last time he would hear this question from his friend so far there hasnt been a hitch thats down to good planning the rest is all about holding our nerve mike offered a wink and poured the water into a tall glass which he carried back into the living room gissing was popping two square tablets from their foil packaging heartburn he explained accepting the drink did alasdair say how mr allison was doing mike enquired gissing chomped down on both tablets hes out of hospital but theres concussion and bruising he glared at mike i think maybe your friend went a wee bit far just far enough to stop his services being called for mike answered when youre finished at marine drive get a cab to bring you here and either allan or me will run you home his own mobile was sounding not a call as such a text message from chib calloway herd my boiz did gud need collateral asap r u near a tv mike decided to ignore it collateral the very word chib had used when taking that phone call good honest collateral the news had shifted to the aftermath of some flooding in england the journalist at the scene said something about the locals fearing theyd got in too deep gissing was popping a third tablet hands unsteady while allan rubbed at the pulse in his eyelid and hopped from one foot to the other like a hyperactive kid in too deep nobody knew the half of it di ransome was seated at his desk in the empty cid suite when he heard the news the radio had been providing him with background music and blather it was some local station mixing golden oldies with traffic and weather ransome had been in the office for a solid two hours clearing an inch from his intray he was due to appear in court three times over the next two weeks and needed to bone up on his evidence the amount of time cops uniform and cid wasted in the citys sheriff and high courts was a scandal and often at the last minute some plea deal was done meaning they didnt have to go into the witness box anyway one officer he knew had earned himself an open university degree doing most of his studying and essaywriting while seated outside various courtrooms waiting to say his piece ransome was spending an idle minute wondering what subject he would study given the chance when the radio dj announced a breakin at an industrial site in granton ransome had started to tune out until he heard the words valuable artworks what the hell were those doing in a warehouse in granton of all places holdings belonging to several citybased museums staff and visitors threatened with guns not known as yet which items are missing artworks and guns guns and artworks ransome phoned laura at the auction house but there was no answer same story with her mobile cursing under his breath he headed out to the car park it took him only twenty minutes to reach marine drive it was one of the things he liked about the city nowhere was more than half an hour from anywhere else felt more like a village sometimes which was why his mind was already turning a warehouse heist artworks stolen and edinburghs premier gangster having so recently started showing an interest in paintings he remembered calloway that day in the national gallery drinking tea with his old school pal michael mackenzie mackenzie the computer wizard the art collector they made an odd couple and no mistake the white transit had been cordoned off with blueandwhitestriped crimescene tape uniformed officers were diverting what traffic there was away from the immediate vicinity a forensics team was busy at work dusting surfaces taking photos a detective inspector called hendricks seemed to be calling the shots causing ransome to wince a little as he got out of his car he considered hendricks a serious rival in the promotion stakes same sort of age good track record personable and presenting himself well to public and top brass alike hed been in the same intake as ransome at tulliallan police college more years ago now than ransome cared to calculate there had been a special challenge for all new recruits raising money for charity despite ransomes best endeavours hendricks had won by a country mile hosting a sportsmens dinner in stirling and attracting a couple of highprofile footballers to the event as speakers only later did ransome discover that hendricks uncle was chairman of a premier league club strings had obviously been pulled there was never any animosity between the two men ransome knew better than to get on his rivals wrong side in public there were displays of professional courtesy and even occasional collaboration besides with ransome stationed at west end and hendricks across town at gayfield square they met only infrequently ransome wondered now whether hendricks had been on call or had barged his way on to the inquiry he was dressed in a sharp suit with a newlooking shirt and tie maybe hed been doing the same as ransome working unpaid hours behind his desk in the hope of snaring something interesting a tv crew was already in situ along with radio and print journalists dogwalkers had come up from the beach to spectate the media were in a sort of scrum comparing notes one of them recognised ransome and came bounding over asking if there was anything he could add to the story ransome just shook his head highprofile case and it just had to fall into hendricks lap ransome what are you doing here hendricks was trying to make the query sound matey hed slipped his hands into his trouser pockets and was coming towards ransome with a spring in his step neat hair trimmed moustache but the slipon shoes looked cheap ransome consoled himself with that im nosy gavin you know me how are things at gayfield square a damn sight quieter since youknowwho retired look good to see you and all that but id better he gestured with his thumb over his shoulder busy man lots to do important man ransome nodded his understanding dont mind me gavin just dont get in the way okay adding a little laugh at the end as though he meant it as a joke when in fact he was being deadly serious which left ransome bristling and trying to think of a comeback as hendricks moved away again he took a couple of steps closer to the action the van doors were wide open and one of the paintings lay on the ground it had come loose from its wrapping and ransome could make out an ornate goldcoloured frame he kept staring at it as one of the sceneofcrime officers took a few more snaps i hear tell the soco commented its by someone called utterson never heard of him its signed in the bottom corner one of the reporters says its worth a couple of hundred grand my house didnt cost half that from what little ransome could see it was a bleak country landscape maybe thirty inches by twenty hed seen better stuff on the walls of his local pub whos that hendricks is talking to he asked the soco looked over towards where hendricks was in close conversation with a short bald worriedlooking man he shrugged and shook his head so ransome wandered back towards the reporter whod recognised him and asked the same question youre not in the loop then the reporter teased ransome just stared him out hes head of the national galleries the man eventually admitted and the guy just turning up ransome followed the direction of the pointed finger a black cab had drawn up its passenger emerging he runs the citys museums and thats one you owe me inspector ransome ignored this focusing instead on the new arrival he was taller and a bit calmer or more resolute than the galleries boss whose hand he shook before giving a consoling pat on the shoulder ransome edged forward until he was within eavesdropping range we think they must have been making the transfer hendricks was explaining for the benefit of the newcomer a member of the public phoned it in he probably disturbed them they lost their bottle and fled the scene in a hurry luckily for you alasdair the museums boss told his colleague with another apparently sympathetic pat alasdair seemed to resent this and shuffled half a yard further away from his tormentor we cant be sure yet if everythings been recovered alasdair said rubbing a hand across his forehead witnesses say there were only about three or four of them doing the actual taking hendricks offered the others were holding the hostages whole thing was over in ten or fifteen minutes they cant have got away with much full inventory needed the museums boss was asking alasdair wasnt one about to happen anyway youre not off the hook donald alasdair snapped back they could have walked off with anything most of the paintings are kept in the vaults but the majority of your stuff is just lying there on the open shelves especially with the influx from the chambers street refit the look on donalds face seemed to cheer alasdair up a little it was as if a load had been lifted not just colleagues ransome thought to himself but rivals too its a good point sir hendricks was telling donald the sooner we get that inventory underway the better meantime can i ask how many people knew about the warehouse and its contents the whole bloody city the man called donald grumbled this is doors open day remember only day of the year they could just waltz in and take whatever they liked he stabbed a finger towards the contents of the van but mostly paintings from what i can see vaults or no vaults it looked as though alasdair was about to remonstrate but their attention was diverted by the diesel chugging of yet another taxi as it arrived on the scene ah said alasdair here comes our resident expert he strode towards the cab and yanked open its back door handshakes were exchanged after which he led the distinguishedlooking gentleman towards the small group in the interim hendricks had noticed ransome again and given him the benefit of a practised glower but ransome didnt think his colleague would want to cause a scene not in front of the edinburgh establishment donald was even wearing a new club tie so he held his ground our chief curator was the victim of a street attack near his home last night alasdair was explaining but were grateful that professor gissing head of the college of art and no mean expert himself has made his services available thought youd retired robert donald was saying shaking hands gissing said nothing by way of reply but allowed himself to be introduced to di hendricks as the conversation continued gissing seemed to realise he was the object of scrutiny from beyond the immediate circle he gave a surreptitious glance in ransomes direction ransome turning away a moment too late i was sorry to hear about jimmy the professor was saying ransome remembered hearing about the mugging guy down by the canal turned out the victim was an art expert well well well and now here was gissing professor robert gissing friend to michael mackenzie one of lauras three musketeers hed been at the auction house the same day as calloway and all of them had ended up in the wine bar just along the street oh it was a small city all right was edinburgh staring at hendricks back ransome knew he was going to keep it all to himself all the various connections and coincidences the personalities permutations and probabilities alasdair was explaining to gissing that they needed to verify the identities and authenticity of the abandoned paintings and also ensure they were undamaged but well need to dust them for prints too hendricks was saying the thieves may have got careless not a chance the friendly soco next to ransome muttered for his benefit that vans as clean as a whistle have you idd it yet ransome asked in an undertone the soco shook his head itll have been stolen to order though you mark my words probably changed the plates and all ransome nodded in agreement his gaze fixing once again on professor gissing the mans arms were folded as he listened to hendricks might just have been concentrating but to ransome the body language was all about defensiveness maybe theyd fail to find any fingerprints hed seldom known the socos to be wrong but something was whispering a name into his ear the name of charles chib calloway not too many snooker halls left calloway was telling mike mackenzie i mean proper ones fullsized slate tables know how much they weigh you need to check that your floor can stand up to them the gangster was switching on some of the lights in the cavernous yet mustysmelling room mike could make out six tables but none of them in the best of health two were covered with gashed and stained dust sheets while the remaining four had suffered nicks rips and rudimentary repairs to their green baize a game seemed to have been abandoned on one of them mike rolling the pink ball towards the centre pocket whys this one shut on a saturday evening he asked overheads chib explained costs me more to run than i get back i could always put pool tables in instead maybe a few slot machines he wrinkled his pugnacious face but ill probably end up selling it some developer can turn it into apartments or one of those huge superpubs why not do it yourself with my reputation chib gave a cold chuckle what do you reckon the chances are of me getting planning permission never mind a licence you could bribe a few councillors chib had picked up a cue but found it wanting it rattled when he replaced it in the rack maybe a few years back mike things have changed or set up a front company so no one knows youre the one in charge chib gave another chuckle warmer this time listen to yourself michael maybe we should swap places eh you seem to be thinking more like a criminal every day maybe thats because i am a criminal so you are chib agreed with a slow nod and how does it feel mike shrugged ask me again further down the line chib had made a circuit of the table he now gestured towards the package under mikes arm mike laid it flat on the dusty green baize and carefully undid the brown paper he had wrapped it himself hoping to make it look less like one of the works recovered from marine drive just in case he was pulled over and asked to open his boot chib had sent two more texts before mike had decided to get their transaction out of the way leaving allan in the penthouse awaiting gissings return an extremely good example he told the gangster of lateperiod utterson id still rather have had something by jack the vee but chib took his time studying the painting running a finger along the edges of the canvas not very big is it they look bigger when theyre framed they do mike agreed speaking of which i know i know i cant go taking it into a shop tell them i want a nice new surround for it and i cant put it up anywhere it might be noticed he affected a disappointed sigh hardly worth the effort then he smiled and looked at mike eyes twinkling my youngsters were okay did as they were told they were great the shooters worked a treat we handed them all back afterwards i know chib paused for a moment folding his arms had half a mind you might hang on to yours seemed to be forming quite an attachment to it ive still got it if you want it tempting mike confessed but better all round if they just disappear agreed so nobody got hurt eh it was a piece of cake mike found himself laughing as he ran a hand through his hair if i could do it again id grab twice as much getting a taste eh mikey we couldnt have done it without you chib picked up his utterson and pretended to study it i still say you could just have swapped the paintings no need for the stunt with the van how would it have looked if wed gone into that warehouse and come out again without anything being missing this way they think theyve got back what was taken and that means theyll be relieved rather than suspicious thinking more like a criminal every day chib repeated so what happens now theyve got the professor at the scene hell be in the process of verifying that the recovered paintings are the originals and theyll take his word for it just like that theyve no reason to doubt him besides which hes the only expert theyve got if id known how gullible these sods were id have done something like this long ago you didnt know someone like westie though the plan depended on him and it was the profs idea to bring him in will gissings nerve hold do you think chib placed the painting back on the green baize hell be fine chib seemed to ponder this you did well mike makes me wish wed teamed up years back the actual plan was gissings remember chib ignored this what about your other mate allan mike watched chib nod allans fine sure about that see the thing is this were connected now arent we and out of the whole lot of us the only one i trust is me he stabbed a finger towards himself and then mike i need to be sure none of you lot will start blabbing if the cops come asking wont happen mike stated i dont even know this westie but in my experience students are always bad news thing is he doesnt know anything about you so where does he think the shooters and my lads came from out of thin fucking air he doesnt seem to be the inquisitive sort mike decided that chib need not know about alice you dont what the utterson i just thought youd be more excited there was a sound at the door a thin smile spread across chib calloways face now im excited he said then he sniffed and rubbed his nose seeing how youve developed a taste mike i thought you should be part of this mike started to get a bad feeling part of what but chib was ignoring him and heading for the door he unlocked it and in stepped a very tall ponytailed and tattooed man incongruous in a powderblue suit and shoes with no socks chib led this new arrival over to the table where mike was pulling his shoulders back trying for a bit more height and heft this is mr hate chib was saying by way of introduction hate id like you to meet the friend i was telling you about you could even call him an associate of mine mike mackenzie the way chib said his name told mike something was going on the man called hate meantime ignored him altogether giving mike the chance to study him more closely there was a dotted line across his throat and when he rested his meaty hands against the edge of the snooker table mike saw that the word hate had been tattooed along both sets of knuckles this is the collateral hate was saying ignoring any niceties this is it chib agreed and i am supposed to believe it is worth how much the accent was scandinavian but mike couldnt place it more exactly mike here is the expert in that department chib was saying mikes eyes bored into his but chib was far from being fazed it is a piece of shit the giant concluded a piece of shit worth around two hundred k on the open market mike stated hate gave a snort and picked up the utterson none too gently mike feared the stretcher might snap the big man turned it over examining it collateral mike was thinking hed suspected as much and this had to be the viking johnno had mentioned that day in the car calloway had no interest in the painting not really instead he was about to hand it over to this monster a monster who now had mikes name and would forever link him to the painting if it turned out not to be worth the figure quoted would things turn nasty he knew now that this was why chib had made sure hate knew his name why the gangster had wanted mike here when the deal went down were connected now hadnt chib said so himself and if flak was coming chib wanted mike as his human shield mike mackenzie what the hell have you got yourself into hate meantime was sniffing the surface of the painting actually sniffing it doesnt smell so old he commented none of that chib chided him with a wag of the finger you think id try to pull a cheap stunt get someone to verify it if you dont believe me mike here knows someone at the college of art christ now hes trying to drop the professor in it too mike held up a warning hand the painting is stolen im sure you know that already watch tonights news if you need persuading but the only way anyone anyone will find out is if it starts to be seen by people so i am supposed to trust you hates eyes were milky blue the pupils tiny shards of darkness you could go online mike found himself suggesting check other works by the artist hes pretty famous find out what theyve been fetching recently at auction samuel utterson thereve been exhibitions books about him hate looked from one man to the other two hundred thousand pounds he intoned slowly dont go getting any ideas chib said wagging his finger again and forcing out a short laugh its just temporary security the cash is coming hate fixed him with a gaze youve still got your men out looking for me havent you otherwise youd be a fool but they wont find me mr calloway and if they did theyd soon wish they hadnt understood chib said hate turned his attention back to the painting he was still grasping and mike feared he was about to punch a hole through it but he placed it back on the table instead actually with a reasonable attempt at gentleness which told mike the man was at least halfway convinced and started to wrap the brown paper around it so were cool chib asked it was only because of the relief evident in his voice that mike realised how nervous the gangster had been ever since hates arrival that is something i will need to ask my client hate was tucking the package beneath his arm no way i can let you walk out of here if we dont have an understanding chibs relief it seemed to mike had quickly turned to bravado hate just stared him out then youll have to stop me he offered heading for the door chib looked around him his eyes alighting on the rack of snooker cues but when he glanced in mikes direction mike gave a shake of the head before calling out a question towards the giants back why english the man stopped and half turned his head your tattoos the word hate mike explained why english the only reply was a shrug of the shoulders before the door was yanked open and slammed shut again mike waited for the echo to die then nodded towards the snooker cues maybe if theyd been ninemillimetre i wouldnt trust a ninemil to stop that fucker chib rubbed a hand down his face in your line of work you do meet the most congenial people not much worse than the ones you meet in any other business that may be true mike conceded and both men laughed releasing the tension in the room by the way mike added whatever it is i dont want to know clever sod like you mike my guess is youve already worked it out i owe some money on a deal the utterson buys me time i know it happens with the mafia and old masters well now it happens in edinburgh too you want a drink there was a bar area in one corner chib unlocked one of the cupboards and pulled out a halfempty bottle of whisky and two tumblers mike brushed dust from a stool with the palm of his hand before sitting down in a funny way he offered it actually makes sense chib drained his glass and exhaled what does if the paintings not in your hands the police havent a chance of finding it in your possession thats true maybe theyll try running hate in instead chib gave a snort and poured himself another sure you dont want to swap professions i dont have a profession thats right youre a man of leisure unless you fancy gentleman thief on your passport instead this was strictly a oneshot deal chib mikes mobile was vibrating he lifted it from his pocket and checked the screen it was robert gissing the prof he explained to chib answering the call how did it go robert im only just finishing up gissing was keeping his voice low obviously there were people in the vicinity remember mike said when you order a cab make sure you give your home address as the destination just in case anyones listening once youre on your way you can tell the driver youre headed to mine instead im not a fool mike whats wrong mike had sensed something in the professors voice the whisky froze halfway to chib calloways mouth are you with our friend gissing was asking as arranged hes happy with the goods never mind that im sending you a snap bloody amazing things these camera phones i think i got it without him knowing got what mike asked eyes narrowing the photo your phone does accept photos whats this all about robert i just want to know if weve got a problem chib was by mikes side now listening in he smelled faintly of sweat beneath the aftershave and the whisky i didnt like the way he was looking at me gissing was saying get back to me in five the call ended mike stared at his phones blank screen is that meant to be a dig at me chib asked what i didnt like the way he hell no its just that he has something he wants us to see dont tell me the paints still wet on your student pals efforts mikes phone trilled a photo was coming through chib peered at the screen as mike held it in the space between them the professor had a quality mobile hed used it to take pictures for a recent photography exhibition at the college highest possible resolution zoom the works mikes own phone was the latest model too with a nice big screen the photo itself appeared in three horizontal chunks of download it showed the profile of a man taken from the waist up hed been shot from some distance and using the full extent of the zoom meaning the picture was slightly blurred all the same chib let out a hiss of air thats ransome he growled hes cid been chasing me all across town since way back is he the one you thought was following you the day we went to arthurs seat mike watched chib calloway nod slowly well hes now showing an unhealthy interest in professor gissing mike gnawed at his bottom lip for the best part of a minute while chib explained that ransome had tailed him on and off for a while reason he always took evasive action when driving anywhere in the city thought by now maybe the detective had given up the fight been a while since chib had clocked him but then again i knew he was trying to tail me that day we bumped into one another at the gallery so he might have seen us there mike asked not really expecting an answer thats more than a little worrying he stared at ransomes picture for a while longer then called gissing back houston he began by saying we do indeed have a problem the man who called himself hate had brought a laptop with him on his trip to scotland in fact he never travelled anywhere without it though he was careful to keep nothing on its hard drive that the police of any country he visited might find interesting with the painting by samuel utterson the possibly worthless painting stowed in the rental cars boot he fired up the laptop and got to work accessing the internet and running a search on the artist if he failed to be convinced he might visit a bookshop or library seeking further information the man back in the snooker hall mackenzie if that was his real name had warned that the painting was stolen well that wasnt hates problem was it his problems only started if it turned out to be worth less than calloway owed hate needed to know and that might well mean asking someone in fact it would mean showing them the painting which could bring further potential problems hate had already texted his client with news that he had taken receipt of the utterson like him theyd never heard of the artist again not an insurmountable problem money was money a search of the bbcs regional news site showed that a warehouse belonging to the national galleries of scotland had been broken into earlier that day but a number of paintings had been recovered afterwards it was not known if anything was still missing hate tugged at his ear lobe as he considered his options he could feel the little hole where one of his earrings usually rested when off duty he preferred denims and a tshirt but knew that the suit unnerved people or rather the combination of the suit and the man inside it unnerved people hate couldnt wait to get home he disliked edinburgh it was all surface a kind of street con showing visitors one thing while easing the cash from their wallets without being noticed all the same at least the galleries and museums were free of charge hate had visited a number of them looking at paintings hed hoped the exercise might pay off hoped it would help him spot a fake but all that seemed to happen was members of staff followed him round as if they couldnt quite believe what they were seeing perhaps they were expecting him to take a knife or razor to one of their precious canvases calloway the first time hed mentioned the possibility of collateral to hate hadnt said where the painting would come from hadnt mentioned an artists name hate didnt recall utterson from any of the galleries hed visited but he knew now from the internet that the man was collectable sothebys christies bonhams they had all sold examples of his work in the past couple of years the highest price paid at auction had been three hundred thousand pounds so maybe the man called mackenzie hadnt been exaggerating on a whim hate decided to run a search on mackenzies name too and found almost as many hits as for samuel utterson himself one of which took hate to a magazines website and photos of mackenzies penthouse apartment there looked to be some nice paintings on the walls and it was the same guy no doubt about it there was a small photo of him a man of wealth and taste as hates favourite song might have put it hate tugged on his ear lobe again he was going to have to rethink his opinion of charles chib calloway the man might be a boor an oaf an ugly lowlife specimen but he had a good class of associate laura was at a dinner party in heriot row the host had just sold two paintings at lauras auction but neither had achieved the top end of estimate as a result laura had been expecting to have her ear bent but thankfully all anyone could talk about was the heist its audacity its stupidity and how close a call it had been she had thought about asking mike mackenzie to be her date for the evening but had been unable to summon up quite enough courage as a result the host and hostess had placed her next to a lawyer whose divorce as it turned out was still a fresh and painful wound to be anaesthetised only with alcohol the call on her mobile had come as blessed relief towards the end of the pudding course shed mumbled an apology for not having had the foresight to turn the thing off then had plucked it from her shoulder bag stared at the screen and told the room that she had to take it walking briskly into the hallway shed expelled breath noisily before holding the phone to her ear what can i do for you ransome not interrupting anything i hope actually you are a dinner party im hurt i didnt make the guest list im not hosting i could still have chaperoned she let out another sigh for his benefit is it anything important ransome just wanted to pick your brains its to do with the granton warehouse im guessing youll have heard laura raised an eyebrow youre working on that she had to step aside as one of the liveried waitresses hired for the evening from an agency wheeled a cheese trolley towards the dining room im not alone ransome was saying your friend professor gissing is lending a hand too hes hardly my friend but he is some sort of authority depends on the period laura saw the hostesss head peer around the doorway and nodded to let her know she was nearly finished ive got to go ransome could we meet later for a drink not tonight other plans eh whos the lucky man bye ransome laura replied ending the call she entered the room again and made another apology the lawyer got up to help her into her chair nothing untoward he asked solicitously face reddened with drink no she reassured him who the hell said untoward these days well robert gissing almost certainly did she wondered about ransomes call was gissing really the best qualified man for the job of checking the paintings she doubted it she remembered the last time shed seen him in the doorway during her auction mike had made his way towards him and the two men had then left allan cruikshank following soon after it was allan whod introduced her to mike the evening of the monboddo retrospective opening party she seemed to remember hed introduced mike to gissing that night too shed been talking to mike enjoying his company and by his body language hed seemed to be enjoying hers but then allan had brought the professor over and gissing had begun the job of monopolising the conversation droning on about the importance of taste and discrimination eventually laura had moved to another part of the gallery connecting with other people she knew but still feeling mikes eyes on her from time to time youre only a couple of months out of a twoyear relationship shed told herself dont you dare give in to the rebound a piece of brie laura the hostess was asking knife hovering over the cheese trolley and quince or grapes with that im fine thanks laura said aware that the lawyers eyes were lingering on the swell of her chest as he poured her more wine you used to have a monboddo didnt you another guest was asking the host sold it a decade back she was informed school fees the host gave a shrug of the shoulders the raiders tried to get away with a monboddo the guest explained to the table portrait of the artists wife she turned to laura do you know the one i mean laura nodded she knew it all right and remembered the last time shed seen it and whod seemed most interested in it that night westie and alice ate at their favourite chinese restaurant then headed for a couple of bars and a nightclub where they could dance off some of their excitement the derasse abstract had been given pride of place in westies studio on an easel recently vacated by one of the fakes westie had even proposed a wild notion to alice he would display the derasse as part of his portfolio at the art college passing it off as one of his copies and gissing will see it and kick your arse to iceland and back alice had shrieked laughing along with him dancing dancing dancing into sunday while ransome lay awake in bed staring at the ceiling careful not to disturb his wife by moving about too much even though his nerves were jangling his heart pounding the late supper of spiced vegetable couscous lay like a slab in his stomach allan was awake too his eyes were still sore from the lenses his scalp itchy despite a shower and half a bottle of shampoo he stood by the window in his darkened living room staring out across a patch of grass towards gayfield square police station a couple of tv crews had come and gone the reporters illuminated as they said their pieces to camera every time a patrol car arrived allan expected to see somebody he knew westie or mike or the professor being led from it in handcuffs he wanted to tell someone margot maybe or one of the kids or just pick up the telephone press buttons at random and blurt it all out to the first stranger who answered but instead he kept vigil by the window robert gissing had a busy night ahead but took time to inspect his paintings nice additions to his little collection hed been driven home by allan and hadnt said much during the journey the detective di ransome worried him michael however had warned him to say nothing to allan confirming gissings fears if anyone were to unravel it would be allan cruikshank and it might happen at any moment hence the busy night ahead not that gissing minded sleep could be left till later afterwards he would have nothing but time he even spoke the words out loud nothing but time and smiled to himself knowing this to be anything but the truth edinburgh was sundaymorning quiet the rhythmed tolling of church bells a warming sun denizens and visitors alike spreading out their newspapers across café tables nice day for a drive though not many people would have chosen granton as their destination gulls shrieked all along the waterfront feasting on fastfood leftovers from the previous night in the near distance another new development of highrises was creeping skywards surrounded by wasteland and gasometers not for the first time ransome wondered why the national gallery of scotland had sited its overflow warehouse here he didnt even know why one was necessary couldnt the various paintings and statues have been loaned to needy collections across the land surely there had to be room in the likes of dundee aberdeen and inverness wouldnt kirkcaldy have welcomed a few sketches or the bust of some historical personage he could almost see kirkcaldy through the haze that lay across the becalmed firth of forth yesterdays rain a memory there was a fresh guard manning the gates of the warehouse his colleague having been excused duties the better to answer police questions questions such as how much did they pay you they being the robbers ransome knew what hendricks would be thinking inside job the gang had known the buildings layout how many guards there would be and where those guards would be posted the cctv cameras had been shut down only certain vaults targeted it all smacked of an inside job and that was how hendricks and his crew would be treating it ransome suspected he knew better which was why hed come to granton this morning parking next to a lockeddown snack van the van would be manned on weekdays meaning the proprietor or his customers might have seen something any gang worth its salt would have recced the site on the latenight tv news there had been speculation about the timing of the robbery it wasnt just that it coincided with doors open day it also took place at a time when the warehouse was playing host to new arrivals from the closedforrenovation national museum coincidence the reporter didnt think so hed spoken straight to camera from a vantage point directly in front of the gatehouse ransome headed the same way his id was checked thoroughly by the liveried guard his details logged he walked down towards the loading bay hands in pockets scrutinising the ground for anything the forensic team might have missed only then did he open the door marked private staff only and step inside the investigators were looking busy museum and gallery curators were commencing a full inventory although this was not ransomes inquiry hed phoned a pal at hendricks station the pal had given him what info he had witnesses reckoned the gang had been inside the building for no longer than twenty minutes even though it felt like hours twenty minutes was to ransomes mind slick even so theyd left having taken only eight paintings fair enough those eight added up to well over a million quid insurancewise but still it didnt make sense he knew what hendricks would be thinking stolen to order wealthy and unscrupulous collectors willing to pay for something they couldnt otherwise have experts would be asked for their opinion like the ones on the tv last night theyd mentioned the use of art as mafia collateral discussed cases where famous paintings had been linked to gangland bosses and billionaire aficionados some thieves in the past had tried pulling off heists just to show they could once hed had enough of the tv having tiptoed downstairs from the bedroom ransome had called laura stanton again on her mobile shed complained shed been asleep ransome realising midnight had come and gone hed apologised then asked if she had company in bed youve got a onetrack mind ransome thats what makes me such a good copper so do you have any names for me names artlovers who might put a gang together this is edinburgh ransome hed agreed that this much was true hed then thrown robert gissings name into the pot and asked if she could give him any more background why just wondering how much of an expert he is expert enough shed told him yawning you didnt seem so sure earlier im sure now funny though isnt it the gallerys own expert getting himself mugged the night before hes needed what are you getting at ransome just keep me posted will you laura hed hung up and gone back to sipping his tea rooibos sandras idea good for the digestion apparently standing in the warehouse now mouth dry and stomach unsettled he watched the curators they wore thin white cotton gloves they all seemed to be wearing them didnt matter if they were dressed in suit and tie or blue overalls the cops meantime wore latex if they wore anything alasdair noone was there still fraught after the best part of a day he looked like hed got by on about fifteen minutes sleep his museums counterpart donald farmer was present too but altogether calmer seemed to ransome that nothing from the museum overflow had been touched as intimated by farmer on tv the previous night the look on the mans face had bordered on smug then and bordered on smug now there were guards standing on sentry duty inside the loading bay doors as clear a case as ransome had ever seen of shutting the stable door and typical of hendricks who had almost certainly ordered it it would look good if the brass came calling they liked things busy but controlled there was as yet no sign of hendricks himself ransome doubted he was having a liein maybe he was in the guardroom or conducting interviews back at the station ransome didnt take any chances and made his way quickly into one of the aisles between the high groaning shelves last thing he wanted was his colleaguecumadversary challenging him as to what the hell he was doing here any lie would do of course but ransome doubted hendricks would swallow any of them im walking all over your case he said to himself and when its done and dusted ill be right and youll be wrong and ill be the one staring promotion in the face the three unlocked vaults were still open or had been reopened this morning to allow the forensic team further access there were plenty of paintings left inside the ones the gang had taken would be allowed home only after their examination was complete theyd already been declared unharmed and genuine verifications made by professor robert gissing but they would still be checked for fingerprints and fibres the journalist on tv last night had talked of the relief felt by the arts community here in scotland and doubtless further afield as well fine but why abandon the van media speculation had been brief the gang had been disturbed and had panicked theyd been unloading the paintings probably transferring them to another vehicle a member of the public had become suspicious and had called it in ransome had already asked his pal at hendricks station for news of the callers identity seemed no name had been given and the callers number had yet to be traced the alarm of course had already been raised by the guard at the gatehouse hed provided a description of the van along with its licence number stolen a couple of days previously from a street in broxburn the licence plate was fake but the owner a painteranddecorator had idd the van annoyed to find that the tools of his trade had been ditched somewhere along the way so a successful heist followed by a botched transfer and the abandonment of the treasure to hendricks this all made sense but not to ransome abandoning the van yes maybe but why not take at least a few of the paintings the reckoning was that between six and ten men must have been involved and only eight paintings recovered the largest measuring five feet by four even framed why leave them after all that meticulous planning and the perfect execution were these the sorts of men likely to be spooked by a passing motorist or dogwalker they were toting guns for christs sake what could they possibly have had to fear the more ransome thought about it and he didnt think hed managed much more sleep than alasdair noone over the past twentyodd hours the less sense it made his conclusions were simple maybe it was an inside job and maybe not but thered been no cause for panic on the part of the thieves so here he was giving up his sunday morning to examine the scene and possibly ask a few questions and glean a few more facts of his own he looked into all three unlocked vaults the paintings were stored in racks sideways on with brown cardboard tags which identified them only by numbers another reason for the inside job theory if the art had been stolen to order someone had known what they were getting who would have access to the numbering system besides the staff his pal back at hendricks station hadnt been able to answer that the same soco ransome had spoken to at marine drive yesterday had just finished running some sort of torch over the floor in one of the vaults anything ransome asked a few fibres half a footprint probably wont mean much theyll have dumped the clothing ransome speculated the soco nodded so far the only strands of hair weve found are synthetic wigs ransome reasoned receiving another dispirited nod ive got a caseload piling up while i waste my time here havent we all ransome turned away and headed back towards the guardroom during the heist the guards and visitors had been herded inside and made to crouch on the floor they hadnt seen anything useful so far as ransome was aware nor had they heard anything their captors had communicated by means of grunts one thing the curator in charge of the tour had pointed out the men whod held them had seemed younger than the ones doing the actual thieving glenns words came back to ransome four or five schemies with pool cues glenn had been thinking of the lads as a gang to intimidate hate but maybe hed been wrong the younger thieves hadnt worn much by way of disguise either just baseball caps pulled low and scarves muffling mouth and nose ransome couldnt see anyone in the guardroom so stepped inside there were tv screens working again now and showing interior and exterior views of the warehouse coverage of the gatehouse was hopeless the camera was trained on the vehicle barrier you could make out half the gatehouse but nothing of the pedestrian walkway beyond it he knew that hendricks had already complained to the galleries boss about this ransome sat himself down at the desk and peered through the window into the warehouse proper you couldnt see the relevant vaults from here in any case the warehouse and its contents were sitting targets amazing no one had thought to turn the place over sooner there was a knock at the open door ransome turned his head sharply fully expecting to see his nemesis but it was someone else someone he recognised professor robert gissing oh the academic began clearly flustered i was looking for di hendricks ransome was on his feet taking a step forwards hes not here he ventured offering his hand im a colleague di ransome yes i saw you at marine drive did you what about alasdair noone gissing was staring down at his shoes hes around somewhere thank you eyes still directed floorwards id better have a word with him but ransome wasnt about to let him go without a fight professor gissing hesitated yes eventually raising his eyes to meet the detectives gaze ransome was right in his face now gissing was a good inch and a half taller than him but that meant nothing just wondered if i could have your take on things sir bungled robbery someone on the inside is that your reading of it gissing folded his arms defensive again then gave a pout and looked thoughtful i dare say more fanciful scenarios exist ive seen them in todays newspapers but my jobs not to make wild guesses inspector thats right sir your job was to verify the paintings but you did that yesterday so what brings you here this morning gissing straightened his back my attendance was requested by alasdair noone he seems to think i may be able to pinpoint any gaps in the holdings of nineteenth and twentiethcentury scottish art because thats what the thieves took indeed pretty specialised market would you say sir hardly there are collectors from canada to shanghai your field of expertise though i suppose so yes well id better let you get on inventorys well underway already for the first time gissing seemed to notice the activity going on around them due to happen in a few weeks anyway wasnt it ransome added robbery just speeded it up look inspector im not sure how any of this can be of benefit to your investigation oh its not my investigation professor gissing im just curious thats all ransome paused watching gissing try to take this in shame about mr allison wasnt it the question threw the academic him being the resident expert and all ransome pressed on do you know him sir i believe hes pretty badly shaken terrible business gissing seemed to agree still silver linings and all that eh im not sure i get your meaning ransome gave a shrug im just saying its lucky you were on hand to step into the breach so to speak yes well gissing having nothing to add was again about to leave see much of chib calloway these days gissing kept his back to the detective for several seconds then half turned his head sorry what was that name again ransome just smiled and winked the two paintings were still propped up on one of the sofas in mike mackenzies penthouse so far today mike hadnt been able to spend as much time as he would have liked with lady monboddo hed had to surf the web checking the level of interest national and international in the heist either the national galleries had been spectacularly lucky or else the robbers had been spectacularly inept cackhanded they called it in my day allan cruikshank had offered when he arrived at the flat hed also warned that mike should be thinking of a hiding place for the two paintings what have you done with yours mike asked in return under the desk in my study reckon theres a chance the cops will miss them if they come looking what the hell else can i do stick them in the bank for safe keeping mike just shrugged allan was looking awful he kept wandering over to the window and staring down towards the car park as if fearing the imminent arrival of blue flashing lights the pair of them had stepped out on to the balcony for a cigarette mike trying to push away the thought that his friend might be about to jump but glad all the same when they retreated indoors mike had made peppermint tea which allan said he couldnt remember asking for he held the mug cupped in both hands help you relax mike offered relax allan hooted rolling his eyes how much sleep did you get last night not much allan conceded tell me have you ever read any edgar allan poe the telltale heart we just have to hold our nerve allan a few days of fuss and itll all die down youll see how can you say that a splash of tea had spilled on to the wooden floor but allan seemed not to have noticed we still know what we did why not shout a bit louder im sure the neighbours will be thrilled allans eyes widened he removed one hand from the mug so he could clamp it over his mouth mike didnt bother saying hed been exaggerating for effect the flat was pretty well soundproofed when hed first moved in hed cranked up the hifi then gone downstairs to ask the couple he a restaurateur she an interior designer if they could hear it im sorry allan was muttering now from behind his fingers he went to sit down but his eyes fell on the paintings again you really should hide those he advised voice quavering if anyone asks theyre copies mike explained soothingly you could do the same stick them on a wall where you can see them maybe the coultons will calm you down where mere mortals like myself cant theyre better than any of the ones first caly has allan intoned yes they are mike agreed look the whole point of this exercise if you cast your mind back was the pleasure of owning a masterpiece or two the professors already convinced everyone theyve got their paintings back today at the warehouse hell reinforce that nothing missing everything accounted for after that the media interest will disappear in a puff of smoke i wish i could disappear in a puff of smoke allan bounded to his feet again and made for the window what about this cop you mentioned i wish to god i hadnt mike muttered to himself having told gissing not to say anything hed decided allan actually did need to know about ransome they were a team after all and they were still mates you didnt keep stuff hidden from your mates but when mike had called him to explain allan had said he was coming straight over hes already on our trail allan persisted hes got nothing even if he thinks something fishys going on hows he going to prove it but allan was not to be consoled what if i give mine back or just abandon them somewhere good thinking mike bore down on his friend then theyll know the ones they found in the van are copies and start wondering why the esteemed professor didnt say anything allan gritted his teeth in frustration you take them then ill give them to you i cant get to sleep with them in the house mike considered his options and placed a hand on allans shoulder okay how about this well bring them here and ill look after them for a few days maybe even a week or two just until you start to feel good about them allan thought for a moment and then nodded slowly as long as were agreed mike persisted im holding them for you not taking them from you is it a deal he waited until allan started nodding again and we dont tell anyone else he added its our little secret mike did not want anyone knowing that allan was getting the shakes least of all chib calloway he was hoping it was just shock meaning it would wear off on those occasions when hed been able to study the portrait of monboddos wife hed been unable not to see another face there not lauras this time but the man called hate something told mike that even if he were never again to be in the same room as him hed still be haunted by the face and figure the face the figure and those hellish tattoos it was of course no business of mikes who chib chose to give his painting to but it was dangerous at the heists conception there had only been the three friends mike allan and gissing westie had been added as a necessity but now westies girlfriend was a player too and chib chib had been mikes idea it would be his fault if things started to go wrong chib chibs four lads and now hate and who knew where hate would lead whats on your mind allan was asking nothing mike stated im lying to him and keeping things from him too id never blurt anything out mike you know that right i mean were mates always will be thats the truth of it of course it is allan attempted something like a grin his face was pasty coated with perspiration youre so in control mike always got the answers up here he tapped the side of his head you got a real buzz out of yesterday didnt you i did mike confessed with a smile but meeting the debtcollector had been another very different kind of buzz one that told mike he was rubbing shoulders with the big boys in the playground now playing with the bullies they wouldnt play fair wouldnt let sentiment or emotion or friendship get in the way allan had slumped back into his chair sloshing more tea mates always will be well you never could tell lets go fetch your paintings mike offered that way you can rest easy some sleep would be nice allan agreed how come we havent heard from robert not easy for him to phone from the warehouse mike counselled even though he too wanted to know what was happening there he checked his watch you sure its okay if we go pick up the paintings just now why wouldnt it be its sunday allan i want to be sure youre not breaking any arrangements dont you see your boys on a sunday margots taken them to london to see some show mike nodded his satisfaction with this it was a relief that allan wouldnt have to try making small talk with his sons during a princes street shopping trip or a restaurant meal anything else you normally do on a sunday he asked got to keep our routines as normal as possible you and me sometimes go for a drink allan reminded him so we do mind if we skip that tonight fine by me i feel better for talking though im glad you invited me over allan was looking around the room now what did i do with my jacket youre wearing it mike informed him when westie still hungover from the night before checked at the cash machine the money was in his account paid in full for services rendered eight good likenesses and true well nine actually but who was counting what mattered was that his work was busily fooling the art world into thinking the heist had failed bloody beautiful he said out loud staring at the amount on the screen for a few seconds more he printed out a ministatement then just because he could he withdrew two hundred pounds and marched with it into the café where alice was sitting in front of a stack of papers they hadnt got to bed till dawn and she was still bleary front page of most of them she informed him well the broadsheets anyway some actress with new improved udders beat you on a couple of the tabloids tell the whole caff he warned handing her the cash machine statement she squealed and reached across the table to kiss him when he drew back and lifted his cappuccino she noticed the bank notes fanned out on top of one of the newspapers she gave another little squeal louder this time and jumped to her feet to hug him coffee splashed across one of the front pages but neither of them minded in fact none of the other customers took a blind bit of notice too wrapped up in sunday supplements or college textbooks or sending messages on their phones or listening through earphones to the latest sounds the café was fairly new sited beside the meadows where the old infirmary was being turned into expensive flats handy for the art college but neither alice nor westie was a regular hed picked it for that reason and because there was a bank close by alice had seated herself again she was dabbing at the spilt coffee with a paper napkin know what it feels like she asked a tarantino film early tarantino were the young lovers whove escaped with the cash having said which she scooped up the notes and folded them into the pocket of her zipup westie couldnt help grinning even though hed wanted the money for himself still there was plenty more where it had come from but he had a further warning for her we dont go splurging too much remember thats to finance you through film school just promise me you wont turn any of this story into your first screenplay third or fourth maybe she agreed the pair of them were still laughing as their waitress was she polish brought the focaccia toastie alice had ordered afterwards just prior to taking her first huge bite out of the sandwich alice commented that for once they could afford to leave a tip westie winked at her then settled back to read about his exploits he wasnt hungry still had paint fumes and varnish in his lungs but hed be happy to sit there for a while swapping papers ordering yet more coffee noting the gradations in light the lengthening shadows as afternoon segued into evening which was exactly what he was doing when he noticed that alice had stopped reading and was gazing out of the window he doubted she was seeing the same world he was she was using the edge of her pinkie nail to prise slivers of dough from between her teeth penny for them he offered she gave a shrug seemed to be considering her response then turned to face him leaning her elbows on the tabletop chin resting between her cupped palms i was just wondering she began as though musing aloud for no ones benefit but her own why they all got two paintings apiece and we only got the one the guy who provided the muscle only got one he corrected her but he wasnt there was he he wasnt at the warehouse risking arrest and look at the work you put in all those days and nights nobody worked harder than you westie i got paid though didnt i she nodded slowly thats sort of what im getting at the cash was to pay for the work you did but then you did more you went on the raid helped switch all those frames you told me yourself professor gissing was taking forever to do it and nearly having a coronary in the process it was all down to you westie and you came good she reached out to him with one hand clasping his own in hers there were still streaks of colour on his knuckles traces of reds blues whites and greens monboddos wife had taken the longest so many folds in the material of her dress alices chin was no longer supported by either hand she was stabbing a finger against one of the newspapers says here some of the artists would fetch high six figures high six figures and we end up with one lousy derasse westie was stung one of our favourite artists he reminded her influenced by mondrian through a prism of sixties counterculture alice just made a face and it was one westie recognised she was not going to be convinced it just seems so unfair westie thats all im saying well its a bit late now to do anything about it he argued before draining his latest cup her eyes met his above its rim and he felt skewered by them is it really though she said is it really too late westie lowered the cup slowly back into its saucer mike was alone in his flat hed put some music on without really caring what it was allans coultons were on a chair next to the fireplace mike had never really been a fan of the mans abstracts great whooshes of colour and little doodles that were symbolic like cartouches according to allan mike had poured himself a malt and was savouring it as he studied monboddos wife light seemed to pour from the canvas he put down his tumbler and picked up the portrait pressing his lips to those of the gently smiling woman close up the surface of the paint was crisscrossed with hairline fractures too bad he could hardly call in a restorer monboddo hadnt signed the work he seldom signed his name to anything the show mike had been at the one where hed first set eyes on the painting he was holding right now plenty of the work on display had been given the wrong provenance until scholarship had improved even so a few of the works were attributed to or school of but not the wife the wife was one hundred per cent genuine her name he went to a shelf and took down a biography of the artist her name was beatrice the painting bore the title a reflective pose but the sitter was definitely beatrice she appeared in at least four other works by monboddo the biographer stated his belief that the artist had painted her in as flattering a light as possible probably to make up for some transgression notably more heinous than the norm transgression heinous mikes stomach did a little flip and he decided hed had enough whisky gissing still hadnt called but then theyd sort of agreed contact was to be kept to a minimum let the dust settle mike placed the monboddo back on the sofa and reached for his mobile anyway couldnt do any harm to send the prof a text keep it short and offhand just the sort of casual enquiry any friend might send how are you lets have a drink soon any news your end he turned the phone over in his hand and almost dropped it when it buzzed incoming message it was from gissing mike felt his hand starting to shake as he pressed the tiny button to accept the text subject of photo is probing lets give him nothing to work with it was nicely vague even though mike knew what it meant few others would calloway had put a name to the cop in the photo di ransome ransome was working the heist and there was a history between calloway and him it was far from perfect but they could ride it of course they could what the hell else could they do mike found that he had refilled his tumbler without meaning to he went into the kitchen and poured it down the sink last thing he needed was a hangover well actually there were a lot of things he needed less than a hangover in fact right now it wouldnt even make his top five having rinsed the glass and left it to drain he walked back into the living area and flopped on to the sofa so that he sat flanked by his two paintings he hadnt given the other one much thought it was an early cadell a beach scene westie had been dismissive plenty of impasto and sharp angles could do it in my sleep mike wanted to call gissing wanted to hear him say reassuring things wanted to share with him the story of calloways collateral a text message wasnt going to cover any of it he turned the phone over and over again in his hand took a deep breath punched in the professors number and listened to the ring tone gissing would have caller id had to know who was calling but nobody was answering it went to the messaging service a pleasantly robotic female voice but mike decided to ring off instead tomorrow it could wait till tomorrow hed go surf the net one final time for news then call it a night he carried beatrice with him under his arm how did you get this address monday morning mike hadnt eaten breakfast yet and here he was opening his door to chib calloway the gangster brushed past him not even waiting for an invite nice place he was saying as he walked into the openplan living area great outlook too always fancied living somewhere with a view of the castle you didnt answer my question mike said sternly chib turned towards him no secrets between us mikey any time you want to see my place you only have to ask is that coffee i can smell i was just brewing some milk and one sugar chib told him mike hesitated then headed for the kitchen what did you make of mr hate chib called out to him mike was still half asleep but adrenalin was making itself felt what the hell was calloway doing here have you heard from him he called back over his shoulder he had a view of half the living area but calloway was out of sight not yet lot of art on your walls mike ive been doing a bit more digging on you from what i can tell youre absolutely minted makes me wonder what why nick paintings when you can afford to buy them sometimes the ones you want never come on the open market mike carried through two rushed mugs of coffee and saw that chib had been busy snooping the gangster was smiling as he gestured behind one of the rooms cream leather sofas not much of a hiding place michael anyone would think you want to get caught i didnt have much time mike said by way of excuse they were on the sofa when you rang the bell mind if i take a peek chib didnt wait for assent he was already easing out the paintings four he said two belong to allan im keeping them for him mind if i ask why hes got a girlfriend mike answered hiding his mouth behind the coffee mug knows a bit about art so he doesnt want her seeing them he was hoping chib would accept the lie so which two are yours the portrait and the landscape glad to hear it allans two look like something from playschool chib studied the monboddo and the cadell nice he decided are they worth the same as mine roughly probably a little less actually but then i only got the one and here you are with four of the little beauties one was all you wanted chib kept nodding still appearing to be making an appraisal of the paintings the portrait looks a bit like that bird from the auctioneers i hadnt noticed mike stated eventually calloway accepted the proffered mug with a grunt of thanks definitely a resemblance he mused his eyes on beatrice concentrating on the swell of her cleavage think shed like me any better if she knew i own an utterson laura stanton you mean more likely shed turn you in true calloway gave a dismissive sniff then took a slurp of the coffee the reason im here is ive been thinking about that bawbag of a copper ransome thats the one you heard any more from the prof just a text to say everythings fine again mike hid behind the mug he was holding the media say its someone called hendricks whos in charge of the investigation gav hendricks is a featherweight its ransome we need to keep an eye on chib had taken a step towards mike say he takes your friend allan in for questioning allans fine he better be mike didnt want calloway coming any closer so made a show of wandering over towards the window realising too late that it might make him appear nervous hadnt allan done the selfsame thing he found himself staring out of the window anyway and could make out the roof of chibs black bmw series two men were resting against the car one of them smoking a cigarette the other checking his phone for messages you brought your boys mike commented dont fret they dont know its you im visiting why not chib gave a shrug not sure who to trust these days and its nice to keep a few secrets isnt it i suppose so though it didnt stop you telling hate my name you leave hate to me mike chib was wagging a finger he decided that hed spent enough time admiring the paintings and had started on another circuit of the room its all right for some eh i mean look at you youve got your money in the bank art on your penthouse walls and behind the sofa youre living high on the hog mr michael mackenzie calloway gave a humourless chuckle some of us still have to go out there and graft for a living this coffees champion by the way any more of it going mike took the empty mug and headed for the kitchen he didnt like it that chib knew where he lived liked it even less that his goons were stationed outside and that chib now knew there were four masterpieces in the apartment not forgetting the lesser pieces exhibited on the walls he heard a bleep from the living area and figured chib was making a call or sending a text he hoped it wasnt an invitation for the goons to join the party maybe they were coffeelovers too when he returned with the replenished mug however chib was pointing towards the coffee table on top of which sat mikes own mobile sounds like youve got a message waiting the gangster explained thanks mike replied handing calloway the coffee he walked over to the table but then hesitated hadnt his phone been sitting in the inside pocket of his jacket the jacket that was still draped over the back of one of the chairs he glanced towards chib who was studying allans two coultons again slowly shaking his head mike picked up the phone and glanced at its screen two text messages the first was from laura need to see you was all it said under normal circumstances this would have gladdened mikes heart but these were far from normal circumstances as the second text demonstrated westie shortchanged another picture or k cash you choose alice nothing urgent i hope chib was asking not really mike pretended to be punching a reply into the keypad aware of chibs eyes drilling into him so youre pretty confident about your pal allan the question caught mike off guard of course he spluttered why shouldnt i be well because of his taste in art for one thing mike barked out something that he hoped might be construed as a laugh chib obliged by smiling back he straightened his back and clasped his hands behind his head studying the room again as if he were considering its purchase very nice he commented bet it cost a few bob a few mike conceded owe any money on it no didnt expect you would man of your talents whats that word they use about businessmen when they know what theyre doing ecumen acumen mike corrected him thats it chib nodded slowly now do us all a favour mike he was bearing down on mike for all the world as though he was going to back him against the wall use some of that famed acumen of yours to make sure nothing goes wrong starting with your good friend mr allan cruikshank a chains only as strong as its weakest link isnt that what they say the two men stood only inches apart so that mike could feel the gangsters breath on his face he took a moment to steady himself from where im looking he said eventually the weakest link is that headcase hate if he wants to take you down all he has to do is send the cops an anonymous tipoff but then his clients wouldnt stand a cat in hells chance of getting whats owed them when it comes down to it theyre business people same as you so dont you go worrying about that and dont give me cause to worry about anything at your end a chain doesnt have an end mike said quietly a chains nothing but ends calloway snapped back they locked eyes for a moment and then the gangster turned away it looked to mike as if he was readying to leave the replenished mug still three quarters full was placed on the coffee table chib exited into the long hallway mike following maybe next time ill get the full tour eh calloway was gesturing towards the art that lined the walls and like i say theres an open invite to mine not half as snazzy as yours of course but then its been through the wars a bit like its owner the thing is mike thought to himself i dont know your address while you now know mine the front door was open chib striding out on to the landing with a backwards wave of the hand mike pressed the door closed after him and leaned against it as if to repel further intruders he listened out for the sound of the lift arriving and hazarded an eye to the spy hole the lift doors were sliding closed he turned and walked back to the living area scooping his phone up and making for the window as yet there was no sign of calloway mike didnt want the gangster seeing him making a call no telling who hed think mike was talking to so he retreated a few steps into the room before punching gissings number into the keypad laura wants to see me westies girlfriend is getting greedy but it was gissing he wanted maybe the professor could offer solace or at least the vague reassurance that as bad as things might seem mikes life was not yet ready to implode the call was answered my boy this is unexpected the line was terrible gissings voice breaking up where are you mike asked keeping my head down just as we agreed at least i thought thats what wed agreed how much does ransome know he seems to know that i know charles calloway how is that even possible your guess is as good as mine things are starting to unravel mike heard the bmws engine starting im sure youre exaggerating michael gissing sounded so calm that mike felt it a shame to spoil things so he came to a sudden decision he would keep the news of allans paintings hates collateral and chibs visit to himself at least for now by the way mike said ive told allan about ransome how did he take it he took it mike paused how did it go at the warehouse yesterday i did all that was asked of me in my usual thorough manner theyre even offering to pay me for my time your message said ransome is probing what does that mean it means what it says hes not part of the official inquiry yet hes sniffing around it like a dog after a truffle i happened to mention as much to di hendricks when i saw him he wasnt best pleased nicely done robert i thought so the professor purred meantime the very best thing we can do is stay calm and keep ourselves very much to ourselves except in the direst of straits these are the direst of straits mike wanted to tell him but instead watching the bmw retreat down the long sloping driveway he found himself agreeing with a sigh and running his free hand through his hair he asked again for gissings whereabouts im at home keeping busy with some marking assignments but whenever boredom strikes i find i have one or two things i can gaze at in wonder and reverence we are blessed are we not michael blessed mike echoed as chib and his men finally disappeared from view chib calloway had fairly stalked towards his car johnno had flicked away his cigarette glenn holding open the rear door for their boss unless you want to drive but chib had been content in the back looking over his shoulder as the car pulled away no sign of anyone at the topfloor windows good meeting never you mind chib had growled chewing on a thumbnail while he considered potential courses of action of course in a sense it wasnt for him to decide the demand had been made to mike twenty grand or one of the paintings the girl called alice she had to be westies girlfriend chib knew about westie but no one had thought to mention that there was a bird in on it as well and now the pair of them were getting greedy chib found himself tutting while at the same time admiring their barefaced cheek what were they going to do run to the cops not likely with the two of them being every bit as complicit as anyone else they were testing mikes nerve that was all same as chib himself had just been doing problem wasnt really mike though it was that wet pal of his allan cruikshank losing his bottle mikes lie about the new girlfriend might have worked if hed had time to refine it over the course of his professional life chib reckoned hed probably heard about twenty thousand lies the majority of them honed to near perfection mikes attempt hadnt been in the same league hadnt even been playing ballboy another reason for the little visit today chib wanted to see exactly how rich michael mackenzie was just because hed run a company sold some product it didnt mean things hadnt gone tits up along the way plenty of guys chib knew had made money only to blow the whole lot on misguided shares or badly tipped nags but mike was living the high life no question about it chib doubted the paintings on the walls were repro flatscreen tv mustve been three of four k as for the flat itself not much change out of a million hell the way things were in edinburgh maybe even a millionfive millionsix which was all to the good chib liked a man with money mike could solve the westie problem by throwing cash at it but that didnt mean they wouldnt come back wanting more might happen next week or next year but it would happen come to think of it mike could solve chibs own cashflow problem too if the vikings decided they didnt want to go with the painting the planning the clandestine meetings car manoeuvres to lose any tail the handover of the shooters all these things had kindled something in mike mackenzie hed been growing to like it introducing him to hate however might have been a mistake mike hadnt been ready for that hate had scared him good and proper and he had yet to recover his early confidence still hed held up pretty well this morning how did you get this address chib had to smile at that it had been as easy as asking an estate agent they all knew the mackenzie pad could reel off the magazines and supplements it had appeared in another good reason chib told himself for not being flashy with your cash and your choice of residence didnt want every fucker knowing your business or that you might be worth a visit where to boss glenn was asking from the drivers seat home chib said the other text message had been from laura when chib had noted her resemblance to the portrait mike had been all casual laura stanton you mean but the pair of them were close she sent him texts used only her first name and sounded keen to see her millionaire businessman friend chib would have to consider the ramifications of this too but for now one of his own mobiles was trilling he recognised the number and considered not answering then told glenn to pull over chib was pushing open the door before the bmw was fully stationary hed taken a deep breath and flipped the phone open calloway came the quiet voice hiya edvard the only name chib had for the man edvard boss hogg of a hells angels chapter in the wilds of norway they ran drugs from all over denmark to sweden russia to finland norway to the uk happy with the collateral chib noticed that he was standing beside some railings behind them was a patch of churnedup grass some kids having a kickabout a quartercentury back that was me nobody would dare take the ball away once i had it well edvard was saying thats why i wanted to talk with you the voice was cultured never threatening chib had been informed early on in the relationship that he would never meet its owner probably not even hate had got to meet edvard i hope theres not a problem chib was staring at the game without really seeing it a dog was barking it had been tied to one of the goalposts no problems as yet in fact quite the contrary you will know of course that collateral such as yours can make for a reliable form of currency the one youve got isnt even posted as missing turning towards the car chib noticed that the passengerside window was down meaning glenn and johnno were listening of course they were chib knew he had to keep from saying anything meaningful he walked further down the pavement thats good thats very good edvards voice was as soft as a lullaby so then to cut the story short perhaps more of our business could be transacted in similar fashion in future chib doubted it sure he agreed sounding enthusiastic no problem at all edvard you like your art huh me too i like money better mr calloway the voice had turned cold and what im really passionate about just now is the money you still owe me its coming edvard im happy to hear that ill be in touch soon about further transactions the phone went dead edvard never stayed on too long just in case chib snapped the phone shut and tapped it against his teeth he was replaying the conversation and winced when he got to you like your art huh to anyone listening in on a wiretap say hed just given away the nature of the bloody collateral good work chib nice fucking going still edvard wanted to do business with him more paintings to be swapped between gangs as security on various deals tap tap tap of the phone against his teeth the dog howling now in frustration the bmw drawing up alongside chib making him realise hed kept on walking he was thinking about edvard and the people edvard did business with hundreds and thousands of miles away from edinburgh how much did they know about art about the glasgow boys and the scottish colourists if paintings were just collateral to them just something to be held on to while deals were being done professor robert gissing reckoned that this kid westie was a master forger and chib began to wonder about that too he was still thinking as he got back into the car thinking as they pulled away from the kerb westie and alice alice and westie westie shortchanged i know how you feel pal chib said out loud boss glenn asked from the driving seat nothing who was on the phone was it hate chib sat forward in his seat until his face was almost level with glenns any more sticking your big pointy nose in youll have my hands around your throat understood loud and clear glenn said sounding suitably chastened its just that he swallowed hard as if fearing his bosss hands if youre in trouble me and johnno want to help what were here for johnno piped up well isnt that touching chib crooned we feel maybe you dont trust us the way you used to glenn persisted oh aye and who are you going to complain to your shop steward get a grip glenn some of my business youre better off not knowing im taking more than my share of flak just to keep you two off the radar know what i mean not really boss johnno eventually admitted chib just groaned and slouched back again mackenzies coffee was giving him a headache had to be the coffee either that or brain cancer from the mobile phone one or the other what else could it be there was a restaurant next to the auction house it had been a bank at one time and still boasted a rococo interior of vast fluted columns and intricate cornicing in the morning the tables were kept empty ready for the lunchtime rush but breakfast could be had at one of the booths by the window laura was stirring a foamy cappuccino when mike arrived he pecked her on both cheeks and ordered water frizzante from the waiter before sliding on to the bench across from her no coffee she asked there was a plate in front of her showing leftover crumbs from a croissant little pots of jam and pats of butter sat untouched already had my share of jolts this morning he explained i havent seen you since the day of the auction how did it go not quite recordbreaking she was stirring her spoon slowly around the remains of her drink did you hear about the warehouse she seemed to be studying him as he adjusted his shirt cuffs yes he said eyes widening wasnt that extraordinary extraordinary she echoed you probably know the people at the national gallery they must have had a fit id imagine so bloody lucky the gang didnt get away with it lucky yes her voice drifted away though her eyes stayed locked on him dont tell me mike said affecting a laugh shaving foam on my ear lobe he made a show of checking but wasnt about to be rewarded with anything like a smile one of the paintings was the portait by monboddo of his wife beatrice she pronounced the name in the italian style i remember it from the exhibition and how you couldnt take your eyes off it she waited for him to speak nice to know i was under surveillance was all he could think to respond allan teased me she went on said the reason you were so keen was because she looked like me well i suppose theres a certain truth in that you remember that night of the exhibition some of us went to a restaurant after mike winced dont he said too much wine at the preview and mike giddy at this new world he had entered a world where people knew about art and spoke from the heart one too many brandies at the restaurant hed caught lauras eye several times shed always smiled back then shed gone to the ladies and hed followed her barging in and trying to kiss her do you know anyone called ransome she asked suddenly bringing mike back to the present should i i knew him at college he tried much the same thing with me once at a party followed me to the loo noting the pained look on mikes face she broke off the reminiscence i hadnt laid eyes on him in a while she said instead but then the day of the auction he came to see me afterwards he said he was interested in a local villain called chib calloway whod been sitting in the front row with two of his henchmen close by i was at the back cosying up to the dealers you didnt see this man calloway she watched as he shook his head but you know who he is i know the name mike conceded straining his neck to see if the waiter was on his way whats any of this got to do with me im not supposed to tell you this but ransome thought maybe youd brought calloway to the auction me mike raised both eyebrows why would he think that he didnt say but he managed to describe you she paused her stare intensifying and allan and the professor too he wanted your names and i didnt see how i could refuse wheres my water got to mike muttered craning his neck again his mind was racing ransome must have been watching chib that day hed seen mike leaving the auction house with gissing and allan probably followed chib and his men there and was watching outside hed have seen mike allan and gissing heading for the shining star with chib and his men following close after had ransome actually been in the bar and seen mike talking with chib no the place had been dead chib sensitive to surveillance would have noticed him surely so what had led him to connect mike and the others to chib the answer seemed simple enough hed been at the national gallery and had spotted mike and chib in the café more crucially however ransome now had all their names and then laura continued after the robbery ransome called me twice actually it was saturday night so it had to be important to him even though he made the questions sound casual was he after another snog laura gave a sad little smile and dropped her gaze to the contents of her cup thats the wrong question mike you should be asking me whos this ransome chap whats he got to do with anything but you already know dont you i really havent a clue what youre getting at he works for lothian and borders police mike and he was asking about the professor she sat back as if finished talking but ready and willing to hear anything mike might have to say no clue at all he stressed laura sighed and folded her arms concentrating so hard on the cappuccino now that she might have been inviting it to levitate i mean he blustered on well im not sure what i mean the water was arriving on a silver salver ice and lime in the tall slender glass the waiter began to pour then asked if they needed anything else yes mike felt like telling him an escape hatch but he just shook his head in time with laura they watched the young man leave laura unfolded her arms and rested her fingertips against the rim of the table such long fingers the nails immaculate i knew ransome pretty well back in college days she stated quietly he was a determined sod even then that night at the party i had to knee him between the legs im not sure thatll work as far as youre concerned she screwed shut her eyes and mike feared she was about to start crying he reached across the table and covered her hands with his own its really all right laura hes probably after some dirt on this guy calloway he sees us at the same auction and starts imagining all sorts of conspiracies nothing to worry about ransomes not even part of the team looking at the heist realising that he was thinking aloud he broke off but not quickly enough lauras eyes had reopened the botched heist you mean sure yes of course how could you possibly know he knew what she was about to say and bit down on his bottom lip how could you know ransomes not part of the team she duly obliged mike fixed her with a look he knew there were things he should be saying reassurances he should be giving her eyes gleamed and intelligence shone from her face so much more alive than lady monboddo mike knew that whatever he said shed see through it there would be more questions on her part more lies on his all of it spiralling downwards things he couldnt tell her explanations and excuses he couldnt give instead of which he slid out of the bench reaching into his pocket for money to place beside his tumbler her head was bent over the table staring hard at its surface he leaned over to kiss her hair pausing with his face there breathing in her subtle perfume then he straightened up and walked towards the door mike she called to him whatever it is maybe i can help he nodded slowly hoping she would catch the gesture even though he had his back to her now the waiter was standing by the door he held it open for mike and said he hoped hed have a nice day thank you mike replied heading out on to george street im not at all sure that i will glenn burns had been working for chib calloway these past four and a half years and was certain of only two things his boss was in trouble and overall in the scheme of things as it were and with everything taken into account he could do a far better job chib no offence had terrible people skills lacked vision and seemed to bounce from crisis to crisis glenn knew this because hed been studying business textbooks in his spare time one lesson hed taken to heart was always sleep with the enemy not that hed actually climbed into bed with di ransome but hed whispered sweet nothings into the coppers ear hoping chibs decline and fall would prove both swift and bloodless so far it hadnt panned out yet here he was meeting ransome again and this time the man had photos to show him yeah i know them glenn admitted i mean i dont really know them but chib put the frighteners on them one time in a bar the shining star thats the one then he insisted on going to that boring sodding auction and they were there too we went back to the shining star again and there they all were seated in the selfsame booth as before this one glenn tapped one of the photos it was a cutting from a magazine hes the one who went to school with chib or so chib says its true ive checked anyway that day at the shining star once the other two have left the school pal comes over and has a chat with chib what about ransome was gazing at something on the other side of his windshield they were parked atop calton hill just to the east of princes street great views of edinburgh if you could be bothered to look so far all glenn had done was climb out of his own car and into the detectives it smelt of leather nothing in the ashtray till glenn deposited a wad of gum there nicely souring the look on ransomes face they were gassing about the auction who was going up and down in value who wasnt selling at all i zoned out to be honest boring as allgetout chib wanted to know about bidding and paying and did they take cash and this guy was telling him names mike right mike mackenzie ransome confirmed he might not have liked the gum in his ashtray but when glenn unwrapped a fresh stick and offered him one he was quick enough to take it chewing it like it was chateaubriand flavour the other two are called gissing and cruikshank he continued one works at the art college the other at first caledonian bank but its mike your boss seems to know best right right they met again another time we picked mike up in the grassmarket just outside the last drop pub but chib kicked me and johnno out of the car so christ knows where they went or what they talked about who is he anyway this mike just some sod who got lucky and made a fortune from computers lives in some swanky penthouse in murrayfield thats a coincidence glenn furrowed his brow what is we were out there first thing this morning some fancy address called henderland heights chib wouldnt say why glenn broke off talking stunned into silence by something he thought he would never see detective inspector ransome trying to grin and whistle at the same time ransome knew what he should do he should take what he knew his suspicions evidence and conclusions to the chief but then the chief would say why didnt you tell hendricks any of this hes the officer in charge of the case and it would all filter back to hendricks anyway his collar his glory wouldnt matter that the donkey work had been done by ransome he needed more needed the proof that would lead to arrests for armed robbery mackenzie and the others theyd conspired in some way to help calloway pull off the heist there was precious little doubt in ransomes mind that chib was behind it hed been scouring the city for muscle to help him glenn had been clear on that or maybe it was this character hate leading a team of hells angels the very people whod have access to sawnoffs and the like but it couldnt have happened without inside info which was where the three musketeers came in rank amateurs probably cajoled or threatened until they were in way over their heads it would be easy to break them easier by far than confronting chib himself and when they broke he would have the gangster where he wanted him and hendricks too come to that hendricks had given him an earful on the phone somehow hed got to hear that ransome had visited the warehouse stay the fuck away those had been hendricks instructions ransome had come back with a few choice words of his own before ending the call and refusing to answer when hendricks rang back sod him sod the lot of them a bit more hard evidence was needed that or a confession evidence would be difficult without search warrants and his various hunches and titbits of surveillance were never going to secure any of those not even his covert source could connect calloway to the heist in any way other than tangentially he really needed more hard evidence or a confession and suddenly ransome knew exactly what to do and who to do it to tuesday morning just gone eleven westie was working on his degree show he was stuck in the basement of the college of art which meant no windows no natural light westies solution was a series of striplights standing at angles against the walls so that any paintings hung nearby would throw jagged shadows across sections of the room the problem was it was hard to see the paintings themselves added to which the floor had become treacherous snaking coils of electrical flex leading from the lights to an overloaded junction box hed been told by the janitor that there were health and safety issues and by one of his tutors that the art of display was part and parcel of the exhibition in other words if westie couldnt provide proper lighting and an environment that wasnt a potential deathtrap he might be marked down not that westie needed to worry of course he was whistling a happy tune so what by miles davis as he worked safe in the knowledge that his extracurricular activities on behalf of professor gissing and his friends had already secured him a high pass maybe even a distinction doesnt mean you can slack gissing had warned him your show has to exhibit a basic level of competence otherwise the marks going to look overly suspicious westie reckoned he could do competence and he was proud of his seven chosen canvases pastiches of runciman nasmyth raeburn twice wilkie hornel and peploe the peploe was a particular favourite a still life featuring potted plant fruit bowl and at the very edge of the canvas ketchup bottle gissing a fan of peploe hated it which was why it was going to be westies centrepiece he wanted to hear the professor praise it to the other assessors albeit through gritted teeth the fresh injection of cash into westies bank account had meant he could go to town on his frames no trawling the junk shops and skips he had bought from an architectural reclamation specialist in leith the frames were gilded ornate original and immaculate hed spent some more of the money on a couple of meals out and was thinking of renting a proper studio so that alice could have her living room back thats going to eat into my film studies funding she had complained unless we do something about it it had taken a lot of talking to persuade her not to go asking mike for any more cash but then shed started saying they should sell the derasse and pocket what they could no point us having it if its got to be kept hidden id be as happy with one of your copies anyway hed asked who they should sell it to and shed just shrugged her shoulders got to be someone out there whod want it no questions asked ill bet we could get fifty thou easy never easy westie thought to himself now she had worked hard to talk him out of including the derasse in his exhibition he realised that thinking about all of this had interfered with his whistling back to the top miles every time he replayed the heist itself he ended up laughing bloody lavender hill mob and no mistake gissing clutching his chest like he was about to peg it that would have been interesting allan with a waterfall of sweat running down his face from under that ridiculous wig mike had done okay though hed been cool throughout definitely cut out for it that was another reason westie didnt want to start hassling for a bigger cut mike had something about him the four hoodies had been mikes doing you got the feeling with mike that despite the haircut and the handcrafted boots he definitely knew people people you didnt want to know could probably handle himself too while westie was a fully paidup pacifist give peace a chance and all that this is some awful dump by the way a voice growled from the doorway westie studied the man who was lumbering into the room shaved head leather coat gold rings and neck chain dont know why youre bothering son nobodys going to find you down here unless you leave a trail of breadcrumbs can i help you westie asked as the stranger chuckled at his own joke course you can westie i wouldnt be here otherwise the man was holding out a pudgy hand westie could have sworn there was scar tissue on the knuckles im chib calloway reckoned it was high time we had an actual facetoface chib calloway the man nodded judging by the way your jaws grazing the floor im guessing the name means something to you thats good saves lengthy explanations i know who you are westie admitted then you know why im here westie felt his knees trying to buckle nno ive no idea wwhy youre here has nobody bothered to tell you mr westwater dearie me tell me what exactly calloway chuckled again and patted him on the shoulder westies knees almost went again under the pressure the extra guys on your team last saturday did you think they maybe appeared in a puff of smoke the shooters and the van who the hell did you think organised it all you westie just managed to choke the question out me chib calloway confirmed im pretty impressed actually reckoned someone would have blabbed good that my names kept out of the spotlight and yet i find myself having to come here the gangster started tutting as he began a tour of the studio and its contents westie wanted to ask what was going on but the greater part of him really didnt want to know only a couple of the paintings had actually been hung the other five resting against one of the whitewashed walls calloway had crouched down to flick through them saying nothing eventually he stood up again brushing imaginary dust from his palms i dont know much about art he apologised except for the noble art of course know what that is westie boxing westie offered thats it exactly boxing the gangster was walking away from westie heading towards the doorway closely followed by hammering battering kicking gouging slashing hacking and stabbing he turned and gave a smile not quite so noble by the time it gets to that stage of course llook mr calloway i just did what i was told nnobody said you were part of the i mean youve got nnothing to worry about not from me calloway was advancing slowly on westie again you saying its all down to your girlfriend then how is alice by the way westies face creased in puzzlement i dont understand calloway took a deep breath your dear sweet little alice sent a warning to my friend mike mackenzie she says you want an extra twenty k on top either that or another painting according to her you feel cheated is that right westie do you feel hard done by but the students powers of speech had deserted him now calloway went on seemingly satisfied by this reaction how do you suppose she got mikes mobile number want to go fiftyfifty or ask the audience no because she got it from you westie she got it from you a forefinger stabbed westie in the chest it felt like the heft of a blade the barrel of a gun calloway had leaned forward from the waist so he was eye to eye with the student unless you can come up with some other highly convincing explanation spittle hit westies face he didnt dare wipe it away until calloway had started another circuit of the room taking care not to trip over the various cables these are dangerous times pretty boy he was saying people get a bit frantic a bit crazy i didnt know the silly cow had sent that text but you knew she was thinking about it didnt you you knew it was a text even though i never mentioned the fact calloway had turned and was closing in on westie again his hands had emerged from his pockets they were bunched into fists the pair of you talked it over maybe tweaked the wording till youd got it just right we only thought the punch hit westie in the stomach and sent him backwards until he hit the wall either side of a framed canvas calloway had followed up with a hand around the students throat its good that were getting to know one another he spat because youre going to do something for me two things in fact for one persuade your bonyarsed girlfriend that nobodys getting shafted around here except her westie eyes bulging had started to nod as best he could calloway released his grip and the young man collapsed to his knees coughing a string of phlegm from his mouth calloway crouched down in front of him a hand resting on either shoulder is that a deal he asked no bother mr calloway westie managed to gasp im on that straight away he managed to swallow and whats the second thing the second thing is this westie were going to be a team you and me calloway was nodding as if to reinforce the point a team westies ears were ringing and his mouth felt full of sand there was juice in a carton on the floor next to him but he didnt think now was the right time for a refreshment break looks like those forgeries of yours did the business young westie calloway was telling him in my book that means you know what youre up to quick turnaround too from what im told so now youre going to make me a few more more copies calloway nodded again plenty more paintings in that warehouse you cant be serious dont fret the gangster offered a smile were not going to turn the place over again do i really look that thick so you want them for yourself in a manner of speaking westie felt himself relax a little sure mr calloway i can do that after all whats the difference between hanging a fake on your wall and owning the real thing if the fakes perfect no difference at all calloway helped westie back up on to his feet brushing dust from his shoulders do you have anything particular in mind westie asked doesnt have to be from the warehouse i can do you a mona lisa if you like no westie not the mona lisa these have to be paintings that are kept locked away from the public gaze how many are we talking about couple of dozen should do it westie puffed out his cheeks thats a lot of work calloways face tightened youre forgetting youve a lot of making up to do after that little stunt alice tried to pull westie raised his hands in surrender no problem he said not for you mr calloway im flattered you think id be good enough watching the gangsters features relax again he decided it was safe to ask a question by the way which painting did you get from the raid its by some guy called utterson dusk on rannoch moor how about you a derasse westie was able to say despite the sudden queasy surge in his gut never heard of him calloways hands still rested on westies shoulders any good is he westie cleared his throat not bad experimental style of jasper johns but a bit hipper do you want to swap the gangster just laughed as though westie had been making a joke westie tried smiling back maintaining the illusion while his brain screamed the utterson why did it have to be the bloody utterson allan cruikshank was in his office at first caledonian banks hq on the corner of george street and st andrews square the building was becoming cramped and being grade i listed there was little way to renovate it to accommodate the twentyfirst century allans office was half its original size subdivided by means of a partition wall the only view from his remaining window was of a ghastly seventies office block to the rear of the building along with everyone else at his level allan worked to monthly targets his roster of high net worth clients had been underperforming of late and he should have been making a few calls maybe arranging lunches or predinner drinks the better to talk them into sticking some more of their money the banks way he knew that if asked mike mackenzie would come on board as a client but then they would cease to be just friends the transaction would sit between them changing everything but then who was allan kidding they were no longer just friends theyd pulled off a heist together and allan now had something hed always wanted at least theoretically he owned two paintings that first caledonian despite its muscle its own extensive portfolio of art and its own curator could never possess and he hated the fact he didnt think it was simple cowardice that had convinced him to hand the paintings over to mike for safe keeping it was just that the coultons didnt mean anything to him he realised hed have been as happy with westies reproductions and at least he could have displayed those his fingers drifted over a nick on his chin hed been shaving this morning not really concentrating hadnt slept much either not since saturday he tossed and turned and imagined himself in a police cell a courtroom a prison you were a bloody fool allan he said out loud not that any of it had been his idea not really gissing had come up with the original notion and mike had fleshed it out without mike as a conduit to chib calloway theyd probably never have gone ahead with it allans role had been secondary negligible christ almighty he sounded as if he was explaining himself to the prosecutor when the alarm bell sounded he jolted upright but it was only the phone the buzzer signalling an internal call he picked it up allan cruikshank speaking he said stifling a yawn front desk mr cruikshank theres a gentleman here to see you allans appointment diary was open in front of him empty till midafternoon he knew what the receptionist was going to say but still felt a rush of cold at her words hes with the police detective inspector ransome shall i send him up can you tell him im in the middle of a meeting allan waited while his message was relayed he says hes happy to wait the receptionist trilled and hell only need five minutes of your time then tell him to wait there in the lobby ill be another quarter of an hour or so allan slammed the phone down and jumped to his feet the window looked inviting four floors to the waiting roadway and oblivion but he knew it only opened an inch and a half nobody at first clay wanted an accident if he exited his office and walked towards the lifts there was a stairwell for use in a fire he didnt know where it would bring him out though maybe into the very lobby where his nemesis was waiting hell and damnation he muttered picking up the phone again mike wasnt answering at home so allan tried his mobile this time he got through hello the voice said that bloody detectives here allan blurted out wants to talk to me he knows mike he knows youd better get yourself over here who is this in horror allan studied the display hed transposed two digits of mikes number he ended the call squeezed shut his eyes and felt like weeping eventually he took a deep breath and tried again making sure this time that it was mike who answered its got to be about the heist mike he explained youve got to help me by rushing over there mike asked after a lengthy pause and what message would that send allan youve got to brazen it out why the hell is he here whos been talking hes fishing thats all you dont know that we wont know anything until youve talked to him have you got something you can take to calm down maybe if someone whacked me with a hammer as the words left allans mouth he regretted them he didnt want mike getting ideas ideas he might take to his new best friend chib calloway allan swallowed hard and took a nice deep breath ill be fine mike sorry if i overreacted call me when youre done with him mikes voice was all steel always supposing im allowed one phone call the joke was weak but mike laughed anyway just be yourself allan youre a dealmaker remember that and ransomes not even part of the official investigation as far as i can tell hes been on chibs case hes probably sniffing around anyone who knows him but how does he know theres a chance he saw us at the auction and maybe at the shining star afterwards so he knows were interested in art and drinking you can bet ill be on his list too but youve barely met chib allan and thats all you need to tell him okay allan agreed thanks mike call me straight after sure allan put the receiver down then picked it up again and spoke to his secretary asked her to head down to reception in a couple of minutes and sign in a mr ransome he didnt bother saying who ransome was then again shed know by days end the receptionists and secretaries were as thick as thieves allan spent the time trying to compose himself he pulled some paperwork from his drawer and spread it across the desk switched on the tv to the stock market screen by the time the knock came he was seated behind his desk sleeves rolled up calculator to hand jacket draped over the back of his executive chair come in he called ransome was younger than hed expected and dapper with it hed known hnws with less style nice place to work was the detectives opening gambit allan had stood up long enough to shake hands across the desk he gestured for ransome to sit down lot of expensivelooking art on the walls ransome continued down in the lobby all along the corridors first caledonian has its own curator allan informed him our portfolio is worth in excess of twenty million ransome gave a whistle do they ever let the staff borrow something for a couple of nights not at my lowly level of management allan attempted a selfdeprecating smile whats this all about inspector i admit im intrigued youre a hard man to track down mr cruikshank the hoops ive had to go through the detective shook his head slowly all i had was your name you see that and the name of your bank ever had any trouble with moneylaundering certainly not the regulations make sure of that a banker would be a useful contact though wouldnt he if you did want to launder money quite the opposite as i say were obliged by law to report unusual levels of activity to the authorities ransome didnt seem particularly interested in any of allans answers nevertheless the questions kept coming i understand you work with high net worth individuals mr cruikshank thats right is michael mackenzie a client that comes under the heading of privileged information inspector has something happened to mike you do know him then weve been friends for over a year and charles calloway ransome broke off sorry you probably know him better as chib i really dont know him at all we ran into him in a wine bar one day but thats about it this would be the shining star wine bar just along the road from here thats right allan had been expecting a flippedopen notebook and pen maybe a hulking junior colleague standing against the door like a silent sentry but ransome just sat here with his fingertips pressed together one leg crossed over the other when you say ran into him i mean just that he saw us looking at him came to the table and gave a couple of scowls and snarls hes good at that is calloway a professional id say and this was just yourself and mr mackenzie another friend was there professor robert gissing ransome raised an eyebrow i seem to know that name wasnt he the one called in to run an eye over those paintings from the granton heist thats him hes head of the college of art ransome gave a thoughtful nod so you didnt speak to chib at the auction which auction the one a couple of weeks back and again funny coincidence just along the road from here id no idea mr calloway had an interest in auctions allan leaned back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his head ransome just smiled and was thoughtful again id really like to know what this is all about inspector you say that calloway came over to your table and a few words were exchanged yes so what was your friend mackenzie doing joining calloway at the bar chatting and sharing a drink must have been after i left allan improvised loyaltys an admirable quality mr cruikshank when its not misplaced what do you think those two would have had to talk about i dont know schooldays maybe schooldays allan licked his parched lips they were at the same school for a short time the way the detective nodded to himself told allan that this wasnt news to him might start to explain why theyve been spending so much time together recently ransome speculated i happened to see them at the national gallery and at that auction and at the shining star and i know theyve been taking little drives together sure you werent there with them mr cruikshank i can assure you i wasnt ransome leaned forward well what about this then calloway has been to mr mackenzies home at henderland heights what does that suggest to you mr cruikshank it doesnt suggest anything to me your friend mackenzie collects art doesnt he someone at the auction house told me as much then he takes a known criminal on a tour of our national collection after which they attend an auction together checking out the going rate for various artists doesnt that begin to suggest anything to you mr cruikshank nothing allan entwined his hands more tightly around his head willing himself not to leap up from his chair and grab the cop by the throat but then that might look suspicious mightnt it instead he apologised for not offering ransome a coffee or tea your secretary already did that sir i said i wouldnt be staying but you look like you could do with a cold drink if i might suggest ransome made a gesture and allan realised that his armpits were showing and his shirt was damp with sweat he lowered his hands into his lap the dectective sighed and reached into his jacket pocket lifting out a small cassetteplayer while i remember he said would you take a quick listen to this he held the machine out in front of him at arms length and pressed a button allan listened to westies call to the emergency services strangest bloody thing white van dumping bodies as the call ended ransome hit the stop button does that voice ring a bell mr cruikshank allan shook his head slowly and determinedly our forensic teams hanging on to the original recording the detective said studying the tapeplayer before slipping it back into his pocket amazing what they can do these days an engine turning over in the background they can isolate the sound and match it to a specific brand of car isnt that incredible sir incredible allan echoed thinking of his audi had its engine been running he couldnt remember now thered be immunity you know the detective was saying as he rose to his feet i mean im just thinking aloud here but anyone who helped us put chib calloway behind bars would be a hero pure and simple dont tell me youve never wanted to be a hero mr cruikshank ive told you i barely know the man but youre good friends with michael mackenzie and mackenzie knows him so talk to mike ransome nodded slowly thought id try you first you strike me as the rational sort the sort whod see sense ransome was halfway to the door but he paused again it wouldnt just be immunity mr cruikshank it would be anonymity too were hot on that these days for people who help take the likes of calloway off the streets he took a final look around the room you had a breakin here didnt you at first caly i mean few years back now yes rumour at the time was calloway was responsible then hes not very clever we dont tend to keep bullion on the premises still got away with a pretty penny though ransom sniffed and rubbed a finger along the underside of his nose another rumour at the time he had help help someone on the inside just what exactly are you getting at allans voice had hardened nothing mr cruikshank just that hes got previous that way contacts people he can scare or bribe into helping him good of you to take the time to see me funny though when i asked your secretary she said you didnt have any meetings this morning he gave a little bow and a smile then tapped his watch told you i only needed five minutes and with that he was gone yes thought allan five minutes to shred a mans nerves and send his whole life crashing to smithereens around him he needed some fresh air needed to walk off some of the adrenalin but he couldnt leave now ransome might be loitering he had to call mike tell him everything mike was the one the detective was interested in mike could lead him straight to calloway there wasnt even any evidence in allans home what did he have to fear he found himself pacing the room then realised there was something on ransomes chair something that hadnt been there before the detectives business card with a mobile phone number scrawled along the bottom when his own mobile rang he answered it without thinking whoever you are the voice said i dont take kindly to practical jokes it was the man whod answered the first time allan had tried mike the wrong number allan muttered an apology ended the call and turned his phone off altogether mike could wait everything could wait until he was good and ready to deal with it mike mackenzie was staring at his mobile willing it to ring he was seated in a stockbridge café having been for a walk along the water of leith it had always been his preferred route when he had things to think about problems to solve but this time it had worked miraculously hed been wondering what to do about the threat from westies girlfriend one call to his bank would see the transfer of an additional twenty k into the students account but mike hadnt been quite ready to make that decision maybe gissing could warn westie off or at least talk some sense into him but the professor was answering neither messages nor texts mikes latest communication to him had warned that ransome was closing in and would probably be knocking on both their doors so far there had been no reply but then just as mike was pushing open the door to the café a text had arrived sorry about alice dont do anything w which was fine just so long as westie had the measure of his girlfriend but at least mike could file that particular problem in the pile marked pending the call from allan had put him right off his goat cheese and rocket ciabatta why didnt he ring now could ransome really have taken him to the station for further questioning pockets emptied belt tie and shoelaces removed was that how they did it always supposing im allowed one phone call had allan cracked and told the detective everything when the phone did ring it caught mike by surprise so that he spluttered some of the coffee back into its cup but when he looked at the display it was laura rather than allan laura he said answering look sorry i walked out on you it was bloody rude of me and ive been meaning to call and apologise never mind that she was saying theres a full inventory underway at the warehouse a thankless task id imagine he was trying for levity just bloody listen will you the rumour is theyre finding gaps gaps in the collection the missing paintings mikes brow furrowed but the paintings were in the van not those paintings the others the ones still missing the ones the gang got away with got away with he echoed his head spinning how many are we talking about half a dozen so far and theyre not halfway through the stock check a fergusson sketchbooks gone too plus another book with signed plates by picasso jesus lauras voice turned imploring if theres anything you know mike anything you can tell the police what youve got to speak to them or you could always call ransome ill act as gobetween if you like im sure if the paintings could somehow be chanced upon you know if they were left abandoned somewhere nice of you to assume this has got anything to do with me mike realised he was being studied by a woman at another table she was probably wondering why he was stabbing his cooling ciabatta with a knife he managed a smile and put the knife down has ransome spoken to you yet i told you laura hes not even working the case its chib calloway hes after and his paranoia has extended as far as allan and the professor and me why allan what why put allan at the top of that list mike rubbed at his temples trying to dull the pain there was a pharmacy next door to the café and he decided he needed some aspirin a couple of hundred should do it no reason he eventually said knowing the preceding silence had already given the lie to this if calloway has the paintings maybe you could talk to him laura was suggesting now did he look to you like the sort of man you can reason with are you trying to tell me he does have them christ no i dont know anything about these missing paintings what im saying is i dont want to be the one making that accusation to chib calloways face mike just how involved are you unattached at the moment as it happens the sound she made was a sigh of frustration im fine laura this is all going to peter out trust me can i do that though mike can i really trust you it was an excellent question mike thought he was wondering who he could trust now that the game had changed did anyone have the new rulebook to hand alice was late back from the cinema shed been hosting another of her quiz nights in the bar themed this time the subject being american new wave didnt seem to matter the same team of four always won which probably explained why the turnout had started to drop it was a problem and she didnt have an answer to it as yet as she climbed the steps to the flats front door she tried to remember if there was any food waiting for her hell with it they could always phone out she reckoned mike would come across with the extra money not all of it obviously thered be some negotiating but enough to keep her and her dreams on track she was surprised she hadnt heard from him maybe it was time for another text issuing a deadline as she started to turn her key in the lock the door was flung open from within westie was bugeyed brandy on his breath his clothes looked ready for the bin what the hell have you done he shouted hauling her inside by the arm and slamming shut the door no idea she bristled care to give me a clue you stupid stupid bitch hed turned away from her stalking into the living room his hands held to his head as though to prevent it from splitting open shed seen him in some manic states before but never like this look she said all i did was ask for a bit more money no harm in trying i take it mikes been on to you mike mike saliva was flying from the corners of his mouth if only he turned to confront her remember i told you there was a sleeping partner id to paint an extra fake for him turns out its chib calloway alice looked at him blankly whos chib calloway hes edinburghs equivalent of the mafia not the sort of guy you want on your back so mikes gone running to him hes the sleeping partner the one who loaned us the guns the van the extra pairs of hands calloway came to see me today at the art college he had two messages for me one we dont get any extra cash two he wants me to do more paintings what for does it matter thing is your harebrained scheme has gone tits up and im the one in the shit how could you be so stupid alices face had hardened i was thinking of us westie thinking of you they werent treating you right at least they were letting me live which is more thanll happen if i dont come good for chib calloway i cant believe youd do this to me do what try blackmailing mike she leaned forward so that her face was an inch from his get a grip westie you could just say no to this guy whats he going to do if he tries anything we go straight to the nearest cop shop westie stared at her for a moment then slumped on to the sofa elbows on knees hands still wrapped around his head you dont get it he muttered you dont get it oh here we go alice rolled her eyes the tortured artist bit like i havent seen it before a hundred times just leave will you leave her voice was rising again its my bloody flat in case youve forgotten he didnt move didnt speak ill leave all right she stated into the silence just you try and stop me westie heard her grab her things and go when he finally looked up the room was blurred with tears ransome and his chis were in a pub on rose street standing either end of the bar and communicating by mobile phone chis stood for covert human intelligence source this being the polices new favoured terminology but ransome knew precisely what glenn really was he was his grass his nark his snout his snitch his mole in chib calloways organisation itll be you running the show soon he was reminding the hoodlum even though ransome had no intention of allowing glenn to step into calloways shoes only thing hed be stepping into was the same prison cell as his boss and wouldnt that make for fun and games once chib knew the part his onetime lieutenant had played in his downfall chibs men all trust you ransome continued so all we need to do now is nail him for that art heist more than a dozen paintings missing at the latest count must be tucked away somewhere i thought the thieves left them in the van keep up glenn inventory on the warehouse keeps throwing up pictures that are no longer there so they did get away with some looks like nothing in your bosss house or the boot of his car ive not had the boot open in a while i could take a peek and while youre at it make some excuse to get inside his home too have a rake around where else could he be stashing them you sure its him in the first place come on glenn he must have let something slip nothing then he didnt want you in on it maybe youre on the way to the subs bench glenn you and johnno maybe chibs building himself a new team ransome lifted the whisky glass to his nose smelling seaweed and peat smoke and maybe a hint of hot road tar the produce of a coastal distillery somewhere far to the north and west of edinburgh just the one drink though he had sandras vietnamese duck to look forward to he forced himself to stare straight ahead at the row of optics rather than try for eye contact with glenn there were plenty of drinkers between them what is it youre drinking glenn he asked smirnoff ice cheers mr ransome i wasnt offering to buy you one if i go telling the barman to send a drink to the other end of the bar itll look like a pickup then why did you ask just curious same as im curious about the whereabouts of these pictures funny thing glenn said but remember i told you wed been to henderland heights mike mackenzies flat yes well on the way back chib got a call someone called edward but pronounced funny and chib said something to him about collateral and how it wasnt even posted as missing what did he mean by that dunno he realised johnno and me were being nosy and made sure we were out of earshot for the rest hes got to have it stashed somewhere whatever it is theres the clubs and pubs theyve all got cellars and storerooms plus the snooker and pool halls dozens of places you could ask around see if chibs made any visits without you knowing if he gets wind of it make sure he doesnt are you absolutely sure mike mackenzies a recent addition to chibs social scene im sure but mr ransome maybe that means mackenzies hiding the paintings for chib the thought had crossed my mind tough to get a search warrant though ransome gave a loud sigh look glenn its all very simple really if we can get your boss for the warehouse theres no fallout no ones going to know you played any role in it at all makes your accession all the easier my what ransome closed his eyes for a second you taking chibs place as the citys number one he explained right the pubs double doors flew open as a stag party burst in easy enough to spot the bridegroomtobe reduced to his underpants shoes and tshirt the latter defaced by graffiti and egg yolk ransome angled his phone away from the fresh wave of noise keep your eyes and your ears open glenn next day or so is going to be crucial believe me chibs empire is ready to fall make or break time for you my friend you ready to ascend your bosss throne ready for what glenn had pressed a finger to his ear holding the phone more closely to the other i didnt catch that mr ransome too much noise hello mr ransome glenn took a few steps back the better to see the far end of the bar but the detective had already headed out into the night it was eight oclock on wednesday morning before mike got through to chib they arranged to meet at ten at the disused snooker hall mike had been cagey on the phone keeping it short intent on saving his fury for the meeting itself but then he reminded himself who and what chib was and revised his strategy accordingly chib was standing behind one of the unlit tables when mike pushed open the door the gangsters face was in shadow as he rolled a series of reds against the opposite cushion studying their trajectories and momentum whats on your mind michael chib asked his voice refrigerator cold i think you know lets pretend i dont mike slid his hands into his jacket pockets the warehouse is missing a few paintings chib a dozen or more as it turns out which kind of blows our brilliant plan to smithereens they may not have noticed the switch but they know a robberys happened because theyre suddenly short twelve masterpieces one snooker ball hit another and sent it spinning on its axis i saw it on the news chib intoned one reason i was off limits last night if wed met then i mightve been a bit hotheaded still cant say im too thrilled about it though if youd thought about it for one second one single solitary second youd have realised they were bound to do a full stock check mike paused or did your four bright young things just get greedy and grab the oils for themselves sorry mike im a bit confused calloway leaned down with his elbows on the rim of the table his face was visible now eyes peering up at mike didnt you use those same four guys to cover the guards and the gatehouse leaving you and your friends to empty the vaults mike burst into an incredulous laugh youve had all night to come up with a story and thats the best you can do im tempted to say the same thing youre not seriously suggesting we lifted those paintings are we supposed to have tucked them under our jumpers how would i know i wasnt there but then neither were my boys they were keeping an eye on the hostages while you went about your business when are they supposed to have pulled off this miracle did they make themselves invisible so they could get past you in the vaults without anyone noticing mike thumped a fist down hard against the green baize a cloud of dust flew from it why the hell would we go to the bother of stealing paintings wed taken all the trouble of switching them so nobody would ever be the wiser maybe one of you got greedy i would know if that had happened really you were standing over your pals the whole time as they emptied their vaults chib was silent for a moment then exhaled noisily you talk a good game mike i could almost use someone like you on my team this is crazy mike spun away from the table running his hands through his hair stopping just short of tearing out a few clumps ill tell you whats crazy chib stated quietly your pal allan was paid a visit yesterday by ransome how do you know that chib was standing upright again his grin just showed against the shadows much like the cheshire cats i had johnno tail the bastard for a few hours wanted to know what hes up to ransome paid a visit to first caledonian bank i remember you telling me thats where allan works its not a big deal allan called me at the time to tell me it was happening and chib was slowly rounding the table and nothing i spoke to allan afterwards it was a fishing expedition thats all you sure about that look is this you laying down some smoke right now its these missing paintings im bothered about who else was in the warehouse westie and allan not the professor he stayed in the van couldnt risk him being idd chib was by now face to face with mike what about afterwards how do you mean chib rubbed his jaw he had neglected to shave for a couple of days and there was a rasping noise as his fingers crossed the greying stubble ive heard of it happen a bank gets turned over doesnt have to be a bank could be a petrol station supermarket anywhere really once the thieves have hoofed it the staff call the cops but then theyve got that five or tenminute wait all this stuffs still lying around the place and whatever goes walkies will be blamed on the robbers mikes eyes narrowed youre saying the guards at the warehouse but wouldnt the visitors see something he shook his head slowly no im not buying that youd rather convince yourself it was me mike could feel the mans breath on his face garlic had played some part in the previous evenings meal there was a hint of milky tea too breakfast probably only three of my guys he went on were in the actual warehouse meaning they mustve taken what four paintings apiece what in gods name were they wearing tents chib offered a cold chuckle no my friend this was down to your lot and im sure if i ask them nicely westie and allan will spill their guts literally if need be what about asking your own guys first i dont need to wouldnt be the first time a smalltime crook had given in to temptation their mutual staring contest lasted twenty seconds chib the first to blink as he reached into his jacket for his phone mike concentrated on keeping his breathing steady his demeanour solid not much sleep last night too many questions of course hed been turning over some of the same suspicions chib had just voiced little phrases had kept recurring no such thing as the perfect crime honour among thieves traitor in the ranks chibs eyes were on him as he punched in some numbers mike knew he was right no way those four had been hiding anything under their jackets and nowhere in the back of the van to stash so many extra paintings sketchpads and illustrated books mike needed to think needed to talk to allan and westie hed decided not to call them straight away see if either decided to call him first as soon as they heard the news not a peep on the other hand maybe they were just following orders gissings orders lie low glenn chib was saying i want you to round up billy kev dodds and bellboy get them round to the snooker hall pronto as he snapped shut his phone mikes sounded westies number on the screen mind if i take this outside he asked chib someone i shouldnt know about just personal mike said hauling open the door outside on the pavement he took a few deep gulps of air as he answered the call hello he said wondering whether to expect westie himself or the girlfriend alice mike is that you westies voice what can i do for you mike asked i just wanted to i want to say sorry id no idea alice was going to send you that text and it stands to reason she didnt really mean it we dont i dont want any more money or a painting come to that im quite happy with everything he didnt sound it youve got enough paintings then i suppose so westie sounded confused and how manys that westie what do you mean just the derasse you know that mike so are we okay now yeah im not sure westie see ive got a favour to ask mikes shoulders tensed the street was midmorning quiet a newsagents at the corner a secondhand shop still waiting to open tenements across the way but no one at the grimy windows i might not be in the mood he told westie i can appreciate that mike but ive apologised now so maybe you can you know what get calloway off my case the words were just short of a scream so that they came over in a distorted crackle i wasnt aware he was on your case you didnt send him round here to scare me off mikes brow furrowed whats he been saying westie he wants me to do more fakes for him loads of them and im scared mike scared to say no but scared of whatll happen if i say yes mike had turned round to face the windowless snooker hall it was called diamond jims the paint peeling from its signage had there ever been a diamond jim and if so what had happened to him why does he want them westie you think i was going to ask hes a monster mike everybody knows that he threw a guy off the scott monument once threatened to mike corrected him did he tell you what paintings he wants i dont think he knows yet says theyve got to be like the ones we took you know unlikely to be posted missing mike found himself nodding have you seen the news westie christ no has something happened to her mike wasnt really listening hed spotted a bag of rubbish in the pend that separated the two tenement blocks it had burst open and a rat was feasting on the contents slithering over the remains of takeaway meals and beer cans it dawned on mike that he was a very long way from home westie had called chib a monster hard to disagree and after all wasnt edinburgh the very city that had spawned dr jekyll and mr hyde mike placed a hand against the snooker halls dank defaced wall and felt it leave a thin residue all across his palm a hellish spot he thought to himself so why go back inside why not run for it and try to forget that he had once known anyone called chib calloway somehow he didnt think it would be that simple and the first to flee well they would become the prime suspect wouldnt they what he asked into the phone has something happened to her westie had asked and now he was saying something else alice the voice repeated cracking with emotion i dont know what im going to do how do you mean i had a go at her last night about her sending you that text and calloway and everything she walked out mike shes been gone all night mike swore under his breath and rolled his eyes heavenwards youve got to go after her he spoke quietly and calmly into the mouthpiece despite his pounding heart but he noticed that he was having to hold the phone in both hands to stop it being shaken out of his grip youve got to bring her back sort things out between you get her to see sense she knows everything westie and shes got less to lose than the rest of us how do you mean if she goes to the police theres practically nothing they can charge her with she wouldnt do that and if shes feeling like youve turned against her well whats to stop her trying a spot of blackmail again she wont not now she knows calloways involved she might so heres what you have to do westie you call her text her go knock on her friends doors any family that cinema she works in you track her down and then you drop to your knees and tell her youre sorry shes got to come back westie shes got to there was silence on the line for a moment then the sound of sniffles being wiped away ill try mike what about calloway first things first westie let me know soon as you find her find who chib was standing in the doorway to mikes left mike ended the call and thrust the phone back into his jacket nothing he lied making a show of checking his watch you reckon your lads will be here soon i have other business they wont be coming mike chib looked up and down the street as if for witnesses i changed my mind we both know this has nothing to do with them but from the sweat on your face and the way your hands are shaking id say it could have something to do with that call you just took it was from westie mike confessed rubbing at his forehead the day was muggy his shirt was sticking to his back chib thought for a moment then offered a smile he told you about my little scheme bit late to start replacing the missing paintings idve thought chib shook his head slowly youre not even close so what are you up to mike folded his arms trying to control the tremors calloway sniffed the air as he considered his answer seems to me he eventually offered were all up to something mike even you that means theres going to be winners and losers want to take a bet which side ill be on now come back indoors and well grab a couple of cold drinks chib was holding open the door mike stared at it a scene from goodfellas flashed through his mind the heros wife offered a fur coat by the bad guy all she had to do was walk into the warehouse and pick one out ive got to be going chib seemed to read his thoughts of course you do mike he said quietly but do me a favour will you whats that a dark smile spread across the gangsters face tell westie i hope alice comes home took your time ransome complained into his phone he was at his desk doing some actual real work for a change that was exactly how ds ben brewster had put it actual real work sarky little bastard but now glenn had called and he had some information for him ive got good news and bad the voice rumbled i always like the bad news first glenn that way theres something to look forward to chib had you tailed yesterday ransomes grip on the receiver tightened why didnt you warn me johnnos just told me ransome wondered if johnno had been there when hed visited first caledonians hq had to give the man credit ransome hadnt spotted him what time was this about eleven till three meaning chib probably now did know ransome had paid allan cruikshank a visit that might work out okay actually chib turning the screws one side of the banker ransome the other so whats the good news he asked ive got four names for you chib told me he wanted to talk to them then changed his mind i reckon theyre the ones he was recruiting glenn recited the names while ransome jotted them down so who are they bellboys the only name i seem to know same here ransome sighed loudly okay then heres an easy one wheres chib now diamond jims in gorgie the snooker hall ransome tapped his pen against his notepad thanked his chis and ended the call complaints were rising into the air someone in the crowded office had farted clipboards were being waved like fans groans and pleas to try opening a window the smell hadnt reached him yet but if he rose to leave he knew he would get the blame so he held his ground and studied the names on his pad billy kev dodds and bellboy bellboy was a hard wee bastard the others would be pals of his known to local coppers no doubt add mike mackenzie and calloway himself and you had a posse big enough to pull off the heist the gangs all here he muttered to himself he still wasnt sure about allan cruikshank and professor gissing oh he reckoned they knew about it knew all about it mackenzie would have taken them into his confidence bragging showing off making them complicit making them accessories which meant one of them might just squeal ransome hadnt had a proper talk with gissing yet from what hed seen so far of the old man he thought he knew the type probably marched against the bomb in the fifties liked the idea of a student riot in but couldnt get anyone else in edinburgh to agree with him typical trendy leftie grown old still antipolice and unlikely to cooperate as a result leaving the banker allan cruikshank ransome intended letting him stew another day max before a second visit trusting the man didnt have an aneurysm in the interim but now that the detective had started to consider the professor he realised there might be some fun to be had there too before that though he had to pass these four new names around get a minion to run a check hed managed to shift a further halfinch in depth from his intray time for a break he persuaded himself tearing the page from the notebook mike had spent a fruitless halfhour at the art college gissings secretary wasnt around and neither was he the door to his outer office was open but the inner sanctum was locked tight there was paperwork on the secretarys desk and her phone was ringing mike was tempted to pick up just in case it was gissing himself but instead he placed his hand against the coffee mug next to the telephone there was some residual warmth meaning the secretary couldnt be far off unless shed clocked off early in the end he scribbled a note and slid it under gissings door just the three words need to meet and his initials heading back downstairs he decided to visit westie the basement was labyrinthine plenty of students were at work but no one had seen westie eventually a bearded and bespectacled man somewhat older than the undergraduate norm and standing in a studio half filled with hay bales told him that westie was in the next room along except that he wasnt there his door was ajar and inside there were signs of recent activity seven paintings framed and prepped a couple were waiting for hooks to be hammered into the wall against which they rested the hooks were on the floor next to them as was a small hammer mike hoped that westie was on the hunt for alice he hoped he wasnt hunched on the sofa in his flat getting stoned and maudlin you a dealer it was the beard from the next studio along he was wiping his hands down the front of his overalls it took mike a moment to realise he probably meant art dealer rather than any other kind mike shook his head there was a guy here yesterday the man continued looked like a bouncer i asked westie afterwards who he was said he was a dealer takes all sorts i suppose the man was shuffling back towards his work excuse me mike called to him is westies stuff any good do you think define good the man said moving out of view mike thought about this and decided that he couldnt he headed upstairs again and pulled open the door to the outside world someone else was coming in so he took a step back the man made to pass him with a nod of thanks then stopped in his tracks mike realised who it was ransome he stared at the floor but too late youre michael mackenzie the detective said mike pretended to look surprised thats right he said do we know one another has your good friend chib calloway not mentioned me to you or allan cruikshank come to that ransome was holding out his hand waiting for mike to reciprocate mike shook it allan he asked no i dont think he has do you work with him ransome laughed some students wanted to get past so that the two men had to move back inside the reception area im a police officer mr mackenzie surely mr cruikshank must have said something to you about me why should he because im investigating your friend chib calloway you keep calling him that but i wouldnt class him a friend what then an associate would that be nearer the mark we were at school together tynecastle high bumped into one another again recently and found that you share an interest in fine art ransome mused does that explain your trip here today mr mackenzie im a bit of a collector mike offered a shrug degree shows coming up and i was hoping for a sneak preview ransome nodded along with this but looked far from convinced so you werent just warning professor robert gissing not to speak to me mike managed a laugh why in gods name would i do that he cut the end of the sentence off with a little cough hed been about to add the word inspector but couldnt remember if ransome had identified himself as such hed already slipped up with laura couldnt have it happen again you dont deny youre friends with professor gissing i certainly know him a damned sight better than i do chib calloway youll know where i can find him then he has an office on the top floor i cant say for certain hell be there well ill try anyway ransome smiled and made to move past mike whats this all about first allan cruikshank and now professor gissing you seem to be talking to half my friends mike was trying for levity but ransomes stare was steely you cant be that short of friends mr mackenzie surely he seemed about to leave it at that but then paused ive just been to see a man called jimmy allison too much to expect that you know him too ransome watched mike shake his head he was the victim of a mugging night before the granton warehouse heist youll have heard something about that mr mackenzie the heist sure mike agreed well this curator expert in his field he lives just a short hike from here one of those newish blocks of flats by the canal yes only he wasnt there his wifes up to high doh called the police even only no one thought to tell me hes gone missing you see since yesterday shes worried hes got concussion christ first alice and now this could have fallen in the canal mike eventually commented is that what you think mr mackenzie ransomes jaw was jutting thing about mr allison is he knows professor gissing half of edinburgh knows robert gissing mike paused you cant think that the professor had anything to do with ransome responded with a twitch of the mouth only bit of good news ive got for you mr mackenzie is that having spoken to you i dont think its your voice on the tape but pretty soon now im going to know who made that call what call ask your friend allan ransome gave a little bow as he moved away mike watched him disappear into the building then made good his escape breathing hard allison was missing what the hell was that about maybe concussion was the truth of it poor sod could have ended up in the canal a tap on the head was all that had been requested and required but mike should have been there to make sure maybe allan was right maybe the best thing to do was ditch the paintings and phone in a tipoff problem was hate still had his hands on one of them plus the forgeries might be traceable back to westie once identified as such and mike would need to convince westie and gissing to give their paintings back you wanted this mike he told himself oh christ gissing mike slapped at his forehead say the secretary had returned say she unlocked the door the detective would find mikes note lying there he slapped himself a couple more times for luck then noticed that passing students portfolios tucked under their arms were staring at him performance art he explained striding towards another of his favourite thinking places the meadows by six oclock the offices of first caledonian were closed and allan cruikshank felt it safe to start answering his home telephone checking his messages he discovered that the halfdozen calls hed ignored during the course of the day had all been from his secretary wondering where he was asking if he was ill telling him she was cancelling all his meetings there was nothing from mike or robert gissing and nothing from the detective allan had turned off his mobile phone and felt little compunction to switch it on again he had the feeling that the first person he spoke to hed end up telling them everything had he been a religious man he might have headed up leith walk to the catholic cathedral where confessionals doubtless awaited hed even considered margot but she would scold him and maybe even laugh at his plight relieved to have rid herself of such an idiotic specimen allans stomach had been growling since midmorning but he lacked an appetite hed sipped eight or nine glasses of tap water but still felt unquenched daytime tv had proved little solace one chat show aimed at housewives had contained a lengthy discussion about the international trade in stolen art and at the top of every hour thered been a news update which allan always switched off before the heist could be mentioned he was shaved and dressed in his work suit having woken up from a brittle shortlived sleep determined to go into the office as usual his resolve had lasted as far as the front door with his hand ready to turn the lock hed frozen there was a whole terrifying world out there this flat was his only refuge most of the rest of the day hed stayed by his window wondering if ransome or some other authority figure would exit the police station and take the short walk to the tenement pressing the bell marked cruikshank there were no signs of any media interest patrol cars came and went plainclothes officers ambled outdoors for cigarettes and conversation with his window open ears straining all allan could ever hear were birds in the trees and the rumble of buses on leith walk he could take one of those buses and lose himself elsewhere or a train south an aeroplane headed overseas he had a passport and a couple of credit cards only one of them nearing its spending limit what was stopping him did he want to get caught ransomes card was in his wallet giving off some kind of weak radiation so that he was always aware of it an elevendigit phone number was all that stood between him and a kind of atonement what was he so afraid of letting mike and robert gissing down or the wrath of chib calloway seeing himself in the newspapers and the dock or slopping out with the other inmates seated on his living room floor his back to the wall he raised his knees and wrapped his arms around them his secretary would have left for the evening thered be no more phone calls from work if he could get through the rest of the evening maybe things would start to look a little brighter maybe tomorrow would be better maybe things would turn out all right it was nearly eleven that night by the time chib calloway got home hed decided to have a word with his young team after all a phone call wouldnt do it had to be face to face you looked someone in the eye you pretty much knew if they were lying to you he got the distinct feeling mike hadnt been lying whoever had snatched the daubs it hadnt been him that still left plenty of suspects but then the four kids hadnt seemed like they were lying either we did just what we were told to no more no less bellboy had stated acting as the groups spokesman missing half his teeth but still eloquent well compared to his comrades he was the rest of the day had been about meetings there was a lapdancing club on lothian road lease expiring and current management thinking of shifting their sphere of operations elsewhere chib had been asked if he wanted to take the place on as a going concern problem was he got the feeling the best girls would be moving on with their old employers and it would be tough finding the talent to replace them plus thered have to be a refit and hed been quoted seventyfive to a hundred k for a really outstanding job something to get the vips in who was kidding who you always stuck vip on the windows and the adverts but your clients were sleazebags and stag groups chib had done the clever thing asked johnno who the regular doormen were then given one of them a buzz as a result of which he learned that the place had been dying on its feet for the past three months wouldnt touch it with a bargepole mr calloway end of story chib had been waiting for other calls from hate from edvard kept checking his phone but nothing so far at days end he had dispensed with the services of glenn and johnno dropping them at one of his own pubs but declining their offer of a swift one on the drive home hed listened to a bit of dire straits always seemed to make the world a better place he parked the bmw in the driveway the garage belonged to the bentley and stood for a moment staring up at the night skys orange glow hed bought a telescope once from a place on the royal mile but hadnt had much success with it light pollution hed been told all the citys streetlamps so hed made the shop take it back with a full refund turned out later theyd given him twenty quid too much which hadnt bothered chib in the least some of his men wondered why he chose to live on a newbuild estate when he could have practically any house in edinburgh but those four and fivestorey georgian piles in the new town they just didnt do it for him too finicky and formal nor did he want rolling acres and stables and all of that which would have entailed leaving the city behind he was an edinburgh boy born and bred not too many could say the same whole streets filled with english accents not to mention the students tens of thousands of them but this was still chibs city and sometimes he couldnt help but love it to bits the house corner plot detached exshow home was in darkness a neighbour had warned him he should keep a light burning in the upstairs hall just to deter the thieves chib hadnt bothered pointing out that thieves werent quite that stupid did the neighbour think they skulked around the place wondering why whole families congregated on the upstairs landing thinking of it now chib had another chuckle to himself the neighbours were okay though never minded when he turned the volume up a bit or had some of the lads and a few girls round for a party his wife liz the house had been her idea theyd hardly been there a year when the cancer had started to eat away at her shed always got on with the neighbours and most of them had paid their respects at the funeral that might have been their first inkling that lizs husband was a man of substance the cortege had been vast consisting mainly of large gentlemen in dark glasses their movements choreographed by glenn and johnno little wonder the neighbours never complained about the noise he had yet another little chuckle then walked up to the door and slid the key into the lock another thing about the house tenyear warranty and the builders had thrown in an alarm system free of charge not that he ever used it once he had closed the door behind him he felt a sense of contentment this was where he could relax unwind forget all his worries a couple of whiskies and some trash tv the local indian restaurant would deliver so would his favourite pizza place and if he fancied fish and chips instead well the guy there would hop on to his moped too just because chib was chib but tonight all he wanted was the whisky maybe three or four of them to be honest just to shut out any lingering memories of mackenzie ransome and hate it was the amateurs he was most wary of people like hate and edvard and even ransome they knew how the game was played mackenzie and his crew were another matter entirely and that meant things could go wrong spectacularly wrong of course chib himself had been no more than peripheral if the cops came sniffing what was there to find he didnt give a toss if mackenzie the banker and the prof all went to jail what skin would it be off his nose then again it would be a blow no doubt about it if westie went with them with these thoughts running through his head he couldnt be anything but surprised to walk into the living room flick on the lights and see that someone was waiting for him there though not exactly of his own accord the man was bruised and battered bound and gagged he was seated on one of chibs dining chairs it had been dragged away from the table and placed in such a way that it would be the first thing chib saw when he walked through the door the mans eyes seemed to be pleading even though one of them was swollen shut and the other reduced to little more than a slit there was a crust of blood below the nose others either side of his mouth and trailing down into the top of his stained shirt from his left ear sweat was drying in what hair he had left to him and his shirt and trousers were torn this is mr allison hate said emerging from the kitchen he was eating a banana from the fruit bowl i know of course you do you worked him over first time round didnt you chib stabbed a finger in hates direction nobody he said quietly does this to me nobody comes into my house making all sorts of mess i dont think weve made a mess hate replied calmly he then dropped the banana skin on the floor and ground it into the carpet lizs carpet with the heel of a black cowboy boot youre tangling with the wrong man chib warned him breathing hard stoking himself up hate ignored him concentrating instead on jimmy allison the man flinched as hates hands reached towards him but all hate did was peel the length of silver tape from his mouth you know the rules mr allison hate reminded him then he turned his attention to chib while resting the palm of his hand against the crown of allisons head mr allison here as im sure youre aware is a curator at the national gallery of scotland his expertise is in nineteenth and twentiethcentury scottish art he has a soft spot for mctaggart so he tells me and also samuel bough hate bent down a little so his face was level with the curators is my pronunciation adequate mr allison with eyes screwed shut in fear allison nodded his agreement that it was it is perhaps an irony hate continued straightening up again that mr allison should suffer such similar mishaps in so short a space of time the perils of the world wide web im afraid his name materialized as someone in the area who might be able to tell me a little more about the painter samuel utterson our conversation when we finally got round to it was illuminating so much so that i decided mr allison should inspect dusk on rannoch moor chib closed his own eyes for a moment he knew what that meant it meant the curator now knew too much no way hate was going to let the poor old bastard walk away from this he started thinking of possible burial sites and watched as hate bent down beside allison again removing his hand from the mans head and running it down his face until it held him by the chin now hate was crooning to his hostage why dont you go ahead and share your conclusions with mr calloway here tell him what you told me mr allison allison swallowed hard as if trying to summon some saliva into his parched mouth and when his lips parted in the seconds before he started to speak chib realized pretty much exactly what the terrified man was going to say mike had been dreaming about trouble at sea for some reason he had dismissed his crew and set sail alone on a long voyage only to find himself unable to steer the craft there were too many buttons and switches and levers the maps made little sense though he had marked his destination sydney with a large x before long he had found himself in the middle of a storm and taking on water the spray stung his face and he realized he was soaked to the skin he awoke to find that his face really was wet someone was standing over him holding an empty glass he sat bolt upright and wiped at his eyes with one hand as he reached with the other for the light switch when the bedside lamp came on he saw that it was chib calloway holding the glass behind him stood two more men one of whom seemed to be at the mercy of the other what the hells going on mike spluttered blinking how did you get in here my friend hate seems to have a way with locks chib explained dont go thinking youre the only one its happened to now get yourself dressed still disorientated his mind a jumble of questions mike swung his legs from under the duvet but didnt rise to his feet a little bit of privacy he requested but chib shook his head slowly then startled mike further by dropping to all fours tutting chib reached beneath the bed and slid out the four paintings still havent learned have you i half expected to find them behind the sofa christ we could have been in and out of here with them while you were fast asleep chib rose to his feet again and tossed mikes trousers to him no time for modesty michael he warned him with a sigh mike got into his denims then reached for the tshirt draped over the back of his chair whats this all about he asked pulling it over his head know who this is chib asked mike didnt think he meant hate though hed recognized him almost immediately as for the man hate was holding upright the man with the pulverized face and bloodsoaked shirt well mike had been trying not to look at him at all he sat back down on the bed and slipped his feet into his shoes not a clue he said lifting his watch from the bedside table thats nice hate said meaning the watch cartier the santos even chib turned to stare at him ive got one at home hate explained then to mike i looked you up on the web mr mackenzie youre a wealthy man thats lucky means we can work something out perhaps first things first eh chib reminded him then turning to mike i was asking if you knew hates friend there his names jimmy allison ring any bells mikes eyes widened the specialist and now the recipient of two beatings which i think youll agree is a mite unfair chib paused for effect especially when nobodys laid a hand on you now get into that fucking living room were going to have words you and me he scooped up all four paintings and marched towards the door hate waited for mike to follow then brought up the rear with mr allison mike was still avoiding eye contact the mugging might have been gissings idea but hed gone along with it in fact hed told the professor it was genius hard now to justify his elation consequences had been missing almost entirely from the plot and what the hell was hate doing with allison anyway mike didnt doubt that the answers were waiting for him in the living room but feared what else might be there hate dumped the curator on one of the chairs the mans hands were tied behind him his mouth covered with tape mike thought about pouring himself a drink but wasnt sure his hand would be steady enough besides which the parchedlooking allison might see it as yet another small torture see this chib was saying hed placed the paintings on the coffee table and was pointing towards the sofa there was another picture displayed there its your utterson mike told him dusk on rannoch moor thats right and what did i do with it you gave it to hate mike had no idea where the conversation was going and what did hate do i dont know well have a think about it shitforbrains but hate had noticed the home cinema system pioneer he commented good make jesus will you shut up chib yelled at him mike wondered which was preferable that the soundproofing stop his neighbours downstairs hearing any of this or that they decide to call the police to say that something bad was happening in the penthouse chib had turned towards him again come to any conclusions yet mike rubbed at his eyes again and slicked back his hair at a guess hate decided he would verify the painting despite my warnings he went to mr allison here who is an authority on the artist and somehow mr allison had an accident and you came to me for help instead of heading for a and e mike held chibs stare for a full twenty seconds with a growl the gangster fetched the utterson from the sofa and held it four inches from mikes face im not exactly the expert here he snarled so maybe youll know better when exactly was this painted early twentieth century is that so well maybe youre right take a closer look in particular tell me whats going on in the bottom lefthand corner mike didnt know what to expect the artists signature most probably he saw heather and long blades of grass and a bit more heather right at the very corner chib suggested and then mike did see it and he screwed shut his eyes well the gangster prompted him looks like theres something lying in the grass halfhidden mike muttered and what does it look like to you mike a condom a used condom and can you enlighten us all why exactly would a painter of samuel uttersons reputation have felt the need to add that particular touch mike opened his eyes again its westie he stated its a sort of calling card of his he copies famous paintings then adds an anachronism like an airliner or a mobile phone or a condom chib added mike nodded his agreement see mike what i cant understand here what im really failing to get my head around is why you would do this to me you really thought i was so stupid i wouldnt notice in actual fact hate interrupted you did not notice this is me talking here chib yelled at him again i dont know anything about this mike said really i dont chib burst out laughing you can do better than that mike i promise you i cant because it happens to be the truth well well just go and ask westie then see what he has to say about it during his last few minutes of life but before we do that theres the small matter of my fee what id like from you mr michael mackenzie software millionaire is one hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds payable in cash that way hate here can return home job done the amount of grief you and your lot have caused me i should be asking for more but lets open proceedings at one seventyfive one eighty hate said chib pointed towards him one eighty with the gentleman at the back do i hear any advance on one eighty shall we say two hundred sir eyes boring into mikes going once just let me fetch my wallet mike drawled receiving a punch to the gut for his efforts his knees buckled hed never felt anything like it brute strength speed and accuracy he reckoned he might just about get through the next minute without vomiting on his own floor breathing would be good too chib had hunkered down in front of him grabbing him by the hair and yanking his face up so they were eye to eye am i in the mood for jokes the gangster spat there were flecks of white either side of his mouth i dont keep cash around the house mike said between gasps never know when someone might come waltzing in and even even making a request to my bank it takes time time to arrange that sort of money he sucked in more air plus as soon as i say cash alarm bells are going to ring moneylaundering hate agreed the banks have to inform the authorities and youre suddenly the bank of fucking scotland chib roared at him look mike said having regained most of his breath those four paintings are worth a lot more than the money youre asking why not just take three of them maybe leave me one he nodded towards mr allison weve got the very man here who can judge them authentic chib stared at him youve got some fucking nerve mike then over his shoulder towards hate what do you think want to take your pick hates response was to walk over to the coffee table lift the cadell beach scene and stick his fist straight through it calmly the huge man then lifted the monboddo the glorious portrait of beatrice and did exactly the same thing get the picture he said i think so mike answered with a fresh groan as chib released his hair he started to get to his feet checking that his knees would lock and hold him upright the painting hate had dropped it back on to the table was it beyond repair no way of telling and there sat allans two ugly offerings pristine and untroubled so what now he asked to nobody in particular we wait here till morning chib replied then a little trip to the bank followed by a friendly visit to our artforgercumdeadman mike had picked up the portrait of beatrice they cant all be fakes he said almost to himself all that matters is mine was chib stated big mistake but not my mistake chib the gangster shrugged his shoulders nevertheless youre the one with the money which the bank wont just hand over ever heard of transfers mike ive got accounts all over the place in any number of names the dough goes into one of those i close the account pronto and hate here gets his share hate didnt look thrilled by this scenario mike guessed the man had already been kept waiting longer than he liked why do you think westie did it mike asked chib well soon find out chib was studying allans two paintings one in either hand his own worthless utterson lay abandoned on the floor where anyone was welcome to step on it chib held one of the coultons in front of mr allison what do you think jimmy are these the real thing for a change without waiting for a reaction he turned towards mike maybe ill take them with me unless youve got any objection theyre allans not mine then you can sort it out with allan mikes eyes were on the curator he needed a diversion and poor mr allison was just about his only bet im really sorry about this he said quietly though he wasnt sure if allison had much hearing left i mean im sorry for whats about to happen to you the man was staring back at him now as best he could nothing wrong with his ears they need me mike continued to explain at least for another day or so ive got money you see and they want it but you mr allison theyre just about done with you and hate doesnt seem to me the type who likes loose ends you might promise on the heads of your grandkids that you wont go running to the cops but hates not about to take a risk like that shut it the scandinavian warned just thought he ought to know mike turned his attention to chib i really dont know what westie was playing at gissing checked all eight paintings he broke off starting to get the glimmer of a notion what chib prompted nothing want me to set hate on you youve seen what he can do to reinforce the point hate himself had taken a few steps forward it was as much of a chance as jimmy allison was going to get he was up on his feet and running the first thing he did was shove at the door nearest him which flew open as he tried closing it after him hate make a lunge into the gap chib was starting to laugh realizing that the curator had stumbled into mikes bedroom no other exits mike on the other hand knew exactly what he was doing he shouldercharged the offbalance gangster and did some running of his own down the hall towards the front door he flung it open and bounded down the stairs taking them three at a time as he ran from the building he was grateful to note that chib hadnt thought to bring his minders with him the bmw however was locked tight so mike flew past it making for the boundary wall he scrambled over it landing in a neighbours garden with only moonlight to guide him he crossed the lawn and heaved himself over into yet another garden a couple of cats on a windowsill glowered at him but at least there were no dogs meaning no barking one more wall and he was back on the roadway it was an alley locals used as a short cut too narrow for vehicles to get down he took it and kept moving he patted his trouser pockets doublechecking that he had his wallet that meant credit cards and cash but no phone and no keys to the flat always supposing he would ever dare to go back he tried not to think about the havoc hate and chib might be wreaking or how they might then vent their spleen on the hapless mr allison mikes own options were limited he could find a hiding place and wait there till morning growing chilled in the process or he could aim for a main road where a taxi might just find him after ten or fifteen minutes he paused to catch his breath crouched low behind a hedge the houses here were victorian three and four storeys high and semidetached some were used as small hotels for one mad second he considered a latenight checkin but he was still too close to home no rest for the wicked he told himself regaining a little of his breath damage report his knuckles were grazed and his shins and knees bruised there was a stabbing pain in his chest and his lungs were aflame he knew he should head straight to westies flat and warn him what was coming would chib know the students address if so it would be his first stop too you could always go to the cops he whispered out loud would that be enough to save allisons life but then what was he going to say and what was the point when chib hate and allison would be long gone from the flat he screwed shut his stinging eyes trying to impose some order on his thoughts say chib knew where to find westie mikes best course of action would then be to head for allans they could always call westie see if he was available to answer maybe he was wandering the streets seeking alice and come to think of it why was mike so worried the little bastard had kicked this whole thing off in the first place with a bit of help mike was forced to concede from his hiding place he heard the distinctive diesel chug of an approaching cab its brakes squealed as it stopped outside one of the hotels a middleaged couple got out talking loudly slurring their words mike peered over the hedge and reckoned he had a chance he tried to seem as nonchalant as possible as he emerged from hiding and stuck his arm in the air gesturing with his hand the driver had just stuck his roof light back on but turned it off again when he saw him mike climbed into the back almost overcome by the cloying perfume left behind by the woman he closed the door and slid the window down hungry for fresh air gayfield square he told the driver lucky you caught me the man responded id just about made up my mind to call it a night he was having trouble finding his passenger in the rearview mirror mike had slumped as far down into his seat as he could had an evening of it by the look of things the driver rattled on not that theres anything wrong with that weve all got to let off steam sometime havent we whole country would explode otherwise im sure thats true mike was on the lookout for a cruising bmw either that or two hulking figures on foot but the streets were empty citys been a bit dead the cabbie was saying only real problem ive got with the place nothing ever happens in edinburgh does it sir the look of horror on allans face did nothing but deepen as mike told his story the only moment of relief came when mike started to apologise that chib had got his hands on the coultons hes welcome to them allan had said sounding as though he honestly meant it and now that were shot of all our illgotten gains lets shop calloway to ransome and leave the professor in the lurch besides chib wouldnt hesitate to tell the police everything meaning you and me would still go away then theres westie to consider they tried the students mobile but it was only his messaging service after the beep mike left a warning to which allan added a yelled coda its your own stupid fault you moron mike ended the call i hope hes out somewhere and not just wasted or blotto if he knows whats good for him hell have left the country that might not be too far from the truth mike mused far as im concerned they can go rot him and his grasping girlfriend both allan had started to pace the room loosening his tie and undoing the top button of his shirt why are you dressed mike suddenly thought to ask its the middle of the night allan studied himself ive not been to bed yet you wear your tie in the house never mind all that what are we going to do mike thats the bigger question i knew something like this would happen i knew it would all go wrong well allan the first thing you can do is try calming down mike wanted to add that he was the one whose house had been broken into he was the one whod been threatened and assaulted whod had to flee for his life scared witless as he leapt from garden into garden he was the one known to chib and hate both the one they were blaming for everything looking at his friend however he doubted any of that would help allan was muttering about all that planning having gone down the drain so instead mike repeated his first instruction and watched as allan nodded distractedly taking off his glasses and rubbing at them with the corner of a handkerchief mike poured out more coffee without offering a refill to his friend and allowed his head a moments rest against the back of the chair he even let his eyelids droop for a few seconds but the image of chib calloways furious face made him open them again there was going to be hell to pay no doubt about it allan was staring at him what did westie think he was doing he was asking could he just not help himself had to leave some sort of bloody signature or was he having a go at us because he really did see us as the establishment and how come he didnt swap the forgery for the original at the warehouse was it maybe just a cockup the utterson was in your vault allan mike stated quietly what chibs utterson was one of the paintings you lifted from the warehouse then i dont understand are you saying we left the original painting in the back of the van and what about all these other paintings theyre saying have gone awol how many did we end up taking we need to speak to gissing mike commented after westie hell be the next person chib and hate will want a word with and then itll be us dont worry allan im sure youre parked solidly at the foot of his list this produced a thin smile you might be sorry about that but i can assure you im not the smile was enough to prise a laugh from mike which started allan off too shoulders heaving mike pinched the bridge of his nose allan was catching his breath and dabbing at the corners of his eyes how did we ever get into this mike he asked mike shook his head slowly never mind that lets concentrate on how were going to get out of it theres always this allan had produced something from the breast pocket of his shirt mike took it and peered at the tiny writing it was a business card belonging to di ransome dogeared and smudged and complete with his mobile phone number last resort he said tucking it into his wallet first off we go see gissing what if theyre waiting for us allans nerves were beginning to reassert themselves mike thought for a moment ive got a plan he told his friend well have to take your car though and ill explain on the way the cabbie had been right edinburgh was dead it was a perennial problem with the city it lacked the boisterousness to be found in larger cities like glasgow and newcastle lack of traffic meaning allans car would be easy to pick out but then they did have a slight advantage mike knew chibs bmw by sight while chib had no idea what marque allan favoured added to which chib had only met allan fleetingly and hate didnt know him at all which was why mike lay flat along the back seat of the audi having instructed allan to be on the lookout for beamers whenever they were forced to stop at junctions and red lights allans hands would tighten on the steering wheel if a car drew up behind or alongside his spine would stiffen his gaze fixed on the windscreen mike knew what he looked like a drunk driver terrified of the breathalyzer he only hoped chib and hate would think so too there were a few taxicabs on the roads their roof lights showing them to be still for hire touting for customers who simply didnt exist mike had considered a brief detour past westies tenement building just to check the lie of the land but he didnt think allan would be keen and wasnt even sure it would be worth the risk gissing lived just outside town and that was where they were headed it was a large detached property in juniper green mike and allan had been guests there at a couple of parties where the professor had introduced them to critics college lecturers and a few established artists one of whom over dinner had doodled all over his paper napkin allan slyly pocketing the result while the table was being cleared mike mentioned the incident now as they left the city centre behind hoping to keep his friends mind from other things always meant to frame it allan responded with a nod my big regret is not asking him to sign the bottom of the bloody thing it was another mile or so before mike told him they were getting close pull in to the kerb he suggested they were still a few hundred yards shy of gissings house it sat behind a low stone wall on what had become a main commuter artery into the city at one time the wall would have been topped with iron railings but they had been removed during world war ii for use in the manufacture of armaments gissing had told the story once over port and brandy load of bollocks of course he had chuckled they collected tons of the stuff and ended up tipping the whole lot into the firth of forth no way you could use it for anything useful but it made the civvies feel theyd done their bit for the war effort mike reminded allan of this as allan turned off the ignition and headlights allan just nodded and handed over his mobile phone theyd agreed that if there was a callbox in the vicinity theyd use that but there wasnt mike punched in the numbers and waited for an answer then took a deep breath somebodys breaking in next door he yelped i heard the glass smashing the old guy lives there on his own so im really worried im going to go take a look but please send a car he reeled off gissings address then hung up and now we wait he said handing the phone back theyll have you on tape now allan commented least of my worries almost certainly allan conceded theyve got a recording of westie too you know ransome played it to me he says they can identify the make of car from the engine noise ransomes full of crap mike retorted hoping he sounded more confident than he felt having spoken with ransome himself the detective would have little trouble identifying his voice from a recording but then he would know allans voice too it didnt matter none of it mattered not in the wider scheme a quiet night in the city for lothian and borders police this was a given when it took only four or five minutes for the patrol car to arrive its blue lights bouncing off the surrounding buildings and trees the lights were switched off when the car came to a stop no siren either maybe they didnt want to scare away the felons or it could just have been a courtesy to the sleeping neighbours that was edinburgh for you two uniformed officers got out neither bothered with his cap they wore black stab vests over white shortsleeved shirts one was holding a torch shining it towards the professors house they opened the garden gate and walked down the path towards the front door mike waited there were half a dozen other cars parked along the length of the road and he wanted to see if any of them suddenly sprang into life nothing allan stated the two policemen had disappeared around the far side of the house okay then nice and slow allan turned on ignition and headlights both and they cruised past the house mike staring hard from the back seat the torch was casting huge shadows against the house next door and the garage gissing had never used since outgrowing his sports car drive on a bit further and turn around mike commanded yes bwana allan signalled into a side street executed a threepoint turn and started back the way theyd just come the officers were out front again trying the doorbell peering through the letterbox mike could hear the crackle of a twoway radio nobodys home allan said or else theyre keeping very quiet mike added not that he believed this for a second they parked again opposite side of the road this time and facing away from gissings house it was only a couple of minutes before the patrol car moved off a few seconds later allans phone sounded thatll be the police switchboard he reasoned wondering why were making hoax calls a good reason not to answer i wasnt planning to i can always report the phone as stolen if you like but i doubt youll fool ransome true the phone stopped ringing eventually they sat for another five minutes just to be sure and then mike patted his friends shoulder do we park outside allan asked lets walk the air will do us good they got out and still keeping their wits about them padded quietly towards the house no lights had come on in any of the neighbouring properties none of the cars nearby was a bmw maybe calloways already snatched him allan hissed maybe mike said not really believing it cops could come back at any moment yes mike pushed open the wooden gate and headed down the garden path towards the living rooms large bay window he pressed his face to the glass but the shutters were closed on the inside there was another window to the left of the front door gissings dining room where allan had pocketed the artists napkin but the shutters were closed there too fingerprints allan whispered in warning and mike realized hed been resting his hands against the glass he shrugged and headed to the side of the house taking the path past the garage i dont get it allan said following close behind place looks deserted has he gone into hiding if he misses the degree show people will start to get suspicious the rear garden was silent the moon appearing suddenly from behind a bank of cloud giving mike more than enough light the conservatory was empty theyd sipped their port and coffee there after dinner seated on squeaky wicker furniture but now there was nothing the space was completely empty no shutters either at the kitchen window allowing mike to peer inside again the room had been stripped hes done a runner allan gasped only possible explanation mike agreed he had taken a couple of steps back on to the lawn it needed cutting his shoes sinking into it but one of his heels caught the edge of something more resistant it was a cardboard sign attached to a wooden stake he hoisted it up so that allan could see for himself the words for sale across which another piece of card had been attached there was just the single word printed there sold all the way down the damned limpopo mike muttered tossing the placard back on to the ground dawn was breaking as allan dropped mike off outside the apartment block you absolutely sure about this allan asked from the drivers seat mike just nodded go to the cops or dont go to the cops your call allan you dont want me to come with you allan was craning his neck in the direction of the penthouse in case theyre still there mike shook his head but i appreciate the offer mike hoped he sounded confident inside he was exhausted remember whatever you do dont go back home not until this is finished one way or the other so how come youre going home because im the one with the answers mike reached down into the car so he could shake his friends hand at the same time he pressed something into it the card with ransomes number then he closed the car door and tapped twice on the roof watching allan drive off chib calloways bmw was gone that didnt mean he hadnt left his goons upstairs but mike headed there anyway taking the lift rather than the stairs it was only a few hours since hed been bounding down these same steps in mortal fear of his life leaving three men in his flat one thing he really didnt want to find was the cooling corpse of jimmy allison when the lift doors slid open at his floor he hesitated for a moment his front door stood gaping just as hed left it stepping out of the lift and into his hallway he could see that revenge had been exacted the paintings that had lined the walls were now strewn across the floor stomped and gouged beyond repair as if clawed at by a wild animal he could well imagine the thwarted gangster teeth bared shredding them and jumping on them and feeling so much better afterwards wonder what ill tell the insurers mike speculated aloud glass crunched underfoot as he made his way to the living area no welcoming party but no sign of a body either mike released the breath hed been holding dribbles of blood on the chair where allison had been sitting and a small pool of blood soaking into the carpet in mikes bedroom evidence that the curator had been punished further for his attempted escape he wondered at the mans fate but only for a moment he knew that really he should be thinking about his own destiny and how far he could influence it but fatigue washed over him again and he flung himself on to the sofa there was a patch of water over by the fireplace and the faintest aroma of urine calloway again or perhaps hate the smashed tv was probably hates work too allans coultons had gone but mike picked up the remains of the monboddo portrait beatrice smiled back at him with what remained of her face he tried smoothing the tatters of canvas back into place but chunks of paint flaked off in the process she looked like a carcrash victim her face a jigsaw of scars sorry he apologised placing her beside him aside from the tv and the artworks not much damage had been done he got up and went into the kitchen running himself water from the tap the tv would have made quite a bit of noise which might have alerted both men to the fact that there were neighbours who could be wakened he took the filled glass into his computer room drinking as he went stuff had been thrown on to the floor but it was nothing a bit of tidying couldnt fix the keyboard was awash with whisky the contents of a bottle hed left on top of the filing cabinet okay so both would need replacing the cabinet itself which contained all his bank statements and investment details remained locked there was a mangled kitchen knife in the wastepaper bin which told him someone had tried forcing an entry the key was in his bedside drawer meaning no one had bothered to look too hard for it desk drawers stood open contents disturbed or emptied on to the floor it could all be fixed the inventory had given him a little bit of strength he reckoned if hed been in charge of ransacking someones home hed have been more thorough altogether more professional this was petty and spiteful and nothing else calloway was forgetting the first rule of business any business you couldnt allow it to become personal he found a spare cigarette in a packet in his bedroom and smoked it on the balcony staring out across the city birds were singing and he thought he could even hear the distant sounds of animals awakening in the city zoo on corstorphine hill when the cigarette was finished he went back inside and wandered through to the kitchen opening a cupboard bringing out a dustpan and brush his cleaner came in on a friday but he guessed this was beyond her remit he swept up some of the glass from the tv screen but tiredness came crashing down on him once more and he retreated to the sofa he closed his eyes and thought back to how it had all started with gissings seemingly casual remark repatriation of some of those poor imprisoned works of art wed be freedom fighters mike mulling over the possibility and then bumping into chib calloway again at the national gallery the gangster keen to learn about art or at least about the profits to be made from it next thing mike was telling gissing they should do it hed intended the target to be one of the citys institutions a banking headquarters or maybe an insurance company but gissing himself had other plans of course you did mike said out loud raising his glass in a reluctant toast to gissings plot of the three of them gissing allan and mike only mike could have come close to affording the paintings they were planning to steal so why had he agreed and not just agreed but seemed at times to be the chief instigator why had he done that because you played me like a fucking stradivarius professor he told the empty room gissing had been only too happy to take a back seat less suspicious that way a year ago hed planned the exact same heist but hadnt had access to accomplices but then allan and mike had come into his orbit and he had probed at their weaknesses assessed their potential and found them just about perfect and all because mike had been bored and greedy of course hed coveted the painting of beatrice one thing he could never own no matter how wealthy he became then there was calloway himself offering glimpses of a very different world at school mike had craved an invitation to join calloways gang its pecking order dependent on heft and ruthlessness rather than brains and guile his first year at university he had gone off the rails he would pick fights in the student union bar at parties he was unpredictable he probably only won half his battles and had eventually come to his senses had begun to conform to fit in jekyll and hyde he muttered to himself one thing still niggled had calloway and gissing been in cahoots mike didnt think so which meant that bumping into the gangster at the gallery really had been an accident almost the only unplanned event of the whole scheme bringing calloway into play had been mikes idea meaning the current mess was down to him he was sure that was how gissing would see it his head was resting against the back of the sofa eyes closed during the slow drive allan and he had taken around edinburgh he had explained some of it to his friend adding his own best guesses and assumptions to the mix allan had had to stop the car once or twice getting things straight in his head asking questions refusing at least at first to believe what he was hearing then slapping the palms of his hands repeatedly against the steering wheel youre a rational man allan mike had told him you know this is the only way it all makes sense hed then reminded allan that edinburgh had nurtured sir arthur conan doyle and that doyles creation sherlock holmes had spoken the truth when he said that once you had eliminated everything else whatever was left however improbable it might seem had to be the truth mike wasnt sure whether allan would go to the police maybe he too would return home the better to wait out his fate as for mike well his fate was already here announcing itself by way of the one creaky floorboard in the hallway but then he heard a voice calling his name forming it as a question and sounding concerned laura he called back getting to his feet he realised he hadnt switched on any of the lights but none of the blinds were closed meaning he could make her out well enough as she emerged into the room just doing a bit of redecorating he explained as she stood openmouthed arms by her sides what happened a slight fallingout who with godzilla he managed a tired smile what are you doing here she had walked further into the room negotiating her way around the shards of glass ive been trying your phone both your phones when you didnt answer i got scared mike what have you gotten yourself into he didnt really need to answer shed picked up the portrait of beatrice i knew it she said with a sigh knew it was you behind the heist how did you do it switched the originals for copies it sounded so simple and straightforward when put like that which gissing then verified she nodded slowly so hes in on it too but what about the missing paintings he gave a shrug nothing to do with me im afraid see all the time i thought i was part of a team i was actually being groomed as the patsy he managed a dry chuckle at his own hubris can i offer you a drink he raised his own empty water glass no dont mind if i he made for the kitchen again laura following actually i wasnt the only patsy he went on i made the mistake of bringing an outsider on board calloway she guessed and it was decided that he would make the perfect fall guy hes a philistine you see and thats what this whole thing was about us versus them so ransome was right all along you and that thug were partners allan was in on it too and a student at the art college called westie plus professor gissing she added mike drained the glass before answering above all of us yes he said quietly professor robert gissing hes done a runner with all the missing paintings ive never liked him and i was never really sure what you saw in him i wish to christ youd tried warning me she was still holding the monboddo and all for this all for that he conceded why is it so important mike i think you know the answer she looks like me is that what youre saying laura studied what was left of the portrait you do realise theres something slightly creepy about that i mean you could just have asked me for a date instead we had a date laura didnt work out too well you give up too easily she was still studying the painting who did this damage hate im sorry he realised she didnt know about hate hes a man calloway owes money to its a long story neither of them said anything for the best part of a minute laura broke the silence youre going to go to jail mike believe it or not laura jails way down my schedule of concerns right now just as mike had done before laura was trying to push the canvas back into something like its original shape she was lovely wasnt she she was mike agreed then he corrected himself she still is laura was blinking back tears mike wanted to take her in his arms and hold her until the world evaporated around them he turned round and placed the glass on the draining board then gripped the edge of the sink with both hands he could hear her putting down the painting then her arms were wrapping themselves around him from behind her head resting against his shoulder what are you going to do mike run away he said only half joking with you if you like what were the alternatives he could hand the money over to calloway and hate as requested but they would always have a stranglehold on him and he doubted he would see an end to the payments until the well was dry then there was the curator when he turned up dead or merely mangled the police would have something else to investigate and with ransomes input theyd soon be visiting the penthouse flat with difficult questions for its owner ill call ransome laura stated you must see its the only sensible option mike turned towards her sense hasnt played much part in this so far he said her arms stayed loosely around him their faces were only an inch or so apart but there was something moving in the shadows of the living area mike looked over lauras shoulder dont let us stop you one of calloways henchmen drawled adding for his partners benefit thats twenty notes i owe you the other man smiled told you didnt i the flats worth checking no matter what the boss says then to mike you going to give us any trouble mackenzie mike shook his head laura had released her grip on him and had swung round to face the two intruders but shes not part of this mike explained let her go and then ill come with you anywhere you like sounds reasonable glenn and johnno were in the kitchen now mr calloway should be fronting one of those tv design shows shouldnt he johnno said renovations while you wait both men laughed at this their eyes were on laura rather than mike he placed a hand on her arm off you go then he instructed and leave you with these two animals just go he gave her a little nudge in the back she glowered at calloways underlings i happen to be an old friend of di ransomes dont think i wont run to him if you touch so much as a hair on mr mackenzies head bad move laura mike muttered hes right missy means youll be coming with us now mike lunged at the two men yelling for laura to run but glenn brushed him to the floor while johnno took lauras arm and spun her round his other hand muffling her cries mike was up on one knee when a foot caught him under the chin launching him backwards to sprawl across the kitchen floor glenn knelt on him and mike felt his organs want to explode there was a grin on the face behind the fist and then the fist itself connected with the side of mikes jaw he had a moment to register that he was spinning towards unconsciousness he wondered if his boat was waiting for him and also if he would ever see laura again ransome woke up and knew that was his lot it was almost five not bad for him hed managed four and a half hours mrs thatcher he seemed to recall had got by on as little if not less he left sandra in bed and padded towards the bedroom door leaving the landing light off as he made his way downstairs in the living room he turned on the lamp next to the sofa and reached for the tv remote he knew that checking the news headlines on teletext and ceefax would keep him occupied for ten or fifteen minutes after that there was either sky news or bbc on freeview he peered through the inchwide gap in the curtains the street outside was silent years back whenever he woke up early he took delight in heading into town stopping at bakeries and allnight cafés listening to cabbies telling the story of their nights work but sandra had started complaining that he was waking her and their neighbours both revving the car as he reversed out of the driveway not too many of his colleagues had ever met sandra she didnt like official functions or parties or the idea of the pub she worked in nhs admin and had her own group of friends women who would attend talks in bookshops and museums or plan outings to foreign films and tea rooms ransomes theory was that she felt she should have done better at school maybe gone beyond secretarial college a university degree perhaps she gave off an air of quietly simmering dissatisfaction with her lot and he had no wish to compound this with earlymorning engine noise even though none of the neighbours had actually ever complained to him about it the kettle might wake her too so he stuck to a glass of milk and a couple of indigestion tablets the faint peeping noise in the hallway he put down to a small bird outside but when it persisted he knew he was wrong his jacket was hanging up behind the front door the coat rack had been sandras idea and woe betide if he draped his clothes over the end of the bannister or on the backs of chairs his mobile was in the inside pocket the noise wasnt because it needed charging it was a message from the previous evening donny was a guy ransome knew who worked at the criminal records office the message was succinct phone me so having gone back into the living room and closed the door tight that was exactly what ransome did donny its me christ man what time is it i just got your message it can wait till morning donny was coughing and spluttering spit it out ransome commanded give me a break ransome listened as donny got out of bed a door opened and closed more coughing and loud sniffles another room had been reached the rustle of papers got it here somewhere ransome was at his own window staring at the outside world again a fox cantered down the middle of the road for all the world as if it owned the place this time of day maybe it did at that ransomes street was quiet and treelined the houses were from the s which kept prices low compared to the georgian and victorian properties only half a mile away the area had been called saughtonhall when ransome and sandra had moved in but solicitors these days tended to say corstorphine or even murrayfield instead in the hope of adding a few thousand to the price sandra and ransome had even joked for a time about whether their street qualified as south murrayfield or south south murrayfield any further south and wed be on the doorstep of saughton prison take your time donny ransome muttered into the phone here we go a final flourishing of paperwork right nasty piece of work who the viking with the tattoos you asked me to track him down remember of course i did sorry donny his names arne bodrum hails from copenhagen but spends most of his time elsewhere served two years for what wed probably call gbh ran with the hells angels and is now reckoned to be an enforcer for same specifically a chapter whose hq is haugesund in norway its thought they make their dough running drugs into countries like germany and france not to mention the uk that much i already know donny what else have you got more along the same lines plus the guys mug shots the whole lotll be on your desk in about three hours donny paused can i go back to my pit now sweet dreams donny ransome ended the call and placed the phone on the windowsill hate was acting as a gobetween no more than that he was an enforcer glenn had said calloway owed money on a drug deal the creditors being an overseas hells angels chapter it meant chib was hurting needing a quick injection of cash and who did they both know had cash step forward mike mackenzie or first caly come to that and hello again allan cruikshank ransome reckoned this was the sort of thing he could take to the chief ask again for a fullscale surveillance and maybe some of those search warrants he wasnt stepping on hendricks toes there was no need to mention the heist so thered be no reason to turn him down if a budget couldnt be found ransome would do the whole thing by himself gratis and for nothing all he needed was permission he had walked away from the window and now had his back to it which was why it took him a moment to realise his phone was vibrating incoming call had to be donny with something else maybe something crucial but the sill was narrow and the phone fell to the floor just as ransome was reaching out towards it the casing went one way and the memory chip another and the thing went dead cursing under his breath ransome reassembled the phone then had to switch it on again the screen had suffered a fracture but the lcd display behind it was readable no messages he went to last call didnt recognise the number but then he didnt know donnys mobile number did he hit callback and pressed the phone to his ear thanks for getting back to me inspector i think we were cut off it wasnt donnys voice ransome couldnt place it at all sorry who is this he asked silence at the other end as though options were being weighed last chance to hang up et cetera and then a clearing of the throat and when the name was announced ransome put the face to it straight away after all hadnt he just been thinking about the man could this really be happening had he dozed off and this was all some bizarrely satisfying dream first arne bodrum and now this ransome sat himself down and crooned his opening words into the mouthpiece something must be troubling you mr cruikshank why dont you tell me all about it nice of you to drop by chib calloway said opening his eyes mike knew where he was the abandoned snooker hall chib was standing in front of him some way off hate was studying the positions of the balls on one of the tables five chairs had been arranged in a line and mike was seated to the far right hands tied behind his back feet strapped to the chair legs he looked to his left and saw laura next to him similarly bound he gave a low groan of apology in her direction which she acknowledged with a slow blinking of the eyes westie was next along his own eyes brimming with tears then came alice whose sharp gaze was nothing but venom with calloway as its target at the furthest end of the short unhappy row sat the hapless curator jimmy allison looking dazed and bereft and whose only crime had been to become a recognised expert in his field wake up dummy calloway was telling mike time to get a good smacking hate had grabbed one of the reds in his paw and was making his way towards the chairs he tossed the ball as he walked catching it each time with a slap of his cupped palm lots of bodies to dispose of he speculated no shortage of resting places calloway assured him weve got the north sea and the pentland hills not to mention all those building sites around granton then to mike ive already had a fulsome apology from westie here he made to pat the young mans cheek causing westie to flinch and screw his eyes shut in expectation of something harder at the sight of this calloway gave a low chuckle and turned his attention back to mike but not much by way of explanation you expect me to fill you in before we fill you in hate growled i hope theres no extra charge for the lousy puns mike said hate wrapped his fingers around the snooker ball and drew back his fist i told you hate hes mine calloway snarled stabbing a warning finger towards the scandinavian youre not in a position to order me around hate told the gangster my town my rules calloway spat back it was like watching two caged animals feral territorial and deadly hate spat on the floor then channelled some of his pentup anger towards the ball hurling it at the wall behind the chairs when it landed out of mikes sight line it failed to roll telling him it had split in two calloway leaned down so he was level with mikes face my boys tell me you were quite the sir galahad with your lady friend but how smart was it to go back to your damned flat about as smart as kicking and slashing your way through half a million quids worth of art instead of taking it with you the old red mist descended calloway explained besides which what the fuck do i want with paintings he rose to his full height and walked along the line till he was in front of westie again leave him alone alice raged you touch him again ill rip your balls off calloway gave a whoop and even hate offered a lopsided grin of admiration shes a tough old broiler westie isnt she calloway asked easy to see who wears the cock in your house then for mikes benefit westie here tells me it was gissings idea to switch paintings on me he doesnt seem to think you knew anything about it youve been to gissings house mike waited for the gangster to nod then youll have seen the evidence im guessing he left town yesterday maybe even before that explains why he couldnt be reached on the phone i thought he was lying low but actually it was more like deep cover that house of his mustve been on the market for weeks meaning he knew exactly what he was doing and what was he doing mikey let the others go and ill tell you nobody goes anywhere hate interrupted stabbing a finger in mikes direction the finger was encased in sleek black leather a drivers glove hate had started to pull them on one for each hand mike knew what that meant some work manual work was about to be done and no fingerprints he focused his attention on calloway one thing you need to know both of you im not afraid of you maybe i was once but not now nor was this mere bravado almost the only thing he had left it seemed was a sudden and irrational lack of fear the school bully was right there in front of him and mike wasnt flinching he was aware of the others watching him as he spoke not just laura westie and alice but even allison who was leaning forward straining against his restraints for a better view hate too hands now gloved to his satisfaction was acting the spectator you should be afraid the gangster was saying i know mike agreed with as much of a shrug as his bonds would allow but somehow its not working maybe its because of all that money you need me to get for you i can lay my hands on plenty of cash without your help calloway snarled but not even hate looked convinced by the outburst let them go mike stated calmly i can tell you the whole story once theyve walked out of here not a chance hate growled what do i need the whole story for anyway calloway added i know ive been cheated and thats all that matters he straightened up and started rolling his shoulders limbering up for the task ahead which one do you want to kill first hate the strongest came the answer always leave the weakest until last wise words calloway conceded probably means we should start with westies little ballbreaker bring it on alice said baring her teeth with pleasure sweetheart mike realised that he had to start telling the story it was the only thing that might postpone all their ends youre not the only one whos been conned he blurted out to calloway we all have in as much as weve been set up for a fall gissing planted a seed in my head then watered it by coming up with the notion of switching paintings the plan was so well conceived hed obviously been thinking about it for a long time in fact he said as much but suddenly he had an absolute need to put it into action and that meant finding allies allies whod then take the fall on his behalf you and your flaky friend cruikshank dont go thinking ive forgotten about him by the way mike nodded then wished he hadnt when glenn had thumped him hed done a sterling job me and allan he said swallowing back the nausea gissing already had his eye on westie for the role of forger he was wary of you becoming involved though it raised the stakes i suppose but he soon changed his mind at the time i thought it had been too easy to persuade him but now i can see his thinking out of all of us you were the perfect fall guy someone the police would love to nail but then you went and asked for a painting well as far as he was concerned you were one of the great unwashed he couldnt let you have a precious original that would have been sacrilege at the same time he doubted youd ever spot a fake so he made westie here prepare an extra copy without the rest of us knowing westie was nodding he picked up the story the professor came to see me he told me he needed an extra copy of the utterson and no one was to know about it i asked him why and he told me i was better off staying ignorant that ignorant rankled i knew it was the way hed always thought of me so you added one of your little secret flourishes to the finished article mike guessed westie nodded some more we made the switch while you and allan were back in the warehouse doing the final check the professor hid the real utterson inside the back of one of the paintings hed chosen for himself it was a nice snug fit and then for calloways benefit honest mr calloway if id known it was meant for you id never have agreed mike watched the gangster pat westies cheek again he was thinking of all the other clues clues he should have spotted the plans gissing had drawn up with so much thought and detail having gone into them and the professors own comment when mike had said that the plan itself seemed perfect most plans do when you first think of them yes gissing had had the heist in mind for some considerable time but not just so as to steal some paintings hed been doing that for years without anybody noticing sneaking the occasional small masterpiece out with him when he visited the warehouse on one of his many research trips but then he must have learned of the upcoming inventory a full and thorough inventory the first one in years hed realised then that the missing paintings would not be overlooked so he had brought forward his retirement without telling anyone outside the college his house had been placed on the market and then hed gone fishing for companion plotters when hed first laid out the plan hed made sure to tempt mike with the monboddo and allan with the prized coultons appealing to their avarice when the inventorys discrepancies were noted the police investigation would zero in on these dupes after all hadnt they just pulled off a heist stood to reason theyd be the ones with the missing paintings leaving gissing himself tucked away somewhere out of sight somewhere abroad was mikes guess it wouldnt be anywhere the professor had discussed would be some secret place that he held dear hed mentioned spain then changed his mind and said the west coast of scotland one of his very few slipups and mike should have realised at the time what it meant im getting bored with this hate complained into the silence time to do some killing gissings the one you want mike stressed eyes boring into calloways when youre finished with me promise youll not forget that ill remember the gangster allowed but as of this moment im inclined to agree with mr hate here theres been far too much talking about time hate stated punching his fist into the palm of his other hand mike turned his head towards laura he was almost close enough to kiss her goodbye sorry i got you into this you should be there was plenty of iron left in her voice so the least you can do now is save the day his eyes stayed locked on hers and eventually he gave a slow nod pain pounding through his brain the nodding appeared confident and the eye contact was good his senses seemed heightened just as in the immediate aftermath of the heist itself and he was with the woman he loved this is living he thought shame about the rest of it save the day laura had demanded who was he to argue in fact the only thing he lacked was a plan any sort of plan johnno and glenn stood guard on the pavement outside the snooker hall johnno was smoking looking twitchy whats up glenn asked why are we stuck out here might work better for us we cant be called as witnesses you think chibs going to top every single one of them johnnos eyes had widened but only a little seems likely and what the hells hate doing here i still owe him for what he did to my arm some wars you just have to walk away from johnno johnno stared at him walk away glenn shrugged whatever the mess in there ends up being guess whose job itll be to mop things up after ours johnno agreed flicking the remains of his cigarette on to the roadway whats it all about anyway have you figured it out yet ive got an inkling but like i say best not to know johnno cupped the front of his trousers im bursting reckon i can he nodded towards the door of the snooker hall there was a toilet in there but hed have to walk past everyone to reach it glenn shook his head slowly if i were you he said id try over there he gestured towards the pend on the other side of the street fair enough glenn watched johnno cross the road watched as he headed down the lane and disappeared behind a row of communal bins hed already retrieved his phone from his pocket once johnno was out of sight he flipped it open and started punching numbers mike wasnt at all ready to die and if he was going to live so was laura it was his fault she was here shed only come looking for him because shed been worried which meant she cared about him least he could do in return was save her life or more likely admittedly perish in the attempt the air in the snooker hall felt electric hate had taken a step forward and chib calloway didnt look like doing anything other than aiding and abetting alice had just stopped cursing the pair of them out having received a slap for her efforts westie had bitten his lip saying nothing so shed vented her spleen on him for another halfminute or so at the far end of the row jimmy allison looked beaten by life and accepting of his fate it seemed to mike that hed lost some dignity and control of his bodily functions to go with the blood on his shirt front ive been in this goddamned country too long hate was saying all i want to do is go home whether i get my clients money or not hed turned towards calloway a sudden sneer making his face even uglier i know edvard will be keen to hear about the fake you were going to try to fool him with ive told you a dozen times i didnt know it was a fake calloway growled but then his own face lost some of its tension as he realised what hate had just said you havent told him he asked with ominous calm just get me the money and he need never know but im already in negotiations calloway was saying mike saw that the gangster was looking towards westie yes because the hells angels back in scandinavia did a lot of international trading and fine art made for useful collateral on calloways instructions westie was going to make more fakes with which to dupe hates employers and those same employers didnt know as yet that theyd been tricked with the utterson mike was impressed he could see calloway calculating all the possibilities and permutations in an instant and when he made his move it was lightning fast too hate had turned away from him to face the line of hostages again trying to decide who would be first to die he didnt hear the snooker cue being lifted from the table didnt feel the change in air pressure as it was swung at the back of his head the force of contact snapped the wood in half with a crack splinters falling into mikes lap alice screamed and laura gave a little yelp the giant stumbled and almost fell on top of mike but he didnt go down not quite calloway started raining blows from behind yelling for his henchmen to come and help him the door opened and one man ran in johnno chib commanded whack him hard about fucking time johnno snarled joining the fray he got a good kick at the doubledover hate blood spurting from the giants nose but hate was already fighting back heaving calloway halfway across the room with a shoulder charge mike realised that alice was screaming again but not in horror at the events unfolding right there in front of her she was shouting for help struggling against her bonds mike saw why she was staring wideeyed at the open door beyond which lay the outside world so reassuringly unchanged and unthreatening a pavement a lamppost the roadway anyone passing would be bound to notice and fetch help maybe a passenger in a car or a cruising cabdriver it had dawned on westie too he wrestled with his chair until it tipped over he started wriggling using any purchase he could find slithering and jerking his way towards anywhere that wasnt here dont leave me alice yelled at him ill get help he gasped the heel of one shoe squeaking against the floor as he moved he left a slight trail in his wake and mike was reminded suddenly and absurdly of a snail beginning some epically slow journey he turned his head to check on laura but her eyes were on the wrestling match in front of her there were flecks of blood on her cheeks nose and forehead hates blood as for jimmy allison his shoulders were heaving with a crazed species of laughter at the unfolding spectacle as johnno launched himself on to hates back one arm around his throat calloway was upright again and preparing to charge mike was still impressed by the fluidity of the mans thinking an ally had become an enemy in the blink of an eye he couldnt be sure though whether hates demise would necessarily lead to the groups salvation which was why he started working away at his own bonds westie was halfway to the door now and alice was still crying out for help calloway had a question for johnno where the hells glenn thought he was right behind me the reply came from between gritted teeth as johnno continued to squeeze the life from hate but then the giant powered himself backwards into one of the tables mike thought he could hear a sharp cracking sound not dissimilar to the snapping of the cue as johnnos spine connected with the tables wooden rim the arm fell from around hates neck and as hate stepped away johnno slumped to the floor face twisted in pain calloway meantime had aimed a kick where it hurts most reminding mike of school playground tactics but it seemed to have little effect and hate swiped his gloved fist hard across the gangsters jaw the followup punch felled calloway knocking him unconscious to the floor hate took only a couple of moments to gather himself bubbles of blood appeared at both nostrils and his breathing was ragged his face was near puce from the attempted strangulation he staggered towards the door and slammed it shut then bent down to drag westie away from all hope of freedom westie screamed in agony as he was pulled along the floor by his hair hate hauled the chair upright again between laura and alice a clump of westies hair fell from his gloved hand as he removed it alice was yelling obscenities at the giant but he ignored her instead he reeled back towards calloway and johnno assessing any level of threat they might still present satisfied he turned his attention towards mike and the others im going to kill you all he spat his voice hoarse and then im going home your employers wont like it mike said coolly if you dont take them their money remember im the guy who can deliver it but hate was shaking his head a photograph of the corpses will suffice you dont think the police will show an interest ill be long gone he looked around him again calloway has to die and there cant be witnesses hate pointed towards mike ill be saving you till last my friend does that make me the weakest youre all weak this whole city is weak hate threw his head back ceilingwards and gave a little groan not it seemed to mike of pain but rather of dismay at the blunt stupidity encountered so far on his adventure someone like calloway hes an idiot and yet somehow he gets to be in charge youre fools the lot of you you might have a point oh i do a grin spread across the bloodsmeared face as hate reached behind him into the collar of his shirt slowly he pulled out a slender gleaming knife and started to survey his kingdom calloway unconscious on the floor blood trickling from one ear johnno in a heap conscious but wishing otherwise moaning in agony and the five trussed figures in their chairs best thing you can do mike stated is walk away from here before glenn comes back with the cavalry glenn calloway has two bodyguards remember you might not have much time hell find his boss dead along with the rest of you mike came to the conclusion that at long last he had run out of options his only hope was to charge at the man try ramming his head into his stomach he knew it was hopeless but what else was there hate himself seemed to realise this and gave a soft chuckle mike turned towards laura she was trying hard to hold back the tears not exactly how id hoped things might work out for the two of us he apologised as second dates go ill admit ive had better westie whod started struggling against his bonds again had keeled over on to the floor for a second time alice wasnt far off joining him allison was still chuckling to himself eyes screwed shut sanity evaporating and all of this for a few paintings mike thought all because i was bored pampered infatuated and greedy and tricked by the greater villain professor robert gissing it galled him to think that gissing was dodging all of this enjoying his retirement surrounded by however many masterpieces cocktails on the patio and lazy days in the sun one last thing he said gaining the murderous giants irritated attention ive told calloway and now im telling you robert gissing is the man who conned all of us find gissing and youll have your hands on an art collection worth millions remember to tell your client that when you get home hate thought for a moment then nodded slowly thanks for the tip he said and to return the favour ill make this quick not painless maybe but quick he placed himself in front of laura leaned down a little towards her and drew back the knife lauras scream drilled into mikes ears he squeezed shut his eyes straining one last time at his bonds but then there was another sound that of a door being kicked in he opened his eyes to the sight of figures streaming through the doorway dressed in black stab vests and some of them wearing visored helmets on each chest the word police was picked out in white lettering the officer at the front had dropped to one knee and mike realised he was pointing a pistol at hate hate froze for a moment the knife poised lauras mouth was still gaping though her screams had been silenced by the arrival of the cops hate turned his head so his eyes met mikes the look was worth a thousand words the officers were barking out a repeated order and eventually the giant complied the knife fell to the floor with a clatter and he raised his arms above his head kneeling down as instructed sliding his hands slowly around to the back of his head awaiting the restraints the officers fell on him the pistol was reholstered only after the handcuffs had been securely fastened we were told there are firearms one of the faces behind a visor stated ive not seen any mike told him get me out of this bloody chair alice yelped mike was looking towards the doorway glenn the missing henchman was standing there so was detective inspector ransome ransome was whistling a little tune hands in trouser pockets as he stepped inside he stared down at calloway then crouched down in front of him and checked his neck for a pulse satisfied rubbing a little of calloways blood between thumb and forefinger he stood up again and headed for the row of chairs anybody hurt he asked for some reason the question made laura laugh use your eyes ransome she said the guy at the end is barely breathing ransome ordered two officers to get the curator into an ambulance then stopped to pick up hates knife checking it for blood when he saw it hadnt been used he sliced through the tape with it so that lauras hands were free despite alices pleas mike was next ransome handed the knife to laura and asked her to do the honours she looked towards hate and then at the knife but ransome tutted enough drama for one day he chided her leave mr bodrum to us he might be bodrum to you mike commented but hell always be hate to me as laura began cutting alice and westie free the latter complaining that hed broken his arm when he fell ransome helped mike rid himself of the ties around his ankles then had to help him to his feet better the detective asked mike nodded his agreement he felt lightheaded and his headache was intensifying how did you find us he managed to ask glenn burns but to be honest we were already on your trail the detective turned his head towards the doorway mike following suit allan was standing there looking slightly sheepish when mike smiled and nodded he came inside taking in as much as he could christ mike he said wrapping his arms around him mike whispered into his ear how much have you told him when the embrace was finished the look in allans eyes was clear everything sorry he said dont be mike answered i hope it was all worth it ransome mused ports and airports mike said grabbing the detective by the arm youve got to stop robert gissing leaving the country might be a bit late for that mr mackenzie besides its not your little ladykillers gang that concerns me a di called hendricks will be wanting to speak to you about all that ransome nodded in calloways direction theres the prize i was after so i suppose really i should be thanking you for delivering it with a smile he moved off just as the paramedics arrived hate was on his feet and flanked by policemen about to be escorted outside looks like you wont be going home just yet mike called out to him im not the only one the giant spat back theres something in that laura conceded you will testify against calloway ransome asked mike was being led towards a waiting police van allan next to him handcuffs had not been thought necessary the di called hendricks had turned up looking grumpy mike had watched ransome explain the situation to him which had done little to lighten his colleagues mood but had given an extra spring to ransomes own step afterwards mike shrugged now it was a good question after all should really be the other way round he told ransome after all im the one who dragged him into it but you will testify it sounded like a statement of fact rather than any kind of question if you do itll go easier for you meaning what ransome shrugged six years instead of eight youd be out of jail inside three im sure you can afford the best lawyers in the land mr mackenzie and it shouldnt be too hard for them to paint a picture of you in court as a naïve playboy who got in with the wrong crowd maybe a friendly psychoanalyst can plead diminished responsibility meaning im not in my right mind not at the time no how about me allan asked where do i figure in this same goes but with the added factor that you did the right thing and turned yourself in and in the process helped save five people from being tortured and killed seven actually mike corrected the detective hate wasnt about to leave chib and johnno alive see ransome told allan youre practically a hero an ambulance was parked next to the police van and jimmy allison was being stretchered into it an oxygen mask tied to his face another stretcher would be needed for johnno one man required a blood transfusion and some stitches plus a potential lifetime of psychological counselling the other needed a new spine mike wondered again at the sheer nerve of robert gissing stealing paintings for years never detected but about to be undone by something as straightforward as an inventory gissing railing against the storing from view of so many important and beautiful works making the same argument to practically everyone he met in order to seek out a few gullible souls who might be duped into doing something about it then seeing to it that allison was attacked so that he himself would be on hand to verify a series of fakes it was sublime but so much could have gone wrong nevertheless it was the only roll of the dice left to gissing and against all the odds it had worked and now mike would go to jail and allan would go to jail and westie would go to jail allan looked devastated but westie didnt seem too bothered mike had heard him inside the snooker hall explaining to alice that prisoners got to do art classes and everything might well make the westie brand even more valuable when i come out notoriety is something you cant just buy off the shelf maybe he had a point at that but it hadnt stopped alice from giving him a solid punch to his damaged arm so that hed howled and doubled over while she turned and walked away she would be taken in for questioning they would all be questioned especially hate who even now was struggling against his restraints and his captors both he was like a force of nature and mike was thankful the giant was being afforded a van of his very own if we all go to jail mike asked ransome will we be in the same wing as calloway and hate i doubt it well find you the softest option possible even so calloways bound to have friends on the inside ransome gave a little chuckle i think youre overestimating him mr mackenzie chibs got more enemies than friends behind bars youll be fine trust me there was a shout from nearby it was glenn burns he was being led in handcuffs to a waiting patrol car you fucking well owe me ransome you owe me everything ransome ignored the outburst and concentrated on mike instead the van doors stood wide open they led to an inner cage with two bench seats so gissings got all the missing paintings ransome asked mike nodded calloways got a couple of the ones we swapped if he hasnt already trashed them ransome nodded mr cruikshank here told me all about them and westwater and his girlfriend have another a derasse and what exactly are you left with mr mackenzie mike considered this ive got my health i suppose and a story to tell the grandkids he watched as laura was brought out of the snooker hall incidentally lauras got nothing to do with any of it i know shes a friend of yours shell have to give us a statement ransome said after that ill see she gets home thanks mike stared at the inside of the van not easy is it sir ransome asked what being a criminal mastermind youll have to ask robert gissing that laura had spotted them and was heading their way she touched ransome on his forearm any chance of a word with the prisoner ransome seemed reluctant but her eyes won him over and he noticed that chib calloway was being led out of the hall in handcuffs having woken up to find himself surrounded by lothian and borders finest ill just be a minute ransome warned as he headed off in calloways dazed direction laura leaned in towards mike and pecked him on the cheek i asked you to save the day she told him and you duly obliged you might not have noticed he reminded her but really it didnt have much to do with me actually allan piped up if were discussing lifesavers laura beamed a smile at him and gave him a hug and a kiss before turning back to mike this time when they kissed it was on the lips allan made a show of turning away so they had at least the semblance of privacy she wrapped her arms around mike and he felt warmth flowing through him will you be in prison for a long time she asked will you be waiting for me i asked first ransome reckons three years he also says i should get the best legal team money can buy and a psychiatrist wholl vouch for my insanity so youll probably end up a pauper and a lunatic is that going to affect our relationship do you think she gave a little laugh lets wait and see mike was thoughtful for a moment ill have to find out how often im allowed visitors dont count your chickens mackenzie will jail be smelly and full of leering sex maniacs probably and thats just allan a couple of uniformed officers were approaching ready to usher allan and mike into the van laura and mike embraced again and shared a final lingering kiss if id known mike mused that this was all a fellow had to do to win you over break it up now one of the uniforms said one more thing mike told laura as they were separated when you visit ill need you to bring me stuff maybe i can give you a shopping list what sort of stuff he pretended to be thinking atlases he said at last world atlases he was halfway into the back of the van plus travel books art books list of museums and galleries of renown youre going to better yourself is that it he decided that the best thing to do was nod his agreement she didnt get it not just yet allan did though and gave him a glance that said as much said there was someone mike needed to find just as soon as they let him out epilogue professor robert gissing was in the study of his whitewashed home in the centre of tangier his reverie had just been broken by the sound of a motorbike misfiring the windows had been thrown wide open and the sun was high overhead in a clear blue sky he could hear the varied noises of business wafting up towards him from the market downstairs bartering and general gossip plus the diesel clatter of antiquated vans and lorries they never really disturbed him and now the motorbikes surly engine had been switched off too he could sometimes smell spices and coffee in the air and cardamon citrus fruits and incense they all added to the sensations of a life being lived to the full in a world rich in everyday wonder he was happy here with his books and a glass of infused mint there were fine rugs overlapping on the floor and fine paintings covering a good deal of the available space on the walls he had no telephone and he received no mail he had access to the internet thanks to the café at the end of the street but only used it once or twice a month to catch up on the news from britain he would do a word search entering names such as mackenzie and calloway westwater and ransome he didnt know enough about computers to be completely confident that he wasnt leaving a trail of some kind by doing this he remembered reading an article once about how the fbi would monitor peoples borrowings from libraries names being flagged up if they were taking out items such as mein kampf and the anarchist cookbook he didnt suppose the internet would be very different but all the same felt it a risk worth taking know your enemy and all that of course it was entirely possible that hed been forgotten about dismissed by the police as untraceable and if they couldnt catch him what chance did amateurs like mike and calloway have okay so mike had some knowledge of computers but gissing doubted this extended to covert tracking and the like for the first couple of years however he hadnt stayed anywhere for too long fake passports had been provided in a variety of names costing him thousands but worth every penny euro and dollar one of the paintings that had come into his possession happened to be by an artist coveted by a saudi businessman gissing had known as much when hed taken it the collector had paid gissing half what the piece was worth on the open market on the understanding that it would remain in his private gallery for both our sakes gissing had warned him but especially yours the gentleman had understood and had been delighted with the purchase that deal alone had allowed gissing to travel in some style france spain italy and greece then africa he had now been in tangier for four months but had moved his things here from storage only once he was confident that he would be staying at the local cafés he was known as the englishman a misapprehension he had done nothing to correct he had grown a beard and often wore a panama hat and sunglasses he had also fought hard to lose three and a half stones in weight only on a few occasions had he wondered if it had all been worth it he was after all a fugitive he could never return to scotland could never see friends again or drink whisky with them in a decent pub while the drizzle fell outside but then he would spend a while gazing at his paintings and a slowly spreading smile would replace any lingering doubts the cd he had been listening to stopped abruptly at the end of its final track bach played by glenn gould he was working his way through the classical repertoire the same thing went for books he had vowed to try proust again and to reread tolstoy there was even a plan to study latin and greek he reckoned he had another fifteen or twenty years in him plenty of time to savour each morsel each sip each musical note word and stroke of the brush tangier was similar to edinburgh in some ways a village masquerading as a city he was no longer a stranger to his neighbours and the market traders the owner of the internet café had invited him to dine with his family street children liked to tease him they tugged on his beard and pointed at the bow ties hed taken to wearing he would sit at outdoor tables picking at his dinner and sometimes wafting air across his face with the brim of his hat it was he had concluded neither better nor worse than the life hed once had in edinburgh it was different that was all he regretted the involvement of michael and allan naturally he did but calloway had been mikes idea and a very bad idea at that though in retrospect almost perfect for gissings own purposes of course it hadnt worked precisely to plan michael and allan not to mention calloway had been able to persuade the authorities that the missing artefacts had nothing to do with them gissings photo had been published in a great many newspapers across the globe hence his nomadic existence but all that was in the past now and he could start to relax a little the book containing the picasso lithographs was written in spanish some folk tale or other hed vowed to teach himself spanish also so as to savour it all the more his favourite painting however was a peploe still life full of glassy realism and romance he wasnt sure now about the one wilkie portrait in his collection if he ever needed additional funds it would probably be the least painful to part with the saudi had said he would be interested should future negotiations prove possible for now though gissing was quite content the doorbell sounded followed by a knocking he didnt get up immediately but when the knock was repeated curiosity got the better of him he rose with a little effort to his feet and padded barefoot across the floor was he expecting someone the answer was yes yes and always it was a couple of weeks since his last search of the internet anything could have happened in the interim people could have been released from jail all the same once freed from custody they would still have a job on their hands to track him down before he had quite reached it the door began to open hello is anyone home the voice was accented but he couldnt quite place it can i help you gissing was saying as he went to meet his visitor ian rankin
