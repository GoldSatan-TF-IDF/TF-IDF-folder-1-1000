longer version of the prologue lines long as opposed to appears in the original autograph manuscript the typed manuscript and the unrevised galley proofs of sweet thursday all housed at the harry ransom humanities research center university of texas austin it is not known why steinbeck excised such a large portion of the text one night mack lay back on his bed in the palace flop house and he said i aint never been satisfied with that book cannery row that book cannery row steinbecks earlier roman Ã  clef novel set in preworld war ii monterey featuring the protagonist doc based on edward f ricketts and including in its cast of characters numerous other lightly fictionalized loosely disguised reallife persons the novel is dedicated for ed ricketts who knows why or should on the dedication page of the copy steinbeck presented to ricketts he wrote with all the respect and affection this book implies in his memoir about ed ricketts steinbeck wrotei used the laboratory and ed himself in a book called cannery row i took it to him in typescript to see whether he would resent it and to offer to make any changes he would suggest he read it through carefully smiling and when he had finished he said let it go that way it is written in kindness such a thing cant be bad but it was bad in several ways neither of us foresaw as the book began to be read tourists began coming to the laboratory first a few and then in droves people stopped their cars and stared at ed with that glassy look that is used on movie stars hundreds of people came into the lab to ask questions and peer around pp lvilviii would of went about it different and after a while he rolled over and raised his head on his hand and he said i guess im just a critic but if i ever come across the guy that wrote that book i could tell him a few things like what said whitey no well said mack like this here suppose theres chapter one chapter two chapter three thats all right as far as it goes but id like to have a couple of words at the top so it tells me what the chapters going to be about sometimes maybe i want to go back and chapter five dont mean nothing to me if there was just a couple of words id know that was the chapter i wanted to go back to go on said whitey no well i like a lot of talk in a book and i dont like to have nobody tell me what the guy thats talking looks like i want to figure out what he looks like from the way he talks and another thingi kind of like to figure out what the guys thinking by what he says i like some description too he went on i like to know what color a thing is how it smells and maybe how it looks and maybe how a guy feels about itbut not too much of that you sure are a critic said whitey no mack i never give you credit before is that all no said mack sometimes i want a book to break loose with a bunch of hooptedoodle the guys writing it give him a chance to do a little hooptedoodle spin up some pretty words maybe or sing a little song with language thats nice but i wish it was set aside so i dont have to read it i dont want hooptedoodle to get mixed up in the story so if the guy thats writing it wants hooptedoodle he ought to put it right at first then i can skip it if i want to or maybe go back to it after i know how the story come out eddie said mack if the guy that wrote cannery row comes in you going to tell him all that whitey no said hell mack can tell anybody anything why mack could tell a ghost how to haunt a house youre damn right i could said mack and there wouldnt be no tablerapping or chains there hasnt been no improvement in househaunting in years youre damn right i could whitey and he lay back and stared up at the canopy over his bed i can see it now said mack ghosts eddie asked hell no said mack chapters what happened in between when the war came to monterey and to cannery row cannery row site of numerous fish canneries fish reduction plants and processing and packing houses along ocean view avenue monterey the street was renamed cannery row in that section of town was called new monterey which susan shillinglaw explains in a journey into steinbecks california was not spanish monterey not methodist pacific grove but the shoreline and sloping wooded hills between these places p everybody fought it more or less in one way or another when hostilities ceased everyone had his wounds the canneries themselves fought the war by getting the limit taken off fish and catching them all it was done for patriotic reasons but that didnt bring the fish back as with the oysters in alice as with the oysters in alice from the walrus and the carpenter a poem in chapter four of through the lookingglass and what alice found there by british writer and mathematician charles l dodgson whose pseudonym was lewis carroll o oysters said the carpenter youve had a pleasant run shall we be trotting home again but answer came there none and this was scarcely odd because theyd eaten every one theyd eaten every one it was the same noble impulse that stripped the forests of the west and right now is pumping water out of californias earth faster than it can rain back in when the desert comes people will be sad just as cannery row was sad when all the pilchards pilchards california sardine sardinia caerulea at eleven to fourteen inches in length it was the states most important commercial fish until midcentury according to a graph in richard f g heimann and john g carlisles the california marine fish catch for and historical review reprinted in michael hemp cannery row in the monterey area sardine catch was a record tons the canning boom driven by world war ii saw monterey become the sardine capital of the world though in around the time of docs discharge from the army the catch was tons p marine scientist ed ricketts studied the sardine extensively during his later career and in his final article on the subject published in the monterey peninsula herald in shortly before his death and reprinted in ricketts breaking through concluded that if conservation had been adopted early enough a smaller but streamlined cannery rowwould be winding up a fairly successful season in stead sic of dipping as they must be now deeply into the red ink of failure p as katherine rodger asserts in her introduction to breaking through his pleas for moderation fell on deaf ears p in to the year sweet thursday was published a greatly reduced monterey fleet brought in fiftyeight tons were caught and canned and eaten the pearlgray canneries of corrugated iron were silent and a pacing watchman was their only life the street that once roared with trucks was quiet and empty yes the war got into everybody doc doc marine biologist pioneering ecologist and intellectual polymath edward flanders robb ricketts was the model for steinbecks fictional doc steinbecks portrayal of doc is often biographically accurate regarding rickettss physical gestures and appearance his personal habits and tastes and his cultural interests especially in music literature and philosophy steinbeck embroiders too ricketts attended the university of chicago but never graduated whereas his fictional counterpart holds a phd from that institution the research award doc receives from old jingleballicks in chapter may have been compensation for rickettss failure at winning a guggenheim fellowship in on the other side in order to emphasize docs romantic adventures steinbeck ignores rickettss role as a husband and a father to three children from his marriage to anna nan maker in the couple later separated but were never legally divorced halfchrist and halfgoat steinbeck summed him up in his elegy about ed ricketts itself an exercise in paradox selective memory and impressionism steinbecks eighteenyear relationship with ricketts was profoundly beneficial as richard astro established in john steinbeck and edward f ricketts besides their collaborative book sea of cortez steinbeck drew on rickettss ideas so deeply and so often that after rickettss death in may steinbeck told mutual friends in steinbeck a life in letters wouldnt it be interesting if ed was us and that now there wasnt any such thing or that he created out of his own mind something that went away with him ive wondered a lot about that how much was ed and how much was me and which was which p excellent resources with which to survey the world of ed ricketts are katharine a rodgers renaissance man of cannery row and her breaking through as well as eric enno tamms beyond the outer shores was drafted he put a friend known as old jingleballicks old jingleballicks eccentric old jays prototype has never been positively identified by scholars though it is possible he was in some way connected with stanfords hopkins marine station perhaps its onetime director w k fisher who was initially critical of the quality and nature of rickettss scientific work in about ed ricketts steinbeck says only that ricketts hated one professor whom he referred to as old jingleballicks it never developed why he hated old jingleballicks p xviii in charge of western biological laboratories western biological laboratories docs business was modeled on edward f rickettss pacific biological laboratories cofounded in in pacific grove with albert galigher his former university of chicago roommate in the late s ricketts by then the labs sole owner moved the business to ocean view avenue in monterey later the street was renumbered then renamed with rickettss lab becoming cannery row the building now a private social club still stands recently it received a california governors historic preservation award and served out his time as a tech sergeant in a vd section doc was philosophical about it he whiled away his free hours with an unlimited supply of government alcohol made many friends and resisted promotion when the war was over doc was kept on by a grateful government to straighten out certain inventory problems a job he was fitted for since he had contributed largely to the muckup doc was honorably discharged two years after our victory our victory victories by allied forces over germany and japan that ended world war ii took place in may and august he went back to western biological and forced open the waterlogged door old jingleballicks hadnt been there for years dust and mildew covered everything there were dirty pots and pans in the sink instruments were rusted the liveanimal cages were empty doc sat down in his old chair and a weight descended on him he cursed old jingleballicks savoring his quiet poisonous words and then automatically he got up and walked across the silent street to lee chongs grocery for beer a welldressed man of mexican appearance stood behind the counter and only then did doc remember that lee chong was gone beer said doc two quarts coming up said the patrÃ³n is mack around sure i guess so tell him i want to see him tell him who wants to see him tell him doc is back okay doc said the patrÃ³n this kind of beer all right any kind of beers all right said doc doc and mack sat late together in the laboratory the beer lost its edge and a quart of old tennis shoes took its place while mack filled in the lost years change was everywhere people were gone or changed and that was almost like being gone names were mentioned sadly even the names of the living gay was dead killed by a piece of antiaircraft fallback in london he couldnt keep his nose out of the sky during a bombing his wife easily remarried on his insurance but at the palace flop house palace flop house a shed once owned by horace abbeville and used to store fish meal that figures prominently in cannery row the palace flop house was deeded to chinese merchant lee chong as payment for a grocery debt they kept gays bed just as it was before he wenta little shrine to gay no one was permitted to sit on gays bed and mack told doc how whitey no took a job in a war plant in oakland and broke his leg the second day and spent three months in luxury in his white hospital bed he learned to play rhythm harmonica an accomplishment he enjoyed all the rest of his life then there was the new whitey whitey no and mack was proud of him for whitey no had joined first marines and gone out as a replacement someone not whitey no said he had won a bronze star but if he had hed lost it so there was no proof but he never forgave the marine corps for taking his prize away from hima quart jar of ears pickled in brandy hed wanted to put that jar on the shelf over his bed a memento of his service to his country eddie had stayed on his job with wide ida at the cafÃ© la ida the medical examiner when he looked at his check sheet and saw what was wrong with eddie came to the conclusion that eddie had been technically dead for twelve years but eddie got around just the same and what with the draft taking everybody away he very nearly became a permanent bartender for wide ida out of sentiment he emptied the wining jug into a series of little kegs and when each keg was full he bunged it and buried it right now the palace is the bestendowed flop house in monterey county down about the middle of the first quart of old tennis shoes mack told how dora flood had died in her sleep leaving the bear flag bereft her girls were brokenhearted they put on a ladydrunk that lasted three days stuck a not open for business sign on the door but through the walls you could hear them doing honor to dora in threepart harmonyrock of ages asleep in the deep and st james infirmary rock of agesst james infirmary rock of ages written by augustus m toplady asleep in the deep written by arthur j lamb with melody by henry w petrie st james infirmary a folk song of indeterminate authorship was recorded by many artists including louis armstrong in those girls really mournedthey mourned like coyotes the bear flag was taken over by doras next of kin an older sister who came down from san francisco where for some years she had been running a midnight mission on howard street running it at a profit she had been a silent partner all along and had dictated its unique practices and policies for instance dora had wanted to name her place the lone star because once in her youth she had spent a wonderful weekend in fort worth but her sister insisted that it be called the bear flag bear flag the bear flag so named because it featured a grizzly bear once native to california was raised at sonoma california on june by a group of american settlers led by captain john c frÃ©mont in a revolt against mexican rule in californias state legislature adopted it as the state flag in honor of california she said if you were hustling a state you should do honor to that state she didnt find her new profession very different from her old and she thought of both as a public service she read horoscopes and continued after hours at least to transform the bear flag into a kind of finishing school for girls she was named flora but one time in the mission a gentleman bum finished his soup and said flora you seem more a faunatype to me say i like that she said mind if i keep it and she did she was fauna ever afterward now all this was sad enough but there was a greater sadness that mack kept putting off he didnt want to get to it and so he told doc about henri the painter mack kind of blamed himself for henri henri had built a boat a perfect little boat with a nice stateroom but hed built it up in the woods because he was afraid of the ocean his boat sat on concrete blocks and henri was happy there one time when there wasnt much else to do mack and the boys played a trick on him they were bored they went down to the sea rocks and chiseled off a sack of barnacles and took them up and glued them on the bottom of henris boat with quickdrying cement henri was pretty upset particularly since he couldnt tell anybody about it doc could have reassured him but doc was in the army henri scraped the bottom and painted it but no sooner was the paint dry than the boys did it again and stuck a little seaweed on too they were terribly ashamed when they saw what happened henri sold his boat and left town within twentyfour hours he could not shake the persistent and horrifying notion that the boat was going to sea while he was asleep and mack told how hazel had been in the army too although you couldnt get anybody to believe it hazel was in the army long enough to qualify for the gi bill gi bill the popular name for the servicemans readjustment act which provided college or vocational education for returning world war ii veterans and he enrolled at the university of california for training in astrophysics by making a check mark on an application three months later when some of the confusion had died down the college authorities discovered him the department of psychology wanted to keep him but it was against the law hazel often wondered what it was that he had gone to study he intended to ask doc but by the time doc got back it had slipped his mind doc poured out the last of the first bottle of old tennis shoes and he said youve talked about everything else what happened to you mack mack said i just kind of stayed around and kept things in order well mack had kept things in order and he had discussed war with everybody hed met he called his war the big war that was the first one after the war the atombomb tests interested him in a fourthofjuly kind of way the huge reward the government offered for the discovery of new uranium deposits set off a chain reaction in mack and he bought a secondhand geiger counter at the monterey bus station the geiger counter started buzzing and mack went along with itfirst to san francisco then to marysville sacramento portland mack was so scientifically interested that he didnt notice the girl on the same bus that is he didnt notice her much well one thing led to another which was not unique in macks experience the girl was taking the long way to jacksonville florida mack would have left her in tacoma if his geiger counter hadnt throbbed him eastward he got clear to salina kansas with the girl on a hot muggy day the girl lunged at a fly on the bus and broke her watch and only then did mack discover that he had been following a radium dial romance alone was not enough for mack at his age he arrived back in monterey on a flatcar under a tarpaulin that covered a mediumsized tank destined for fort ord fort ord originally called camp gigling when it was established in the fort ord military reservation was located on the monterey bay peninsula between marina and sand city at more than twentyseven thousand acres it was one of the largest us army bases on the west coast and housed as many as fifty thousand troops after world war ii it became a facility for basic combat and advanced infantry training part of the base is now the site of california state university monterey bay mack was very glad to get home he had won a few dollars from a guard on the flatcar he scrubbed out the palace flop house and planted a row of morning glories along the front and he and eddie got it ready for the returning heroes they had quite a time when the heroes straggled back over doc and mack a golden melancholy settled like autumn leaves melancholy concocted equally of old tennis shoes and old times of friends lost and friends changed and both of them knew they were avoiding one subject telling minor stories to avoid a major one but at last they were dry and their subject confronted them doc opened with considerable bravery what do you think of the new owner over at the grocery oh hes all right said mack kind of interesting the only trouble is he cant never take lee chongs place there was never a friend like lee chong mack said brokenly yes he was wise and good said doc and tricky said mack and smart said doc he took care of a lot of people said mack and he took a few said doc they volleyed lee chong back and forth and their memories built virtues that would have surprised him and cleverness and beauty too while one told a fine tale of that mercantile chinaman the other waited impatiently to top the story out of their memories there emerged a being scarcely human a dragon of goodness and an angel of guile in such a way are the gods created but the bottle was empty now and its emptiness irritated mack and his irritation oozed toward lee chongs memory the sonofabitch was sneaky said mack he should of told us he was going to sell out and go away it wasnt friendly doing all that alone without his friends to help maybe thats what he was afraid of said doc lee wrote to me about it i couldnt advise himi was too far awayso he was safe you cant never find out what a chinks got on his mind said mack doc who would of thought he was what you might sayplotting oh it had been a shocking thing lee chong had operated his emporium for so long that no one could possibly have foreseen that he would sell out he was so mixed up in the feeding and clothing of cannery row that he was considered permanent who could have suspected the secret turnings of his paradoxical oriental mind which seems to have paralleled the paradoxical occidental mind it is customary to think of a sea captain sitting in his cabin planning a future grocery store not subject to wind or bottomfouling lee chong dreamed while he worked his abacus and passed out pints of old tennis shoes and delicately sliced bacon with his big knife he dreamed all righthe dreamed of the sea he did not share his plans or ask advice he would have got lots of advice one day lee chong sold out and bought a schooner he wanted to go trading in the south seas he dreamed of palms and polynesians in the hold of his schooner he loaded the entire stock of his storeall the canned goods the rubber boots the caps and needles and small tools the fireworks and calendars even the glassfronted showcases where he kept goldplated collar buttons and cigarette lighters he took it all with him and the last anyone saw of him he was waving his blue naval cap from the flying bridge of his dream ship as he passed the whistle buoy at point pinos point pinos located at the northern end of the monterey peninsula point pinos was named by spanish explorer sebastiÃ¡n vizcaÃ­no in it became the site of the oldest continuously operating lighthouse on the west coast established in into the sunset and if he didnt go down on the way over thats where he is nowprobably lying in a hammock under an awning on the rear deck while beautiful polynesian girls in very scanty clothes pick over his stock of canned tomatoes and striped mechanics caps why do you suppose he done it mack asked who knows said doc who knows what lies deep in any mans mind who knows what any man wants he wont be happy there said mack hell be lonely out among them foreigners you know doc i figured it out it was them goddam movies done it you remember he used to close up every thursday night thats because there was a change of bill at the movie house he never missed a movie thats what done it the movies i and you doc we know what liars the movies are he wont be happy out there hell just be miserable to come back doc gazed at his rundown laboratory i wish i were out there with him he said who dont said mack why them south sea island girls will kill him he aint as young as he used to be i know said doc you and i should be out there mack to help protect him from himself im wondering mack should i step across the street and get another pint or should i go to bed why dont you flip a coin you flip the coin said doc i dont really want to go to bed if you flip it ill know how its going to come out mack flipped and he was right mack said id just as lief step over for you doc you just set here comfortableill be right back and he was the troubled life of joseph and mary mack came back with a pint of old tennis shoes and he poured some in docs glass and some in his own doc said what kind of a fellow is the new owner over theremexican isnt he nice fellow said mack classy dresser name of joseph and mary rivas smart as a whip but kind of unfortunate docunfortunate and funny you know how it is when a pimp falls in love it dont make any difference how much he suffersits funny and joseph and marys kind of like that tell me about him said doc i been studying him said mack he told me some stuff and i put two and two together hes smart you know doc theres a kind of smartness that cuts its own throat havent you knew people that was so busy being smart they never had time to do nothing else well joseph and mary is kind of like that tell me said doc i guess you couldnt find no two people oppositer than what you and him is mack began youre nice doc nice and eggheady eggheady highly academic intellectual or studious but a guy would have to be nuts to think you was smart everybody takes care of you because youre wide open anybody is like to throw a sneakpunch at joseph and mary just because hes in there dancing and feinting all the time and hes nice too in a way whered he come from doc asked well ill tell you said mack mack was right doc and joseph and mary were about as opposite as you can get but delicately opposite their differences balanced like figures of a mobile in a light breeze doc was a man whose whole direction and impulse was legal and legitimate left to his own devices he would have obeyed every law down to pausing at boulevard stop signs the fact that doc was constantly jockeyed into illicit practices was the fault of his friends not of himselfthe fault of wide ida whom the liquor laws cramped like a tight girdle and of the bear flag whose business while accepted and recognized was certainly mentioned disparagingly in every conceivable statute book mack and the boys had lived so long in the shadow of the vagrancy laws that they considered them a shield and an umbrella their association with larceny fraud loitering illegal congregation and conspiracy on all levels was not only accepted but to a certain extent had become a matter of pride to the inhabitants of cannery row but they were lamblike children of probity and virtue compared to joseph and mary everything he did naturally turned out to be against the law this had been true from his earliest childhood in los angeles where he had been born he led a gang of pachucos pachucos members of mexicanamerican youth gangs in the southwestern united states from the s to the s the pachuco style and culture originated in el paso texas but moved quickly westward and became especially prominent in east los angeles pachucos sported loosefitting zoot suits oversized trousers and jacket with a characteristic broad felt hat which presented an exaggerated version of gangster clothing of the s pachucos spoke a unique dialect called calo a hybrid blend of formal spanish with english and gypsy words while he was still a child the charge that he lagged with loaded pennies lagged with loaded pennies joseph and mary may have used illegally weighted pennies for the coin toss that determined who would be first to break lag at pool if not provable at least seems reasonable he rejected the theory of private ownership of removable property almost from birth at the age of eight he was a pool hustler of such success that navy officers had been known to put him off limits when the gang wars started in the mexican district of los angeles joseph and mary rose above pachucos he set up an ambulatory store well stocked with switch knives snap guns brass knuckles and for the very poor socks loaded with sand cheap and very effective at twelve he matriculated at reform school and two years later emerged with honors he had learned nearly every criminal technique in existence this fourteenyearold handsome boy with sad and innocent eyes could operate the tumblers of a safe with either fingers or stethoscope he could make second stories as though he had suction cups on his feet but no sooner had he mastered these arts than he abandoned them reasoning that the odds were too great he was always a smart boy joseph and mary was looking for a profession wherein the victim was the partner of the predator the badger game the swinging panel and the spanish treasure badger gamespanish treasure illegal or unethical confidence games the badger game for instance is a dishonest trick in which a person is lured into a compromising situation and then blackmailed were nearer to his ideal but even they fell short he had never made a police blotter and he wanted to keep it that way somewhere he felt there was a profession illegal enough to satisfy him morally and yet safe enough not to outrage his instinctive knowledge of the law of averages you might have said he was well launched on his career when suddenly puberty smote him and for a number of years his activities took a different direction in the fields of larceny and fraud joseph and mary vegetated for a number of years he was a man when the fog cleared from before his eyes and he could see again then just when he was set to go the army got him and kept him as long as it could in good conscience it is said that his final dishonorable discharge is a masterpiece of understatement j and m never could get set he started again on his career and took a wrong turning for he fell under the influence of a young and understanding priest who drew him into the warm bosom of mother church into which joseph and mary had been born anyway now joseph and mary rivas approved of confession and forgiveness and he felt as perhaps franÃ§ois villon franÃ§ois villon french poet thief and general vagabond ca ca had that under the protection of the cloth he might find some outlet for his talent father murphy taught him the theory of honest labor and when joseph and mary had got over the shock of the principle he decided to give it a try he was still malleable and he succeeded where villon had failed in keeping his hands off church property with the help of father murphy who had influence in the city government joseph and mary found himself the possessor of a city job a position of dignity with a monthly check to be cashed without fear of fingerprinting the plaza in los angeles is a pretty square ornamented with small gardens palms in great pots and many many flowers it is a landmark a tourist center a city pride for it preserves a mexicanness unknown in mexico joseph and mary then was in charge of watering and cultivating the plants in the plazaa job that was not only easy and pleasant but kept him in direct touch with those tourists who might be interested in small packets of art studies although joseph and mary realized he could never get rich in this job he took a certain pleasure in being partly legal it gave him the satisfaction most people find in sin at about this time the los angeles police department had a puzzle on its hands marijuana was being distributed in fairly large quantities and at a greatly reduced price the narcotics squad conducted raid after raid without finding the source every vacant lot was searched from san pedro to eagle rock and then the countryside was laid out on graphing paper and the search for the pointed leaves of the marijuana went on in everwidening circles north past santa barbara east to the colorado river south as far as the border the border was sealed and it is well known that muggles muggles a slang term for marijuana does not grow in the pacific ocean six months of intensive search with the cooperation of all local officials and the state police got absolutely nowhere the supply continued unabated and the narcotics squad was convinced that the pushers did not know the source heaven knows how long the situation might have continued if it had not been for mildred bugle thirteen head of her class in beginning botany los angeles high school one saturday afternoon she crossed the plaza picked some interesting leaves growing around a potted palm and positively identified them as cannabis americana joseph and mary rivas might have been in trouble but for the fact that the los angeles police department was in worse trouble they could not bring him to book how would it look if the newspapers got hold of the story that the plaza was the source of supply that the product had been planted and nurtured by a city employee freshened with city water and fed with city manure joseph and mary was given a floater so strongly worded that it singed his eyelashes the police even bought him a bus ticket as far as san luis obispo doc chuckled you know mack he said youre almost building a case for honesty i always put in a good word for it said mack how did he get in the wetback wetback derogatory name applied to undocumented mexican immigrants in the united states the term is thought originally to refer to people crossing the border by swimming across the rio grande generally steinbecks use of racially charged terms such as chink and spick reflects the attitudes and habits of his characters not necessarily of the author his attitude toward mexican nationalsif not exactly fully realistic or authenticis nonetheless generally positive and respectful especially when it is noted that sweet thursday appeared during the same year the united states governments immigration and naturalization service launched operation wetback which targeted illegal mexican nationals in the southwestern united states and eventually succeeded in deporting eighty thousand of them business doc asked well he was casing the field for a career said mack and wetbacks looked like a goldbrick cinch joseph and mary figured the angles and the percentage you look at it and you see it couldnt flop he put up his fingers to count facts then took a quick drink to tide him over the period when his hands would be tied up mack touched the little finger of his left hand with his right forefinger number one he said j and m talks mexican because his old man and his old lady was mexican before they come to la he touched his third finger number two the wetbacks come in by theirself nobody makes them come theres a steady supply number three they cant talk english and they dont know a cop from a bucket they need somebody like joseph and mary to take care of them and get them jobs and take their pay if one of them gets mean all j and m got to do is call the federal men and they deport him without no trouble to j and m thats what he was always looking fora racket with the percentage stacked for the house he figures hes got three or four crews working in fruit and vegetables and he can kind of lay back and rest the way he always wanted thats why he bought out lee chong he figured to make the grocery a kind of labor center where he could rest up his men and sell them stuff at the same time and what hes doing aint very much against the law doc said i can tell from your tone it didnt work what happened music said mack now it is true that joseph and mary did know all the angles averages and percentages his systems couldnt lose but they did the odds are against making your point with the dice and that law holds until magic intervenes and someone makes a run there were literally millions of wetbacks in the countryquiet hardworking ignorant men content to bend their backs over the demanding earth it was a setup it couldnt lose how did it happen then that in joseph and marys crew there should be one tenor and one guitar player under his horrified eyes an orchestra took shapetwo guitars a guitarÃ³n rhythm and maraca men a tenor and two baritones he would have had the whole lot deported if his nephew cacahuete had not joined them with his hot trumpet joseph and marys wetbacks abandoned the carrot and cauliflower fields for the dance floors of the little towns in california they called themselves the espaldas mojadas espaldas mojadas joseph and marys group is wetbacks they played ven a mi mi chica dolorosa and mujer de san luis and el nubito blanco que llora ven a mique llora spanish song titles come to me my sorrowful girl woman from san luis and the little white cloud that cries the espaldas mojadas dressed in tight charro charro the spanish word for the colorful even gaudy traditional outfit of the mexican cowboy costumes wore huge mexican hats and played for dances in the spreckel firemans hall the soledad i o o f i o o f in de pen dent order of odd fellows a fraternal organization devoted to improving and elevating the condition of humanity through friendship love and truth derived from seventeenthcentury british orders the first american ioof lodge was chartered in baltimore mary land in in membership was extended to women the elks of king city the greenfield garage the san ardo municipal auditorium joseph and mary stopped fighting them and started booking them business was so good he screened new wetbacks for talent it was joseph and marys first entrance into show business and its native dishonesty reassured him that his course was well chosen so you see said mack it was music done it you cant trust nothing no more you take fauna nowthe bear flag aint like any hookshop on land or sea she makes them girls take tablemanner lessons and posture lessons and she reads the stars you never seen nothing like it everythings changed doc everything doc looked around his moldy laboratory and he shivered maybe im changed too he said hell doc you cant change why what could we depend on doc if you change a lot of people are going to cash in their chips why we was all just waiting around for you to get back so we could go on being normal i dont feel the same mack im restless now you get yourself a girl said mack you play some of the churchy music to her on your phonograph and then ill come in and hustle you for a couple of bucks make a try doc you owe it to your friends ill try said doc but i have no confidence in it im afraid ive changed hooptedoodle looking back you can usually find the moment of the birth of a new era whereas when it happened it was one day hooked on to the tail of another there were prodigies and portents that winter and spring but you never notice such things until afterward on mount toro the snow came down as

this meant nothing you never notice such things until afterward monterey had changed and so had cannery row and its denizens as mack said the tumtum changes giving place to new and god tumtums himself in many ways doc was changing in spite of himself in spite of the prayers of his friends in spite of his own knowledge and why not men do change and change comes like a little wind that ruffles the curtains at dawn and it comes like the stealthy perfume of wildflowers hidden in the grass change may be announced by a small ache so that you think youre catching cold or you may feel a faint disgust for something you loved yesterday it may even take the form of a hunger that peanuts will not satisfy isnt overeating said to be one of the strongest symptoms of discontent and isnt discontent the lever of change before the war doc had lived a benign and pleasant life which aroused envy in some gnatbitten men doc made a living as good a living as he needed or wanted by collecting and preserving various marine animals and selling them to schools colleges and museums he was able to turn affable and uncritical eyes on a world full of excitement he combined the beauty of the sea with mans loveliest achievementmusic through his superb phonograph he could hear the angelic voice of the sistine choir sistine choir recordings of the vaticans sistine chapel choir and could wander half lost in the exquisite masses of william byrd william byrd william byrd was one of the most celebrated english composers of the renaissance his three famous masses in latin were written between and he believed there were two human achievements that towered above all others the faust faust of goethe german author johann wolfgang von goethes tragedy of a man who sells his soul to mephistopheles the devil in exchange for unlimited power part i was published in and revised in part ii was published in the year goethe died of goethe and the art of the fugue art of the fugue of j s bach johann sebastian bach os ns was a prolific german composer and organist of sacred and secular works for choir orchestra and solo instruments his final and unfinished collection of fugues and canons was composed between and and published after his death in see below pp and of j s bach doc was never bored he was beloved and preyed on by his friends and this contented him for he remembered the words of diamond jim brady diamond jim brady james buchanan brady american businessman financier and philanthropist of the gilded age whose appetite for food was legendary who when told that his friends were making suckers of him remarked its fun to be a suckerif you can afford it doc could afford it he had not the vanity which makes men try to be smart docs natural admiration and desire for women had always been satisfied by women themselves he had few responsibilities except to be a kindly generous and amused man and these he did not find difficult all in all he had always been a fulfilled and contented man a specimen so rare aroused yearning in other men for how few men like their work their liveshow very few men like themselves doc liked himself not in an adulatory sense but just as he would have liked anyone else being at ease with himself put him at ease with the world in the army there had been times when he longed for his music for his little animals and for the peace and interest of his laboratory coming home forcing open the waterswollen door was a pleasure and a pain to him he sighed as he looked at his bookshelves it took him ten minutes to decide which record to play first and then the past was gone and he was faced with the future old jingleballicks had kept the little business going in a manner even more inefficient than doc had and then had left it to founder the stocks of preserved animals were depleted the business contacts had lapsed the bank that held his mortgage was no longer checked by patriotism there was some question whether doc could ever build back his marginal business in the old days he would have forgotten such considerations in multiple pleasures and interests now discontent nibbled at himnot painfully but constantly where does discontent start you are warm enough but you shiver you are fed yet hunger gnaws you you have been loved but your yearning wanders in new fields and to prod all these theres time the bastard time the end of life is now not so terribly far awayyou can see it the way you see the finish line when you come into the stretchand your mind says have i worked enough have i eaten enough have i loved enough all of these of course are the foundation of mans greatest curse and perhaps his greatest glory what has my life meant so far and what can it mean in the time left to me and now were coming to the wicked poisoned dart what have i contributed in the great ledger what am i worth and this isnt vanity or ambition men seem to be born with a debt they can never pay no matter how hard they try it piles up ahead of them man owes something to man if he ignores the debt it poisons him and if he tries to make payments the debt only increases and the quality of his gift is the measure of the man docs greatest talent had been his sense of paying as he went the finish line had meant nothing to him except that he had wanted to crowd more living into the stretch each day ended with its night each thought with its conclusion and every morning a new freedom arose over the eastern mountains and lighted the world there had never been any reason to suppose it would be otherwise people made pilgrimages to the laboratory to bask in docs designed and lovely purposelessness for what can a man accomplish that has not been done a million times before what can he say that he will not find in

of four biblical kings and is generally regarded to have authored the book of isaiah which delivers messages of peace compassion and justice it is better to sit in appreciative contemplation of a world in which beauty is eternally supported on a foundation of ugliness cut out the support and beauty will sink from sight it was a good thing doc had and many people wished they had it too but now the worm of discontent was gnawing at him maybe it was the beginning of docs middle age that caused itglands slackening their flow skin losing its bloom taste buds weakening eyes not so penetrating and hearing dulled a little or it might have been the new emptiness of cannery rowthe silent machines the rusting metal deep in himself doc felt a failure but he was a reasonably realistic man he had his eyes examined his teeth xrayed dr horace dormody dr horace dormody in dr horace dormody with his brother dr hugh dormody opened peninsula community hospital renamed community hospital of monterey peninsula in went over him and discovered no secret focus of infection to cause the restlessness and so doc threw himself into his work hoping the way a man will to smother the unease with weariness he collected preserved injected until his stock shelves were crowded again new generations of cotton rats crawled on the wire netting of the cages and four new rattlesnakes abandoned themselves to a life of captivity and ease but the discontent was still there the pains that came to doc were like a stir of uneasiness or the flick of a skipped heartbeat whisky lost its sharp delight and the first long pull of beer from a frosty glass was not the joy it had been he stopped listening in the middle of an extended story he was not genuinely glad to see a friend and sometimes starting to turn over a big rock in the great tide pool great tide pool an especially rich ecological zone and consequently one of docs prime specimen collecting sites it is located off montereys ocean view boulevard at the western foot of the point pinos light house in chapter of cannery row steinbeck wroteit is a fabulous place when the tide is in a wavechurned basin creamy with foam whipped by the combers that roll in from the whistling buoy on the reef but when the tide goes out the little water world becomes quiet and lovely the sea is very clear and the bottom becomes fantastic with hurrying fighting feeding breeding animalsa rock under which he knew there would be a community of frantic animalshe would drop the rock back in place and stand hands on hips looking off to sea where the round clouds piled up white with pink and black edges and he would be thinking what am i thinking what do i want where do i want to go there would be wonder in him and a little impatience as though he stood outside and looked in on himself through a glass shell and he would be conscious of a tone within himself or several tones as though he heard music distantly or it might be this way in the late night doc might be working at his old and battered microscope delicately arranging plankton on a slide moving them with a thread of glass and there would be three voices singing in him all singing together the top voice of his thinking mind would sing what lovely little particles neither plant nor animal but somehow boththe reservoir of all the life in the world the base supply of food for everyone if all of these should die every other living thing might well die as a consequence the lower voice of his feeling mind would be singing what are you looking for little man is it yourself youre trying to identify are you looking at little things to avoid big things and the third voice which came from his marrow would sing lonesome lonesome what good is it who benefits thought is the evasion of feeling youre only walling up the leaking loneliness sometimes he would leave his work and walk out to the lighthouse to watch the white flail of light strike at the horizons once there of course his mind would go back to the plankton and he would think its a protein food of course if i could find a way to release this food directly to humans why nobody in the world would have to go hungry again and the bottom voice would sing lonesome lonesome youre trying to buy your way in doc thought he was alone in his discontent but he was not everyone on the row observed him and worried about him mack and the boys worried about him and mack said to fauna doc acts like a guy that needs a dame he can have the courtesy of the house anytime said fauna i dont mean that said mack he needs a dame around he needs a dame to fight with why that can keep a guy so goddam busy defending himself he aint got no time to blame himself fauna regarded marriage with a benevolent eye not only was it a desirable social condition but it sent her some of her best customers well lets marry him off said fauna oh no said mack i wouldnt go that far my god not doc doc tried to solve his problem in the ancient way he took a long leisurely trip to la jolla four hundred miles south he traveled in the old manner with lots of beer and a young lady companion whose interest in invertebrate zoology doc thought might be flexibleand it was the whole trip was a success weather calm and warm tides low under the weedwreathed boulders of the intertidal zone doc found by great good fortune twentyeight baby octopi with tentacles four or five inches long it was a little bonanza for him if he could keep them alive he handled them tenderly put them in a wooden collecting bucket and floated seaweed over them for protection an excitement was growing in him his companion began to be a little disappointed docs enthusiasm for the octopi indicated that he was not as flexible as she and no girl likes to lose center stage particularly to an octopus the fourhundredmile trip back to monterey was made in a series of short dashes for doc stopped every few miles to dampen the sack that covered the collecting bucket octopi cant stand heat he said he recited no poetry to her the subject of her eyes her feelings her skin her thought did not come up instead doc told her about octopia subject that would have fascinated her two days before doc said theyre wonderful animals delicate and complicated and shy ugly brutes said the girl no not ugly said doc but i see why you say it people have always been repelled and at the same time fascinated by octopi their eyes look baleful and cruel and all kinds of myths have grown up around octopi too you know the story of the kraken kraken legendary tentacled sea monster of gargantuan size perhaps inspired by giant squid of course of course she said shortly octopi are timid creatures really doc said excitedly most complicated ill show you when i get them in the aquarium of course there cant be any likeness but they do have some traits that seem to be almost human mostly they hide and avoid trouble but ive seen one deliberately murder another they appear to feel terror too and rage they change color when theyre disturbed and angry almost like the rage blush of a man very interesting said the girl and she tucked her skirt in around her knees doc went on sometimes they get so mad they collapse and die of something that parallels apoplexy theyre highly emotional animals im thinking of writing a paper about them you might find out what causes human apoplexy said the girl and because he wasnt listening for it doc didnt hear the satire in her tone theres no need for giving the girl a name she never came back to western biological her interest in science blinked out like a candle but a flame was lighted in doc the flame of conception seems to flare and go out leaving man shaken and at once happy and afraid theres plenty of precedent of course everyone knows about newtons apple charles darwin and his origin of species charles darwin and his origin of species steinbeck is creating a myth here according to brian railsback in parallel expeditions darwin never claimed his theory flashed complete in such a way however the inductive process the novelist suggests in which a theory emerges after a gathering of facts does indicate his knowledge of darwins method further steinbeck is essentially correct in stating that the naturalist spent the rest of his life backing it up darwin produced six editions of the origin of species in his lifetime the last in ten years before his death p flashed complete in one second and he spent the rest of his life backing it up and the theory of relativity occurred to einstein in the time it takes to clap your hands this is the greatest mystery of the human mindthe inductive leap everything falls into place irrelevancies relate dissonance becomes harmony and nonsense wears a crown of meaning but the clarifying leap springs from the rich soil of confusion and the leaper is not unfamiliar with pain the girl said goodby and went away and doc did not know she was gone for that matter he did not know she had been with him with infinite care doc scrubbed out a big aquarium carpeted it with sea sand and laid in stones populated with sponges and hydroids and anemones he planted seaweeds and caught little crabs and eels and tidepool johnnys he carried buckets of sea water from the beach and set up a pump to circulate the water from tank to aquarium and back he considered every factor within his knowledgerelations of plant and animal life food filtering oxygenation he built an octopus world within walls of glass trying to anticipate every octopus need and to eliminate every octopus enemy or danger he considered light and heat eight of his octopi were dead but the twenty living ones scuttled to the bottom of their new home and hid themselves throbbing and blushing with emotion doc drew a stool close and peered into the little world he had made and his mind was filled with cool green thoughts and stately figures for the moment he was at peace the pale expressionless eyes of the octopi seemed to be looking into his eyes in the days that followed docs disposition was so unpredictable that mack exhausted every other possibility before he moved in on western biological for the two dollars he thought he needed macks campaign was probably the most elaborate of his career it began quietly and only after a thorough preparation did it begin to take shape then spinnerets of emotion laced in and the heavy notes of tragic necessity began to be faintly heard drama grew as it should out of its inherent earth macks voice was controlled and softno trembling yetjust a reasonable clear but potentially passionate growth mack knew he was doing well he could hear himself and he knew that if he were on the receiving end he would find it impossible not to weaken why then did not doc turn his eyes from the dimly lit aquarium he had certainly said hello when mack came in a little shakily mack cut in the vox angelica the vox dolorosa and finally a bendiga stupenda so moving that mack himself was in tears doc did not turn his head mack stood stunned it is a frightening thing to lay out everything you have to finish and have no response he didnt know what to do next he said loudly doc hello said doc dont you feel good sure mack how much do you want two dollars doc reached in his hip pocket for his wallet without lifting his eyes macks great performance had been wasted he might just as well have simply come in and asked for the money he knew he could never reach such a height again a sudden anger came over him and he considered refusing the money but his natural good sense saved him he stood there rolling the dollar bills between his fingers whats got into you doc he said doc turned slowly toward him theres going to be one great difficulty he said how am i going to light them its always a problem but in this case it might be insuperable light what doc we start with two obvious problems doc continued first they cant stand heat and second they are to a certain extent photophobic i dont know how im going to get enough cold light on them would it be possible do you suppose to condition them to light them constantly so that the photophobia subsides oh sure said mack uneasily dont be too sure said doc the very process of conditioning might if it did not kill them change their normal reactions its always difficult to evaluate responses that approximate emotions if i place them in an abnormal situation can i trust the response to be normal no said mack you cannot dissect for emotion doc went on if a human body were found by another species and dissected there would be no possible way of knowing about its emotions or its thoughts now it occurs to me that the rage or rather the symptom that seems like rage must be fairly abnormal in itself i have seen it happen in aquariums does it occur on the sea bottom is the observed phenomenon not perhaps limited to the aquarium no i cant permit myself to believe that or my whole thesis falls doc mack cried look doc its memack hello mack said doc how much did you say youve already given it to me said mack and he felt like a fool the moment hed said it i need better equipment said doc goddam it i cant see without better equipment doc hows about you and me stepping over and getting a halfpint of old tennis shoes fine said doc ill buy said mack ive got a couple of loose bucks doc said sharply ill have to get some money where can i get some money mack i told you ill buy doc ill need a wideangle binocularscope and light ill have to find out about lightmaybe a pinpoint spot from across the room no theyd move out of that maybe there are new kinds of lights ill have to look into it come on doc doc bought a pint of old tennis shoes and later sent mack out with money to buy another pint the two of them sat in the laboratory side by side staring into the aquarium resting their elbows on the shelf and they got to the point where they were mixing a little water with the whisky i got an uncle with an eye like them said mack rich old bastard too i wonder why when you get rich you get a cold eye selfprotection said doc solemnly conditioned by relatives i guess like i was saying doc everybody in the row is worried about you you dont have no fun you wander around like you was lost i guess its reorientation said doc well some people think you need a dame to kind of nudge you out of it i know a guy that every time he gets feeling low he goes back to his wife makes him appreciate what he had he goes away again and feels just fine shock therapy said doc im all right mack dont let anybody give me a wife thoughdont let them give me a wife i guess a man needs a direction thats what ive been needing you can only go in circles so long i kind of like it that way said mack im going to call my paper symptoms in some cephalopods approximating apoplexy great god almighty said mack there would be no game as he got to know him joseph and mary regarded doc with something akin to lovefor love feeds on the unknown and unknowable docs honesty was exotic to joseph and mary he found it strange it attracted him in spite of the fact that he could not understand it he felt that there was something he had missed though he could not figure what it was one day sitting in western biological joseph and mary saw a chess board and finding that it was a game and being good at games he asked doc to teach him j and m easily absorbed the characters and qualities of castles and bishops and knights and royalty and pawns during the first game doc was called to the telephone and when he returned he said youve moved a pawn of mine and your queen and knight howd you know the patrÃ³n asked i know the game said doc look joseph and mary chess is possibly the only game in the world in which it is impossible to cheat joseph and mary inspected this statement with amazement why not he demanded if it were possible to cheat there would be no game said doc j and m carried this away with him it bothered him at night he looked at it from all angles and he went back to ask more about it he was charmed with the idea but he couldnt understand it doc explained patiently both players know exactly the same things the game is played in the mind i dont get it well look you cant cheat in mathematics or poetry or music because theyre based on truth untruth or cheating is just foreign it has no place you cant cheat in arithmetic joseph and mary shook his head i dont get it he said it was a shocking conception and he was drawn to it because in a way its outrageousness seemed to him like a new strange way of cheating in the back of his mind an idea stirred suppose you took honesty and made a racket of itit might be the toughest of all to break it was so new to him that his mind recoiled from it but still it wouldnt let him alone his eyes narrowed maybe hes worked out a system he said to himself enter suzy it is popular to picture a smalltown constable as dumb and clumsy in the books he plays the stock bumpkin part and people retain this attitude even when they know its not true we have so many beliefs we know are not true a constable if he has served for a few years knows more about his town than anyone else and on all levels he is aware of the delicate political balance between mayor and councilmen fire department and insurance companies he knows why mrs geltham is giving a big party and who is likely to be there usually he knows when mabel andrews reports a burglar whether it is a rat in the dining room a burglar or just wishful thinking a constable knows that mr geltham is sleeping with the schoolteacher and how often he knows when highschool boys have switched from gin to marijuana he is aware of every ripple on the towns surface if there is a crime the constable usually knows who didnt do it and often who did with a good constable on duty a hundred things dont happen that might sometimes theres a short discussion in an alley sometimes a telephone call sometimes only his shadow under a street light when he gets a cat down out of a tree he knows all about the owner of the cat and many weeping parentprodded little boys and girls put small things stolen from the fiveanddime in the constables hands and he if he is a good constable gives them a sense of mercyinjustice without injuring the dignity of the law a stranger getting off the del monte express in monterey wouldnt be aware that his arrival was noted but if something happened that night he would know it all right montereys joe blaikey was a good constable he wouldnt ever be chiefdidnt much want to be everybody in town liked joe and trusted him he was the only man in town who could stop a husbandandwife fight he came by his techniques in both social life and in violence from being the youngest of fifteen nice but violent children just getting along at home had been his teacher joe knew everyone in monterey and he could size up a stranger almost instantly when a girl named suzy got off the greyhound bus she looked up and down the street fixed her lipstick then lifted her beatup suitcase and headed for the golden poppy restaurant suzy was a pretty girl with a flat nose and a wide mouth she had a good figure was twentyone fivefeetfive hair probably brown dyed blond brown cloth coat rabbitskin collar cotton print dress brown calf shoes heel taps a little run over scuff on the right toe she limped slightly on her right foot before she picked up her suitcase she opened her brown purse of simulated leather

but no powder tin box of aspirin no keys if there had been a murder that night joe blaikey could have written all that down but now he wasnt even aware that he knew it joe acted pretty much by instinct he got into the golden poppy just as the waitress was putting a cup of coffee on the counter in front of suzy joe slipped onto the stool next to her hi ella he said to the waitress cup of coffee coming up said ella hows your wife joe oh pretty good wish shed get her strength back though takes it out of you said ella man cant understand that give her a tonic and let her rest ill have fresh coffee in a minute if you want to wait yeah said joe ella went to the head of the counter put coffee in the silex and filled the bowl joe said quietly to suzy whats on your mind sister not a thing said suzy she didnt look at him but she could see him in the shine of a malted machine behind the counter vacation sure how long dont know looking for a job maybe ella started toward them saw what was happening and got busy at the other end of the counter joe asked know anybody here i got an aunt here whats her name that your business yep all right i got no aunt joe smiled at her and suzy felt better she liked a guy who was worried about his wife he said to her on the bum not yet said suzy you gonna give me trouble mister not if i can help it said joe you got a social security card

on alvarado street and then she went to the wharf and watched the fishing boats at their moorings a school of tiny fish always lay in the shade of the pier and two little boys fished with hand lines and never caught anything about four oclock she strolled along deserted cannery row bought a package of lucky strikes at the grocery glanced casually at western biological and knocked on the door of the bear flag fauna received her in the combination bedroom and office ill tell you the truth said fauna business aint been good it may pick up some in june i wish i could put you on aint you got a hardluck story that would kind of sway me nope said suzy you broke yep but you dont make nothing of it fauna leaned back in her swivel chair and squinted her eyes i used to work a mission she said i know hardluck stories from both ends i guess if you laid all the hard luck ive heard end to end why the bible would look short and some of them stories was true now i could make a guess about you suzy sat silentposture hands face noncommittal lousy home said fauna fighting all the time probably you wasnt more than fifteen or sixteen when you married the guy or maybe he wouldnt done it just to get away from the fighting suzy made no reply fauna looked away so that she wouldnt see the hands slowly grip each other got in a family way right off said fauna that made the guy restless and he powdered what did you say i didnt say nothing said suzy wheres the baby i lost it do you hate the guy i got nothing to say said suzy okay with me i aint really very interested theres some dames born for this business some are too lazy to work and some hate men dont hardly none of them enjoy what theyre doing that would be like a bartender that loves to drink you dont look like a naturalborn hustler to me

into j c penneys can i help you dress not too dear over here i like that tomatoey one thats a new shade love apples tomato color its rayon itll give you good service it better size twelve shoes to match suzy took a very deep breath yes by god she said the creative cross for days the flame burned in doc his phoenix thought true he didnt have a proper microscope but he had eyes and he had thank god an analytic mind that could slough off sensations emotions pains as he stared at the octopi his thesis took form with a glass needle he stimulated one to fear and rage until it attacked and killed its brother he removed one passive octopus to a separate jar where he subjected it to mild solutions of menthol of epsom salts sickening it a little and then bringing it back to health again then he aroused rage and when the body colors pulsed and changed he introduced a small amount of cocaine sulphate and saw the emotion disappear into sleep if you can say an octopus sleeps then he aroused it with saline and touched it here and there with the frustrating needle noted the flush the growing intensity of color the uncertain whipping and groping of the arms until suddenly it collapsed and died doc removed the body and dissected the tissue trying to find burst vesicles it works he said aloud i havent proper equipment to see how it happens but this animal dies with the appearance of apoplexy there must be leakage even if i cant see it i can start my paper with observation doc bought a package of yellow pads and two dozen pencils he laid them out on his desk the pencils sharpened to needle points and lined up like yellow soldiers at the top of a page he printed observations and speculations his pencil point broke he took up another and drew lace around the o and the b made a block letter of the s and put fish hooks on each end his ankle itched he rolled down his sock and scratched and that made his ear itch someones talking about me he said and looked at the yellow pad he wondered whether he had fed the cotton rats it is easy to forget when youre thinking watching the rats scrabble for the food he gave them doc remembered that he had not eaten when he finished a page or two he would fry some eggs but wouldnt it be better to eat first so that his flow of thought would not be interrupted later for some days he had looked forward to this time of peace of unbroken thought these were the answer to his restlessness peace and the life of the mind it would be better to eat first he fried two eggs and ate them staring at the yellow pad under the hanging light the light was too bright it reflected painfully on the paper doc finished his eggs got out a sheet of tracing paper and taped it to the bottom of the shade below the globe it took time to make it neat he sat in front of the yellow pad again and drew lace around all the letters of the title tore off the page and threw it away five pencil points were broken now he sharpened them and lined them up with their brothers a car drove up in front of the bear flag doc went to the window and looked out no one he knew but he saw mack go into the grocery he remembered he wanted to ask mack something its always hard to start to concentrate the mind darts like a chicken trying to escape thinking even though thinking is the most rewarding function of man doc could take care of this when you know what youre doing you can handle it he set his jaw and was starting to turn back to his desk when he saw out of the corners of his eyes the flash of a skirt he looked out the window again a girl had come out of the bear flag and was walking along cannery row toward monterey doc couldnt see her face but she had a fine walk thigh and knee and ankle swinging free and proud no jerk and totter the way so many women walked as they fell from step to step no this girl walked with her shoulders back and her chin up and her arms swinging in rhythm its a gay walk doc thought you can tell so much by a walkdiscouragement or sickness determination there are squinchedup mean walks and blustering walks shy creeping walks but this was a gay walk as though the walker were going happily to a meeting with someone she loved there was pride in the walk too but not vanity doc hoped she would not turn the corner but she did there was a flick of skirt and she was gone but doc could see in his mind her swinging limbs the melody of her lithe swift movement probably ugly as a mud fence he thought and then he laughed at himself thats full circle he said mind i congratulate you you jumped me to sex translated it to aesthetics and ended with sour grapes how dishonest can i be and all because i dont want to go to work ill work my head off to avoid work come mind this time you dont get away with itback to the desk he picked up a pencil and wrote the observed specimens were twenty small octopi taken in the intertidal zone near the town of la jolla specimens were placed in a large aquarium under conditions as nearly approximating their natural habitat as possible sea water was continuously filtered and replaced every twentyfour hours animals from a typical ecological community were introduced together with sand rock and algae taken from the collecting point small crustaceans were supplied in spite of precautions five individuals died within one week the remaining fifteen seemed to become acclimatized and readily captured and consumed the small grapsoid crabs placed in the aquarium the lights his pencil point broke he took another and it broke with a jerk making a little tear in the paper he read what he had written dull desiccated he thought why should i presume that an animal so far removed from the humanperhaps im fooling myself the middle voice sang subtly looking for yourself in the watersearching little man among the hydroids for your soullooking for contentment in vanity are you better than mack that you should use the secret priestly words of science to cover the fact that you have nothing to say and the bottom voice mourned lonesome lonesome let me up into the light and warmth lonesome doc jumped up and went to the aquarium and stared into the lighted water from under a rock an octopus looked out and one of its arms flicked rhythmically as though it led an orchestra and the beat was gay and free and fluidlike the swinging thigh and knee and ankle doc put his face in the palm of his hand and pressed blackness on his eyes until specks of green and red light swarmed on his vision and then he got up and went across the street for beer tinder is as tinder does joseph and mary rivas liked fauna even admired her but he did feel that it was a little indecent for a woman to own the bear flag a paying institution with a steady income operate it yes but not own it the proprieties told joseph and mary there should be a man in the background to drain off the profits it was his observation that when women had access to money they got nervous to his mind a healthy woman was a broke woman a dame with money was a kind of a halfassed man she stopped working at being a woman and as everybody knows the finest thing about a woman is that she is a woman joseph and mary had given some thought to relieving fauna of the responsibility of the profits if he owned the bear flag and fauna ran it there would be a natural and practical balance fauna had so far figured her way out from under his philanthropy but joseph and mary did not give up particularly when it was no trouble not to a good stock manipulator reads the financial page and looks for the stock he has but he also notices other quotations too just in case joseph and mary kept that kind of eye on the bear flag he felt that someday fauna might look away from the dealer for a moment now that his own affairs ran smoothly he was able to cast a benevolently rapacious eye about him he knew about suzy before she had even got her clothes washed and he felt that fauna was slipping you got a quail there he told fauna thats mary trouble if i ever seen it i guess so said fauna whyd you take her on i let myself make a mistake once in a while said fauna she aint a good hustler but when i get through with her she might make somebody a damn fine wife shes making a patsy of you said the patrÃ³n people got to be a patsy now and then said fauna you never feel real good if you never been a sucker once i went missionary down in south america why asked the patrÃ³n cant remember right off what did you do taught them to love one another what did they do taught me to shrink heads savages said the patrÃ³n no they wasnt them headhunters was pretty nice peoplehonest too when they sell you a head they give good value but theres always a wise guy like this athatoolagoolooa naturalborn headhustler hed worked out a way to push monkey heads gave them a close shave didnt have to shrink them much theres people will buy anything i know said the patrÃ³n well the bishop come through said fauna and he give me holy hell for buying up them monkey heads you mean to say you bought them said the patrÃ³n sure i bought them i got a box of them in the woodshed everybody said i was a fool but it paid off howd it pay off well look said fauna my bunch was honest and they shrunk honest heads spose a shipment goes out and this joker athatoolagooloo slips in a couple of his monkey headspretty soon nobody dont trust nobody why people would get to looking asspants at a real nice head i bought them up to keep them off the market i had my reputation to think of yeah but this joker the patrÃ³n began i know what youre going to sayand he done it too he had me he charged me more for them monkey heads than i paid for the real article he knew he had me thats what i thought anybody would said the patrÃ³n oh it all worked out said fauna if you ever buy a chungla head youll know you got the best yeah but how about the joker said the patrÃ³n fauna opened up her desk drawer and took out a beautiful little item black as polished ebony and no bigger than a lemon he made up real nice didnt he said fauna the patrÃ³n looked nervously away i got to get back he said i left my nephew in the store dont he play trumpet drives me crazy said joseph and mary got a new trumpet cant get away from it made him go practice down on the beach figured the waves and the sea lions would kind of drown him out the other night he give a passing signal to a navy tug and theyre still looking for what passed them but last night was the worst he was practicing down on the beach and he aimed his damn trumpet into the sewer pipe got resonance he said i dont know if its true but i heard that every toilet in the whole neighborhood give off with stormy weather stormy weather blues song written by musician harold arlen and lyricist ted koehler in about a heartbroken woman who has lost her man its first stanza sets the tone for the whole song dont know why theres no sun up in the sky stormy weather since my man and i aint together keeps raining all the time ethel waters first sang it at the cotton club in harlem but it was also memorably performed by billie holiday ella fitzgerald and lena horne who sang it in the movie of the same name in in it was chosen by the library of congress to be added to the national recording registry old lady somers was taking an enema i dont believe what they said happened i got to get back that kid can break glass with a high note come over and visit again said fauna you mind what i said about suzy i will said fauna its a funny thing but you never like to trade at your own place the store across the street has always got fresher cigarettes than you have the girls at the bear flag never got cigarettes from the slot machine at the bear flag when they wanted luckies or a up they went to the patrÃ³ns for that matter nearly everyone in cannery row went nearly every place in cannery row nearly every day joseph and mary had hardly got back to the grocery before suzy came in you wouldnt recommend joseph and mary as a celebrator of gods loveliest creation but if you wanted a quick assay on a babe you couldnt ask for better than joseph and marys if he was not involved in an emotional way he was good between the time suzy got change and the time she pushed the lucky strike button on his cigarette machine each had gone over the other and registered the result suzys note greaseball smart and mean look out if he gives you something a percentage boy smiles with his mouth eyes like a snake may trip himself someday by being too smart patrÃ³ns note lousy risk for a house a character wont play the rules might reverse the field too friendly if she likes a guy she might toss in her roll the patrÃ³n would have kicked her out of the bear flag he knew that the only person you can trust is an absolutely selfish person he always runs true to form you know everything hell do but you take somebody with an underlying kindness and he might fool you the only satisfactory sucker is the one who is entirely selfish you never have any trouble with that kind fauna was laying herself wide open joseph and mary tabulated suzy the way he might have bought a used car pretty good figure good ankles and legs too light in the butt and too heavy in the chest thats a bad sign a good hustler is flatchested face kind of pretty if she felt like it face reflected how she felt goodlooking if she felt good a good hustler has a mask looks the same to everybody pretty but you dont remember what she looked like the next morning suzy you wouldnt forget a real bad risk suzy liked people or she didnt like them that in itself was bad cacahuete the patrÃ³ns nephew was dusting shelves and he flashed a gold smile at suzy suzy lighted up she didnt smileshe grinned her lips were full and mouth wide and when she grinned her eyes crinkled and something warm and scary came out of her thats a bad risk on top of this was toughness but not dependable dull toughness suzy might take a poke at jack dempsey jack dempsey william harrison dempsey world heavyweight boxing champion known as the manassa mauler fifty of his sixty wins were by knockout she wasnt smart all in all joseph and mary wouldve dumped suzy in a minute shed be the kind of dumb dame whod fall for some guy without finding out his bank balance she was the kind he thought whod give one guy a helluva lot of trouble but whod be lousy playing the field she had something of the same quality doc had the patrÃ³n decided to warn fauna again this kid could be pure murder in a hookshop such was the patrÃ³ns reasoned opinion and the patrÃ³n was a professional if youd take a doctors advice about a disease youd surely take the patrÃ³ns about a hustler both could be wrong of course the appraisals and judgments were almost instantaneous so that by the time suzy had opened her cigarettes put one in her mouth and lighted it the judgment was complete how are you joseph and mary asked okay said suzy fauna wants some yellow pads and a couple of pencilssoft pencils the patrÃ³n laid them out she does a lot of writing he said shes used six pads in about a month shes doing astrology you believe that stuff no but it dont do no harm i knew a guy made a good living with it said the patrÃ³n oh she dont charge nothing said suzy i know said the patrÃ³n i cant figure why not fauna aint dumb she sure aint said suzy doc came in with two empty beer bottles get a couple of cold ones back on the ice will you he asked suzy glanced at him took him in and looked away his beard shocked her a little she didnt stare at him the way you dont stare at a cripple the patrÃ³n said why dont you put in an icebox then you can take a case at a time its easier to let you keep the ice said doc you know suzy here shes new at the bear flag how do you do said doc how do you do said suzy she would have said hi to anyone else when doc had gone the patrÃ³n said thats a funny guy it takes all kinds said suzy he knows stuff i aint even heard of the patrÃ³n was defending doc the way everyone did kind of hoitytoity asked suzy hell no thats the way he always talks he dont know no other way well i guess it takes all kinds said suzy he gets bugs and stuff out of the ocean and sells them who to why theres peoplell buy anything said the patrÃ³n i guess so why dont other people do it too much work and you got to know what to get say why does he wear that beard i used to know a wrestler wore one i dont know why said the patrÃ³n whyd the wrestler thought it made him look tough well maybe doc the samebut no he dont want to be tough the patrÃ³n went on in the army they made a guy with a beard shave it off said a guy with a beard wanted to be different and the best way to not get along in the barracks is to be different maybe thats it said suzy i dont mind a different guy if he aint too different dames can take it said the patrÃ³n they dont like it but they can take it what the hell am i doing all this talking for i got work to do suzy asked you mexican american my old man was mexican can you talk that spick spick insulting derogatory term for a hispanic person talk sure pollyvoo that aint the same kind said the patrÃ³n be seeing you said suzy and she went out and let the screen door slam she aint a bad kid the patrÃ³n thought but id sure kick her the hell out of the bear flag doc looked out the window of western biological he watched suzy walk past the vacant lot and up to the front porch of the bear flag just as she was about to climb the steps she turned and looked around she thought someone was looking at her she didnt see doc the great roque war the great roque war an american variant of croquet the name was derived by removing the first and last letters roque is played on a rolled sand court with permanently anchored wickets the mallets with which the ball is struck have a short handle approximately twentyfour inches and the ends of the mallet are faced with stone according to susan shillinglaws a journey into steinbecks california there was no such war with greens squaring off against blues though in a local tempest erupted in pacific grove over attempts to remove the roque courts voters resoundingly defeated the move p pacific grove pacific grove sedate pacific grove montereys nextdoor neighbor on the peninsula began in as a summer methodist tent camp and religious retreat on property owned by land baron david jack then in became the site of a pacific coast arm of the chautauqua literary and scientific circle modeled on the methodist sunday school teachers training camp established in at lake chautauqua new york pacific groves roots as steinbeck notes were religiously philosophically and politically conservative and monterey sit side by side on a hill bordering the bay the two towns touch shoulders but they are not alike whereas monterey was founded a long time ago by foreigners indians and spaniards and such and the town grew up higgledypiggledy without plan or purpose pacific grove sprang full blown from the iron heart of a psychoideolegal religion it was formed as a retreat in the s and came fully equipped with laws ideals and customs on the towns statute books a deed is void if liquor is ever brought on the property as a result the sale of ironandwine tonic is fantastic pacific grove has a law that requires you to pull your shades down after sundown and forbids you to pull them down before scorching on bicycles is forbidden as is sea bathing and boating on sundays there is one crime which is not defined but which is definitely against the law hijinks are forbidden it must be admitted that most of these laws are not enforced to the hilt the fence that once surrounded the pacific grove retreat is no longer in existence once during its history pacific grove was in trouble deep trouble you see when the town was founded many old people moved to the retreat people youd think didnt have anything to retreat from these old people became grumpy after a while and got to interfering in everything and causing trouble until a philanthropist named deems presented the town with two roque courts roque is a complicated kind of croquet with narrow wickets and shorthandled mallets you play off the sidelines like billiards very complicated it is they say it develops character in a local sport there must be competition and a prize in pacific grove a cup was given every year for the winning team on the roque courts you wouldnt think a thing like that would work up much heat particularly since most of the contestants were over seventy but it did one of the teams was called the blues and the other the greens the old men wore little skullcaps and striped blazers in their team colors well it wasnt more than two years before all hell broke loose the blues would practice in the court right alongside the greens but they wouldnt speak to them and then it got into the families of the teams you were a blue family or a green family finally the feeling spread outside the family you were a partisan of the blues or a partisan of the greens it got so that the greens tried to discourage intermarriage with the blues and vice versa pretty soon it reached into politics so that a green wouldnt think of voting for a blue it split the church right down the middle the blues and the greens wouldnt sit on the same side they made plans to build separate churches of course everything got really hot at tournament time things were very touchy those old men brought a passion to the game you wouldnt believe why two octogenarians would walk away into the woods and youd find them locked in mortal combat they even developed secret languages so that each wouldnt know what the other was talking about well things got so hot and feeling ran so high that the county had to take notice of it a blue got his house burned down and then a green was found clubbed to death with a roque mallet in the woods a roque mallet is shorthandled and heavy and can be a very deadly weapon the old men got to carrying mallets tied to their wrists by thongs like battleaxes they didnt go anyplace without them there wasnt any crime each didnt charge the other with including things theyd outgrown and couldnt have done if theyd wanted to the blues wouldnt trade in green stores the whole town was a mess the original benefactor mr deems was a nice old fellow he used to smoke a little opium when it was legal and this kept him healthy and rested so that he didnt get high blood pressure or tuberculosis he was a benevolent man but he was also a philosopher when he saw what he had created by giving the roque courts to the pacific grove retreat he was saddened and later horrified he said he knew how god felt the tournament came july and feeling was so bad that people were carrying pistols blue kids and green kids had gang wars mr deems after a period of years finally figured that as long as he felt like god he might as well act like god there was too much violence in town on the night of july mr deems sent out a bulldozer in the morning where the roque courts had been there was only a deep ragged hole in the ground if hed had time he would have continued gods solution hed have filled the hole with water they ran mr deems out of pacific grove they would have tarred and feathered him if they could have caught him but he was safe in monterey cooking his yen shi over a peanutoil lamp every july to this day the whole town of pacific grove gets together and burns mr deems in effigy they make a celebration of it dress up a lifesize figure and hang it from a pine tree later they burn it people march underneath with torches and the poor helpless figure of mr deems goes up in smoke every year there are people who will say that this whole account is a lie but a thing isnt necessarily a lie even if it didnt necessarily happen whom the gods love whom the gods love parody of a line by greek tragic dramatist euripides bce bce whom the gods would destroy they first make mad they drive nuts to a casual observer cannery row might have seemed a series of selfcontained and selfish units each functioning alone with no reference to the others there was little visible connection between la idas the bear flag the grocery still known as lee chongs heavenly flower grocery the palace flop house and western biological laboratories the fact is that each was bound by gossamer threads of steel to all the othershurt one and you aroused vengeance in all let sadness come to one and all wept doc was more than first citizen of cannery row he was healer of the wounded soul and the cut finger strongly entrenched in legality though he was he found himself constantly edged into infringements by the needs of his friends and anyone could hustle him for a buck without half trying when trouble came to doc it was everybodys trouble what was docs trouble even he didnt know he was deeply grievingly unhappy for hours on end he sat at his desk with a yellow pad before him and his needlesharp pencils lined up sometimes his wastebasket was full of crushed scribbled pages and at others not even a doodle went down then he would move to the aquarium and stare into it and his voices howled and cried and moaned write said his top voice and search sang his middle voice and his lowest voice sighed lonesome lonesome he did not go down without a struggle he resurrected old love affairs he swam deep in music he read the sorrows of werther sorrows of werther the sorrows of young werther loosely autobiographical novel of love and suicide by german writer and scientist johann wolfgang von goethe but the voices would not leave him the beckoning yellow pages became his enemies one by one the octopi died in the aquarium he had worn thin the excuse of his lack of a proper microscope when the last octopus died he leaped on this as his excuse when his friends visited him he would explain you see i cant go on without specimens and i cant get any more until the spring tides as soon as i have specimens and a new microscope i can whip the paper right off his friends sensed his pain and caught it and carried it away with them they knew the time was coming when they would have to do something in the palace flop house a little meeting occurredoccurred because no one called it no one planned it and yet everyone knew what it was about wide ida brooded hugely the bear flag was represented by agnes mabel and becky all the boys were accounted for the meeting began casually and obliquely as all meetings should hazel said wide ida throwed out a drunk last night and sprained her shoulder i aint as young as i used to be wide ida said gloomily the drunk dared her said hazel he didnt even touch the sidewalk going out if they was an olympic event for a and c a and c ass and collara bouncers move used to grab hold of and then eject a patron steinbeck mentions the technique in chapter of cannery row as well wide ida would win it easy sprained my shoulder up said wide ida they kept skirting their problem mack said hows fauna been pretty good she got problems said agnes becky was delicately picking off nail polish that fauna she said shes a wonder shes giving us tablesetting lessons i bet if they was thirtyfive forks shed know what every one of them was for aint they to eat with hazel asked jesus what a ignorant said becky i bet you dont know a dessert fork from a hole in the ground hazel said belligerently you know what a jackson fork jackson fork a mechanical hay fork used for lifting large amounts of hay is for no what just leave it lay and see whos a ignorant said hazel wide ida asked any change with doc no said mack i went over to see him last night i wisht there was something we could do they fell to musing if the times were hard on doc they were equally hard on his friends who loved him once he had been infallible there was nothing he could not do because there was nothing he wanted to do very much and in spite of themselves a little contempt for him was growing in his friendsa kind and loving contempt that might never have happened if he had not once been so great people who had once spoken his name with awe now felt better than he because he was no better than they i aint got an ideas how to proceed said mack hazel said hows about if we ask fauna to do his horoscope shes doing me right now you aint got no future said mack i have too said hazel i bet fauna could tell us what to do about doc mack looked interested its better than nothing he said hoc sunt eddie you dig up one of them kegs you buried during the war hazel you ask fauna to come over for a drink tell her to bring her star stuff maybe shes got me finished said hazel it was a matter of some sorrow to fauna that she didnt entirely believe in astrology but she had found that nearly everyone wants to believe that the stars take notice of us her science gave her a means for telling people what they ought to do and fauna had definite ideas about what everybody ought to do in spite of her secret skepticism every once in a while she turned up a reading that astonished her hazels horoscope had her breathless and baffled she seriously considered burning it and never telling him hazel led her to the palace flop house and mack poured her a drink from the keg she tossed it off still deep in thought you got my stars wrote down hazel demanded anxiously fauna regarded him sorrowfully i dont want to tell you she said why not is it bad awful said fauna come on tell me i can take it fauna sighed ive checked it over and over she said you sure you give me your true birthday sure then i dont see how it can be wrong she turned wearily and faced the others the stars say hazels going to be president of the united states there was a shocked silence i dont believe it said mack i dont want to be president hazel said and he didnt there is no choice said fauna the stars have spoke you will go to washington i dont want to hazel cried i dont know nobody there i wonder where we could all go said whitey no i seen some islands in the pacific that was pretty nice but hell hazel would have them too the us got a mandate i wont take it said hazel mack said we could kill him his stars dont say it fauna said hes going to live to seventyeight and die from a spoiled oyster i dont like oysters said hazel maybe youll learn in washington mack said maybe you made a mistake thats what i hoped said fauna i went over and over it no sir hazel is going to be president well weve weathered some pretty bad ones eddie offered forlornly aint they no way i can tell them i wont do it hell ill hide out said hazel desperately fauna shook her head dismally ill check again she said but i dont think you got a prayer you got nine toes hazel i dont know well count hazel took off his shoes and moved his lips nine he said bitterly thats what the horoscope said we can only pray its for the best lord said whitey no thats what i call a ninetoone prayer fauna now youve went and made a president out of a sows ear how about getting docs paper wrote whos a sows ear hazel demanded william henry harrison william henry harrison harrison was an american military leader a politician and the ninth president of the united states who died thirty days into his termthe briefest presidency in us history and the first us president to die while in office oh said hazel oh yeah agnes piped up in her hoarse soprano doc just aint himself i took him a pint and he didnt hardly pass the time a day just set there looking at that yellow paper know what was on that paper eggs said whitey no no i dont like to tell it aint nice hot damn said mack maybe hes getting well go onwhat well said agnes in a shocked voice hed drew a picture of a lady without no clothes on and right beside that was one of them damn devilfish only it was smoking a pipe dont hardly seem like the old doc wide ida shook herself out of a mountainous lethargy he used to be the easygoingest guy in the world now hes got a wild hair anybody else but doc id figure it was a dame but hell doc can take dames or let them alone mack said he could even take dames and let them alone fauna put her hands on her hips you fellas sure there aint a girl hiding out where he cant get to her no said hazel i wisht hed snap out of it go over and talk to him and he dont say nothing and he dont listen lets run a few dames past him and see if he picks up said whitey no mack said i dont believe in it but i wish fauna would do a job on doc might give us an idea fauna said i never seen nobody that wanted me to do a horoscope that believed in it i aint sure i believe in it myself sure ill do doc whens his birthday with surprise they realized that no one could remember seems like it was in autumn said eddie got to have it fauna said mack you think you could find out i guess so say fauna if you aint got too much integrity could you maybe rig it a little how do you mean well kind of tell him to lay off his goddam paper and get back to horsing around whats wrong with his paper if only he gets it wrote hazel demanded mack scratched his stomach i guess we got to face it he said doc wants to write that crazy paper driving himself nuts with it know what i think doc aint never going to write that paper hazel stood up what dyou mean well you know them kind of people they call accident prone no matter what they do they get hurt its like they want accidents well i think doc dont really want to write that paper whitey no said he sure goes about it the hard way ever hear of a substitute said mack you mean like on the bench at football eddie asked hell no said mack i mean like a guy is using something to cover up something elseand maybe he dont even know it himself hazel demanded you running doc down take it easy said mack i think docs scared to write that paper because he knows its crazy quod erat demonstrandum quod erat demonstrandum latin for that which was to be demonstrated indicating that something has been clearly proven its acronym qed often appears at the conclusion of mathematical proofs huh asked fauna qed said mack oh said fauna sure theres a hole in reality through which we can look if we wish doc had made changes his desk was drawn in front of the window he sat writing rapidly on his yellow pad color change he wrote seems to be not only a concentration of fluids to the surface but also a warping of tissue which perhaps refracts the light giving an impression of color a door slammed doc looked out at the street fauna was teetering down the chicken walk that led from the palace flophouse doc looked back at his pad there were footsteps on the pavement he looked up wide ida was going toward her bar joseph and mary came out of the heavenly flower and crossed the street climbed the stairs of western biological and knocked come in doc cried and there was relief in his voice thought id shovel the dirt a little that band of mine is practicing upstairs drives me crazy well im pretty busy said doc j and m gazed about the room why do you keep snakes to sell whod buy snakes said j and m say what you looking at he craned his neck thats the new dame shes going to give fauna trouble little mary trouble who doc asked you wasnt listening i guess i must get to work said doc you know i still dont get it what there must be some way to kind of bend the odds in chess there isnt ive got to go whats the rush tide said doc doc walked on the beach beyond the light house the waves splashed white beside him and sometimes basted his ankles the sandpipers ran ahead of him as though on little wheels the golden afternoon moved on toward china and on the horizons edge a lumber schooner balanced on docs left the white sand dunes rounded up and behind them the dark pine trees seemed to hold a piece of night throughout the day doc thought under stimulation there is increased pulsing like a man under physical or emotional strain something like the release of adrenalinebut no way to prove it no more specimens until spring tides his middle voice argued maybe you dont believe any of it why cant you laugh at yourself you could once youre trapped in a cage of selfimportance lonesome the low voice cried in his guts no one to receive from you or give to you no one warm enough and dear enough doc wanted desperately to go back to his old lifethe hopeless wish of a man wanting to be a little boy forgetting the pain of little boys doc dropped to his knees and dug a hole in the damp sand with a scooped hand he watched the sea water seep in and crumble the sides of the hole a sand crab scuttled away from his digging fingers from behind him a voice said what are you digging for nothing said doc without looking around there are no clams here i know it said doc and his top voice sang i just want to be alone i dont want to talk or explain or argue or even to listen now hell tell me a theory hes got on oceanography i wont look around the voice behind him said theres so much metal in the sea why theres enough magnesium in a cubic mile of sea water to pave the whole country i always get them doc thought if theres a bughouser within miles hes drawn to me im a seer said the voice doc rocked angrily back on his heels okay he said its just my business but you tell me about it he didnt remember ever having been discourteous to a stranger before this one was a big bearded stranger with the lively innocent eyes of a healthy baby he wore ragged overalls and a blue shirt washed nearly white and he was barefooted the straw hat on his head had two large holes cut in the brim proof that it had once been the property of a horse doc found his interest rising it is my custom to invite a stranger to dinner said the seer not original of course harun alrashid harun alrashid harun ca fifth abbasid caliph who ruled from to was a munificent patron of letters and arts and under him baghdad was at its apogee he became a great figure to the arabs who tell about him in many of the stories of the thousand and one nights did the same please follow me doc stood up from his squatting position the tendons in back of his knees creaked with pain the seer towered above him and on closer inspection it was true that his blue eyes had the merry light of a wise baby but his face was graniticchiseled out of the material of prophets and patriarchs doc found himself wondering if some of the saints had not looked like this from the ragged sleeves of the blue shirt wrists like big grapevines protruded and hands sheathed in brown calluses crisscrossed with barnacle cuts the seer carried a pair of ancient basketball shoes in his left hand and seeing doc look at them he said i only wear them in the sea my feet arent proof against urchins and barnacles in spite of himself doc felt surrounded by the man harun said doc was visited by djinni djinni in arabian and muslim mythology djinni or jinni are intelligent spirits of lower rank than the angels they are able to appear in human and animal forms and to possess humans and the spirits of earth fire and water do the djinni visit you doc thought oh lord am i going to play along with this nonsense why cant i cross my fingers and spit and walk away i can still walk away the seer looked downward at an angle into docs face i live alone he said simply i live in the open i hear the waves at night and see the black patterns of the pine boughs against the sky with sound and silence and color and solitude of course i see visions anyone would but you dont believe in them doc asked hopefully i dont find it a matter for belief or disbelief the seer said youve seen the sun flatten and take strange shapes just before it sinks in the ocean do you have to tell yourself every time that its an illusion caused by atmospheric dust and light distorted by the sea or do you simply enjoy the beauty of it dont you see visions no said doc from music dont forms of wishes and forms of memory take shape thats different said doc i dont see any difference said the seer come alongdinners ready in the dunes there are deep little creases where the windcrouching pines have made a stand against the moving sand and in one of these only a hundred yards back from the beach the seer had his home the little valley was protected from the wind the pine boughs covered it and the sand was deeply carpeted with sweet pine needles once down in the little cup you could hear the wind sweeping the pine tips overhead and a perpetual dusk hung under the warped trees the pines survived only by following the suggestions of the stronger forcescrouching low and growing their limbs in the direction of the wind nourishing the little trailing plants which slow up the pace of the walking dunes under the trees a fire was burning and on a hearth of flat stones blackened tin cans steamed this is my home the seer said you are welcome here i have a wonderful dinner he brought a tin box from the fork of a tree took out a loaf of french bread and sliced off two thick slices then he brought sea urchins from a dripping sack cracked them on a rock and spread the gonads on the bread the males are sweet and the females sour he said i like to mix the two ive tasted them said doc the italians eat them its about as strong a protein as you can get some people think its aphrodisiac there was an iron simplicity in the seer he was like a monolith of logic standing against waves of angry nonsense next well have steamed limpets said the seer i have a pin here to eat them with do you like sea lettuce its an acquired taste and then i have a stewa kind of universal bouillabaissei wont tell you whats in it youll see do you take all of your food from the sea the seer smiled at him no not all i wish i could it would be simpler i take all the protein i need and more but my human stomach still craves starch i want a little bread and some potatoes i love acid with the protein seei have a bottle of vinegar and some lemons and last i indulge myself with herbs rosemary and thyme and sage and marjoram how about sugars doc asked you wont find sugars in a tide pool the seer dropped his eyes and watched a black ant try to climb an avalanche of sand losing ground all the way when he spoke his voice was shy and ashamed i steal candy bars he said i cant seem to help it the flesh is weak said doc oh i dont mind that the seer cried appetites are good things the more appetites a man has the richer he is but i was taught not to steal i dont believe in stealing it hurts my feelings when i do and i dont enjoy the candy bars as much as i would if i didnt steal them but i love baby ruths and mounds they picked the limpets from their shells with pins and dipped them in lemon juice the stew contained mussels and clams and crabs and little fish seasoned with garlic and rosemary some people dont like it said the seer after they had finished doc lay back in the pine needles and a fine peacefulness settled on him the air the softness of the needles the odors of kelp and pine and yerba buena the music of surf against windplucking pine needles the fullness of belly made a little room of contentment around him he said im surprised they dont lock you upa reasonable man its one of the symptoms of our time to find danger in men like you who dont worry and rush about particularly dangerous are men who dont think the worlds coming to an end its coming to an end all right the seer said that started the moment it was born i dont know why they dont put you in jail its a crime to be happy without equipment oh they do said the seer and they put me under observation every once in a while i forgot said doc you are crazy arent you i guess so said the seer but not dangerous and theyve never caught me stealing candy bars im very clever at that and i steal only one at a time dont ever gather disciples said doc theyd have you on a cross in no time theres not much danger of that i dont teach anybody anything im not so sure said doc the doctrine of our time is that man cant get along without a whole hell of a lot of stuff you may not be preaching it but youre living treason im lazy said the seer did you ever drink yerba buena tea yerba buena tea yerba buena clinopodium douglasii is a sprawling aromatic herb of the western and northwestern united states western canada and alaska and is used to make tea that is both a medicinal and a refreshing drink its name an alternate form of hierba buena which means good herb was given by the spanish priests of california no its strong and aromatic and a mild physic can you drink it out of a beer bottle i dont know why not look out the bottles hot here wrap a twig around it after a while the seer asked whats aching you or dont you want to talk about it id just as soon talk about it if i knew what it was said doc as a matter of fact its gone away for the moment ah one of those said the seer do you have wife or children no do you want wife or children i dont think so the seer said i saw a mermaid last night you remember there was a half moon and a thin drifting mist there was color in the night not like the black and gray and white of an ordinary night down at the end of the beach a shelf of rock reaches out and the tide was low so that there was a smooth bed of kelp she swam to the edge and then churned her tail like a salmon leaping a rapid and then she lay on the kelp bed and made dancing figures with her white arms and hands she didnt go away until the rising tide covered the kelp bed was she a dream did you imagine her i dont know but if i did im proud that i could imagine anything so beautiful what is it you want ive tried to think said doc i want to take everything ive seen and thought and learned and reduce them and relate them and refine them until i have something of meaning something of use and i cant seem to do it maybe you arent ready and maybe you need help what kind of help there are some things a man cant do alone i wouldnt think of trying anything so big without he stopped the heavy waves beat the hard beach and the yellow light of the setting sun illuminated a cloud to the eastward a clot of gold without what doc asked without love said the seer i have to go see the sunset now ive come to the point where i dont think it can go down without me that makes me seem needed he stood up and brushed the pine needles from his threadbare overalls ill come to see you again said doc i might be gone the seer replied ive got a restlessness in me ill probably be gone doc watched him trudge over the brim of the dune and saw the wind flip up the brim of his straw hat and the yellow sun light up his face and glisten in his beard hazels brooding after mack left the palace flop house and incidentally did not find doc at home hazel sat brooding things came through slowly to hazel he had heard mack advance his theory about how doc would never get his paper written but the impact of the statement did not strike home until he was alone it is true that all over cannery row the feeling was growing that doc was not infallible but the news had not seeped through to hazel he knew that doc was in trouble but the friendly feeling of contempt had not penetrated if hazel had wanted to know the day and hour of the worlds demise he would have gone to doc and docs answer would have been final alone he brooded not about docs weakness but about the treachery of docs friends who could question him who would dare to question him hazel beat his hand on the arm of his rocking chair for a while and then he got up and went to wide idas eddie was behind the bar so hazel had two shots of whisky and paid for a coke he walked between two canneries to the beach a seagull with a broken wing engaged his kindly interest he chased it trying to help it until it swam to sea and drowned hazel had experienced an earthquake and he searched for the shaker he walked along the rocks to pacific grove beach and even the brown young men standing on their hands for the girls did not hold interest he went up the hill and toured the basement of holmans department store holmans department store according to the pacific grove museum of natural history wwwpgmuseumorg this landmark pacific grove store was started in when r luther holman bought towles dry goods store on light house avenue near seventeenth street by when the store moved over two blocks to its new location at light house avenue son wilford holman was in charge of operations holmans department store with more than forty different departments was the largest store on the pacific coast between los angeles and san francisco and highway also known as the holman highway was built in part to bring customers to its doors the store having hired a flagpole skater to promote business appears in chapter nineteen of cannery row the floor manager accompanied him an honor and a precaution few people received but hazel didnt even see the shining display of small tools you cannot cut the ground from under a man and expect him to act normally on his way back to cannery row hazel passed a funeral home where an impressive group was gathering ordinarily hazel would join any kind of celebration with enthusiasm but now he watched the mounds of gladiolas being carried out and no sense of participation stirred in him the festive dead would have to be buried without hazel in new monterey hazel walked not around but right through a dog fight all the preceding manifestations would have troubled his friends but if they had known what hazel was thinking they would have been horrified thinking is always painful but in hazel it was heroic a picture of the process would make you seasick a gray whirling furor of images memories words patterns it was like a traffic jam at a big intersection with hazel in the middle trying to get something to move somewhere he strolled back to cannery row but he did not go to the palace flop house by instinct he crept under the branches of the black cypress tree in the vacant lot where he had lived for so many years in prepalace days hazels thoughts were not complicated it was just remarkable that he had them at all hazel loved doc doc was in trouble somebody was responsible who that it might be a situation rather than a person was beyond his grasp the person who was hurting doc must be made to stop it even if he had to be killed hazel had nothing against murder that he hadnt killed anybody was only because he hadnt needed to or wanted to he tried to recall everything he had heard concerning docs frustration and it was all nebulous all vague except for one thing mack had said doc couldnt write his paper that was the only clear statement that had been made mack was the one if mack knew about it he must be responsible for it this was a matter of sorrow to hazel because he liked mack very much he hoped he wouldnt have to kill him it was getting dark under the cypress tree too dark to read hazel always judged light by whether or not you could read by it in spite of the fact that he never read anything the frontporch light of the bear flag came on western biological was still dark up the hill in the palace flop house the kerosene lantern made a dim glow through the windows again and again hazel tried to turn to sweet thoughtlessness but it was no use mack was responsible mack had to do something about it hazel got up and brushed the cypress dirt from his clothes he walked up past the rusty pipes and the empty boiler crossed the railroad track and went up the chicken walk behind him muffled by the canneries he could hear cacahuete playing stormy weather on his trumpet and the sea lions on china point barking in the palace mack and the boys were playing ticktacktoe with a piece of chalk on the floor the wining jug was set conveniently near hi hazel said mack draw up mack hazel said sadly i want you should step outside with me and put up your dukes mack rocked back on his heels what im going to beat the holy hell out of you said hazel why mack asked this was just the question hazel was afraid of he tried to find a quick tough answer you just step out and youll find out he said hazel mack stood up hazel baby whats eating you tell me see if i cant make it right hazel felt the whole situation leaving his hands you cant treat doc that way he said fiercely not doc what way am i treating him i aint done nothing to doc except maybe hustle him a little but we all done thateven you tried you said he cant write his paper thats what you done oh for gods sakes said mack youre yellow then okay im yellow sometime when i aint feeling yellow ill paddywhack you sit down have a jolt from the jug they babied hazel and pampered him until his eyes were damp with appreciation but when hazels mind dug in it would not let loose you got to help him he repeated he aint happy he just mopes you got to help him mack said it aint entirely our fault trouble is doc lets concealment like a worm in the bud feed on his damask cheek lets concealmenthis damask cheek mack quoting shakespeare is one of the incongruous comedic effects steinbeck strove for in sweet thursday spoken by viola in act ii scene line of william shakespeares comedy twelfth night or what you will ca a blank my lord she never told her lovebut let concealment like a worm i the budfeed on her damask cheek she pined in thoughtand with a green and yellow melancholyshe sat like patience on a monumentsmiling at grief was not this love indeed he sure as hell does said whitey no i aint going to stand for no excuses said hazel mack studied the problem from every angle hazels right he said at last weve been selfish we never in our lives had such a good friend as doc and were letting him down makes me feel ashamed its hazel showed the way if i was in trouble i wouldnt want hazel to do no figuring but i sure would like to have him for a friend hazel ducked his head in embarrassment in his life so few compliments had come his way that he didnt know how to cope with them mack went on i make a solemn move we all stand up and drink a toast to hazela noble noble soul aw hell fellas said hazel and he wiped his eyes on his sleeve they stood in a circle around him mack and eddie whitey no and whitey no and each one tipped the jug over his elbow and drank to hazel good feeling was running so high they did it again and were about to do it a third time when hazel said aint there something we can drink to so i can get a drink to lefty grove lefty grove robert moses lefty grove one of the greatest pitchers in majorleague baseball history grove retired in with a career record of his lifetime winning percentage is eighth alltime but none of the seven men ahead of him won more than games grove was elected to the baseball hall of fame in in he was elected to the major league baseball allcentury team said eddie that broke the ice an era of good feeling set in they dug up another keg of the private stock eddie had saved during the war he started the bung and smelled it delicately i remember this one he said they was some guys up from south america and they brought in a bottle of absinthe absinthe a distilled highly alcoholic aniseflavored spirit derived from herbs including the flowers and leaves of the medicinal plant wormwood artemisia absinthium perfumes the whole house said mack it was like old times they reminded one another if gay were only herelets drink a toast to good old gay our departed friend the absinthe had soothed the mixture in the keg and added something sweet and oldfashioned a courtliness crept into the speech of the dwellers of the palace flop house an oldworld courtesy everyone vied to be last not first at the refilled jug next dough we get well go up to woolworths woolworths the f w woolworth company was a nationwide retail corporation whose fiveanddime stores became a nearly universal presence in america the first woolworths store was founded in by frank winfield woolworth the chain closed in and get some glasses said mack hell said whitey no theyll just get broke but i see what you mean somehow they felt they were living in a moment when history pauses and takes stock and changes course they knew they would look back on this night as a beginning at such times men feel the nudge toward oratory mack steadied himself against the stove and begged their attention by rapping on the stovepipe gentlemen he said let us here highly resolve to get docs ass out of the sling of despond eddie said remember we done something like that once and damn near ruined him macks golden mood held we were younger then he said this time were going to think her out and shes going to be foolproof hazel was so far won back into comradeship that he had relaxed into happy incoherence to lefty grove he said mack opened the oven door and sat on it ive give it a lot of thought he said lately i done hardly nothing else you never do hardly nothing else said whitey no mack ignored him i got a theory aw shut up said eddie who you talking to said whitey no i dont know said eddie innocently but if the shoe fits i got a theory if you aint too pieeyed to listen said mack when he had them quiet he went on when you hear my theory you might get kind of violent i want you to sleep on it before you talk i think doc needs a wife what well hell he dont have to marry her said mack you know what i mean if the absinthe had not given them tolerance he might have had a series of fights right then kindly do not interrupt he said i will now review the dame situation in the us you take a look at divorces and the reasons for them and you can only think one thing the only guy that shouldnt have nothing to do with picking out a wife is the guy thats going to marry her thats a fact its a fact that if hes left alone a guy practically always marries the wrong kind of dame play it safe and dont marry nobody said whitey no theres some guys cant operate that way said mack are you suggesting we turn doc our true friend in i asked you not to shoot off your face until you slept on it said mack with dignity hazel tugged at his sleeve aint you joking mack no said mack i aint joking if anything bad come to doc you know what id do to you hazel asked yes said mack i think i doand i think id have it coming hazels bed was a fourposter on which the bedposts were twobyfours topped by a quilt he had built it from memory of a moving picture when the palace flop house was quiet at last hazel lay in his bed and looked up at the logcabin pattern of his canopy his mind was whirling he wished there were some simpler way to help doc than by the major operation mack had suggested once he got up and looked out the door and saw that the green shaded light was on in the laboratory the poor bastard he whispered he didnt sleep well and his dreams were shaped like mushrooms flower in a crannied wall flower in a crannied wall flower in the crannied wall by alfred lord tennyson a popular english victorian poet and the poet laureate of

should know what god and man is joe elegant joe elegant various candidates have been proposed as the model for joe elegantnotably mythologist joseph campbell and novelist truman capotethough given the selfparodying nature of sweet thursday louis owens in john steinbecks revision of america plausibly offers the young john steinbeck author of such ponderously mythical novels as cup of gold and to a god unknown with their naive and heavyhanded wielding of symbols p was a pale young man with bangs he smoked foreign cigarettes in a long ebony holder and he cooked for the bear flag the girls said he made the best popovers in the world and he could give a massage that would shake the kinks out of a saturday night when the fleet was in he sneered most of the time and except at mealtime kept to himself in his little leanto behind the bear flag from which the rattle of his typewriter could be heard late at night one morning soon after she had come suzy was having her coffee while joe elegant cleared the table of crumbs from earlier breakfasts you make good coffee suzy said thank you you dont look like a guy who would work here its temporary i assure you i got a wonderful recipe for gumbo want me to give it to you fauna designs the meals you aint very friendly why should i be he was passing behind her suzy reached up hooked her fingers in his shirt collar twisted and yanked his face

my apartment some afternoon i could give you a cup of tea say youre a nice fella got any more coffee ill make a fresh pot parallels must be related doc spent a restless night his head was full of yellow pads and seers and octopi ordinarily he would have worked or read since he couldnt sleep but now if he turned on a light he would see the yellow pad and the marshaled pencils as the dawn crept over the bay he decided to go for a very long walk perhaps to follow the shoreline all the way around to carmel he arose and since it was still dusky in the laboratory he turned on the lights to make his coffee wide ida from the entrance of la ida saw his lights come on she put an unlabeled pint bottle of brown liquor in a paper bag and crossed the street to western biological doc she said would you work this stuff over what is it they say its whisky i just want to know if itll kill anybody i got a pretty good buy they make it up in pine canyon thats against the law said doc killing people is against the law too said wide ida doc was torn between bootlegging and murder he thought sadly that he was always involved in something like thisnot good or bad but bad and less bad he made a fairly quick analysis its not poison he said but it wont build good healthy stomachs theres some fusel oil fusel oil an oily colorless liquid with a disagreeable odor and taste it is a mixture of alcohols and fatty acids formed during the alcoholic fermentation of organic materials fusel oil is used as a solvent in the manufacture of certain lacquers and enamels it dissolves nitrocellulose it is poisonous to humans in it but i guess its no worse than old tennis shoes thanks doc what do i owe you oh maybe a quartbut not this stuff ill send over some old taylor you dont have to go off the deep end said doc doc i hear you got trouble me what kind of trouble i just heard said wide ida doc said angrily ive got no trouble whats all the talk god almighty everybody treats me as though i had a disease what kind of trouble if theres anything i can do she said and went out quickly leaving the pint behind doc took a sip of it made a face and took a swig his heart was pounding angrily he could not admit that the pity of his friends only confirmed his frustration he knew that pity and contempt are brothers he set his chin i will get the spring tides at la jolla he said to himself i will get a new microscope and the very lowest voice whispered somewhere theres warmth he sat down at his desk and wrote viciously parallels must be related he took another drink from the pint and opened yesterdays mail there was an order for six sets of slidesstarfish embryonic series for the oakland polytechnic oakland polytech oakland technical high school in oakland california known locally as oakland tech is a public high school located on broadway in north oakland it is one of six comprehensive public high school campuses in oakland founded in it is the alma mater of clint eastwood rickey henderson huey p newton and the pointer sisters high school he was almost glad to do the old and practiced work he got his collecting buckets together threw rubber boots in his old car and drove out to the great tide pool lousy wednesday some days are born ugly from the very first light they are no damn good what ever the weather and everybody knows it no one knows what causes this but on such a day people resist getting out of bed and set their heels against the day when they are finally forced out by hunger or job they find that the day is just as lousy as they knew it would be on such a day it is impossible to make a good cup of coffee shoestrings break cups leap from the shelf by themselves and shatter on the floor children ordinarily honest tell lies and children ordinarily good unscrew the tap handles of the gas range and lose the screws and have to be spanked this is the day the cat chooses to have kittens and house broken dogs wet on the parlor rug oh its awful on such a day the postman brings overdue bills if its a sunny day it is too damn sunny and if it is dark who can stand it mack knew it was going to be that kind of a day he couldnt find his pants he fell over a box that had crept out in his path he cursed each brother in the palace flop house and on his way across the vacant lot he went out of his way to kick a dandelion flower he was sitting gloomily on a pipe when eddie came by and so naturally he walked with eddie to wide idas to try to do something about it he hung around waiting for wide ida to go so that eddie could slip him a drink but wide ida was bending over the bar cursing a letter taxes she said every time you get going theres more taxes youre lucky mack you dont own nothing and you dont make nothing until they start taxing skin youre safe whats the beef he asked city and county taxes said wide ida on what on this place it aint much but i was fixed to put a down payment on a new pontiac it was a statement that ordinarily would have aroused a detached compassion in mack together with mild selfcongratulation that he was not burdened with taxable assets but now a nagging worry fell on him and he went back to the palace flop house to worry in greater comfort he went over the history of the palace in his mind it had belonged to lee chong long before the war mack and the boys had rented it from him for five dollars a month and naturally enough they had never paid any rent lee chong would have been shocked if they had then lee chong sold out to joseph and mary did the palace go with the rest mack didnt know but if it did the patrÃ³n didnt know it he was no lee chong he would have demanded the rent but if the patrÃ³n did own the place he would get a tax bill if he got a tax bill he was sure to be on the necks of mack and the boys the patrÃ³n was not a man to pay out money without getting more money back that was certain it seemed very unjust their home their security even their social standing were cast in the balance mack lay on his bed and considered what could be done suppose the patrÃ³n demanded back rentclear back for years you couldnt trust a man like that what a lousy day it was mack didnt know what to do so he called a meeting of the boys even sent hazel to bring eddie back from wide idas bar it was a grim and shaken assembly mack explained all the angles until even hazel seemed to understand the danger the boys studied their fingers looked at the ceiling blew on their knuckles eddie got up and walked around his chair to change his thinking luck at last whitey no said we could steal his mail so he wont get no tax bill it aint practical said mack even if it wasnt a crime hazel offered we could kill him you aint heard thats against the law too mack asked i mean make it like an accident said hazel he could fall off point lobos then somebody else inherits the joint and we dont even know who the injustice in the theory of private ownership of real estate was descending on them maybe we could get doc to talk to him he likes doc this was whitey no s offering that would only draw it to his attention said mack hell he might even raise the rent he might even try to collect it said eddie hazel was going into a slow but luminous burn he gazed about the whitewashed walls of the palace flop house at the cocacola calendar girls cocacola calendar girls illustrators for the atlantabased soft drink giant pioneered a type of graphically appealing and colorful calendar art that featured cocacolas calendar girls who though provocatively posed in bathing suits were intended to portray wholesomeness as well as beauty steinbeck had used the ubiquitous advertising image in chapter one of the wayward bus at the great and ancient woodstove at the grandfather clock at the framed portrait of romie jacks romie jacks romie jack was one of the seven surviving children out of nine of wealthy and controversial scottishborn monterey county land baron david jack and his wife maria christina soledad romie romie served as manager of the familys david jack corporationowned abbot hotel later cominos hotel in salinas the cominos hotel is featured in steinbecks short story the chrysanthemums there were honest unabashed tears in hazels eyes the sonofabitch he said after all our work he takes away our homethe only place where i ever been happy how can a guy be so goddam mean he aint done it yet said mack he dont even know about it maybe i wish doc owned the place said eddie we wouldnt have no trouble with doc mack looked at him quickly what put that in your head he demanded hell doc dont open his mail for weeks on end doc would forget to collect the rent and hed forget to open a tax bill excitement shone in macks eyes eddie he said maybe you put your finger in it in what i got to think it over said mack but just maybe our darling eddie here is a genius eddie blushed with pleasure whatd i do mack i cant tell you now hell mack i want to know what i done it was smart said mack it was a stroke of just pure wonderful now lets give the patrÃ³n a goingover how much guts you think hes got plenty said hazel and hes plenty wise mack spoke slowly thinking aloud lets see joseph and mary you might say is a con man in a general kind of way hes a nice dresser said hazel a con man cant make enemies unless of course he wants to get out of town he got to keep everybody happy and friendly come on mack whitey no demanded tell us fellas said mack if i blowed it now and it wasnt no good why youd kind of lose face in me i want to think this one out and see if i cant kind of surround him but if we do her youll all have to help do what let me alone now boys said mack and he went back to his bed and put his head on his crossed hands and studied the rafters of the palace flop house hazel came quietly to his bedside you wont let nobody take our home away will you mack i promise said mack fervently wheres eddie went back to wide idas will you do something for me hazel sure mack take that lard can over there and see can eddie fill it full of beer without too much fuss itll help me to think better youll get your beer said hazel you just keep thinking mack say mack how do you think eddie always got a stroke of genius even when he dont know it and i dont never have none come again said mack how comeoh the hell with it said hazel the playing fields of harrow the playing fields of harrow harrow school founded in an exclusive elite british mens boarding public school near london was famous for its tradition of harrow football begun in the nineteenth century a unique hybrid game exclusive to the school which combines elements of both soccer and rugby but which uses a sphericalshaped leather ball because fauna tutors her girls in socialsexual gamesmanship as

study and some of these things were actually done by the girls of the bear flag one wall was dominated by a large framed board on which were pasted enormous gold stars and this was faunas personal pride the ready room was gay and feminine it had an exotic oriental odor from the incense which burned in the blackened lap of a crouching plaster buddha at about a quarter to three agnes and mabel and becky were relaxing in the ready room it was a time of languor the vacant lot was washed in clear pale sunshine which made even the rusty pipes and the old boiler look beautiful the tall mallow

guernsey breeders journal the oldest dairy breed magazine published by a us breed organization california civil code and a novel by sterling north sterling north thomas sterling north author of numerous books for adults and children including the best seller so dear to my heart what the hell is there to read well well just have to use the basket i guess agnes put the basket on your head fauna inspected her now look here young ladies she said just because you got your ankles together and your hips flang forwardthat dont necessarily mean posture agnes tuck in your butt postures a state of mind real posture is when a young ladys flat on her ass and still looks like she got books on her head there came a knock on the door and joe elegant handed fauna a note she read it and sighed with pleasure that mack she said what a gent i guess hed drain the embalming fluid off his dead grandma but hed do it nice is his grandma dead agnes asked who knows said fauna listen to this young ladies

of saint francis of assisi the name given to a classic collection of popular legends about the life of st francis of assisi and his early companions as they appeared to the italian people at the beginning of the fourteenth century doc laid ten big starfish out on a shelf and he set up a line of eight glass dishes half filled with sea water although he was inclined to carelessness in his living arrangements his laboratory technique was immaculate the making of the embryo series gave him pleasure he had done it hundreds of times before and he felt a safety in the known thingno speculation here he did certain things and certain other things followed there is comfort in routine his old life came back to hima plateau of contentment with small peaks of excitement but none of the jagged pain of original thinking none of the loneliness of invention his phonograph played softly played the safe and certain fugues of bach clear as equations as he worked a benign feeling came over him he liked himself again as he once had liked himself as a person the way he might like anyone else the selfhatred which poisons so many people and which had been irritating him was gone for the time the top voice of his mind sang peacefulness and order and the raucous middle voice was gentle it mumbled and snarled but it could not be heard the lowest voice of all was silent dreaming of a warm safe sea the rattlesnakes in their wire cage suddenly lifted their heads felt the air with their forked tongues and then all four set up a dry buzzing rattle doc looked up from his work as mack came in mack glanced at the cage them new snakes aint got used to me yet he said takes a little time said doc you havent been here much didnt feel no welcome here said mack im sorry mack i guess ive

here do you nobody wants any trouble hes got a stake here mack went on if the whole row took a scunner to him why he just couldnt take that chance dont you think if i knew what you were talking about it might help said doc im just trying to figure something said mack well if you mean that the patrÃ³n is in kind of a sensitive position thats what i do mean said mack he cant afford to have no enemies nobody wants enemies said doc i know but he could get his ass in a sling he got a business and hes got property i see what you mean said doc youre going to pressure him and you want to know what hell do what are you going to try to take away from him mack im just thinking said mack i never knew you to think idly when you think somebody gets hurt i never hurt nobody doc well not bad i

license to practice why as a matter of fact i dont know why said doc how about preventive medicine you mean how to keep them from getting sick yes thats easy said mack stay broke doc sat silent for a while he glanced at the starfish and saw the reproductive fluid beginning to ooze from between their rays say mack he asked did you come over to try to get something out of me i dont think so said

rattled doc called come in without looking up from his microscope suzy stood in the doorway she held a gigantic flop cake on one hand and carried a paper bag of canned beer in the other how do you do she said formally doc looked up oh hello for gods sake whats that a cake joe elegant made it why doc asked i think fauna told him to well i hope you like cake said doc suzy laughed i dont think this is a eating cake this is a looking cake fauna sent you some beer thats more like it said doc whats fauna want nothing thats funny where shall i put the cake said suzy now doc looked at suzy and suzy looked at doc and they both had the same thought and they burst into laughter tears streamed from suzys eyes oh lord said suzy oh lord she laughed with her mouth wide and her eyes pinched shut doc slapped his leg and threw back his head and roared and the laughter was so pleasant they tried to keep it going after its momentum was spent oh lord said suzy i got to wipe my eyes she put the cake down on top of the rattlesnake cage and hysterical rattling filled the room suzy jumped back whats that rattlesnakes what you got them for i take their venom and sell it id hate to live with a bunch of dirty snakes theyre not dirty they even change their skins thats more than people do i hate them said suzy and she shuddered you wouldnt once you knew them well i aint likely to get to know them

can see how starfish get to be why do they want to know well i guess because thats the way people get to be then why dont they study people doc laughed its a little difficult to kill unborn babies every halfhour here take a look he pushed a glass dish under the microscope suzy peered in the eyepieces god almighty she said did i look like that once something like sometimes i feel like that now say doc you got a funny businessbugs and all like that there are funnier businesses he said sharply she stiffened meaning my business you dont like my business huh it doesnt matter whether i like it

stinks floor aint been clean in years you aint got a decent suit of clothes you probably cant remember your last hot meal you sit here breeding bugsfor chrissake what do you think thats a substitute

youre happy said suzy youre a pushover if no dames got you its because no dame wants you who the hell would want to live with bugs and snakes in a joint like this whod want to go to bed with anybody thats got three bucks said doc cruelly suzy said icily a smart guy a real smart guy hes got what he wants seems to me i heard youre writing a great big goddam highfalutin paper who told you that everybody knows about it everybodys laughing at you behind your backand you know why because everybody knows youre kidding yourself you aint never going to write that paper because you cant write that paper youre just sitting here like a kid playing wish games she saw her words go home as surely as though she had watched arrows drive into his chest and misery and shame overwhelmed her i wish i didnt say that she spoke softly i wish to god i never said that it might be true said doc quietly maybe you put your finger on the truth is everybody laughing at me is everybody laughing my names suzy she said are they laughing suzy they got no right to she said i was just fighting backhonest to god i was i didnt mean any of that stuff i said i love true things i love true things cf steinbecks appraisal of ed ricketts in about ed ricketts he loved true things and believed in them p xvi said doc even when they hurt isnt it better to know the truth about oneself and he asked it of himself yes i think it is i think it is youre quite right ive got nothing thats why i built up the whole story about my paper until i believed it myselfa little man pretending to be a big man a fool trying to be wise fauna will kill me suzy moaned shell wring my neck say doc you got no right to take mad talk from a twobit hustleryou got no right whats it matter where the truth comes from he said if its the

long doc and she followed becky out doc watched them go he said aloud thats probably the only completely honest human i have ever met his eyes wandered to the table and suddenly he bellowed goddam it she made me miss the time the dirty bitch ive got to do it all over and he dumped the contents of the glass dishes into his slop bucket a pause in the days occupation not the least important and valuable custom fauna brought to the bear flag was the little time of rest and contemplation in the ready room after work and before sleep grievances were brought out and inspected quarrels were settled and all the little matters of interest and despair were turned over and examined for their actual value then praise or blame were assigned and plans for improvement were laid out with lore and tact learned in other fields fauna warped and nudged and bunted her young ladies toward good nature and kindliness which are the parents of restful sleep it was not unusual for light refreshments to be served and on occasion the young ladies voices joined in songhome sweet home old black joe down by the old mill stream harvest moon home sweet homeharvest moon home sweet home was composed in by sir henry bishop from an adaptation of clari or the maid of milan by american dramatist john howard payne old black joe was composed in by stephen c foster the other two songs steinbeck mentions here

shorthanded the night of the memorial meeting for dead members sponsored by the rattlesnake club of salinas helen and wisteria were doing sixty days for a lady fight that is still discussed with admiration in cannery row when the last rattlesnake had gone and the big front door was closed the girls wandered wearily into the ready room sat down and kicked off their shoes becky said one of them rattlesnakes tonight called us an institution and a landmark agnes said acidly we get a few more like suzy and itll be a institution all right i got an uncle in a institution he goes right on fighting

earthquake weather it was a thursday and it was one of those days in monterey when the air is washed and polished like a lens so that you can see the houses in santa cruz twenty miles across the bay and you can see the redwood trees on a mountain above watsonville the stone point of frÃ©monts peak clear the other side of salinas stands up nobly against the east the sunshine had a goldy look and red geraniums burned the air around them the delphiniums were like little openings in the sky there arent many days like that anyplace people treasure them little kids are likely to give off tinwhistle screams for no reason and businessmen find it necessary to take a drive to look at a piece of property old people sit looking off into the distance and remember inaccurately that the days of their youth were all like that horses roll in the green pastures on such a day and hens make a terrible sunny racket thursday was that magic kind of day miss winch who took pride in her foul disposition before noon said good morning to the postman joe elegant awakened early intending to work on his novel on the scene where the young man digs up his grandmother to see if she was as beautiful as he remembered you will recall his novel the pi root of oedipus but joe elegant saw the golden light on the vacant lot and a dew diamond in the heart of every mallow leaf he went out in the damp grass in his bare feet and scampered like a kitten until he got to sneezing miss graves who sings the lead in the butterfly pageant in pacific grove saw her first leprechaun up in back of the reservoirbut you cant tell everything that happened every place on that sweet thursday for mack and the boys it was the morning of truth and since mack was to bear the brunt of it his friends cooked him a hot breakfast and eddie mixed real bourbon whisky in the coffee hazel polished macks shoes and brushed his best blue jeans whitey no brought out his fathers hat for mack to weara narrowbrimmed black hat the crown peaked up to a point whitey no s father had been a switchman on the southern pacific and this hat proved it he stuffed toilet paper in back of the sweatband until it fitted mack perfectly mack didnt talk he knew how much depended on him and he was brave and humble at the same time the boys put the carefully printed tickets in his hand and saw him off and then they sat down in the weeds to wait they knew mack was quaking inside mack went down the chicken walk and across the railroad track he passed the old boiler and rapped on the rusty pipes in a wild show of bravado in front of the grocery he studied a display of screw drivers with loving intensity before he went in cacahuete was behind the counter studying a copy of down beat down beat american magazine devoted to jazz the publication was established in in chicago illinois it is named after the downbeat in music also called the one beat he wore a purple windbreaker with gold piping a lean and handsome boy he had the wild and sullen light of genius in his eyes hi said mack jar said cacahuete joseph and mary around upstairs i want to see him personal said mack cacahuete gave him a long surly stare then went to the back of the store and called tÃ­o mio tÃ­o mio spanish for my uncle what do you want mack wants to see you what about who knows joseph and mary came down the stairs in a pale blue silk bathrobe morning mack these kids have no manners cacahuete shrugged and took his down beat to the top of the potato bin youre out early said the patrÃ³n mack began with ceremonial seriousness you aint been here long joseph and mary but youve made a lot of friends good friends the patrÃ³n inspected this statement and made a note of its slight inaccuracy still he had nothing to lose by going along with it i like the people around here he said they treat me good his eyelids lowered sleepily which meant he was as alert as a radar screen mack said in a little town you get kind of hidebound but youre a man of the world you been all over you know how things is the patrÃ³n smiled and acknowledged his wisdom and waited i and the boys want to ask your advice said mack you aint likely to get a wild hair a vague uneasiness stirred in the patrÃ³n whats it about he asked tentatively mack drew a deep breath a smart businessman like you might think it was silly but maybe you been here long enough to get it its a sentimental thing its about doc i and the boys owe doc a debt we aint never going to be able to repay how much asked the patrÃ³n he upended a broom and tore out a straw with which to pick his teeth take a powder he said softly to cacahuete and his nephew slithered upstairs it aint money said mack its gratitude for years docs took care of usget sick he cures us get broke hes there with a buck everybody says the same the patrÃ³n observed he could not put his finger on the attack and yet he felt there was an attack the sound of his own voice had a warming reassuring effect on mack he was the professional practicing his profession we might of went right on hustling doc for years he said if only doc didnt get his ass in a sling hes in trouble you know hes in trouble said mack poor bastard sits there beating his brains out with them sooplapods you told me well us boys want to do something about it we aint going to see our darling friend crap out if we can help it i bet he done a couple of nice things for you too the patrÃ³n said do you know you cant rig a chess game we had that out said mack impatiently docs business aint been good he cant crack open them sooplapods without he gets a great big goddam microscopecost about four hundred bucks the patrÃ³n said hastily if youre passing the hat ill throw in ten bucks thanks said mack passionately i knew you was a good guy but that aint it i and the boys want to do it ourself we dont want your ten buckswe want your advice the patrÃ³n went behind the counter opened the icebox took out two cans of beer speared them open and slid one up the counter to mack thanks said mack and he beered down his dry mouth and throat haaah he said thats fine now heres what we want to know we got something and we want to raffle it then we want to take that raffle money and get that microscope for doc we want you should give us a hand with the tickets and stuff like that what you going to raffle the patrÃ³n asked this was the moment the horrible moment macks hand shook a little as he poured down the second half of the cool sharp beer his insides quaked the palace flophouseour home he said the patrÃ³n took a pocket comb out of stock and ran it through his black shining hair it aint worth four hundred bucks he said mack nearly cried with relief he could have kissed the patrÃ³ns hand he loved joseph and mary a strong and tender tone issued from his throat we know that he said but its our home oh i know it aint very valuable but when you got something that aint worth muchwhy you raffle it dont you if you got a good cause you can raffle an old pair of socks a new respect showed in the patrÃ³ns eyes you got something there he said and then whos going to win it mack felt confident now he knew his man he was ready to use his knowledge he said confidentially i dont never try to kid a smart hombre i could tell you we was going to draw honest but youd know that was double malarky no we got a idear the patrÃ³n leaned forward some of his wariness was lulled he was still no pushover but he was softened up whats the idear he asked well we got to have someplace to live dont we now this is between i and the boys and youokay okay said the patrÃ³n well sell doc a ticket or maybe just put a ticket in his name and well rig the raffle so he wins i dont get it said the patrÃ³n look said mack doc gets his microscope dont he and we go right on habiting in the palace flop house but its docs its a sap to his old agea kind of insurance i and the boys figure thats the least we can do for him spose he sells it said the patrÃ³n oh not doc he wouldnt put us out in the street a smile spread over the patrÃ³ns large handsome face he could find no fault with it i guess i never give you proper credit he said youre smart maybe we can do some businessi mean later you got the raffle tickets we made them up last night mack laid a little pile of cards on the table how much apiece says right on them mack said two bucks my first offer still stands said the patrÃ³n ill take five and you can leave me some to sell think you could use twenty i could unload nearly fifty said the patrÃ³n ill put them out with the espaldas mojadas macks knees were weak as he went up the chicken walk his glazed eyes stared straight ahead he walked right past the boys and into the palace flop house and sat down heavily on his bed the boys trooped in behind him and stood around got him said mack he dont know he owns it he bought five tickets and hes going to sell fifty to his wetbacks there is a point of relief and triumph in which words have no place eddie went outside and they could hear his shovel strike the ground mack and the boys knew eddie was digging up a keg and this was only one of the happenings on that sweet thursday sweet thursday fauna always drew the shades of her bedroom tight down because of the late hours of business she had to sleep until noon to get her proper rest on the morning of sweet thursday the sun played a trick on her the windowshade had a hole in it no bigger than the point of a pin the playful sun picked up the doings of cannery row pushed them through the pinhole turned them upside down and projected them in full color on the wall of faunas bedroom wide ida waddled across the wall upside down wearing a print dress sewn with red poppies and on her head a black beret the pacific gas electric truck rolled across her wall upside down its wheels in the air mack strode toward the grocery store head down and a little later doc weary feet over his head walked along the wallpaper carrying a quart of beer that would have spilled if it had not been an illusion at first fauna tried to go back to sleep but she was afraid she might miss something it was the little colored ghost of upsidedown doc that drew her from her couch it is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it and this had happened to fauna she was glad when she raised the shade and saw how beautiful was the day the roof of the hediondo cannery hediondo cannery steinbecks joke hediondo means stinky in spanish where seagulls had perched glowed like a pearl fauna brushed her hair severely back and put on a closefitting hat of black sequins she wore her darkgray knitted suit and carried gloves in the kitchen she put six bottles of beer in a paper bag and then as an afterthought she rooted out one of the shrunken monkey heads as a present when she climbed the stairs of western biological and stood at the top puffing a little you might have thought she was soliciting for the red cross instead of for the bear flag doc was frying sausages sprinkling a little chocolate over them it gave them an odd and oriental flavor he thought youre up early he greeted fauna i figured one quart of beer wouldnt last long it didnt said doc have a couple of sausages dont mind if i do said fauna for she knew that he who gives to you is in debt to you this heres a monkey head that i picked up in my travels interesting said doc you know theres some folks think theyre peoples heads said fauna dont see how they could see the shape of the eyes and ears look at the nose oh some folks dont look at people very close said fauna ill have a bottle of beer with you the taste of the chocolate sausages intrigued her i never tasted nothing like it she observed did you ever eat grasshoppers doc yes said doc in mexico theyre kind of peppery fauna was not one to beat around bushes you must get sick of everybody wanting something from you she said doc smiled id be sicker if they didnt he said what can i do for you say thanks for the cake and the beer last night fauna asked what did you think of the kid strange said doc somehow i cant see her working at the bear flag neither can i said fauna she aint no good at it but it looks like im stuck with her trouble with suzy is shes got a streak of lady in her and i dont know how to root it out doc munched his sausages and sipped his beer thoughtfully i never thought of it but that could be a drawback he said shes a nice kid said fauna i like her fine but shes a liability in a business way why dont you kick her out oh i cant said fauna shes had a tough time i never had no gift for kicking people out what id like is if shed pick up and go she got no future as a floozy she threw the book at me said doc you see said fauna shes a character that aint no good in a house she slapped me in the face with a few basic truths said doc thats a quick eye shes got and a quicker tongue said fauna would you do me a favor why of course said doc anything i can i cant go to nobody else fauna went on they wouldnt understand what is it doc said fauna i knocked around and i seen all kinds i tell you if you got a streak of lady in you it spoils you for anything else now you never come over to the bear flag you play the field i personally think that costs you more but i aint one to mess in the way people want to live i dont think im following you said doc okay ill lay out the deck when youre making a play for one of them babes them amateurs you got to do quite a lot of talking before you make the sackaint that right doc smiled ruefully right he said well do you always mean every word of it doc pinched his lower lip whywhyi guess right at the moment i do but afterward afterward if i were to think about it thats what i mean said fauna so if you happen to tell a little teensybeensy bit of baloney you dont blow your brains out youd do well in the analysis business said doc what do you want me to do this kid suzys lousy with new roses she aint a good hustler because of that streak of lady i dont know if shed make a good lady or not i want her off my neck doc would it do you any harm to make a play for her i mean like you do with them dames that come in here what good could that possibly do he asked well maybe im wrong but the way i figure it you can use new roses if you want to if you made a pitch for the kid like she was a lady why she might turn lady on you i still cant see what good it would do said doc it would get her the hell out of the bear flag said fauna she wouldnt want to congregate with no more floozies how about me said doc you dont marry them others do you no but take a whang at her will you doc fauna begged cant do you no harm why hell she might scram out of here and take up typewriting or telephone operating will you do that for me doc he said it doesnt seem honest fauna changed her tack i was talking to her last night and she said she couldnt remember when a guy had treated her like a girl what harm would that do might make her miserable might make her fly the coop maybe she likes it the way it is she dont i tell you shes a blowedintheglass lady look doc you take her out to dinner and ill buy the dinner you dont have to make no pass just be nice to her ill have to think about it think you might do it i might thats a good kid if you treat her right youd be doing me a big favor suppose she wont go she will i wont give her no choice doc looked out the window and a warmth crept through him and suddenly he felt better than he could remember feeling ill think about it he said ill throw in three bottles of champagne whenever you say the word said fauna after lunch joe elegant read fauna his latest chapter he explained the myth and the symbol you see he said the grandmother stands for guilt aint she dead and buried yes thats a kind of a messy guilt its the reality below reality said joe elegant balls said fauna listen joe whynt you write a story about something real maybe you can tell me about the art of writing he said i sure as hell can said fauna theres this guy and he makes love to this dame very original said joe when a man says words he believes them even if he thinks hes lying for goodness sake what are you talking about i bet i get rid of a certain person and put up a new gold star you want to take that bet how did doc like the cake joe elegant asked he loved it said fauna and this was the second event of that sweet thursday sweet thursday was one hell of a day fission took place in the palace flop house and from there a chain reaction flared up in all directions cannery row caught fire mack and the boys had the energy and the enthusiasm of plutonium only very lazy men could have done so much in so short a time oh the meetings the messages carried the plans and counterplans mack had to make more and more raffle tickets what started as a kind of gentle blackmail assumed the nature of an outpouring of popular love for doc people bought tickets sold tickets traded tickets emissaries covered the southern pacific depot the greyhound bus station joe blaikey the constable carried tickets in his pocket and canceled parking summonses if the lawbreaker bought a twodollar chance on the palace flop house whitey no invaded the foreign and fancy purlieus of pebble beach and carmel and the highlands whitey no s method was characteristically direct the first man to refuse him got a rock through his windshield and the news traveled to the boys it had become a crusade and the winning ticket of course with docs name on it was in a tomato can buried in the vacant lot by tacit agreement no one mentioned the raffle to doc to docs friends mack and the boys mentioned the rigging of the lottery but to strangerswho cared it was a perfect example of the collective goodness and generosity of a community but if communities have a group good fairy they also have an imp who works parallel with and sometimes in collaboration with the good fairy cannery rows imp saw the good fairy stirring to life and he sprang to action into the ears of his clients he whispered a few words and his constituents grinned with evil pleasure and their thoughts went like this the patrÃ³n is a wise guy hes a newcomer nice clothes makes his money off poor helpless wetbacks because hes smart lee chong must have sold him the palace flop house and hes forgot it or he never knew it once doc wins it the patrÃ³n wont dare make a move it is such fun to outsmart a smart guy the imp of the row imp of the row perhaps a comic and reductive echo of edgar allan poes theory of human perverseness overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrongs sake sketched out in the imp of the perverse had a good professional time and for once his job seemed almost virtuous people bought more tickets from the patrÃ³n than from anyone else they wanted to watch his face so they could compare it with his face when he found out now ordinarily mack and the boys would have strung out the ticket sales over weeks but time was breathing down their necks if the patrÃ³n got his tax bill from the county their plan would blow up in their faces they had to take a chance with fridaysaturday was the deadline the boys spread the word that there would be mediumheavy refreshments at the palace flop house on saturday night and that contributions of any nature would be welcome mack called on doc the afternoon of sweet thursday if you aint doing anything saturday night he said i and the boys are throwing a little wingding rsvp moi je respond oui come again ill be there said doc then mack remembered a mission with which he had been entrusted i guess i could squirm it out of you doc like i done once before he said but ill come right out in the open whens your birthday a shudder went through doc please dont give me a party he begged the last one you gave nearly ruined me this hasnt got nothing to do with a partyits a bet said mack i stand to win a buck when is it mack prodded him doc picked the first date that came to him july fourth he said why thats like the fourth of july a little said doc and he felt greatly relieved later that afternoon fauna and the girls called formally at the palace flop house in answer to the note mack had sent asking them to drink a jolt of good stuff suzy did not attend she had been quiet all morning and then she mooned away on the path that leads along the sea to the light house on point pinos she looked in the tide pools and she picked a bunch of the tiny flowers that grow as close to the ocean as they can suzy was restless and unhappy she felt excitement and nausea at the same time she wanted to smile and she wanted to cry and she was scared and happy and hopeless doc had asked her to have dinner with him at sonny boys on the pier and fauna had urged her to go suzys first reaction had been violent i wont do it she said sure youll go said fauna i may have to persuade you with a indoorball batbut youll go you cant make me want to test that why ive wore my brain down to the knuckles trying to do something nice for you i aint got nothing to wear said suzy neither has doc if he can go like he does what rights a chippy to get grand but hell fauna heshes got it inside people like me got to put on a puff because they got nothing else im afraid ill turn mean because i dont know how to be nice suzy said fauna im going to give you a piece of advice and if you wont take it i may just call joe blaikey and get you floated right out of town dont throw the first punch waitll youre hit before you put up your dukes most of the time they aint nobody laid a glove on you suppose i could wear my suit its got a big spot said suzy ask joe elegant to spotclean it and press it tell him i said so and thus it was that suzy went walking out light house way on sweet thursday the meeting in the palace wasnt really necessary for word of the raffle had got around and fauna had bought ten tickets and made each girl buy one eddie had borrowed glasses from wide idasfor once with her permission she was invited to the meeting too and she brought two quarts of pine canyon whisky it dont cost hardly nothing she explained formality took hold of the meeting agnes and mabel kept their knees together when they sat down and faunas look of thunder made becky snap hers shut so quickly she spilled her drink shes going to be a wallager said mack i cant wait to see docs face when he wins wide ida asked how you going to explain it to him he wins when he didnt buy no ticket why well say a friend did it and dont want his name mentioned i saw doc a little while ago he said hed sure be here fauna said did you find out when is his birthday sure july fourth fauna exhaled with the sound of escaping gas holy apples hes a gone goose he got a bornon oregon boot i never seen nothing work out so nice whatre you talking about said mack faunas eyes were misty mack she said huskily i dont want to horn in on your party but why couldnt we make it an engagement party too whos engaged well they aint yetbut they will be who doc and suzy its right in their horoscopes spose they wont they will said fauna you can just depend on thatthey will the little group sat in silence and then mack said softly did i say it was going to be a wallager this heres a tomwallager tomwallager slang term that means humdinger whopper etc they aint been nothing so stupendous since the second world war you sure docll go for it you let me take care of thatand dont none of you blab it to him one time i managed a fighter kiss of death kelly welterweight ill have doc in the ring eddie asked how about suzy suzys already in the ring said fauna they parted quietly but in their breasts a flame of emotion burned there never was a day like that sweet thursday and it wasnt over yet the arming at fourthirty in the afternoon fauna ordered suzy to the office bedroom with full field equipment suzy dumped her clothes on faunas bed thats a hell of a way to keep wrinkles out fauna observed she picked up the gray woolen skirt and jacket laid them out inspected them for spots smelled them for cleaning fluid nice piece of goods she said community chest said suzy i was in the charity ward well somebody wasnt her eyes noted the brown shoes she went to the door and yelled joe joe elegant he looked in im not supposed to be on duty he said im a thorn in the side of the worker said fauna you run up the street to wildocks and get new heel taps on these here tell them to fix this scuffed place and give them a nice shine wait and bring them back joe complained as he went but he went fauna said to suzy you got any gloves no ill lend you some herethese white ones

get smart come on nowget off your behind and do something with her hair and not fancy neither to suzy she said becky got a light hand with hair you cant take that coat community chest slipped up there she tapped her teeth with a pencil and then went to her closet and brought out two baum martens that were biting each others heads off just hand these here bo martens over your shoulder fauna said and if you lose them or hurt them ill cut your tripes out now where are we no perfume douse some of this florida water onkind of oldfashioned and youngsmelling becky stood behind suzys chair brushing and combing and molding she got big ears becky said maybe i can kind of hide them a little you got a nice hand with hair fauna said the final briefing took place at six oclock with the bedroom door closed turn around said fauna keep your ankles close together now walk thats good you got a real nice walk like i said youre a goodlooking kid if you work at it a little suzy looked at herself in the mirror and she smiled for it seemed to her that she really was pretty and the idea startled her and pleased her too and when she looked pleased she was even prettier then her mouth turned down and blind panic came over her whats the matter fauna demanded what can i talk about fauna i dont want to go i dont belong with a guy like doc jesus fauna tell him im sick i aint going fauna let her talk herself out and then she said quietly maybe youd like to cry now and get your eyes red after all my trouble go on cry im sorry said suzy you been nice i aint no good fauna youre just wasting your time i know what ill dominute he says something i dont understand ill get mad im scared course youre scared said fauna but if you didnt care nothing about doc you wouldnt be scared you didnt invent it there aint never been no dame went out first time with a guy she liked that wasnt scared maybe docs scared too oh nuts said suzy fauna said if i was your age with your face and shape and what i know there wouldnt be no man in the world could get away i got the knowhowbut thats all i got oh well im going to tell you a few thousand things suzy that if you would listen youd get anything you want but hell you wont listen nobody listens and when they learn the hard way its too late maybe its a good thingi dont know ill listen sure but you wont learn you know suzy they aint no way in the world to get in trouble by keeping your mouth shut you look back at every mess you ever got in and youll find your tongue started it thats true said suzy but i cant seem to stop you got to learn it like you learn anything elsejust practice next thing is opinions you and me is always busting out with opinions hell suzy we aint got no opinions we just say stuff we heard or seen in the movies were scared well miss something like running for a bus thats the second rule lay off opinions because you aint really got any you got them numbered huh said suzy i should write a book said fauna if she could i could now take number three there dont hardly nobody listen and its so easy you dont have to do nothing when you listen if you do listen its pretty interesting if a guy says something that pricks up your interest why dont hide it from him kind of try to wonder what hes thinking instead of how youre going to answer him back youre sure putting the finger on me suzy said softly i only got a little more but its the hardest of all and the easiest what number i lost track dont pretend to be something you aint and dont make like you know something you dont or sooner or later youll fall on your ass and theres one more part to this one what ever number it is they aint nobody was ever insulted by a question spose doc says something and you dont know what it means ask him the nicest thing in the world you can do for anybody is let them help you suzy was silent looking down at her hands fauna said you got nice nails how do you keep them so nice suzy said thats easy my grandma taught me you keep a old lemon rind and every time you wash your hands you scrounge your fingernails around in it and then you shake a little face powder on your hand and you polish your nails on the ham of your hand and you push down the quick with a little piece of lemon wood see what i mean said fauna what i just asked you a question suzy blushed i sure fell into that no you didnt i wanted to know its best if you ask when you want to know thanks said suzy youre a hell of a dame i wonder if i could learn you can if you just remember a lot of things first you got to remember youre suzy and you aint nobody else but suzy then you got to remember that suzy is a good thinga real valuable thingand there aint nothing like it in the world it dont do no harm just to say that to yourself then when you got that remember that theres one hell of a lot suzy dont know only way she can find out is if she sees it reads it or asks it most people dont look at nothing but themselves and thats a rat race whats the fourth thing suzy asked im proud of you fauna said you listened the next thing youll have to do some thinking about nobody dont give a particular damn about suzy one way or the other its hard to get them thinking about you because theyre too busy thinking about themselves theres two three copperbottom ways to get their attention talk about them if you see something nice or good or pretty tell them dont make it a fake though dont fight nobody unless there aint no other way dont never start a fight and if one starts let it get going good before you jump in best way in the whole world to defend yourself is to keep your dukes down now when you got their attention first thing they want is to do something for you let them dont get proud and say you dont need it or want it thats a slap in the puss thing people like most in the world is to give you something and have you like it and need it that aint sloppy that works you give it a try you think doc would fall for that stuff just give it a try suzy said fauna didnt you never get married no why not fauna smiled time i learned what i just told you it was too late i love you said suzy now you see you got me softened up like butter i want you should keep them furs but watch it yeah i see i sure do thank you and would you maybe write down all that stuff so i can get it by heart sure i will now look suzytonight just before you say something say it first to yourself and kind of dust it off you mean cussing i mean cussing and i meanwell sometimes if you look at it you dont say it one whole hell of a lot that passes for talk is just running off at the mouth i guess youre about ready now is there anything i can do for you fauna yes i want you should repeat after me im suzy and nobody else im suzy and nobody else im a good thing im a good thing there aint nothing like me in the whole world there aint nothinggoddam it fauna now my eyesll be red they look pretty that way said fauna at seven oclock doc dressed in an opencollared shirt leather jacket and army pants rang the bell at the bear flag he looked at suzy and he said ive got to make a telephone call do you mind and he ran back to the laboratory ten minutes later he returned he had on clean slacks a tweed jacket and a tie he hadnt used in years fauna saw him standing under the porch light honey she said to suzy you win the first round on points one night of love sonny boy is truly the only greek born in america named sonny boy he operates a restaurant and bar on the wharf in monterey sonny boy is plump and getting plumper although he was born near sutro park in san francisco and went to public schools sonny boy has singlehandedly kept alive the mystery of the near east his perfectly round face hints orient express orient express the orient express which connects calais france on the english channel with istanbul turkey on the black sea is one of the most legendary luxury trains in europe and a symbol of exotic adventure and beautiful spies his bushy voice is congenitally confidential sonny boy can say good evening and make it sound like an international plot his restaurant makes friends for him and supports him perhaps sonny boy in one sense wears a long black cape and dines with balkan countesses where two seas kiss the golden hornbut he also runs a good restaurant he probably knows more secrets than any man in the community for his martinis are a combination truth serum and lie detector veritas is not only in vino but regularly batters its way out doc stopped his old car in front of sonny boys got out walked around opened the door and helped suzy out she was a little shocked but she remained silent the sentence you think im a cripple for chrissake rose to her throat but she followed faunas advicewhispered it and pushed it back the fact of his hand on her elbow did a magic thing to her pushed back her shoulders and raised her chin the gritty light of resistance went out of her eyes doc opened the door of the bar and stood aside to let suzy enter the regulars on the stools turned to look the eyes crept from pretty face to pretty legs took in the martens on the way for one second panic halted her but she saw no look of recognition in the eyes of the regulars sonny boy turned sideways to get around the end of the bar evening folks he said your table is ready would you like to have a cocktail here or shall i send one over oh lets sit at the table said doc sonny boy bowed suzy through the door to the restaurant and she strolled ahead with her nice walk sonny boy rolling along beside doc said in a conspiratorial whisper your secretary called its all fixed you got a secretary doc doc overcame his surprise part time he said whos the lady she new around here shes new around here said doc he caught up with suzy this way said sonny boy he led them to a round table in front of the stone fireplace a pine fire crackled and sent out its fragrance the table had a centerpiece of wild iris the breadsticks stood like soldiers in their glasses the napkins were folded to make little crowns it was the best table in the house private but downstage and well lighted suzys eyes darted around the room no other table had flowers something wonderful happened in suzy she didnt walk around the table and sit down she waited and when doc held her chair she seated herself looked smiling up at him and said thank you sonny boy hovered over the table good you telephoned he said i had trouble getting pompano but i got it hows about a cocktail the wines cooling doc said one time i had some kind of i remember said sonny boy the webster f street layaway plan webster f street layaway plan an inside joke the drink was named for steinbecks former stanford classmate and monterey friend attorney webster toby street a martini made with chartreuse instead of vermouth very good very effective as i remember it said doc two doubles coming right up said sonny boy i told tony to be here to play piano like you said but hes sick doc looked at suzy to see whether she knew fauna had made the arrangements she didnt it is probable that if doc hadnt ordered the webster f street layaway plans he would have got them anyway they arrived with a speed that indicated they were already mixed the shock of a necktie was leaving doc he looked across the table and smiled at suzy and he wondered what is beauty in a girl that it can come and go this suzy did not faintly resemble the tough hustler who had screamed at him the night before he raised the cocktail glass youre pretty he said im glad you came with me heres to both of us suzy swallowed a gulp held back her tears and waited for the spasm to pass i should have warned you said doc theres a rumor that this drink is made of rattlesnake venom and raw opium suzy got her breath its good she said but i was watching its right hand and walked into a left hook her mind cried i shouldnt of said that i forgot already then she saw docs amusement and it was all right suzy noticed a waiter drifting delicately within earshot she had discovered something for herself when in doubt move slowly her head turned toward the waiter and he drifted away she was delighted with her discoveryeverythinginslowmotion she then lifted her glass slowly looked at it carefully then sipped and held it a moment before she put it down slownessit gave meaning to everything it made everything royal she remembered how all the unsure and worried people she knew jumped and picked and jittered just doing everything slowly forcing herself she felt a new kind of security dont forget she told herself dont ever forget this slow slow doc gave her a cigarette and held a match and she leaned forward so slowly that the flame was touching her fingers before she had lighted it a lovely warmth stole through her body she felt bold not defensively bold but safe she asked do they knowwhat i am the layaway plan works equally on all doc said they know youre with me thats all they need to know shall we have one more it came before he got his finger raised for attention if this was conspiracy sonny boy wanted to be in on it if felicity he liked that too i like a fire suzy said once we had a fireplace where i lived doc said youre pretty yes by george youre pretty suzy swallowed the first words that rose and swallowed the second ones and ended up by dropping her eyes and saying thank you softly sonny boy personally escorted the waiter who carried the ice bucket with the chilled chablis then he stood back and surveyed the table how is everything doc just fine said doc you ready to eat any time said doc and suzys discovery continued to hold good take it slow and keep your eyes open and your mouth shut the cold cracked crab the pompano were new to her and they required an eating technique she didnt know she did everything a little behind doc and he wasnt conscious that she watched every move he made when champagne and fruit and cheese arrived suzy knew she had to be alone a thought so overwhelming had come to her that her knees shook and the blood pounded in her temples slow she warned herself take it easy she looked at the leaping flames and then pivoted her head to doc will you excuse of course he jumped up and drew back her chair suzy moved regally toward the ladies room she could not feel her feet against the floor doc watched her passage strange strange he thought what is it maidenly is the word a kind of lonely and terrible modesty what has made the change then he thought its an act fauna coached her but he knew that wasnt true acting couldnt get into the eyes like that coaching couldnt draw the blood to her cheeks he spun the champagne bottle in its bucket and he found himself wishing she would hurry back his eyes found a window that reflected the door to the ladies room behind that door suzy dampened a paper towel and put it against her forehead she stared at herself in the mirror and she didnt know the face she thought of the dinner i hate fish she said out loud it makes me break out but i aint broke out finally she was ready to inspect the thought that had sent her out the symbol the mystery the signpost with an inexorable pointing finger it was so plain no one could miss it fate was not only pointing the way but booting from behind she thought of the dishes being taken away the heaped legs and claws of crab andthey had eaten their horoscopes cancer and piscesfish and crab great god almighty she said and she was limp in the hands of fate sonny boy came to the table everything all right fine said doc just like you ordered huh your secretary told me fine said doc just the way i wanted it when suzy came back she was dedicated you can only fight fate so far and when you give in to it youre very strong because all of your force flows in one direction doc held her chair and then he popped the champagne cork and smelled it suzy said can i have it of course suzy turned the cork in her fingers and looked at it it was very beautiful she put it in her purse and took an iris from the vase do you like champagne i love it she said and wondered what it would taste like and she did love it doc said you know out in the sand dunes there are little valleys covered with pines sometime when you can lets take meat and things out there and cook our supper its very nice the fire reminded you said suzy thats clever of youso it did she said doc will you sometime teach me about the stuff you got in your place sure i will a surge of affection filled him but he was a little afraid too of her terrible modesty he looked away from her eyes to the wild iris in her hand theres an old welsh story he said its about a poor knight who made a wife completely out of flowers the wine was strong in suzy now she said the sentence twice to herself before she said it aloud to doc i hope she didnt wilt the low voice of docs guts burst through at last im lonely he said he said it as a simple matter of fact and he said it in wonder then he apologized i guess im a little drunk he felt very shy he filled the glasses what the hell lets have some brandy too suzy turned half away from him so that her face was outlined in leaping pine flames you know that place you saidout in the sand dunes yes could we look at it whenever you want on our way home youll ruin your shoes i know said suzy you could take them off i will said suzy waiting friday not everyone believes that friday is unlucky but nearly everybody agrees it is a waiting day in business the week is really over in school friday is the halfopen gate to freedom friday is neither a holiday nor a workday but a time of wondering what saturday will bring trade and amusement fall off women look through their closets to see what they have to wear supper is leftovers from the week joe elegant ordered sand dabs for supper at the bear flag the espaldas mojadas returned from their latest triumph and were ushered with great courtesy to the rooms over the grocery the patrÃ³n distributed bottles of tequila also he kept a saucer of seconal seconal registered name of secobarbital a barbiturate sedative that reduces anxiety by slowing down brain and nervous system activity supposedly available only by prescription at hand sometimes a passion of homesickness got into his wetbacks sleep he thought was better than fighting doc slept late and when he went to the grocery for his morning beer he found joseph and mary alert and gay and the sound of singing drifted down the stairs have a good time the patrÃ³n asked what do you mean doc demanded didnt you have a nice party last night oh sure said doc he said it with finality doc id like you to teach me more of that chess you still think you can cheat at it do you no i just like to figure it out i got a case of bohemia beer bohemia beer extensive research proves docs assessment to be correct alcoholic haze that pervades this novel aside there is something fitting about bohemian doc preferring this aptly named brand of beer brewed exclusively in mexico since and named for the beerbrewing region of czechoslovakia bohemia is a smooth mediumbodied pilsnerstyle beer with some pronounced hops flavor from mexico all cold wonderful said doc thats the best beer in the western hemisphere its a present said the patrÃ³n why i dont know maybe i just feel good thanks said doc he began to feel uneasy there were eyes on him going back to western biological he felt eyes on him its the brandy he thought i shouldnt drink brandy makes me nervous he scrambled two eggs and shook curry powder over them he consulted the tide chart in thursdays monterey herald there was a fair tide at pm enough for chitons and brittlestars if the wind wasnt blowing inshore by then the bohemia beer settled his nerves without solving his restlessness and for once the curried eggs didnt taste very good fauna knocked and entered she flicked her hand at the rattlesnakes how do you feel doc all right get drunk a little how was the dinner wonderful you know what to order i ought to say you want to box or should we lay it on the line see what i mean about her yes how does she feel she aint up

tin box of aspirins across the oilcloth tablecover thanks suzy took three and washed them down with coffee hes going out collecting bugs said fauna quietly you went over there i met him in the street have a nice time suzy looked up at her with eyes so wide that she seemed to be turned inside out he didnt make no pass she said breathlessly went out on the sand dunes and he didnt make no pass fauna smiled but he talked nice didnt talk much but he talked nice thats good maybe im nuts fauna but i told him oh you aint nuts i told him everything he didnt even ask fauna asked quietly what did he talk about he said theres a fella in old times made a wife out of flowers what for for gods sake well i dont know but it was all right when he said it what else did he say suzy spoke slowly out in the sand dunes i done most of the talking but he give me a boost every now and then when i run down fauna said he can do that better than anybody suzys eyes were shining with excitement i almost forgot she

well sposeand there aint no harm in supposingspose i moved over there it would bewell it would be right across the street from here everybody knows i worked here wouldnt that kind of bother him he

away why hes a fugitive and a fugitive never gets away how about doc said suzy look if you aint good enough for him he aint good for you i dont want to lay no bear trap for him fauna fauna was smiling to herself she said i guess a man is the only kind of varmint sets his own trap baits it and then steps in it you just set still suzy girl dont do nothing nobody cant say you trapped him if you dont do nothing well he didnt really say they never do said fauna suzy said weakly i cant hardly breathe you know you aint cussed once this morning fauna said aint i some of my gold stars was damn good hookers said fauna but when i put up your gold star suzy the whoring business aint lost nothing like the patrÃ³n says youre too small in the butt and too big in the bust i dont want nobody to get the idea im hustling doc youre damn right you aint ill see to that she looked speculatively at suzy you know id like you to get out of town tonight and kind of freshen up wherell i go you could go on an errand for me to san francisco if you wanted to i got a little package up there in a safedeposit box ill give you some dough and i want you should buy some clothes and a hat get a nice suit itll last

ill start him a nice stew cooking slow said suzy i make a real nice stew she came around the table get your hands off me said fauna go on now and dont you ever say that thing again that made a sucker out of me my best fur you mean i love you thats it dont you say it okay said suzy old jingleballicks doc got back from his collecting about fourthirty he had over a hundred chitons bound with string to little glass plates to keep them from curling and submerged in sea water in his collecting buckets were hundreds of brittlestars now killing is one of the delicate operations of a marine zoologist you want the animal to resemble its living self but this is impossible in death the color changes just as it does with us also if any violent means of killing is used there is constriction and in the case of brittlestars the death struggle causes the animal to shed its arms in the front room of western biological doc poured out part of the sea water from his wooden bucket then he moved the brittlestars to a large flatbottomed glass dish and poured some sea water on top of them the little animals with the snakelike arms whipped about for a moment and then settled down when they were quite still and resting doc added a little fresh water to the dish the arms stirred nervously he waited a while and then added a little more fresh water to a sea animal fresh water is a poison and if it is slowly introduced it is as subtle as morphine it relaxes and soothes until the little creature goes to sleep and dies without violence doc sat down to wait for the poison to act he sensed that there was something wrong what could it be had he forgotten something he felt all right the small hangover of the morning was gone of course it was the case of bohemia beer over at the patrÃ³ns his subconscious must have been reminding him of the beer he looked out the window toward the grocery and there was something wrong with that too and finally he saw his windows were clean he turned and looked around the laboratory the records were piled neatly on the shelves not falling all over themselves the floor was shining and that smellthat was soap he moved to the kitchen his dishes were clean the pans scoured and shining a delicious odor came from a pot on the gas stove he lifted the lid brown meat juice bubbled up through carrots and onions and a stick of white celery swam like a fish doc went back to his table and sat down his cot was made up and smooth and the turneddown sheet was clean suddenly a sense of desolation came over hima great sadness that was like warmth the toes of his linedup shoes peeked out at him from under the bed the poor kid he thought oh the poor damn kid i wonder if shes trying to repayi hope i havent done anything bad my god i hope she didnt misunderstand anything what did i say i know i didnt do anything but what did i say i wouldnt hurt suzy for the world he glanced around again she sure does a job of cleaning he thought the stew smells wonderful too he poured a little more fresh water into the glass dish the arms of the brittlestars were arranging themselves in small spirals they hardly moved when the fresh poison was introduced the clean laboratory made doc nervous and apprehensive and there was something missing from himself something lost the lowest voice of all was still in his black depths he was somehow comforted he went to the record shelf not bachno not buxtehudenot palestrina buxtehudepalestrina dietrich buxtehude ca was a germandanish organist and a highly regarded composer of the baroque period giovanni pierluigi da palestrina ca was an influential italian composer of renaissance music either his hand strayed to an album not used in a long time he had opened it before he knew what he was doing and then he smiled and put the first record on the turntable mozarts don giovanni mozarts don giovanni opera in two acts based on the legend of don juan with music by wolfgang amadeus mozart and libretto in italian by lorenzo da ponte first performed in prague on october at the operas end don giovanni unrepentant seducer is visited by the ghost of a man he has murdered and is offered the opportunity to save his soul when he refuses he is dragged to hell while he is still alive the concluding chorus delivers the operas moral thus do the wicked find their end dying as they had lived it started its overture and doc still smiling went to the kitchen and stirred the stew don giovanni he said is that what i think of myself no i do not but why do i feel so good and so bad he looked at his desk the yellow pads were piled neatly and the pencils were sharpened i believe ill try and at that point there were fumbling steps on his porch and old jingleballicks burst in it is madness to write about old jingleballicks but since he came in at this point it is necessary people coming out of a session with old jay felt slightly dizzy and the wise ones after a time just didnt believe it his name cannot be mentioned for it occurs on too many bronze plaques that begin donated by old jay was born so rich that he didnt know he was rich at all he thought everybody was that way he was a scientist but whether brilliant or a screwball nobody ever knew and since he had contributed to so many learned foundations and financed so many projects and served on so many boards of trustees nobody dared openly to wonder he gave millions away but he was likely to sponge on a friend his scholastic honors were many and there were people who thought privately and venomously that they were awarded in hope of a donation that he was in fact like a football player whose grades have little relation to his scholarship he was a stubby man with a natural tonsure of yellow hair his eyes were bright as a birds eyes and he was interested in everything he was so close to reality that he had completely lost touch with realism sometimes he amused doc and at other times his endless and myopic enthusiasms could drive a man to despair old jingleballicks shouted at everyone under the impression that this made for clarity did you get my wire he cried no came for your birthday always remember it same day they burned giordano bruno giordano bruno italian philosopher priest astronomer astrologer and occultist bruno is perhaps best known for his system of mnemonics and as an early proponent of the idea of extrasolar planets and extraterrestrial life burned at the stake as a heretic for his theological ideas bruno is seen by some as a martyr to the cause of free thought its not my birthday said doc well what day is this friday oh well ill wait over its in december i only have one cot all right ill sleep on the floor he wandered to the kitchen took the lid off the pot and began eating the stewblowing on it violently to cool it thats not done said doc and he was irritated to find that he was shouting back done enough cried old jay and went on eating doc said hitzler came through he said you were seen on a lawn in berkeley on your knees pulling a worm out of the ground with your teeth old jay swallowed a halfcooked carrot not so he shouted say this stews not done thats what i told you oh well you see ive watched robins getting worms little beggars dig in their heels so to speak i got to wondering how much actual pull was involved had a scale with a clamp in my teeth average night crawler resists to the extent of one pound six ounces i tried fortyeight individuals think of it a threeounce bird pulls twentytwo ounces over seven times his own weight no wonder they eat so much just eating keeps them hungry like robins not particularly said doc are you going to eat all my dinner i guess so said old jingleballicks but its not done you got anything to drink ill get some beer said doc fine get a lot dont you want to contribute a little im short said old jay doc said you are not youre a freeloader oh said jingleballicks i said dont you want to contribute im a little short said old jay doc said angrily you are not youre a freeloader you never pay you ran the lab while i was in the army and damn near bankrupted me i dont say you stole most of the museum glass i just say its missing did you take those specimen jars well yes said old jingleballicks and then he said thoughtfully i wish you were a charity or an institution what then i could endow you said old jingleballicks well im not an institution so what do you do you go to a lot of trouble to keep from paying a couple of dollars for beer and suddenly despair and humor crashed headon in doc and he burst into weary laughter oh lord he said youre just not possible youre a ridiculous idea your stew is burning said old jingleballicks doc leaped to the stove and pulled the pot from the burner you ate all the juice he said bitterly of course it burned it was very good said old jay in the grocery doc said give me a dozen cans of beer dont you want the bohemia hell no doc said i have a guest who and then an evil thought came to him a very interesting man doc said why dont you come over and have a drink with us oldi mean my friend can explain chess to you better than i can why not said the patrÃ³n maybe i better bring a little liquor why not said doc crossing the street the patrÃ³n asked you going to the party tomorrow sure i like you doc but i dont get you you aint real said the patrÃ³n how do you mean well everything you do iswell youre like that chess i dont get you at all doc said do you suppose nobodys real to anybody else youre going to meet a man who cant possibly exist dont talk like that said the patrÃ³n nervously old jay shouted as they went up the stairs i bring you tidings of great joy the human species is going to disappear this is joseph and mary rivas said doc joseph and mary this is old jingleballicks why cant you rig a chess game the patrÃ³n asked oh you can you can or at least you can rearrange your opponent comes to the same thing now where was i oh yeswe are about to join the great reptiles in extinction good said doc you mean there aint gonna be no more people said the patrÃ³n right young man we have played the final joke on ourselves open the beer man in saving himself has destroyed himself whos destroyed the patrÃ³n demanded there must be chuckling on olympus olympus at feet high mount olympus is greeces tallest mountain in greek mythology it was considered the home of the pantheon of principal greek deities led by zeus king of the gods said old jingleballicks we go not to armageddon armageddon in the new testaments book of revelation armageddon is the site where forces of good and forces of evil assembled for an apocalyptic climactic battle but to the gas chamber and we generate our own gas doc said i intended to work on my paper good ill help said old jingleballicks oh god no said doc man has solved his problems old jay went on predators he has removed from the earth heat and cold he has turned aside communicable disease he has practically eliminated the old live on the young do not die the best wars cant even balance the birth rate there was a time when a small army could cut a population in half in a year starvation typhus plague tuberculosis were trusty weapons a scratch with a spear point meant infection and death do you know what the incidence of death from battle wounds is today one percent a hundred years ago it was eighty percent the population grows and the productivity of the earth decreases in a foreseeable future we shall be smothered by our own numbers only birth control could save us and that is one thing mankind is never going to practice brother said the patrÃ³n what makes you so damn happy about it it is a cosmic joke preoccupation with survival has set the stage for extinction i didnt get one goddam word of that said joseph and mary docs hands were full in his left he held a small glass of whisky and in his right a can of beer he sipped from the one and gulped from the other every instinct tells me to stay out of this he said and every impulse makes me want to get into it good said old jay is that whisky old tennis shoes said joseph and mary want some perhaps a little later okay its a little later now said old jingleballicks i guess you can hustle with anything said the patrÃ³n i got a feeling im being took well the impulse wins said doc you have forgotten one thing old jingleballicks indeed there have been species which became extinct through their own miscalculations but they were species with a small range of variability now consider the lemming that is a very specialized case said old jingleballicks how do you know we arent what do lemmings do when their population exceeds the food supply whole masses of them swim out to sea and drown until a balance of food and population is reached i deny your right to use lemmings said old jingleballicks hand me the bottle will you deny and be damned doc said is the lemming migration a disease is it a memory or is it a psychic manifestation forced on part of the group for the survival of the whole old jay howled back at him i will not be robbed of extinction this is a swindle he turned to the patrÃ³n dont listen to that man hes a charlatan he sure in hell is said joseph and mary admiringly doc leveled a finger between the eyes of old jay holding his whisky glass like the butt of a pistol disease you say infection down almost to nonexistence but tell me are not neurotic disturbances on the increase and are they curable or does the cure spread them now you wait dont you try to talk now do you suppose that the tendency toward homosexuality might not also have a mathematical progression and could this not be the human solution you cant prove it old jingleballicks cried its all talkoveremphasis why you might as well accuse me of neurotic tendencies and be done with it his eyes brimmed with tears my friend my thoughtfriend my true friend he whimpered doc said i wouldnt even think of such a thing you wouldnt certainly not when are you going to start dinner said old jingleballicks youve eaten my dinner said doc ive got a fine idea said old jay while you start dinner william and mary can get a fresh bottle of whisky and ill set up the chessmen its not william and mary its joseph and mary who is oh my friend im going to teach you the greatest of all games the ethereal creation of human intelligence shall we sugar it up with a little side bet why you dishonest old fraud doc shouted ten dollars mary the patrÃ³n shrugged his shoulders in apology to doc you have to pay to learn things he said make it twentyfive old jingleballicks said you want to live forever doc opened a can of salmon and a can of spaghetti and stirred the two together in a frying pan he grated nutmeg over it sadly he put the burned stewpot to soak in the sink a little after dark the patrÃ³n went back to the grocery and sent cacahuete to deliver a third bottle of whisky upstairs he joined the wetbacks as in advancing and retreating lines they danced the sad and stately measures of the tehuanos tehuanos inhabitants predominantly zapotec indians of tehuantepec in oaxaca southeastern mexico sandunga sandunga la sandunga unofficial regional anthem of the isthmus of tehuantepec was written by governor and military commander mÃ¡ximo ramÃ³n ortiz d it is a sensual graceful dance song that expresses the grief of a tehuana zapotecan woman over the death of her mother the song moves from overwhelming sadness to a sense of acceptance of her loss they sang sandunga mama mia in the darkening laboratory doc and old jay went softly into the third bottle of old tennis shoes youve had the bed long enough doc said i want it now all right as i grow older i expect less and lessand get nothing even from my socalled friends look here youve eaten and spoiled my first dinner stuffed my second swilled my beer taken two drinks for one of the whisky appropriated my bed broken two phonograph records and i saw you put my fountain pen in your pocket and how you razzledazzled the patrÃ³n out of twentyfive dollars i dont know you shouldnt have told him that under certain circumstances a knight can jump three squares in one directionthats not honest i know said old jingleballicks he patted the pillow lovingly now you lie down here and get comfortable ill bring you a drink feel better now oh im all right said doc say is that place across the street still running a jagged rage whipped doc upright you stay out of there he said you old fool lie down and go to sleep why shouldnt i go am i to deny myself the loveliness of women if the price is right i can hear the tinkle of their sweet voices and see the heaving of their white roundness oh shut up doc said whats the matter dear friend i dont remember that you ever starved for love even when it was less near and less reasonable you go to hell said doc but you go to hell here the developing storm at the very moment doc and old jingleballicks were quarreling over a matter neither of them understood mack was sitting body comfortable but spirit disturbed in faunas office bedroom in his hand he held a venetian glass bud vase of whisky he was pouring out to fauna a problem that had not come up in his life for many years dont think that there aint been parties before at the palace and fights he said why when the news come that gay had went to his reward we give a memorial shindig that they dont hardly do no better at the salinas rodeo salinas rodeo the california rodeo has taken place each summer at the salinas rodeo grounds since gay would of been proud of itif he could of got in fauna said theres talk around that three mourners went to join gay before nightfall next day well you got to expect a certain amount of accidents said mack modestly that was all fine but this heres something special not only are loyal hearts framing their dear friend for a hunk of charity but we got a doubleheader right in the palace flop house the holy bounds of matrimony got its spikes dug in on the starting line this heres a halcyon brawl i and the boys got real delicate feelings about it but no clothes said fauna right we think somebody got to set a standard if the loyal friends look like mugs whatll the mugs look like fauna nodded i see what you mean how far you want to gomonkeysuits god no mack said just pants and coats made out of the same stuff and nobody gets in without hes got a necktie on and none of them bow ties that light up neither this is a goddam solemn moment fauna she scratched her scalp with her pencil mack went on i aint as young as i was i dont know how many more parties i can take dont none of us get no younger said fauna she tapped her teeth with the pencil as it happened she also had a problem and she intended to ask macks advice now suddenly the two problems crashed together and a solution for both was born into faunas eyes came the light of triumph as she murmured i got it give it to me gentle said mack i didnt get much sleep today fauna got up and found the stick with which she directed astrological traffic or whacked a protruding piece of bad posture she talked better with the wand in her hand this here calls for a drink she said and she poured it mack turned the stem of the bud vase in his fingers and sighted through his drink the red glass made the brown whisky look green fauna said there was a queen a long time ago and she was loaded didnt think nothing of paying a couple hundred bucks for a house dress got so many bracelets she couldnt bend her arms you know what she done when she had a birthday or a hanging or something overalls said mack no but youre close dressed like shes a milkmaid theyd wash up a cow and the queend sit on a gold stool and take a whang at milking and theres another old dame just the top cream of the top cream gives them parties cant nobody get in she wears a head rag done it for years if you look over the crowd and dont see a head ragshe aint there macks hand shook as he raised the bud vase to his lips is it what i think masquerade cried fauna theres only two kinds of people in the world gives a masqueradepeople who got too much and people who aint got nothing mack smiled inwardly to himself can i have a freshener he asked help yourself said fauna masquerade has got other things too people get kind of bored with who they are makes them something else for a while mack spoke with reverence they used to say if you got something you cant figure out give it to mack fauna its your dice youre a bullbitch idear dame god tetumtum his wonders to perform like it like it fauna this heres one life life in under new owner henry luce life which began in as a humor magazine became the first allphotography newsmagazine in the united states at its most popular it sold more than thirteen million copies per week it published a regular feature life goes to a party magazine would give its ass for an invite we got to have a theme how do you mean well we cant let people just run wild you dont know what kind of stuff theyd wear i dont want no tramp and gunnysack party i guess youre right you got any idears how about at the court of the fairy queen no said mack first place we got no right to hurt joe elegants feelings second place the cops well how about then snow white and the seven dwarfs i seen the picture the picture snow white and the seven dwarfs a walt disney productions movie was the first animated film made in technicolor said mack i think you got something some of them dwarfs looked like mugs i cant see hazel as no fairy but hed do fine as a great big overgrowed dwarf thats whats nice about it said fauna gives you some leeway do you think this might call for a drink i sure as hell do you spread the word mack will you you come either as a dwarf a prince or a princess or you damn well dont get in hold that vase steady but not doc said mack you know said fauna fivell get you seven doc wears a tie o frabjous day o frabjous day from lewis carrolls nonsense poem jabberwocky which appears in chapter one of through the lookingglass and what alice found there and hast thou slain the jabberwock come to my arms my beamish boy o frabjous day callooh callay he chortled in his joy the communications system on cannery row is mysterious to the point of magic and rapid to the speed of light fauna and mack came to the decision that the party should be a masquerade on friday evening at by the magic had started and by everyone who was not asleep drunk or away knew about it one particularly mean woman who hadnt had a man for a long time commented how will you know whether theyre in costume or nota statement clearly drawn from her own state of misery but mainly the news was received with wonder and joy macks tomwallager had achieved the stature of a bullbitch tomwallager consider what was in store for the ticket holders a party at the palace flop house a raffle that amounted to a potlatch an engagement of exciting proportions unknown in the annals of the row and on top of this a costume party any one of these would have been enough together they threatened to be a celebration close to a catastrophe fauna breathed a sigh of relief for it solved her greatest problem she wanted to dress suzy in a certain way and suzy being the tough monkey she was would have resisted now it was easy theres little difference between the wardrobe of snow white and that of a lovely young bride there will be those who will consider that fauna took too much upon herself in engineering a marriage without the knowledge or collusion of either party and such skeptics will be perfectly right but it was faunas conviction born out of long experience that most people one did not know what they wanted two did not know how to go about getting it and three didnt know when they had it fauna was one of those rare people who not only have convictions but are quite willing to take responsibility for them she knew that doc and suzy should be together and since they were too confused or thoughtless or shy to bring about that happy state fauna was prepared to do it for them her critics will cry suppose she is wrong maybe this association has no chance of success and faunas answer to this if she had heard it would have been they aint doing so good now it might work what they got to lose and when you look at it what chance has anybody got doc put on a tie didnt he and if im wrong its my fault sure theyll fight now and then who dont but maybe theyll get something too whats the odds for anybody and if it was suggested that people should have the right to choose for themselves after thinking it over she would have replied who thinks i can think because i aint part of it and if she had been accused of being a busybody she would have said damn right done it all my life you couldnt win an argument with fauna because she would agree with you and then go right on as she had planned she had taken up astrology because she found that people who wont take advice from a wise and informed friend will blindly follow the orders of the planetswhich by all reports are fairly remote and aloof doc would refuse astrology so he had to be sandbagged fauna expected no thanks she had given that up long ago doc could not interpret the black voice of his guts but it sounded loud in faunas ears she knew his loneliness when she was with him that low voice drowned out all the others on saturday morning she made every girl in the house bring out every article of clothing she possessed and lay it on the bed in her office now mabel was a naturalborn blowedintheglass hustler in any time under any system after a period of orientation mabel would have found herself doing exactly what she was doing in cannery row this was not a matter of fate but rather a combination of aptitudes and inclinations born in a hovel or a castle mabel would have gravitated toward hustling the heap of finery on faunas bed was impressive some of those dresses could have got a girl booked for vagrancy just going out to mail a letter mabel took fauna aside and spoke to her privately my grandma come from the old country she said when the door of her room was closed mabel opened the bottom drawer of her bureau and lifted out a brown paper parcel sealed against air with strips of cellophane tape grandma left it to mama and mama left it to me she said as she tore the paper we aint none of us needed it she removed layer after layer of tissue paper and at last spread a dress out on her beda wedding dress of sheerest white linen embroidered with sprays of white flowersstitches so tiny they seemed to grow out of the cloth the bodice was closefitting and the skirt very full mabel opened a box and laid beside the dress a silver wedding crown i guess she wouldnt hurt it none said mabel tell her not to spill nothing on it ill polish up the crown its kind of tarnishedreal silver fauna was speechless for once her fingers went to the light and lovely fabric she was a hard woman to break up but the dress nearly did it snow white she said breathlessly i better be careful or ill get to believing my own pitch mabel im going to give you my jet earrings i dont want nothing you want my jet earrings aw shoot said mabel looks like it might nearly fit her fauna observed well we can kind of tack it where it dont you know youre a good girl you want i should go to work on you hell no said mabel i like it here theres a veil too in this here bag i dont know if we can get away with a veil but well try said fauna oh hell she dont know a veil from a hole in the ground said mabel if only people would give the thought the care the judgment to international affairs to politics even to their jobs that they lavish on what to wear to a masquerade the world would run in greased grooves on the surface cannery row was quieter than usual but below the surface it seethed in one corner of the palace flop house whitey no gave careful lessons to little johnny carriaga in the art of palming cards johnny had been borrowed for the occasionor more truthfully rentedsince alberto carriaga had received sixtytwo cents the price of a gallon of wine for the use of his firstborn it was planned that johnny should be dressed as cupid with paper wings bow and arrow and quiver the quiver was added as a hiding place for the winning raffle ticket for although nearly everyone on the row knew the raffle was rigged a certain pride made it necessary to carry the deception off with dignity because of a small distrust of johnny the arrows in the quiver were tipped with rubber suction cups whitey no had cut a card the exact size of a raffle ticket now try it again johnny he said no i can see the edge of it look sort of squeeze the edges in your palm like this now try it again thats right thats good now lets see you get it out of the quiver you make a pass with the bowlike thisso they look at your other hand and you say i know said johnny im cupid god of love and i draw a bead on unsuspecting hearts god thats beautiful said eddie i wonder where mack got that he made it up said whitey no now when you shove up the bow with your right hand you get the ticket out of the quiver with your left try it iamcupidgodoflove said johnny and he brandished the bow thats good said whitey no it will take a little more practice though dont look at your left hand johnny look at the bow now heres the bowl dig around the cards without dropping the ticket go on practice i want thirtyfive cents said johnny what if i dont get thirtyfive cents ill tell mack said whitey no this here kids jumped the price give it to him said mack ill flip him double or nothing later not with that twoheaded nickel you wont said johnny seems like kids got no respect for their elders nowadays eddie observed if i ever said that my old man would of clobbered me maybe your old man wasnt rigging no raffle said johnny whitey no said this kid aint honest you know where bad kids go johnny i sure do and i been there said johnny give him the thirtyfive cents said mack what hidden hoarded longings there are in all of us behind the broken nose and baleful eye may be a gentle courtier behind the postures and symbols and myths of joe elegant there may be the hunger to be a man if one could be for only an evening what ever in the world one wished what would it be what secret would come out to a certain extent the theme of the palace flop house raffle and engagement party was chosen because of hazel he was definitely dwarf material but when he had reviewed the story asked questions and got as clear a picture as he ever got of anything hazel elected to be prince charming he saw himself in white silk knee breeches and an eton jacket his left hand fondling the hilt of a small sword they offered him grumpy lovable old grumpy the prize part of all they offered him sweet pea the skunk but hazel stuck to his dream it was prince charming or he wouldnt attend friendships have foundered on less all right said mack you go ahead i was going to help you with your costume but i know when im stumped hazel if youre prince charming youre on your own who cares said hazel who wants your help ill bet youre mad because you wanted to be prince charming not me said mack im going as a tree how do you mean its a forest aint it said mack i want a little anenmity you cant see the tree for the forest hazel went to sit under the cypress tree he was gloomy and he was frightened because ideas did not come to him and when he sought them they ran screaming away but he was determined he could not let the office down a man sentenced to be president could not go as a dwarf it wasnt dignified later in the morning he went to the back door of the bear flag and called for help from joe elegant joe smiled ill help you he said maliciously all over the row trunks were being opened and the smell of mothballs penetrated as far as the middle of the street and all over the row the story was being rewritten to fit the wardrobe by unspoken agreement no one planned to be snow white in western biological doc awakened wracked with pain from sleeping on the floor he lay still for a moment trying to isolate the part of him that hurt worst not the least of his agony was his memory of forcing old jingleballicks to take his bed a crazy alcoholic generosity probably masochistic in origin had prompted the sacrifice he raised up on one shattered elbow and looked at the old bastard sleeping so sweetlyhis halo of yellow hair surrounding his polished pink pate his breath puffing in small comfortable snores wake up doc shouted in fury the pale eyes flickered whats for breakfast said old jay dont you even have the decency to have a hangover certainly i do said old jay with dignity hows about some beer does your head ache yes do your joints ache yes do you have lowbloodpressure depression overwhelming then ive got you said doc you get the beer the pale eyes rolled despairingly ill pay half if you get it no tell you what ill doill loan you the money no old jingleballicks eyes were bleak reach me my pants he said and he fished out a quarter and a dime and held them out no said doc god in heaven what do you want i want two dollars why that would be six bottles exactly youre trapped old jingleballicks and you know it old jay dug deep and found two onedollar bills maybe i can write it off to entertainment he said doc pulled on pants and shirt and went across the street he took his time he drank a bottle of beer quickly and then sipped a second while he heard the news of the day from joseph and mary back in the laboratory he put the four cold remaining bottles on the table wheres my change asked old jay i drank your change said doc he was beginning to feel good he saw the stricken look you cheap old fraud he said happily for once youve been had and he went on i wish i could understand you you must have millions and yet you pinch and squirm and cheat why please give me beer im dying said old jingleballicks then die a little longer said doc i love to see you die its not my fault old jay said its a state of mind you might call it the american state of mind the tax laws are creating a whole new kind of mana psyche rather than a psychosis two or three generations and well maybe set the species can i have beer now no if a man has any money he doesnt ask can i afford this but can i deduct it two men fight over a luncheon check when both of them are going to deduct it anywaya whole nation conditioned to dishonesty by its laws because honesty is penalized but its worse than that if youll just hand me a bottle ill tell you tell me first i didnt write the tax laws old jay said trembling the only creative thing we have is the individual but the law doesnt permit me to give money to an individual i must give it to a group an organizationand the only thing a group has ever created is bookkeeping to participate in my gift the individual must become part of the group and thus lose his individuality and his creativeness i didnt write the law i hate a law that stifles generosity and makes charity good business corporations are losing their financial efficiency because waste pays i deplore it but i do it i know you need a microscope but i cant give it to you because with taxes a fourhundreddollar microscope costs me twelve hundred dollarsif i give it to youand nothing if i give it to an institution why if you through creative work should win a prize most of the money would go in taxes i dont mind taxes god knows but i do mind the kind of law that makes of charity not the full warmness of sharing but a stinking expediency and now if you dont hand me a beer i shall be forced heres your beer said doc whats for breakfast god knows the party at the palace flop house tonight is a masquerade snow white and the seven dwarfs why i dont know i shall go as a red dwarf said old jingleballicks a dying star said doc it kind of fits you with that hair when the beer was gone they decided that beer made breakfast redundant doc went back for six more bottles and in a burst of generosity he brought back the bohemia now theres beer for you said old jingleballicks the mexicans are a great and noble people the pyramid of the sun and this beerwhole civilizations have produced less you started to tell me about your paper last night but you got deflected by a girl id like to see that girl id like to tell you about my paper i want to draw some parallels between emotional responses in cephalopods and in humans and id like to observe the pathological changes that go with these responses now the body walls of octopi are semitransparent with proper equipment it might be possible to observe these changes as they happen sometimes the simpler organisms can give us a key to the more complex dementia praecox dementia praecox any of several psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia characterized by distortions of reality disturbances of thought and language and withdrawal from social contact for example was considered purely a psychotic manifestation until it was observed that there were physical symptoms as well why dont you write your paper i seem to be afraid to a kind of terror comes over me when i start what have you got to lose if you fail nothing what have you got to gain if you succeed i dont know old jingleballicks regarded doc benignly have you got enough beer in you so you arent quarrelsome im never quarrelsome the hell you arent took my head off last night you hurt my feelings im sorry what did you want to say will you let me finish if i start ill try old jay said you feel to me like a woman who has never had a baby but knows all the words theres a lack of fulfillment in you i think you have violated something or withheld something from yourselfalmost as though you were eating plenty but no vitamin a you arent hungry but youre starving thats what i think i cant imagine anything i lack i have freedom comfort and the work i like what have i missed well last night in every conversation a girl named suzy crept in for gods sake said doc do you know what suzy is an illiterate little tramp a whore i took her out to dinner because fauna asked me to i found her interesting the way id find a new species of octopus interesting thats all youve always been a goddam fool old jingleballicks but youve never been a romantic damn fool whos talking about romance i was speaking of hunger maybe you cant be wholly yourself because youve never given yourself wholly to someone else of all the esoteric goddam nonsense doc cried why i give floor room to you i dont know then try to figure out why you get mad said old jay what well arent you putting a lot of energy into denying something which if it is not true deserved no denial sometimes i think youre just plain nuts said doc know what im going to do said old jay im going to buy a bottle of whisky i dont believe it said doc where alfred the sacred river ran where alfred the sacred river ran parody of where alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man from kubla khan or a vision in a dream a fragment a poem by british romantic poet samuel taylor coleridge very few people know that hazel had given the palace flop house its name years ago when the boys had first moved in inspired by the glory of having a home hazel compounded the name of something he knew about and something he didnt the known and the unknown the homely and the exotic and ever after the name had stuck so that it was known by certain people from one end of the state to the other and the palace flop house had justified its name over the years it had been shelter and home base to the boys also some surprising events had occurred there the building itself was not impressiveredwood board and bat tarpaper roof twentyeight feet long fourteen feet wide two square windows and two doors one on each side into this simple box mack and the boys had moved some remarkable articles the products of their wits their work and sometimes their misfortune the great castiron stove was in excellent condition and bid fair to outlast the colosseum which it resembled the grandfather clock once the home of a dog stood empty nowand eddie wanted to be buried in it each of the beds was canopied as a substitute for mending the roof and gays bed was kept just as it was when he went awaypatchwork quilt turned down to reveal a gray tennisflannel sheet his copy of amazing true desert stories folded open to page lay on top of the apple box just as gay had left it and his prize possession a collectors item a ring gear and pinions of a willysknight willysknight willysknight automobiles were produced between and by willysoverland company of elyria and toledo ohio in an internal combustion engine ring gear and pinions connect the cars starter with the motors flywheel lay on a black velvet cloth in the bottom of the box on the shelf over his bed the boys kept some kind of nosegay in a swanky swig glass for gay had loved flowers he ate themparticularly red roses mustard flowers wild turnip blossoms and the petals of one variety of dahlia no one had ever been allowed to sit or sleep in gays bed he might return one day the boys thought even though he was reported dead and his army insurance paid now there had been tomwallagers in the palace flophouse but never such a bullbitch tomwallager as was now in the process of exploding the outside was freshly whitewashed beds were pushed together and the interior was a bower of pine boughs crossed to make a canopy the great stove was laid out as a bar and the oven was full of cracked ice in front of the back door a little stage was built with a painters dropcloth for a curtain and the door for an entrancefor certain theatrical effects not counting the raffle itself were planned for that area this forest bower was lighted by japanese lanterns and a string of lanterns led down to the chicken walk above the railroad track the boys were pleased with their effort mack surveyed the scene and put a name to it that was remembered a veritable fairyland a veritable fairyland according to susan shillinglaw in a journey into steinbecks california steinbecks portrayal of the culminating costume party at the palace flop house may owe its inspiration to an outrageous benefit party surrealistic night in an enchanted forest thrown by artist salvador dalÃ­ at montereys hotel del monte on september pp see also the short film clip dizzy dali dinner on youtube at httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvvgiewoak httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvvgiewoak he said the patrÃ³n had contributed his prize group of musicians the original espaldas mojadastwo guitars gourds bones castanets and haitian drum and last a guitarÃ³n as big as a rowboat cacahuete rivas the nephew of the patrÃ³n was scheduled to join his trumpet to the band later but now he was on the beach practicing his solo softly as evening came to cannery row the boys were tired but content following macks lead they all agreed to be trees after all they were the hosts their one sorrow was that hazel had left them his yearning to be prince charming had overcome his love for his friends in joe elegants tiny bedroom he was being transformed caught me with my pants down mack apologized for the twentieth time hazels such a mug you forget hes sensitive hell i could of worked out some kind of charming rig if id give it some thought dont seem right without him here to mess things up it is customary at most masquerades for the arriving guests to be shy ill at ease and sober and to stand around uneasily for maybe an hour before the party warms up in this matter of starting a party cannery row is far ahead of some other centers of culture the party was to start at pm sharp the guests would be notified by the trumpet of cacahuete rivas playing whistle while you work whistle while you work song featured in walt disneys animated movie snow white and the seven dwarfs with music by frank churchill and lyrics by larry morey at least two hours before the signal a series of small earnest parties at wide idas the bear flag and in private homes were practicing for the main event this party was going to begin in full bloom of course mack and the boys were so weighed down with responsibility that they didnt get the best out of their liquor still they made progress and they watched the big hand of the alarm clock on the back of the stove in the bear flag the pageantry was spread all over the floor snow white was going to have as ladies of honor some of the bestknown and most respected hookers north of san luis obispo the ladies were dressing in filmy gowns of red yellow and green and each one was to carry a bottle of whisky garlanded with ribbons to match her dress fauna was going as a witch it was her own idea the only costume she really needed was a broom but she had made a peaked black hat and a black alpaca wraparound to carry the part off but fauna had a payoff when the big moment came she was prepared to fling off her black gown switch broom for wand and emerge as the fairy godmother wide idas was dwarf country eight happys four sneezys six dopeys and nineteen grumpys clustered about the bar earnestly singing harvest moon in oneandahalfpart harmony joseph and mary had elected to go as dracula he hadnt seen snow white but to him a moving picture was a moving picture at western biological doc and old jingleballicks were hopelessly enmeshed in a discussion of tobacco mosaic when the dam had burst a flood followed a garbage can stood in the middle of the floor and in it nestled in crushed ice the six remaining bottles of a case of champagne bought by old jay doc and old jay had completely forgotten the party when cacahuetes trumpet sounded the call to arms they were shouting so loud they didnt hear it when the youth and beauty of cannery row walked gaily up the lanternlit chicken walk old jay and doc were still screaming at each other suddenly doc dropped his voice and it had the effect of a loud noise i think i will go away he said i have tried with every sinew and i have failed nonsense said old jay young man you are at the threshold of a great career threshold of a great career old jingleballicks echoes ralph waldo emersons salutation to walt whitman after the philosopher had read the first edition of the younger mans leaves of grass i greet you at the beginning of a great career he wrote whitman on july but what do i care for honors how do you know you never got any said old jay dont try to hold me back old jingle i wont theres too many of you already do you realize you havent cooked any dinner i bought a pound of hamburger and you ate it raw before i got it near a pan you shouldnt starve yourself young friend said old jingleballicks eddie hurled himself up the steps and flung open the door doc he cried for gods sakes shes started theyre going to draw doc picked a bottle from the ice arm yourself old jingleballicks forward they had to help old jay up the chicken walk the drawing was being held for them dwarfs animals monsters were drawn up in halfcircle facing the curtain i guess were all here said mack he looked behind the curtain you all right johnny goddam cold said johnny and at that moment hazel entered proudly his chin up his eyes flashing with dignity joe elegant had worked all day to get his revenge on mankind and hazel was the result the basis of his costume was long gray underwear to which were sewed hearts diamonds spades and clubs in red and black hazels army shoes had yellow pompoms on the toes an elizabethan ruff of stiff paper was around his neck and on his head a knight templars hat knight templars hat the knights templar is a christianoriented organization founded in the eleventh century originally the knights templar were laymen who protected and defended christians traveling to jerusalem these men took vows of poverty chastity and obedience and were renowned for their fierceness and courage in battle all knights templar are members of the worlds oldest fraternal organization known as the ancient free and accepted masons or more commonly masons the hat steinbeck refers to is plumed with a white ostrich plume from the belt around his middle hung a long scabbard his right hand proudly held a cavalry saber at salute joe elegant had concentrated his revenge in one area the drop seat of the costume had been removed and in its place right on the essential surface of hazel himself was painted a bulls eye in concentric circles of red and blue hazel was a breathtaking sight he did not glance around he knew he was righthe knew it by the silence smartly he turned the saber to parade rest and crossed his hands on the hilt his breath caught in his throat i he said huskily i am prince charming and the company could see now that his cheeks were rouged and his eyelashes beaded i proteck damdamsels he announced and only then did he turn his proud head for the applause and approval he knew he merited there were tears in macks eyes you done fine hazel baby he said couldnt nobody do better who helped you joe elegant said hazel what a nice guy whitey no moved up at macks imperceptible signal you want i should go now right now said mack softly kick the bejeezus out of him hazel moved proudly in on their soft talk mr joe elegant presents his compliments he said he is sorry he cannot attend as he had to leave town on business lets seeis that allyep thats all well thank him when he comes back said mack grimly the guests looked at hazel with stricken eyes and no one laughed one glance at macks jutting chin and doubled fists stopped that impulse get on with it wide ida growled mack pulled himself together advanced to the curtain and turned to face the guests fellow citizens he said right here in cannery row lives a guy that there cant nobody want a better friend for years we have took his bounty without sharing nothing back at him now this guy needs a certain article that runs into dough therefore it is the pleasure of i and the boys to raffle off the palace flop house to buy a microscope for doc we got three hundred and eighty bucks curtain doc shouted mack youre crazy shut up said mack curtain the cloth was pulled aside to reveal johnny carriaga dressed in an aluminum supporter and a pair of blue paper wings johnny brandished his bow iamcupidgodoflove he shouted then the winning ticket slipped from his palm and fluttered to the floor johnny scrambled after it yelling idrawabeadonunexpectedhearts he grabbed the ticket and turned to mack what do i do now he asked mack gave up oh what the hell then he shouted is that the ticket you have drawn cupid i have plucked from the many johnny hadnt been near the bowl but he yelled it anyway give it to me you little bastard said mack quietly friends he said do my eyes deceive me this is a surprise well well folks it gives me great pleasure to announce that the palace flop house has passed into the hands of doc doc was jarred toward sobriety he moved close to mack youre crazy he said like a fox said mack who told you you owned it i didnt tell how do you mean doc i didnt think chong told anybody but me he was afraid youd do something like this mack said lets you and i step outside under the lanterns they faced each other doc popped the champagne cork and handed the bottle to mack who cupped his mouth over the glistening foam what was you saying doc he asked quietly chong wanted you and the boys to have a home he deeded it to you and put up the money for ten years taxes well whynt he tell us he was afraid if you knew you owned it youd mortgage it or sell it and then you wouldnt have a home mack was shaken doc he said would you do me the favor dont tell the boys why sure shake on it shake have a drink suddenly mack laughed doc he said i and the boys want to ask will you rent the joint to us sure i will mack i hope they never find out theyd skin me said mack wouldnt it be simpler if we just forgot the raffle no sir said mack chong was right i wouldnt trust the boys not to sell her sometime when they need a buck i wouldnt trust myself the visit of old jingleballicks had put docs system to an outrageous test meals had been infrequent sleep fitful emotions on stilts and the intake of alcohol enormous the raffle had jarred him out of a pleasant swimming state into something resembling sobriety but not very closely a fog of unreality like a dream feeling was not in him but all around him he went inside the palace and saw the dwarfs and monsters and the preposterous hazel all lighted by the flickering lanterns none of it seemed the fabric of sweet reality the music was deafening old jay danced by clutching a pale brunette to his stomach as though she were a paina disgusting sight and as unreal as the rest anyone untrained in tomwallagers might well have been startled at this tomwallager eddie waltzed to the rumba music his arms embracing an invisible partner wide ida lay on the floor wrestling with whitey no at each try displaying acres of pink pan ties while a wild conga line of dwarfs and animals milled about johnny carriaga ran wild standing on a box he fired at random but not at unsuspecting hearts mrs alfred wong had a rubbertipped arrow stuck between her shoulderblades then johnny winged a lantern and it crashed in flames and set fire to three dwarfs so that they had to be put out with a punch bowl mack and doc were swept into the conga line to doc the room began to revolve slowly and then to rise and fall like the deck of a stately ship in a groundswell the music roared and tinkled hazel beat out rhythm on the stove with his sword until johnny aiming carefully got a bullseye on hazel hazel leaped in the air and came down on the oven door scattering crushed ice all over the floor one of the guests had got wedged in the grandfather clock from the outside the palace flop house seemed to swell and subside like rising bread doc cupped his hands close to macks ear wheres fauna and the girls he shouted later mack cried what coming later and he added better get here pretty soon before the joint burns down what skip it mack shouted at this point whitey no fought his way to macks side and yelled mack theyre coming mack rushed to the espaldas mojadas and raised both hands at them johnny aimed his last arrow at the guitarÃ³n and took the fret out clean hold it mack screamed the music stopped and silence fell on the room then the unrealest part of all began to happen very softly the sound of a sweet muted trumpet whispered and the crazy thing was playing the wedding march wedding marchlohengrin the bridal chorus from richard wagners romantic opera lohengrin traditionally played at weddings it is commonly known as here comes the bride from lohengrin and even as doc listened the sly brass began playing with it slid into minors took a short rhythm ride and moaned away at blues the dancers were very still almost stuffed doc found the source of the musiccacahuete rivas in the corner of the room muting his trumpet with a damp sponge then in this dream the paintsplashed curtain was pulled aside and fauna the witch came through the door straddling a broom doc thought god id hate to testify about this id get the boobyhatch fauna barked this heres a very happy occasion she looked around doc come here he moved vaguely toward her four girls from the bear flag came through the door dressed in blinding colors they ranged themselves two on each side of the door facing inward holding their beribboned whisky bottles to make an arch fauna dismounted from her broom and ripped off her black wrapper displaying a sheath of silver lamÃ© in her hand miraculously appeared a silver wand tipped with a gold star she struck a pose riding on her toes as though prepared for flight i am your fairy godmother she shouted i bring you snow white the bride then suzy appeared in the doorway a transformed suzy in a wedding gown the silver crown was on her head and from its points a veil was suspended she looked lovely and young and excited her lips were parted fauna yelled doc come get your girl doc shook his head to try to wake up it was a dream a craziness the crown the veil the virginity what in hell is going on it happens that two people standing apart can dip into each others thoughts suzy read his mind or his face an embarrassed red crept up her neck and darkened her cheeks she closed her eyes and docs mind read her pain his world spun like a top he heard himself say fairy godmother i acceptmygirl suzy opened her eyes and looked in docs eyes then her jaw muscles tightened and her eyes grew fierce her sweet mouth hardened to a line she took off the crown and veil looked at them a moment and placed them gently on an apple box the crazy trumpet put a samba beat to the wedding march and a guitar took up the throbbing listen you mugs said suzy over the music i could live with a stumblebum in a culvert and be a good wife i could marry a yellow dog and be nice to him but good christ not doc suddenly she turned and darted out the door fauna plunged after her there was no chicken walk out the back way suzy slipped and rolled down the embankment and fauna rolled after her on the railroad track they gathered themselves together you goddam grandstanding bitch said fauna bitterly what do you meannot doc i love him said suzy oh woe woe woe oh woe woe woe from american modernist expatriate poet ezra pounds parodic song in the manner of house man which appeared in his fifth collection canzoni the final stanza reads london is a woeful place shropshire is much pleasanter then let us smile a little space upon fond natures morbid grace oh woe woe woe etcetera one of the common reactions to shock is lethargy if after an automobile accident one man is howling and writhing and another sits quietly staring into space it is usually the quiet man who is badly hurt a community can go into shock too cannery row did people drew into themselves kept their doors closed and didnt visit everyone felt guilty even those who had not planned the party merely to have seen it was enough mack and the boys were doubled up with a sense of unhappy fate it was their third try at doing something nice for doc and it was their third failure they did not know where to turn to escape their own scorn wide ida became fiercely taciturn her customers drank in silence to escape the guilty rage they knew was just under her muscular surface fauna grieved like a lost setter dog in a lifetime of preposterous plans she had discovered some failures but never before a catastrophe even the patrÃ³n experienced little flashes of an emotion new to him always before he had managed to swap guilt for blame of circumstance or enemy but now his accusing finger bent like a comedy pistol and aimed at his own heart it was an interesting pain but a pain nevertheless he became kindly and thoughtful of all around himan attitude that frightened people who knew him there is nothing reassuring about the smile of a tiger as for doc he was undergoing reorganization so profound that he didnt know it was happening he was like a watch taken apart on a jewelers tableall jewels and springs and balances laid out ready for reassembling for pain or frustration the human has many anodynes not the least of which is anger doc quarreled viciously with old jingleballicks ordered him out and told him never to return doc fought with the expressman over the quality of the service he had been getting although it hadnt varied in ten years finally he let the word be passed that he was working and did not want to see anyone from cannery row or anyplace else he sat over his yellow pad the neat pile of suzys sharpened pencils beside him and in his eyes the bleak look of shock suzy was at once the cause and the victim of the disintegration of the row it cannot be said that trouble builds character for just as often it destroys character but if certain character traits mixed with certain dreams are subjected to the fire sometimessometimes ella the waitressmanager of the golden poppy was no less tired at ten in the morning than at midnight she was always tired she not only accepted this but thought everybody was that way she could not conceive of feet that did not hurt of a back that did not ache or of a cook with a good disposition at breakfast the row of gobbling mouths ruined her appetite and she never got it back in the slack time around ten she cleaned and mopped the moist restaurant and swept the crumbs from under the counter stools joe blaikey came in for his morning coffee just making a fresh pot want to wait ella said sure said joe say ella you heard what happened down in cannery row saturday night no what i dont know there was a party i was going to it time i got there it was over nobody wants to talk about it i didnt hear said ella fight you think hell no theyd talk about a fight they love a fight everybody seems to feel kind of ashamed of something let me know if you hear anything will you okay coffees about ready joe suzy came in dressed in her san francisco suitgray herringbone tweed very neat and smart she sat down on a stool hi said the cop hi said suzy cup of coffee just going through the grounds now say thats a cute outfit said ella frisco said suzy you moving out no said suzy im staying joe said what happened down on the row the other night suzy shrugged her shoulders you wont talk neither huh nope damnedest thing i ever saw

your mind that aint none of your business is it against the law happens so seldom it ought to be said joe come on ella suzy begged give me a break ella asked what do you think joe joes eyes went over

fifteen minutes i can cook too ella im a pretty good fry cook go change your clothes said ella joe blaikey waited in the street for suzy to come back he moved up beside her dont bitch ella up he said gently i wont you look excited joe said suzy you remember once you said if i wanted to blow this town youd lend me the dough i thought you was staying i am i wonder could you stake me not to blow town how much twentyfive bucks where you going to live ill let you know joe said i staked kids before what the hell have i got to lose youll get it back i know i will said joe the boiler that for many years had rested among the mallow weeds in the vacant lot between the bear flag and the grocery was the first boiler the hediondo cannery ever had and the hediondo was the first cannery monterey ever had when it was understood that pilchards could be placed raw in cans doused with tomato sauce or oil sealed and then cooked in live steam a new industry came to monterey hediondo started with small capital and skimped and pioneered its way first to success and finally to oblivion its first boiler for producing the cooking steam was the triumphant improvisation of william randolph engineer fireman and president the boiler itself he got for nothing it was the whole front end of a locomotive of the pajaro valley and coast railroad this engine encountering a split rail one night leaped a trestle and dived twenty feet into a mudhole the railroad company stripped its wheels and valves whistle and bell and left the great cylinder standing in the mud william randolph found it hauled it to monterey and set it in concrete at the new hediondo cannery for years it produced lowpressure steam for cooking canned fish while its tubes blew out at intervals and were replaced in when the cannery was rich and expanding the old boiler was finally abandoned in the vacant lot to save a moving bill old mr randolph was still alive and although retired he still hated waste he stripped out the tubes leaving only the big cylinder sixteen feet long and seven feet in diameter the smokestack was still on it and its firedoor two feet wide and eighteen inches high still swung on rusty pins many people had used the boiler for temporary shelter but mr and mrs sam malloy mr and mrs sam malloy in chapter of cannery row the malloys take up residence in this castoff cannery boiler were the first permanent residents mr malloy who was good with his hands after stripping out the remaining tubes added a number of little comforts a boiler as a home has disadvantages as well as advantages some people would balk at getting down on hands and knees to crawl in through the firedoor the floor being rounded makes for difficulty both in walking and in arranging furniture the third inconvenience lies in a lack of light the advantages of a boiler can be listed as follows it is absolutely rainproof it is cozy and it has wonderful ventilation by adjusting the damper and firedoor you can have as much draft as you like under the smokestack mr malloy had built a little brick fireplace for cold winter nights in addition to all of these advantages the boiler was fireproof windproof earthquakeproof and almost bombproof these more than balanced the lack of running water electricity and interior plumbing there are those particularly in carmelbythesea who say that suzys choice of the boiler as a home was a symbolic retreat to the womb and while this may be true it is also true that this womb had economic factors at the golden poppy suzy had her meals free and in the boiler she had free shelter suzy took the money joe blaikey loaned her and went to holmans department store in pacific grove she bought a hammer saw assorted nails two sheets of plywood a box of pale blue kalsomine and a brush a tube of duco cement a pair of pink cottage curtains with blue flowers three sheets two pillow cases two towels and a washcloth a teakettle two cups and saucers and a box of tea bags at joes surplus she bought a used army cot and mattress pad bowl and pitcher and chamberpot two army blankets a small mirror and a kerosene lamp these supplies exhausted her capital but at the end of her first week of work at the golden poppy suzy paid joe back two dollars and a quarter out of tips the row in its shame pretended not to see what was going on at the boiler or to hear the sound of hammering late at night this was good manners rather than a lack of curiosity fauna held out for ten days and when she did give in to her natural nosiness she went secretly late on a tuesday night when the bear flag was closed for lack of customers from the window of the ready room fauna could see a little glow of light coming from the firedoor of the boiler the smokestack put out a lazy curl of smoke that smelled of pine pitch fauna went silently out the front door and up through the mallow weeds suzy she called softly who is it me fauna what do you want to see if youre all right im all right fauna got down on her knees and poked her head through the firedoor the transformation was complete the curving walls were pale blue and the curtains were stuck to the walls with duco cement it was a pleasant feminine apartment suzy sat on her cot in the light from the little fireplace she had built a dressing table for her mirror and bowl and pitcher and beside it stood a fruit jar filled with lupines and poppies you sure fixed it up nice said fauna aint you going to invite me in come on in but dont get stuck in the door give me a hand will you suzy pulled and boosted her through the firedoor here she said sit down on the cot im going to get a chair pretty soon we could make you a hook rug said fauna that would look nice no said suzy i want to do it myself would you like i should make you a cup of tea dont mind if i do said fauna absently and then you sure you aint mad i aint mad you know i never had no place of my own before well youve fixed it up real nice said fauna i can lend you anything you need you can use the bathroom over at the bear flag they got a shower down at the golden poppy said suzy now look fauna said you got me down and my claws wedged dont put the boots to me i aint this heres a nice cup of tea i got to tell you one thing suzy i dont care if you want to hear it or not i been wrong quite a lot but youre going about this wrong dont rub docs nose in it that just makes a man mad what are you talking about well settling here he cant look out his window without youre in his hair fauna braced herself for the explosion and it did not come suzy looked at her hands i got real nice nails she said down at the poppy where i got my hands in water all the time i squidge lotion on keeps them soft fauna you told me not to run away and i didnt i felt like digging a hole in the ground and crawling in and i didnt because i think what you said was right im going to do it right here in sight that aint what i said dont bust in said suzy you said about doc now im telling you once and you can tell it all over the row if you want then i wont have to tell it to nobody again you just forget doc doc aint got nothing to do with me he come along and

mostly im going to feel good enough now you got that you better watch that cussing said fauna i dont cuss no more you just dont try to mix me up said suzy did you get what i said why sure suzy girl

hustler suzy at least you wasnt no good at it i know what i was and i know what im going to be doc fauna asked thats done i tell you get it through your thick headthats done well i guess i better be going fauna said unhappily she put the teacup on the little dressing table got down on her hands and knees and crawled to the firedoor give me a boost through will you suzy suzy stuffed her through the opening the way youd stuff a sausage and then she called fauna fauna put her head in through the door you been the best friend i ever had if im tough it aint at you its at me i was always mad at everybody turns out it was me i was mad at when i get friends with myself maybe i can get friends with somebody without no chip fauna said spose doc come abegging i aint no mantrap said suzy i wouldnt

other side i miss you suzy ill be back when im right i love you oh shut up said fauna and she clanged the firedoor shut a president is born of all our murky inventions guilt is at once the most devious the most comic the most painful was it planted by the group pressure of the tribe to keep the potentially dangerous individual off balance is it set in the psychotissue watered and cultivated by ductless glands is guilt the unconscious device by which a man cries for attention in an unperceiving world or can it be that the final human pleasure is pain what ever its origin we scream like cats in copulation wolfbay the moon whip ourselves with the exquisite thorns of contempt and generally have a hell of a good time at it in the pleasure and passions of guilt hazel should have been voted the human least likely to succeed guilt is a selfish pastime and hazel had never been aware enough of himself to indulge in it he watched life as a small boy watches a train go bymouth open breathing high and light pleased astonished and a little confused hazel had never amounted to a damn mack once described hazels education he done four years in grammar school and four years in reform schooland he didnt learn nothing either place reform school you see where vice and crime are not extracurricular failed to have any more effect on hazel than the fourth grade had he came out as innocent as he had gone in hazel didnt pay enough attention to be evil if mack and the boys and doc hadnt been friends theres no telling what might have happened to him hazel thought mack was the worlds greatest human while doc he didnt consider human at all sometimes he said his prayers to doc but hazel was changing imperceptibly he had begun to pay attention perhaps fauna had planted the germ by reading hazels horoscope after his first protest he never mentioned it again which should in itself have been suspicious hazel did not want to be president of the united states if there had been any avenue of escape he would have taken it but his horoscope closed all doors when a man is finally boxed and he has no choice he begins to decorate his box so hazel condemned to the presidency since he could not escape it began to ornament it a man can climb high on the steps of responsibility hazel began to prepare himself for the time when his call should come he read every word of a copy of time magazine then went back to the beginning and read it again he thought about it a great deal and came to the conclusion that it was nutswhich proves that hazels problem had been inattention not unintelligence he bought a world almanac and read the lives of the presidents and he began to wonder what he would do if the british impressed our sailors if the british impressed our sailors during the administrations of washington adams jefferson and madison the royal navy impressed thousands of seamen from american ships claiming that they were british subjects the british refused to recognize american naturalization and often disregarded protection documents issued to nativeborn american sailors american anger over impressment became one of the causes of the war of or the fiftyfourforty fiftyfourforty in james k polk was elected president on a platform calling for setting the northern boundary of oregon at n the angloamerican dispute over the boundary was settled in by a treaty setting the border at n issue ever came up again he had accepted his duty and it made him sick sometimes in the morning he would awaken happy in the thought that it was a bad dream then he would count his toes and relapse into acceptance of his fate and his duty what made it worst of all was the loneliness he couldnt discuss it with anyone he was set apart and above ordinary experience when he had offered to fight mack it was not in anger he was preparing to defend the weak when he had flown in the face of his friends and refused to be a dwarf and insisted on being prince charming hazel was not being vain the dignity of his position was greater than himself he could not let his future down in an ordinary time one of the boys would have noticed hazels suffering face the weariness the pained nobility and they would have given him two tablespoons of epsom salts but in these times all mens souls were being tried and womens too and a tried soul doesnt look around much hazels attempts to figure out what had happened at the masquerade were fruitless he remembered how he had been dignified and beautiful and then all hell had broken loose and the aftermath was horrible the spirit of the palace flop house tested under the torques and stresses of so many years was broken shattered like granite which withstands so long as the hammer blows then suddenly disintegrates mack who considered life hardly worse than a bad cold was sickened to deathhis eyes were lackluster and his valiant soul was shot and if mack was that way you can imagine what the boys were likejellyfish washed up on an inhospitable shore what happened hazel asked and eyes glanced at him and glanced away and no one had the will to explain for several days hazel thought it might be the bullbitch hangover of all time but it continued into the day of reviving thirst and there was no thirst hazel began to be afraid for his friends he sat under the cypress tree and he not only kept his mind on the subject he actually thought about it it was a time for greatness and only hazel had the strength to rise to that bright bait when he stood up and brushed the cypress dirt from his jeans he had completed the change no longer was he hazel the innocent hazel the unaware hazel the dope his shoulders squared to take the weight and the calm beauty of strength shone from his eyes it was dusky in the palace moldy and sad the boys lay on their beds listless and ruined mack stared up at his canopy and he was the worst of all for there was no expression in his face he had not crashed in flames he was eroding away when hazel sat down quietly on the side of his bed mack didnt even take a kick at him although his shoes were on hazel said mack mack darling you should shake the lead out of your pants now mack did not answer but he closed his eyes and two tears squeezed out and hung there until they dried hazel said gently mack you want i should kick the hell out of you mack moved his head quietly back and forth in negation hazel did not hold back he threw his trump card in and the hell with it i been over to docs he said hes setting there with a pencil in his hand he aint wrote nothing he aint done nothing he aint thought nothing get off your behind mack he needs us mack spoke sepulchrally he needs us like a muddaubers nest up his pants leg dont blame me hazel i cant fight back no more im down for the count whats happened mack macks voice was hollow when we done it before we wrecked his joint and busted him but that was mere chaff how do you mean mere chaff oh it was things bustedglass records dishes books stuff like that but this time weve put a knife in his belly if you keep trying to pat a guy on the head and instead you knock his brains out you lose confidence he sighed and turned over and covered his face with his arms you aint got the right to give up hazel said i got the right to do any goddam thing i want now that sounds better or not do nothing said mack look doc got to go to la jolla you know that he got to make the spring tides next week then when his new microscope comes hell have devilfish and write his paper we got to help him mack fauna says she used to manage a welterweight name of kiss of death kelly thats mekiss of death mack everything i touch withers like the sere and yellow leaf get up i wont said mack get up i tell you mack didnt even respond hazel went outside and looked around he walked to a broken tar barrel lying in the weeds and pulled out a curved oaken stave he went back and stood beside macks bed he judged distance and lift he hit mack so hard that his pants split and only then did hazel realize how serious it was for mack didnt even move he only groaned hazel fought down panic and then he remembered his fatea sacrifice to washington where he would have to eat oysters all right mack he said softly ill have to do her myself he turned and walked out of the door with quiet dignity mack rolled up on one elbow did you hear what that crazy bastard said oh what the hell cant do no worse than i done mother make my bed soon for im sick to the death and i fain would lie down youre already down said whitey no the thorny path of greatness when people change direction it is a rare one who does not spend the first half of his journey looking back over his shoulder hazel had chosen or had been forced to choose a new path he had said ill have to do her myself it had seemed easy but sitting under the sheltering branches of the black cypress tree he had to admit he didnt know who or what in the hell she was he thought with longing of the old time when he was a dope when he was cared for and thought for and loved he had paid off of course by accepting ridicule but it had been a lovely time a warm time doc had said long ago i like to have you sit with me hazel you are the wellthe original well a man can give you his deepest secrets you dont hear or remember and if you did it wouldnt make any difference because you dont pay attention why youre better than a well because you listenbut you dont hear you are a priest without penalties an analyst without diagnosis those were the good days before hazels responsibility but responsibility required judgment the choosing between courses and what was that but thought hazel undertook thought but he did it secretly no one knew he was a little ashamed of it in the sweet old days he would have sat down under the black cypress and then he would have reclined with his head on his arm and in less than a minute he would have been asleep the new hazel clasped his knees with his arms and mourned into the future his mind climbed and slipped like an ant in the treacherous crater of an ant lions trap he must plan he must judge he must choose no sleep came he didnt even itch he had to do her but what was she he never knew how his solution came to him he dropped off to sleep forehead on knees then suddenly his muscles leaped as though under a blow he had a sense of fallingand there was his course laid out before him it wasnt an honorable course but it was the only one he had it almost amounted to treachery you will remember that it was hazels pleasant social custom to ask questions but not to listen to the answers people expected that depended on it suppose he thought i was to ask and then listen but not let on im listening it was sneaky but the intention was clean and the end infinitely to be desired he would not only listen he would remember and he would put all the answers together maybe then he would be able to think her and do her one question would be enough he thought maybe two hazel was weary from his effort he reclined put his head on his arm and slept the good sleep of work well done hazels quest joe elegant came cautiously back from his journey ready to take another one at a moments notice he expected reprisals for hazels costume and there were no reprisals in gratitude he made popovers at the bear flag three evenings in a rowand the girls didnt even know what they were eating he wanted to know what had happened but he was afraid to ask thus joe elegant was glad when hazel called on him in his little leanto in the rear of the bear flag sit here he said ill get you a piece of cake while he was gone hazel regarded the works of henri the artist on the wallone from the chickenfeather period and one from the later nutshell time and he looked at the card table on which joe elegant worked at a portable typewriter there was a neat pile of manuscript on the table green paper typed with a green ribbon a sheet of paper was in the machine it began my dear anthony west my dear anthony west steinbecks satire of joe elegant as a novelist continues here in this dig at anthony west the british author novelist essayist biographerpublished california moonshine an unflattering review of steinbecks east of eden in the september issue of the new yorker mr steinbeck has written the precise equivalent of those nineteenthcentury melodramas in which the villains could always be recognized because they waxed their mustaches and in which the conflict between good and evil operated like a wellrun series of professional tennis matches p in a letter to carlton sheffield on october in steinbeck a life in letters steinbeck registered his dismay i am interested in anthony wests review in the new yorker sic i wonder what made him so angryand it was a very angry piece i should like to meet him to find out why he hated and feared this book so much p clearly steinbeck had the last word it was sweet of you joe came back with a wedge of cake and a glass of milk for hazel and while hazel munched and drank joes large damp eyes bracketed him but never hit him howd it go he asked what why your costume fine fine everybody was real surprised ill bet they were did mack say anything he said i done fine he almost cried joe elegant smiled with quiet malice hazel asked vacuously say what would you think was the matter with doc joe crossed his legs professionally and his fingers rippled through the greentyped green pages its the whole and the part and the part is the whole he said come again its many things and one thing docs libido is driving him one way and his conscience is pulling him another his myth is the sea the wind and the tide and he relates to it by collecting animals he carries his treasures to his laboratory he wants to hide them and perhaps to place the dragon fafnir fafnir in german composer richard wagners norseinspired epic of four linked operas der ring das nibelungen its first complete production took place in fafnir a giant transformed into a dragon guards the golden treasure on guard hazel nearly said he sells them but that would have given him away as listening i knew a dame named fafnir he said bertha fafnir third grade used to do pitchers of turkeys on the blackboard thanksgiving had starched underskirts they rustled kind of joe elegant scowled faintly at the interruption distill the myth and you get the symbol he went on the symbol is the paper he wants to write but that in itself has impurities needs distillation why because it is a substitute thats why his symbol is false thats why he cant write his paper frustration he has taken the wrong path and so he brings in false solutions i need a microscope he says i need to go to la jolla for the spring tides he will not go to la jolla he will never write his paper why not wrong symbol we must go back to the myth the sea the sea is his mother his mother is dead but she is living he is carrying treasures from his mothers womb and trying to save them do you understand sure said hazel listlessly he needs love he needs understanding said joe elegant who dont hazel asked i feel that i could help him if he would let me i kind of thought hed took a shine to suzy said hazel joe elegant let a shadow of distaste tighten his mouth that would only be a new false path a new frustration hazel observed some people like one thing some another very original said joe elegant it was only a few steps from joe elegants leanto through the kitchen to the ready room in the ready room sat becky with her feet up reading her mail becky subscribed to pen pals and had a lively correspondence all over the world the sheet of rice paper in her hands was from japan dear pen pal it began your interest missive receipt how gondola the goldy state japan girl do hairkink likewise but not using blitch my friend mitzi mitzuki very west in minded would try if you mailing small little container hydrogen peroxide double pressure hi said hazel becky laid down her letter ever been to japan nope me neither hows mack fine say becky what would you say was the matter with doc love said becky docs aching away or if he aint he ought to be nice fella like that he sets like he been poleaxed thatll do it poor fella if it was me why id go to him and id put my cool hand on his brow and id say doc the door of faunas room opened i thought i heard voices hello hazel aint none of the other girls around beckys poorly i come to ask you something said hazel well come on in here set down want a snort is it private ill shut the door yes said hazel and that covered all the questions the snort brightened his eye what would you say was wrong with doc i wouldnt of said it a while ago said fauna but when he put on that tieand then the other night hell he was drunk said hazel a guy will say anything when hes drunk no he will not said fauna you think its suzy yes sir and if she wasnt nuts she could go to la jolla with him and help him work why hell shed be in hes trying to write his paper he got himself all bollixed up said fauna i bet he aint even thinking about his paper he aint thinking about nothing thats what i mean if he could stop not thinking about suzy why he could start thinking about his paper thats my opinion anyway you think if she went to la jolla i do but she wont go he wouldnt take her said hazel if everybody wasnt such damn fools he wouldnt get asked said fauna i dont know what were coming to have one more snort i cant said hazel i got to see a guy it was only a coincidence that joseph and mary rivas was also reading a letter when hazel entered the grocery joseph and mary was reading and cursing at the same time cursing in obscure spanish the letter was from james petrillo james petrillo james caesar petrillo was a labor leader who became the influential president of the american federation of musicians from to he rigorously policed the practice of hiring nonunion musicians such as the members of joseph and mary rivass band and it spoke in no uncertain terms if the threat in the letter could be carried out it looked as though what the us government could not do in keeping wetbacks out the musicians union could the patrÃ³n was in a stew ordinarily what he could not eliminate he joined but petrillo did not give him that choice joseph and marys mind strayed toward assassination hazel said howre you lousy said the patrÃ³n aint nobody feeling too good hazel observed docs setting over there like hes punchdrunk what you thinks the matter with him christ knows said the patrÃ³n i got troubles of my own funny thing he said you know last night i was coming home from monterey late and there was a shadow up in the vacant lot it moved into that bright spot the street light throws up by the boiler and i swear to god it was doc sneaking around up there no said hazel i say yes the patrÃ³n looked over the vegetables and the piled canned goods and his eyes dwelt on the cardboard cocacola girl in a swing know something he said speculatively before the party i would have said she was just one more tramp then she belted loose and moved into the boiler and then wellit looks like doc seen something there maybe suzys got something i missed i been thinking i might just take a whack at her you cant said hazel shes docs hell said the patrÃ³n dames dont belong to nobody i might just whistle under her window she aint got no windows said hazel the patrÃ³n smiled petrillos poison was going out of him yes sir he said maybe i missed something you stay away from her said hazel joseph and mary drooped his eyes and an indian looked out for a second then he smiled again have it your own way he said lightly i hear shes got a job this was the golden poppy long narrow highceilinged small octagonal tile on the floor dark wood counter with small round stools units at intervals on the counterjukebox slot papernapkin holder salt pepper sugar mustard catsup rear door to the kitchen with window and service shelf cash register at the front cigarette machine beside the door long mirror behind the counter fronted by coffeemaker griddle toasters covered cakes and pies stacked breakfast foods doughnuts rack of canned soup and soup heater fight cards movie schedule bus timetable there was nothing to be done about the golden poppy it was a dour and gloomy place dedicated to good coffee and sad soggy food it could not compete with the gay and phony little restaurants springing up in monterey with their checked tablecloths showcard murals low ceilings and candles in cork floats the golden poppy did not try there were many people who preferred it to the newcomerscustomers who liked cold damp doughnuts stringy stews and canned soup these diners distrusted fishnets on the walls and jokes on the menu to them food was a necessary but solemn sacrament about which there should be no nonsense the rush hours were seven to eightthirty breakfast eleventhirty to onethirty lunch six to eight dinner in between these hours there were the coffee customers the sandwich and doughnut people in the evening came two rush times at ninethirty when the early movie let out and at eleventhirty when the second show broke at twelvethirty the golden poppy curled its petals except on saturday nights when it stayed open until two for the early drunks the coming of suzy to the golden poppy had a curious but reasonable effect on ella she had over the years maintained an iron interdict against weariness and pain if she had allowed herself to realize how miserable she was she would have cut her throat suzy did more than help she took over joked with the salesmen whistled over the sandwich toaster remembered that mr garrigas like cream of celery soup and remembered his name too for a day or so ella had watched suzy and refused acidly when suzy suggested that she go home and lie down for a couple of hours then her interdict cracked and the crack widened abysmal fatigue aching legs and abdominal pains crept through ella was an exhausted woman when she came at last to admit it going home to lie down for an hour was first a sin and then a luxury and finally a drug now when suzy said after the ninethirty rush go on home and get a good nights sleep it seemed perfectly natural not only could suzy hold the fort but her terse professional gaiety was drawing in new customers at elevenfifteen suzy had the four silexes filled with fresh coffee the hamburgers between waxed paper in the icebox the tomatoes sliced and the sandwich bread in the drawer below the griddle at eleventhirty the customers came in a rush from the second show suzy grew six extra hands club sandwiches melted cheese sandwiches cheeseburgers and coffee coffee coffee the cash register jangled and the change appeared standing up between the tits of the rubber mat hows about a date saturday sure love to is it a date can my husband come you married i wont be if i keep that date youre a swelllooking kid youre kind of pretty yourself heres your change keep it thanks cheeseburger coming up sorry eightysix on the tuna fish sandwiches in the seconds between orders three of her extra hands carried dishes into the soapy water rinsed and dried them hey mr gelthain you forgot your umbrella so i did thank you that would be another quarter tip and the quarter went into a slotted can marked joe every morning when joe blaikey came in for his coffee a little pile of silver was put before him and checked in the account book it was amazing how it added up at five minutes of twelve hazel came in and waited against the wall until a stool was vacant hi hazel whatll it be cup of coffee its on the house hazel how you been okay gradually the customers thinned out and then were gone suzys flashing hands put the golden poppy to bed scrubbed the grill washed down the counter wiped the necks of the catsup bottles she looked up to see hazel sweeping out say what the hell are you doing i figured were both going the same way ill walk with you why not said suzy you can carry my books what just a joke ha ha said hazel seriously they walked down alvarado street all closed up except where the bars splashed neon culture on the sidewalk at the tip of the presidio they stopped and leaned their elbows on the iron railing and looked at the fishing boats in the black water of the bay they crossed the tracks went past the army ware house and entered the upper end of cannery row and at last hazel said youre a swell dame come again say what you thinks the matter with doc how would i know you sore at him howd you like to mind your own business its all right said hazel quickly i aint bright everybody knows that whats that got to do with keeping out of my hair nobody pays no attention to me said hazel he offered this as a recommendation doc says i dont listen he likes that they walked on in silence for a while then hazel said timidly he done everything in the world for me once he went character witness for me and i aint got no character once id of lost a foot but he opened her up and shook powder on her and i still got her suzy didnt answer their footsteps were loud on the pavement and echoed back from the iron fronts of dead canneries docs in trouble hazel said their footsteps filled the street anybody in trouble why they go to doc nobody goes to him now hes in trouble step step step i got to help him said hazel but i aint bright what the hell do you want me to do said suzy well couldnt you go over and set with him no if you was in trouble hed help you i aint in trouble how do you know hes in trouble im telling you i thought you liked him i like him all right if he was in real trouble like if he was sick or bust his leg id probably take him some soup jeeze if he bust his leg he couldnt go to the spring tides said hazel well he aint busted his leg they passed wide idas hazel asked you want a beer no thanks then she said aint you going up to the palace no said hazel i got to see a guy suzy said once when i was a kid i made an ashtray for my old man and old lady they like it they didnt need no ashtray didnt they smoke yes said suzy good night hazel was approaching a state of collapse in his whole life he had never sustained a thought for more than two minutes now his resources reeled under the strain of four hours of concentration and it was not yet over he had to make two more visits and then he had to retire under the black cypress tree to sift his findings so far he could see no light anywhere his mental pictures were like those childrens kaleidoscopes that change color and design as they are turned it seemed to hazel that a slight zizzing sound came from his brain it was a catty night big toms crept about their heads and shoulders flattened to the ground seeking other toms lady cats preened themselves in sweet innocence unaware of what they hoped was likely to happen to them on the rocks off hopkins marine station hopkins marine station the hopkins seaside laboratory of stanford university opened in on lovers point north of its current site at oceanview boulevard pacific grove it has been located on oceanview since when it was officially renamed hopkins marine station it is the oldest marine research facility on the west coast steinbeck attended summer classes at hopkins in the sea lions barked with a houndish quaver the silver canneries were silent under the street lights and from somewhere on the beach cacahuete rivass trumpet softly mourned the memphis blues memphis blues a song written in published in by songwriter and bandleader william christopher handy selfproclaimed father of the blues memphis blues played a significant role in bringing african american music into the mainstream hazel had stopped for a moment in appreciation of the secret night he looked up at the boiler where suzy had gone and into the streak of street light he saw a figure move from the shape and posture he thought it must be the patrÃ³n in a way it was none of hazels business he walked up the stairs and knocked on the door of western biological doc sat on his bed regarding a heap of collecting paraphernalia nets buckets and jars formaldehyde and epsom salts and menthol rubber boots and rubber gloves glass plates and string on his table stood a small new traveling aquarium with a tiny pump and motor run by two dry cells morosely he watched the mist of white air bubbles sift through the sea water come in he said to hazel im glad to see you just come to pass the time of day said hazel good im glad a man feels silly talking to himself and at the same time its private youre the perfect answer hazel say doc i just remembered whats assastrophysic you dont really want me to tell you do you not very much i just wondered i signed up for it doc shuddered i dont think i want to hear about that he said i brang you a pint thats friendly of you will you join me sure said hazel youre really going to la jolla huh well i guess i have to thats one of the things ive been trying to figure out ive made such a stink about it lot of people think you wont go well thats one of the reasons i have to dont you want to i dont know said doc softly he got up from the bed and disengaged a wire from the dry cell no point in wasting juice he said ive been tearing myself down like a model t ford in a backyard got the pieces all laid out still dont know why it wont run dont even know whether i can get it together again i could help said hazel i know about model ts it might turn out you know about people too said doc hazel looked shyly down at his feet no one had ever accused him of knowing anything before doc chuckled thats my good hazel say doc what you think is the matter with you hazel was appalled at his daring but he had asked and doc seemed to find the question reasonable god knows he said some kind of obscure selfjustification i guess i wanted to make a contribution to learning maybe that was a substitution for fathering children right now my contribution even if it came off seems kind of weak i think maybe ive talked myself into something and now maybe i have to do it hazel groped among his bits and pieces macks sorry about what him and fauna done hes just sick he shouldnt be said doc im the one who messed it up you mean you would of took suzy on i guess so ive thought about it ever since for a couple of days there i felt different and better than i ever have in my life a kind of builtin pain was gone i felt wide open about suzy i guess so im supposed to have this wild free brain without conventional barriers and what did i do i balanced a nasty ledger i weighed education experience background even probable bloodlines some of the worst people i ever knew had the best of all those well there it is saying it has made it even clearer i guess ive thrown it away why dont you give it one more try doc how why dont you take a candy bar or a bunch of carnations and knock on her door right from the beginning huh sounds kind of silly well dames is all dames said hazel you may have made a discovery have you seen her yeah she got that boiler fixed up real pretty she got a job down at the golden poppy how is she what did she say hazel cast about again among his broken pieces her vehemence came back to him when she was a kid she made an ashtray for her papa and mama hazel let it hang there because it sounded ridiculous well what about it they didnt need no ashtray said hazel she told you that yep lets have a drink i cant doc i got one morei mean i got to see a guy this late at night yeah and then hazel confessed you been good to me doc i wouldnt do no bad thing to you of course you wouldnt but i done it what remember you always said you liked me cause i didnt listen sure i remember hazels eyes were shy and ashamed i listened he said thats all right doc yes joseph and marys hanging around the boiler hazel couldnt remember ever having been so tired he had put his mind to unaccustomed tricks and it was just as he had been afraid it would be he had got nothing he had started out hoping to find some kind of light to guide him what he had got reminded him of henris painting in nutshells he wanted to sleep a long time perhaps never to awaken to a world in which he now felt himself a stranger he had made a mess of it he wondered if he would make as bad a mess in washington he walked wearily through the vacant lot and up the chicken walk to the palace flop house he wanted to slip into bed in the dark and hide his failure in sleep mack and the boys were waiting up for him where the hell you been said mack we looked all over for you just walking around said hazel listlessly mack moved and groaned jesus you hit me a crack he said damn near killed me i shouldnt of did it said hazel you want i should rub it hell no what you been up to when you get making plans the sky is falling on my tail said henny penny henny penny english fairy tale of undetermined origin and variable plot sometimes called the sky is falling chicken little chicken licken or henny penny in one version henny penny is hit on the head by a falling acorn and believes that the sky is falling and that she must tell the king the moral of the tale varies from version to version but certainly can be interpreted to mean that danger is imminent whitey no asked who you been with everybody just walking around well who oh joe elegant and fauna and suzy and doc you seen suzy mack demanded sure went down to the poppy for a cup of coffee look whos buying coffee it was on the house said hazel well what did she say she says in the third grade she made an ashtray oh jesus said mack did she say anything about doc yeah i guess so you guess so dont ask me if youre going to be mean to me thatll just get me mean mack shifted painfully to his other buttock hazel felt ringed with hostility i guess ill go outside he said miserably wait whatd she say about doc said she didnt want no part of him exceptim going to go on out except what except he got sick or bust a leg mack shook his head sometimes you get me thinking the way you do god almighty i shouldnt of let you out alone i didnt do no harm i bet you didnt do no good either i bet right now youre trying to figure out germ warfarehow to get doc sick im tired said hazel i just want to go to bed whos stopping you hazel didnt even take off his clothes before he went to bed but he didnt sleep either at least not until the dawn crept out from salinas his brain was blistered and his responsibility rode him with surcingle and spurs the distant drum doc sat for a long time after hazel left him his chest rustled with feeling and his throat was dry his top mind looked at hima scientist a thinker trained conditioned to method to exactness no single thing could be permitted in unless it could be measured or tasted or heard or seen the laws of science were docs laws and he sought to obey them to break these laws was not only a sin to him but a danger for violation would let in anarchy he was frightened and cold his middle mind screamed with joy at his discomfiture i told you all through the years ive told you you were fooling yourself lets see you get back to analysis i dare you and the lowhumming mind in his entrails was busy too aching and yet singing that the ache was necessary and good middle mind had its way doc thought lets look at this here is a man with work to do the girlwhat is she lets suppose every good thing should come of a relationship with her it still would be no good there is no possible way for this girl and me to be successfulno way under the sun not only is she illiterate but she has a violent temper she has all of the convictions of the uninformed she is sure of things she has not investigated not only sure for herself but sure for everyone in two months she will become a prude then where will freedom go your thinking will be like tennis against a bad player lets stop this nonsense forget it you cant have it and you dont want it middle mind hooted you cant not have it too what ever happens youve got her take a feel of your pulse listen to your pounding heart why you just heard the iron door of the boiler clang thats why you havent even thought what that means yet but youve got a pain in your gut because of that clang and because its threethirteen in the morning low mind said nothings bad its all part of one thingthe good and bad do you know any man and womanno matter how closewho dont have good and bad let me out or by god ill set my claws in you and ill tear at you for all your life let me out i say feel this this red burning thats rage will you let it out or will it fester here until it makes you sick and crazy look at the time you heard that iron door doc looked at his watch why that sonofabitch he said aloud he snapped off his light and went to the window and looked out toward the strip of light the street lamp threw on the vacant lot then he opened his front door and crept down the stairs crossing the street he followed a broad shadow and hid in it the patrÃ³n was sitting on a big rusty pipe trying to work out a puzzle he had it laid out and the pieces didnt make sense here was himself young goodlooking snappy dresser and making dough and here was a dame a dimeadozen dame living in a boiler working for her keep the patrÃ³n knew methods too and if not scientific they had served him well enough so that he could depend on them you sweet talk you promise you offer and in reserve you always hold force every dame needs a little force he felt the swelling knuckles of his right hand this dame was nuts she didnt listen to his pitch and when he brought up force she slammed the iron door and damn near took his fingers off he was going to lose the nails of all four fingers the dirty bitch thus musing bitterly he did not hear docs approach docs fingers locked in the collar of the patrÃ³ns striped shirt and yanked him to his feet by reflex the patrÃ³n lashed out with his foot and kicked docs legs from under him the two fell together and rolled in the mallow weeds joseph and mary tried for the groin with his knee while docs delicate strong fingers laced around the throat the patrÃ³n felt the thumbs seeking the hollow below his adams apple he tore at the white face with his fingers and docs thumbs went home flaring lights whirled in the patrÃ³ns eyes and his brain turned red he knew that in two seconds his thorax would collapse under the thumbs and he would be dead he had seen it happen he knew it and so knowing he went limp and in sweating terror felt the thumbs relax the patrÃ³n lay still and his sickened mind figured the chancesthe groin again or butt of head to chin but if he missed the terrible thumbs would come again he was weak and afraidafraid even to speak for fear the wrong word might draw the seeking thumbs doc he whispered i give up you got me go near that girl again and ill tear your throat out doc whispered back i wont i swear to god i wont in the grocery under the sevenwatt light the patrÃ³n tried to get the cork out of a pint with his mashed fingers but had to pass the bottle to doc doc felt the sickness that follows rageand he also felt silly he took a gulp of whisky and passed the bottle over the counter joseph and mary drank and then bent over coughing and spluttering doc had to run around the counter to beat him on the back when he could speak joseph and mary looked at doc with wonder i cant understand it he said whered you learn that trick whatd you want to do it for you might of killed me i guess i wanted to said doc i must have wanted to he laughed embarrassedly i thought you were making a pass at suzy i was said joseph and mary jesus doc i didnt know you was that way with her im not said doc give me a drink you wasnt playing tiddlywinks said joseph and mary now dont get excited she give me the bums rush hell she damn near took off my fingers with that door you aint got any competition from me doc shes all yours she wont even see me said doc wont what in hell is the matter with her who knows they rested their elbows on the counter and faced each other beats me said joseph and mary what you going to do doc smiled hazel said take her flowers and a candy bar he might have something there i cant figure her gingerly the patrÃ³n let a little whisky dribble down his throat and winced as it passed the bruised place i guess shes just nuts he said and if shes nuts a guys got to do nuts things you dont think you could say the hell with her i have over and over dont do no good not a bit i know its damn foolishness but there it is i knew guys like that there aint nothing to do about it i guess his eyes sharpened i remember something he said when i was talking to her through that damn firedoor tonight she says when i find a guy thats up to his eyes ill dive in she says and i says for doc hell no she says hes sliced like package bacon i guess shes right said doc that aint what i was thinking look doc when you had the hooks in me if id went onwell would you of i guess so i can hardly believe it of myself but i guess i would have i never did anything like that before why well i just thoughta guy thatll do a killing with his hands aint sliced too thin lets finish the pint doc and then ill help you help me what flowers said joseph and mary we got an hour before daylight up above light house avenue theres front yards just lousy with flowers the deepdish setdown joe elegant was only the cook at the bear flag not the bouncer with the result that his services were never required late at night he retired early and set his alarm clock for four this gave him three or four hours every morning over his portable to tap out green letters on green paper the book was going well his hero had been born in a state of shock and nothing subsequent had reassured him when a symbol wasnt slapping him in the mouth a myth was kicking his feet out from under him it was a book of moods of dank rooms with cryptic wallpaper of pale odors of decaying dreams there wasnt a character in the whole of the pi root of oedipus who wouldnt have made the observation ward the hero had elderly aunts beside whom the marquis de sade was an altar boy the pile of green manuscript was three inches thick and joe elegant was beginning to plan his photograph for the back of the dust cover open collar he thought and a small wry smile and one hand relaxed in front of him with an open poison ring on the third finger he knew which reviewers he could depend on and why he typed a pool scummed with azolla in the open water in the middle of the pond a dead fish floated belly up joe elegant sighed leaned back and scratched his stomach he yawned went into the bear flags kitchen and started a pot of coffee while it was heating he walked out into a glorious morning the pelicans were drumming in for a run of tom cod and little pink kleenex clouds hung over the bay joe saw the flowers in front of the boiler door and moved over to inspect thema huge bouquet of tulips early roses jonquils and iris they might have been anyones offering except that their stems were in a museum jar joe elegants life had not been in danger since the engagement and raffle party but he hadnt felt much friendliness in cannery row either he carried his news into the bear flag and served it to fauna on a tray along with her coffee and crullers by eight oclock the news was in the palace flop house and the early men were ingesting it with their whisky sours at the la ida the best seats were in the ready room with its windows overlooking the vacant lot mack was there behind a drape munching faunas crullers the girls were there in their best kimonos becky had put on her mules with the ostrich feathers at eightthirty the audience heard the boiler door screech and shushed one another suzy on her hands and knees poked her head out of the firedoor and rammed her nose into the giant floral tribute for a long moment she stared at the flowers and then she reached out and dragged them inside the iron door closed after her at nine oclock suzy reemerged and walked rapidly toward monterey at ninethirty she was back she went into the boiler and in a moment came out pushing her suitcase ahead of her the audience was filled with dismay but only for a moment suzy climbed the steps and rang the bell at the bear flag fauna chased the girls to their rooms and mack out the back way before she answered the door suzy said you told me i could use your bathroom help yourself said fauna in an hour when the splashing had ceased fauna knocked on the bathroom door want a little toilet water honey thanks said suzy in a few minutes she emerged scrubbed and shining like a cup of coffee fauna asked wish i could said suzy i got to run thanks for the bath there aint nothing like a good deepdish setdown bath fauna from behind a drape watched her crawl back into the boiler in her office fauna scribbled a note and sent it by joe elegant to western biological it read she aint going to work today il ny a pas de mouches sur la grandmÃ¨re il ny a pas de mouches sur la grandmÃ¨re the english translation of the french is there are no flies on grandmother doc laid his best clothes out on his cot there were pale acid spots on the washed khaki trousers the white shirt was yellow with age and he noticed for the first time that his old tweed jacket was frayed through at both elbows the tie he had worn to the dinner at sonny boys was spotted he found a black army tie in the bottom of his suitcase for the first time in his life he was dissatisfied with his clothing it was silly to feel serious about it but there was no doubt that he was serious for a time he sat down and regarded his wardrobe and his life and he found them both ridiculous and not less ridiculous was the quaking certainty that he was frightened he spoke aloud to the rattlesnakes and they ran out their forked tongues to listen you are looking at a fool he said i am a reasonable man a comparatively intelligent maniq one hundred and eightytwo university of chicago masters and phd an informed man in his own field and not ignorant in some other fields regard this man he said he is about to pay a formal call on a girl in a boiler he has a halfpound box of chocolates for her this man is scared stiff why ill tell you why he is afraid this girl will not approve of him he is terrified of her he knows this is funny but he cannot laugh at it the eyes of the snakes looked dustily at himor seemed to doc went on let me put it this way there is nothing i can do they say of an amputee that he remembers his leg well i remember this girl i am not whole without her i am not alive without her when she was with me i was more alive than i have ever been and not only when she was pleasant either even when we were fighting i was whole at the time i didnt realize how important it was but i do now i am not a dope i know that if i should win her ill have many horrible times over and over ill wish id never seen her but i also know that if i fail ill never be a whole man ill live a gray halflife and ill mourn for my lost girl every hour of the rest of my life as thoughtful reptiles you will wonder why not wait look further there are better fish in the sea but you are not involved let me tell you that to me not only are there no better fish there are no other fish in the sea at all the sea is lonely without this fish put that in your pipe and smoke it he took off his clothes and had a shower and scrubbed himself until his skin was soapburned and red he brushed his teeth until his gums bled his hands were frayed with formalin but he gouged at his discolored nails just the same and he brushed at his overgrown hair and he shaved so close that his face was on fire at last he was readyand still he looked for things to do to put off his departure his stomach was crowding up against his chest forcing him to breathe shallowly i should take a big slug of whisky he thought but it would be on my breath and she would know why id taken it i wonder if shes frightened too you never know women can conceal these things better than men oh god what a fool i am i cant go this way im falling to pieces my voice would tremble why the littleno dont do that you cant build your courage by running her down youre going to her not she to you why do i say you when it is i am i afraid of i and then he knew what to do he went to his records and he found the art of the fugue if i cant get courage from his greatness he thought i might as well give up he sat unmoving while bach built a world and peopled it and organized it and finally fought his world and was destroyed by it and when the music stopped as the man had stopped when death came to him stopped in the middle of a phrase doc had his courage back bach fought savagely he said he was not defeated if he had lived he would have gone on fighting the impossible fight doc cried to no one give me a little time i want to think what did bach have that i am hungry for to the point of starvation wasnt it gallantry and isnt gallantry the great art of the soul is there any more noble quality in the human than gallantry he stopped and then suddenly he seemed to be wracked with inner tears why didnt i know before he asked i who admire it so didnt even recognize it when i saw it old bach had his talent and his family and his friends everyone has something and what has suzy got absolutely nothing in the world but guts shes taken on an atomic world with a slingshot and by god shes going to win if she doesnt win theres no point in living anymore what do i mean win doc asked himself i know if you are not defeated you win then he stabbed himself in vengeance for having run suzy down i know what im doing in the face of my own defeat im warming myself at her gallantry let me face this clearly please i need her to save myself i can be whole only with suzy he stood up and he did not feel silly anymore and his mission was not ridiculous so long he said to the rattlesnakes wish me luck he took his box of candy and went jauntily down the steps of western biological crossing the street he knew he was being observed from every window from which he was visible and he didnt care he waved a salute to his unseen audience going through the vacant lot among the mallow weeds he thought how do you knock on an iron door he stooped and picked a rusty tenpenny nail from the ground and he arrived almost gaily at the boiler and tapped a little drumbeat on the iron wall the firedoor was slightly ajar suzys voice sounded with a metallic ring who is it its i said doc or mesomebody like that the firedoor opened and suzy looked out thanks for the flowers she said i brought you another present she looked at the candy box in his hand being on her hands and knees she had to twist her neck to look up at him doc couldnt tell whether there was suspicion and doubt on her face or only strained muscles from her position candy she asked yes i dont she began and then faunas words crowded in on her with short punches what the hell she said thanks doc was losing his poise suzy had straightened her neck and from her position she couldnt see above his knees doc tried for lightness again and he sounded clumsy to himself this is a formal call he said arent you going to ask me in do you think you can get in i can try there aint much room inside doc remained silent oh for gods sakes come on in said suzy she backed her head out of the opening doc got down on his hands and knees he threw the candy box through the firedoor then crawled through the opening he thought with amusement a man who can do this with dignity need never again fear anything and at that moment his trouser cuff caught on the door and pulled it closed against his ankle he was all inside except one foot and he could not free himself i seem to be hung up he said hold it said suzy she straddled him and worked the cuff loose from the door corner i think you tore your pants she said as she backed off over his shoulders maybe i can mend em for you docs eyes were getting used to the dim interior a little light came in from the smokestack and met a little more that entered from the firedoor its hard to see at first said suzy i got a lamp here wait ill light it up no need said doc he could see now and something in him collapsed with pity at the pretension of the curtains the painted walls and the homebuilt dressing table with its mirror and bottles my god what a brave thing is the human he thought and then suzy brought his rising compassion crashing down theres a welder eats at the poppy know what hes going to do first any day he can bring his torch and cut windows in the sides her voice echoed with enthusiasm ill put in little window frames and some flower boxes with red geraniums she said course ill have to paint the outside then white i think with green trim maybe a trellis like in front i got a nice hand with roses then she was silent constraint and formality sifted in and filled the boiler doc thought in wonder its not a boiler at all somehow she has managed to make a home of this he said youve done a wonderful job here thanks he spoke his thought its a real home its comfortable she said i never had no room of my own no room of my own suzys lament ironically and meta phorically echoes virginia woolfs pioneering feminist essay a room of ones own delivered as lectures at cambridge university in in the essay woolf claims that in order for a woman writer to be successful she needs space to work in and money enough to support herself well you have now sometimes i set in here and think how theyd have to blast to get me out if i didnt want to come doc gathered his courage suzy im sorry for what happened i dont want to talk about it it wasnt none of your fault yes it was i dont think so she said with finality i would do anything to look doc she said you wont let it alone so maybe i got to rub your nose in it a little it wasnt no fault of yours but it sure as hell give me a lesson i had myself a bawl and now its done there aint nothing for you to do i dont need nothing anybodys sorry for me theyre wasting their time i aint never had it so good in my life got that well dont forget it there aint nothing for you nor nobody to do cause im doing it all myself if you can get that through your knocker okay if you cant you better take a powder he said what a conceited fool ive been then silence hung in the boiler suzy broke it when she felt that his nose was sufficiently rubbed in it know what she said brightly they got a night class typing at the high school i signed up next saturday i get a rent typewriter i can learn ill bet you can too maybe youll type my paper for me youre going to write it after all ive got to suzy its all i have im a dead duck without it im going to la jolla saturday for the spring tides im glad are you why not she asked i dont like to see nobody kicked in the face she drew up formality like a coverlet you want i should make you a nice cup of tea i got a sterno stove id like it she had the situation in hand now and she talked on easily while she lighted the stove and put her little teakettle on to boil im making good tips down at the poppy she said paid off joe blaikey in two weeks ellas thinking about taking a weeks vacation she aint never had a vacation hell i can run the joint easy scuse that hell i dont hardly never cuss no more youre doing fine said doc could you tell me without rubbing my nose in it what you want in a man might help meanother time teas ready said suzy she passed him the steaming cup leave it steep a little longer she said sugars in the cup on the dressing table when he was stirring the sugar in she said if i thought it wasnt a pitch you was making id tell you i dont think its a pitch okay then maybe what i want aint anywhere in the world but i want it so i think there is such a thing i want a guy thats wide open i want him to be a real guy maybe even a tough guy but i want a window in him he can have his dukes up every other place but not with me and he got to need the hell out of me he got to be the kind of guy that if he aint got me he aint got nothing and brother that guys going to have something except for toughness youre kind of describing me said doc you keep out of this you told me and i was too dumb to listen you like what you got you told me straight id spoil it took me a long time to wise up but i sure wised up maybe what i said wasnt true when you said it with your face it was true all right doc felt beaten there was no anger in her tone nothing but acceptance together with an undertone of excitement that was it excitement almost amounting to gaiety he said you know suzy you sound happy i am said suzy and you know who done it for me who fauna thats a hunk of dame she made me proud and i aint never been proud before in my life how did she do it doc asked i need some of that myself she told me and made me say itthere aint nothing in the world like suzyand she says suzy is a good thing and goddam it its true now lets knock it off huh okay said doc i guess i ought to be going yeah said suzy i got to go to work say remember that guy you told me about that lived out where we went that night the seer sure what about him joe blaikey had to pick him up what for stealing from the safeway store joe hated to do it ill see what i can do so long suzy you aint mad no suzy but im sorry som i but hell you cant have everything so long doc hope you do good at la jolla when doc crossed the street this time he hoped no one was watching he went into the laboratory walked to his cot and lay down he was sick with loss he couldnt think only one thing was sure he had to go to la jolla if he didnt he would die because there would be nothing left in him to believe in even to defend he squinched his eyes closed and looked at the bright points of light swimming on his retinas there were footsteps on his porch and the snakes whirred their rattles but not violently hazel opened the door and looked in he saw docs expression and the hope died out of him no soap he asked no soap said doc there got to be some way there isnt said doc anything i can do no yes there is too you know joe blaikey the cop sure well he picked up a man in the sand dunes find joe and tell him im interested in the man tell him to be nice to him ill be down to see him as soon as i can tell joe the man is harmless doc rolled on his side and dug in his pocket heres two dollars ask joe to let you see the man and give himno stop at the safeway and buy a dozen candy bars and take them to the seer and then give him the change seer thats the mans name said doc wearily ill do her right now hazel said proudly he went out at a dogtrot doc was arranging himself comfortably in his misery again when there was a knock on the door come in he cried there was no answer but a second knock and a wild buzzing from the snakes oh christ said doc i hope not schoolchildren on a culture tour it was a telegram a long one collect it said eureka greek word meaning i have found it you are now an institution have set up cephalopod research section at california institute of technology you are in charge six thousand a year and expenses get to work on your devilfish am making arrangements for you to read paper in california academy sciences at end of year all clearly deductible congratulations wish i could hear your words when you have to pay for this wire doc laid the telegram beside him on the cot the sonofabitch he said lama sabachthani lama sabachthani from matthew and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me hazel sat on the end of the steel cot in the monterey jail and looked with interest at the seer open up one of them baby ruths he said if youre a friend of docs cant nothing bad happen to you i dont know him said the seer well he knows you thats your good luck i dont know any doctors he aint that kind hes a doctor of bugs and stuff like that oh yes i do remember i gave him dinner and he give you candy bars i probably wont eat them why for chrissake not tell my friend doc that greed poisoned me i love candy bars i stole only one at a time and eased my conscience of a little crime but yesterday an appetite like a whip overcame me i stole three the manager of the safeway says he knew i was stealing one at a time he let it go but when i took three he couldnt let it pass i dont blame him who knows what i would have done next some other appetite might have driven me ill punish myself by smelling these bars and not eating them i think youre nuts said hazel i guess so i have no basis of comparison so i dont know how other people feel you talk a little like doc said hazel i dont get none of it how is he not too hot he got troubles yes i could see that i remember now he wore loneliness like a shroud i was afraid for him jesus you do talk like him he got dame trouble that was bound to be when a man is cold he looks for warmth when he is lonely theres only one cure why doesnt he take the woman she wont have him unless i see sometimes theyre that way who women what do you mean unless hazel looked at the seer with level penetrating eyes this man talked like doc maybe he could help but with this thought there came also caution id like to ask you something hazel said what well this aint none of it true its a kind of aa whatchamacallit hypothetical question i guess so spose theres a guy and hes in trouble yes well he cant get out of it but he got a friend maybe he dont know about thats you said the seer no it aint its some other guy i forget his name he hurried on well spose the guys in trouble and theres one way he can get out but he cant do it you think his friend ought to do it certainly even if it hurt like hell certainly even if it might maybe not work certainly i dont know what the situation is with your doc but i know how it should be with you if you love him you must do anything to help himanything even kill him to save him incurable pain this is the highest and most terrible duty of friendship i gather that what you must do is violent you must first make sure it can be successful and you must second make sure within yourself that you know you will be punished it is quite possible that even if you are successful your friend will never speak to you again that takes a lot of lovemaybe the greatest love make sure you love him that much hazel caught his breath hell there aint no such guy its hypaits malarky a kind of a riddle i guess you do love him that much the seer said no one knows how greatness comes to a man it may lie in his blackness sleeping or it may lance into him like those driven fiery particles from outer space these things however are known about greatness need gives it life and puts it in action it never comes without pain it leaves a man changed chastened and exalted at the same timehe can never return to simplicity under the black cypress tree hazel writhed on the ground from between his clenched teeth came little whimpers as the night drew on and the moon went down leaving blackness so desolation fell on hazel so that he cried out against the agony of his greatness as that other did feeling forsaken hour after hour the struggle went on and only about three oclock in the morning was hazel saturated then he accepted it as he had accepted the poisoned presidency of the united states he was calm for there was no escape if anyone had seen him it would have been a dull man who did not find him beautiful hazel picked his chosen instrument from the groundan indoorball bat he crept like a nightcolored cat out of the black shadow of the cypress tree in less than three minutes he returned he lay on his stomach under the tree and wept little chapter dr horace dormody hated night calls like everybody else but doc was his friend and he responded to the frenzied voice on the telephone in the lab he looked at docs white face and then at his right arm its broken all right i dont know how badly think you could get to my car i want to xray and later he said well thats that its clean and it will take time now tell me your cockandbull story again i was asleep said doc only thing i can think is that i must have turned over and it was caught between the cot and the wall you mean you werent in a fight i tell you i was asleep what are you grinning about whats so funny dr horace said have it your own way its none of my businessunless the other fellow shows up the tissue over the break is smashed it looks as though its been hit with a club i cant have it doc cried ive got to go to la jolla tomorrow for the spring tides and turn over rocks sure try and do it said dr horace is the cast getting hot yes said doc despondently hooptedoodle or the pacific grove butterfly festival when things get really bad there are some who seek out others who have it worse for consolation it is hard to see how this works but it seems to you balance your trouble against anothers and if yours is lighter you feel better you would say the situation in cannery row was just about hopeless consider then the plight of the town of pacific grove and you will understand why the lights burned all night in the masonic hall and why there was talk of getting rid of the city government it wasnt a small thing the whole town was involved the butterflies had not arrived pacific grove benefits by one of those happy accidents of nature that gladden the heart excite the imagination and instruct the young on a certain day in the shouting springtime great clouds of orangy monarch butterflies monarch butterflies steinbeck has taken some license here by timing the arrival of the butterflies danaus plexippus in spring in reality they appear annually by the thousands in october to begin their crucial overwintering period in the pine and eucalyptus groves in pacific grove which has established a permanent monarch grove sanctuary like twinkling aery fields of flowers sail high in the air on a majestic pilgrimage across monterey bay and land in the outskirts of pacific grove in the pine woods the butterflies know exactly where they are going in their millions they land on several pine treesalways the same trees there they suck the thick resinous juice which oozes from the twigs and they get cockeyed the first comers suck their fill and then fall drunken to the ground where they lie like a golden carpet waving their inebriate legs in the air and giving off butterfly shouts of celebration while their places on the twigs are taken by new thirsty millions after about a week of binge the butterflies sober up and fly away but not in clouds they face their monday morning singly or in pairs for a long time pacific grove didnt know what it had then gradually it was remarked that an increasing number of tourists were drawn to see the butterflies where there are tourists there is money and it is a sin to let it drift away pacific grove had a gravy train right in its lap and the butterflies came free it is only natural that the great butterfly festival evolved and where there is a festival there is bound to be a pageant there was ointment trouble at first pacific grove is not only a dry town but ardently dry the sale of various tonics of good alcoholic content is the highest in the state but there is no liquor the fact that the visiting butterflies came to the dry oasis to get drunk seemed a little unfair but the town solved this first by ignoring it and then by hotly denying it the butterfly pageant explains the whole thing there was once a butterfly princess sung by miss graves and she wandered away and was lost somehow a bunch of indians citizens in long brown underwear got in it i forget how anyway the loyal subjects searched and searched and at last they found their princess and in their millions came to rescue her when they lie flat on their backs their legs are waving greetings to their queen it all works out very nicely the pageant is in the ballpark and tourists can buy butterflies made out of every conceivable material from pine cones to platinum the town makes a very nice thing of it why the symbol of pacific grove on its advertising is the monarch butterfly in all history there has been only one slipup in i think it was the butterflies did not come and the frantic town was forced to print hundreds of thousands of paper butterflies in two colors and spread them all over today a wise city government keeps a huge supply of paper monarchs on hand in case tragedy should strike again now the time of the arrival is set give one or two days in either direction the pageant has been practicing for months the indians are trained the prince has his tights out of mothballs and the princess flowers toward coloratura luxury perhaps it was an omen two days before the insects were due miss graves lost her voice she was a nice young woman rather pretty and rather tired she taught fourth grade which is enough to tire anyone sprays and injections had no effect perhaps it was psychosomatic pressure that closed her throat and bottled up all but a dry squawk her eyes were feverish with despondency and then the days went by and the butterflies did not arrive at first there was panic in pacific grove and then a blind anger set in and the citizens looked about for someone to blame the city government was a pushover it was time for a change storekeepers whose bookkeeping was shaky blamed it on the mayor movingpicture attendance had fallen off the city council took the rap for that the matter became a growl and the growl a roar turn the rascals out then there was a hotel fire in king city sixty miles away and guess who came boiling out with an overcoat and a blonde mayor cristy of pacific grove didnt even trouble to resign he left town and just as well there was talk of tar and feathers he must have heard the town hadnt been so upset since the great roque war the religious block blamed the whole thing on sin without going into details the cynics wanted to throw the whole council out together with the chief of police and the water commissioner more solid citizens placed the blame where it belonged on roosevelttruman socialism and the butterflies did not come then the first grade had its scandal william taylor th brought his crayons home wrapped in the dust cover of the kinsey report kinsey report alfred c kinsey a biologist at indiana university and the founder of its institute for sex research published the studies sexual behavior in the human male and sexual behavior in the human female on being confronted he panicked and said he got it from the teacher miss bucke she was questioned and it developed that her father had signed a petition for the release of eugene v debs petition for release of eugene debs eugene v debs fourtime socialist party presidential candidate was convicted in under the espionage act for inciting disloyalty in the armed forces by making an antiwar speech in canton ohio he was sentenced to ten years in prison but was freed on december after president warren g harding commuted his sentence in it had got so nobody could trust anybody and miss graves went on croaking and the butterflies did not come so you see the trouble on cannery row wasnt as horrible as you thought sweet thursday revisited again it was a sweet thursday in the spring the sun took a leap toward summer and loosed the furled petals of the golden poppies before noon you could smell the spice of blue lupines from the fields around fort ord it was a sweet day for all manner of rattlesnakes on the parade ground a

dodgson madness across the rifle range and drew joyous fire from two companies before he skidded to safety behind a sand dune that jackrabbits moment of grandeur cost the government eight hundred and ninety dollars and gladdened the hearts of one hell of a lot of soldiers miss graves awakened breathless with expectancy she sang a scale in halftones and found that her voice was back and all was well with the world and she was right at eleven oclock the monarch butterflies came boiling in from across the bay and landed in their millions on the pine trees where they sucked the thick sweet juice and got cockeyed the butterfly committee met in emergency session in the fire house and got out the crowns of fairies and the long brown underwear of indians the mayor pro tem of pacific grove wrote a proclamation for the evening paper the tide was very low that morning preparing for the spring tides and the warm sun dried the seaweed so that billions of flies came on excursion to feed people felt good judge albertson discharged the seer on the recommendation of the safeway manager dr horace dormody whistled through his mask over an appendectomy and told a political joke to the anesthetist but he didnt mention docs broken arm a patients problems no matter how funny were sacred to dr horace but he couldnt help chuckling discreetly to himself now and then how did the word spread about docs arm who knows fauna heard it with her crullers alice mabel and becky got it with their orange juice the patrÃ³n heard it from cacahuete who thereupon rushed to the beach and played three loud and uninhibited choruses of sweet georgia brown using six changes of key wide ida was siphoning pine canyon whisky into old crow bottles when she heard it mack and the boys had the news early and it gave them something pressing to do suzy opened up the poppy that morning the counter was crowded with breakfasters who dawdled over coffee it was well into the morning before suzy heard that doc had broken his arm and then she couldnt do anything about it because ella was getting a permanent but after she heard it some midmorning customers got curious service from a suzy who looked blankly over their heads when they spoke to her she called mr macminimin mr gross and she called mr gross you and served his eggs straight up which sickened him mack was first on the scene he didnt

the lid was off shes with doc say what you got look said mack and he and the boys gazed down on the instrument the great black tube of an eightinch reflector eyepieces socketed beside it and its tripod cradled biggest one in the whole damn catalogue said mack proudly jesus docll be happy eddie tell us everything that happened dont leave nothing out what a day it was a day of purple and gold the proud colors of the salinas high school salinas high school steinbecks alma mater he graduated in a squadron of baby angels maneuvered at twelve hundred feet holding a pink cloud on which the word joy flashed on and off a seagull with a broken wing took off and flew straight up into the air squawking joy joy suzy was ahead of her racing feet when eddie intercepted her she answered yes and no to eddies casual comments on the weather but not only did she not hear the comments she didnt know eddie was beside her she went up the steps of western biological without seeing whitey no standing guard with a sashweight her coming relieved him of a duty but he stuck around to hear at the top of the steps suzy became a breathless shy girl and as anybody knows there is nothing more indestructible and deadly than a shy young girl she paused to get her breath and then knocked on the door and went in and forgot to close the doorwhich was good for whitey no doc was sitting on his cot gloomily regarding the pile of collecting paraphernalia on the floor i heard you was hurt suzy said gently i come to see if there was anything i could do for a moment docs face lightened then gloom descended this shoots the spring tides he said staring at the white cast i dont know what ill do does it hurt much suzy asked some it will hurt more later i guess ill go down to la jolla with you and turn over rocks that weigh fifty or a hundred pounds i aint put together with spit said suzy can you drive a car sure said suzy you cant do it he said and then from way down in the deep part of him there came a

eyes shone with incredible excitement brother said suzy you got yourself a girl im sure we should all be as happy as kings im sure we should all be as happy as kings poem happy thought by popular scottish author robert louis stevenson in his a childs garden of verses and underwoods the world is so full of a number of things im sure we should all be as happy as kings in the palace flop house suzy sat on a straight chair surrounded by the boys she wore a look of furious concentration her feet were on two bricks and she held a barrel hoop in her hands propped in front of her was a board on which were chalked ignition key speedometer choke and gas gauge on the floor on her right side stood an apple box with a mop handle sticking upright out of it try her again said mack turn the key and reach up with your right toe for the starter suzy put her foot on a chalk spot on the floor chugachugachug said hazel happily push out your clutch suzy pushed her left foot down on a brick now bring

it good now do it again at the end of an hour and a half suzy had driven the straight chair roughly a hundred and fifty miles youll do all right said mack take it slow if you can get two miles out of

guys said suzy hell if hazel can go to all the trouble to breakoop sorrythe least we can do is see he gets some good out of it come on nowwhang her through the gears again the evening was as lovely as the day had been the setting sun pinked up the little white caps on the bay and lighted the serious pelicans pounding home to the sea rocks the metal cannery walls seemed a soft and precious platinum docs old car stood in front of western biological its backseat loaded with buckets and pans and nets and crowbars all cannery row was there the patrÃ³n had set out pints of old tennis shoes along the curb faunas hair blazed in the setting sun the girls gave suzy quick little hugs becky was in romantic tears joe elegant looked out his leanto door he thought he would go to rome after his book was published doc held a list in his hand and checked equipment only mack and the boys were missing and here they came down the chicken walk balancing among them the tripod and the long black tube they crossed the track and the lot and they set the tripod down beside the automobile mack cleared his throat friends he said on behalf of i and the boys it gives me pleasure to present doc with this here doc looked at the gifta telescope strong enough to bring the moon to his lap his mouth fell open then he smothered the laughter that rose in him like it said mack its beautiful biggest one in the whole goddam catalogue said mack docs voice was choked thanks he said he paused after all i guess it doesnt matter whether you look down or upas long as you look well put her inside for you said mack give me one of them pints to doc he cried and under his breath he whispered to suzy turn the key now starter the ancient engine roared doc was sipping from a pint clutch outto you and back mack said let in the clutch suzy did the old car deliberately climbed the curb ripped off the stairs of western biological careened into the street and crawled away scattering lumber as it went doc turned in the seat and looked back the disappearing sun shone on his laughing face his gay and eager face with his left hand he held the bucking steering wheel cannery row looked after the ancient car it made the first turn and was gone from sight behind a ware house just as the sun was gone fauna said i wonder if id be safe to put up her gold star tonight what the hells the matter with you mack mack said

the protagonist doc based on edward f ricketts and including in its cast of characters numerous other lightly fictionalized loosely disguised reallife persons the novel is dedicated for ed ricketts who knows why or should on the dedication page of the copy steinbeck presented to ricketts he wrote with all the respect and affection this book implies in his memoir about ed ricketts steinbeck wrote i used the laboratory and ed himself in a book called cannery row i took it to him in typescript to see whether he would resent it and to offer to make any changes he would suggest he read it through carefully smiling and when he had finished he said let it go that way it is written in kindness such a thing cant be bad but it was bad in several ways neither of us foresaw as the book began to be read tourists began coming to the laboratory first a few and then in droves people stopped their cars and stared at ed with that glassy look that is used on movie stars hundreds of people came into the lab to ask questions and peer around pp lvilvii cannery row site of numerous fish canneries fish reduction plants and processing and packing houses along ocean view avenue monterey the street was

fish until midcentury according to a graph in richard f g heimann and john g carlisles the california marine fish catch for and historical review reprinted in michael hemp cannery row in the monterey area sardine catch was a record tons the canning boom driven by world war ii saw monterey become the sardine capital of the world though in around the time of docs discharge from the army the catch was tons p marine scientist ed ricketts studied the sardine extensively during his later career and in his final article on the subject published in the monterey peninsula herald in shortly before his death and reprinted in ricketts breaking through concluded that if conservation had been adopted early enough a smaller but streamlined cannery rowwould be winding up a fairly successful season in

year sweet thursday was published a greatly reduced monterey fleet brought in fiftyeight tons doc marine biologist pioneering ecologist and intellectual polymath edward flanders robb ricketts was the model for steinbecks fictional doc steinbecks portrayal of doc is often biographically accurate regarding rickettss physical gestures and appearance his personal habits and tastes and his cultural interests especially in music literature and philosophy steinbeck embroiders too ricketts attended the university of chicago but never graduated whereas his fictional counterpart holds a phd from that institution the research award doc receives from old jingleballicks in chapter may have been compensation for rickettss failure at winning a guggenheim fellowship in on the other side in order to emphasize docs romantic adventures steinbeck ignores rickettss role as a husband and a father to three children from his marriage to anna nan maker in the couple later separated but were never legally divorced halfchrist and halfgoat steinbeck summed him up in his elegy about ed ricketts itself an exercise in paradox selective memory and impressionism steinbecks eighteenyear relationship with ricketts was profoundly beneficial as richard astro established in john steinbeck and edward f ricketts besides their collaborative book sea of cortez steinbeck drew on rickettss ideas so deeply and so often that after rickettss death in may steinbeck told mutual friends in steinbeck a life in letters wouldnt it be interesting if ed was us and that now there wasnt any such thing or that he created out of his own mind something that went away with him ive wondered a lot about that how much was ed and how much was me and which was which p excellent resources with which to survey the world

never been positively identified by scholars though it is possible he was in some way connected with stanfords hopkins marine station perhaps its onetime director w k fisher who was initially critical of the quality and nature of rickettss scientific work in about ed ricketts steinbeck says only that ricketts hated one professor whom he referred to as old jingleballicks it never developed why he hated old jingleballicks p xviii western biological laboratories docs business was modeled on edward f rickettss pacific biological laboratories cofounded in in pacific grove with albert galigher his former university of chicago roommate in the late s ricketts by then the labs sole owner moved the business to ocean view avenue in monterey later the street was renumbered then renamed with rickettss
