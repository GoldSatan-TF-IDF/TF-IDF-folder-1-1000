purely coincidental while some of the places in this book do exist ive changed them for my own purposes and any resemblance to real places is just an oversight on my part in short the whole thing is a

might want to read it silently the first time through this is doubly important if you are reading this on an airplane part epiphany chapter life will find you santa barbara california while magic powder was sprinkled on the sidewalk outside samuel hunter moved around his office like a machine firing out phone calls checking computer printouts and barking orders to his secretary it was how he began every business day running in machine mode until he left for his first sales appointment and put on the right persona for the prospect people who knew sam found him hardworking intelligent and even likable which is exactly what he wanted them to find he was confident and successful in business but he wore his success with a humility that put people at ease he was tall lean and quick with a smile and people said he was as comfortable in a savile row suit before a boardroom of businessmen as he was lounging in jeans at santa barbaras wharf trading stories and lies with the fishermen in fact the apparent ease with which sam mastered his environment was the single disturbing quality people noticed in him how was it that a guy could play so many roles so well and never seem uncomfortable or out of place something was missing it wasnt that he was a bad guy it was just that you could never get close to him you never got a feel for who he really was which is exactly how sam wanted it he thought a show of desire of passion of anger even would give him away so he suppressed these emotions until he no longer felt them his life was steady level and safe so it happened that on an autumnsoft sunny day not two weeks after his thirtyfifth birthday some twenty years after he had run away from home samuel hunter stepped out of his office onto the sidewalk and was poleaxed by desire he saw a girl loading groceries into an old datsun z that was parked at the curb and to the core of his being sam wanted her later he would recall the details of her appearance a line of muscle on a tan thigh cutoff jeans the undercurve of a breast showing below the half shirt yellow hair tied up haphazardly tendrils escaping to brush high cheekbones and wide brown eyes but her effect on him now was like a long oily saxophone note that started somewhere in that lizard part of the brain where the libido resides and resonated down his body to the tendons in his groin and back into his stomach to form a knot that nearly doubled him over you want her the question came from beside him a mans voice that startled him a bit but not enough for him to tear his eyes from the girl the question came again you want her already off balance sam turned toward the voice then stepped back in surprise a young indian man dressed in black buckskins fringed with red feathers sat on the sidewalk by the office door while sam tried to regain mental ground the indian dazzled a grin and pulled a long dagger from his belt if you want her go get her he said then he flipped the dagger across the sidewalk into the front tire of the girls car there was a thud and a high squealing hiss as the air escaped the tire what was that the girl said she slammed the hatchback and moved to the front of the car sam in a panic looked for the indian who had disappeared and then for the knife which had vanished as well he turned and looked through the glass door into his outer office but the indian wasnt there either i cant believe i manifested this the girl said staring at the flattened tire ive done it again ive manifested failure sams confusion blossomed what are you talking about the girl turned and looked at him for the first time studied him for a second then said every time i get a job i manifest some kind of tragedy that ruins my chances of keeping it but its just a flat tire you cant manifest a flat tire i saw the guy that did this it was sam stopped himself the indian in black had triggered his fears of being found out of going to prison he didnt want to relive the shock it was probably some glass you picked up you cant avoid that sort of thing why would i manifest glass in my tire the question was in earnest she searched sams face for an answer if he had one he lost it in her eyes he couldnt get a grip on how to react to any of this he said the indian do you have a phone she interrupted i have to call work and tell them ill be late i dont have a spare i can give you a ride sam said feeling stupidly proud of himself for being able to speak at all i was just leaving for an appointment my cars around the corner would you do that i have to go all the way to upper state street sam looked at his watch out of habit only hed have driven her to alaska if she had asked no problem he said follow me the girl grabbed a bundle of clothes from the datsun and sam led her around the corner to his mercedes he opened the door for her and tried not to watch her get in whenever he looked at her his mind went blank and he had to thrash around looking for what to do next as he got in the car he caught a glimpse of her brown legs against the black leather seat and forgot for a moment where the ignition slot was he stared at the dashboard and tried to calm himself even as he was thinking this is an accident waiting to happen the girl said do you think that the germans make such good cars to atone for the holocaust what he started to look at her but instead turned his attention to the road no i dont think so why do you ask it doesnt matter i guess i just thought it might bother them i have a leather jacket that i cant wear anymore because when i have it on i have to drive miles out of my way to avoid going by cow pastures not that the cows would want it back zippers are hard for them but they have such beautiful eyes it makes me feel bad these seats are leather arent they vinyl sam said a new kind of vinyl he could smell her scent a mix of jasmine and citrus and it was making driving as difficult as following her conversation he turned the airconditioning on full and concentrated on timing the lights i wish i had calf eyes those long lashes she pulled down the visor and looked in the vanity mirror then bent over until her head was almost at the steering wheel and looked at sam he glanced at her and felt his breath catch in his throat as she smiled she said you have golden eyes thats unusual for someone with such dark skin are you an arab no im i dont know im a mongrel i guess i never met a mongrel before i hear they were great horsemen though my mother used to read me that poem in xanadu did kublai khan a stately pleasure dome decree i dont remember the rest someone told me that the mongrels were like the bikers of their time who told you that this person whos a biker person sam knew there was some reality to grab on to somewhere a position from which he could regain control if only he could get a straight answer do you know where the tangerine tree cafe is on upper state thats where i work just tell me a block or so before we get to it even after twenty years sam found it impossible to distinguish one area of santa barbara from another everything was the same white stucco with red tile roofs the city had been partially destroyed by an earthquake in and since then the city planners had required all commercial buildings to be built in the spanishmoorish style they even dictated the shade of white that buildings were painted the result was a beautifully consistent city with almost no distinctive landmarks sam usually spotted his destination just as he passed it that was it back there the girl said sam pulled the car to the curb ill go around the block she opened the car door thats okay i can jump out here no i dont mind really he didnt want her to go not yet but she was out of the car in an instant she bent back in and offered her hand to shake thanks a lot i work until four ill need a ride back to my car see ya and she was gone leaving sam with his hand still extended and the image of her cleavage burned onto his retinas he sat for a moment trying to catch his breath feeling disoriented grateful and a little relieved as if he had looked up just in time to slam on the brakes and avoid a collision he took his cigarettes from his jacket and shook one out of the pack but when he reached for the lighter he noticed the bundle of clothes still lying on the seat he grabbed the clothes got out of the car and headed down the street to the cafe the doors to the cafe were the big heavy handcarved pseudospanish ironbanded variety common to almost all santa barbara restaurants but once through them the decor was strictly fifties diner sam approached a grayhaired woman in a waitress uniform who was manning the cash register at the head of the long counter he didnt see the girl excuse me he said the girl that just came in here the blonde she left these in my car the woman looked him up and down and seemed surprised at his appearance calliope she said incredulously sam checked his tie for spots his fly for altitude i dont know her name i just gave her a ride to work she had a flat tire oh the woman seemed relieved you didnt look like her type she went to the back to change i guess she wont get far without these the woman took the clothes from him did you want to speak to her she asked no i guess not i guess ill let her get to work its no problem that other guy is waiting for her too the woman nodded down the counter sam followed her gaze to where the indian was sitting smoking a cigarette and blowing the smoke in four directions with each drag he looked up at sam and grinned sam backed away from the counter and through the doors tripping on the step down to the sidewalk almost falling but catching himself on the wroughtiron railing he leaned on the railing feeling as if he had just taken a hard shot to the jaw he shook his head and tried to find some sort of order to what was happening it could be some kind of setup the girl and the indian in it together but how could they know who he was how did the indian get to the cafe so fast and if it was blackmail if they knew about the killing then why be so sneaky about it as he climbed back into the mercedes he tried to shake off the feeling of foreboding that was creeping over him like a night fog hed just met the most beautiful woman he had ever seen and shortly he would see her again he had come to her rescue what better first impression even if he hadnt planned it the indian was a coincidence life was good right he started the car and put it into gear only to realize that he couldnt remember where he was going there had been an appointment when he left the office he drove several blocks trying to remember the appointment and who he was going to be when he got there finally he gave up and pressed the autodialer on his cellular phone as the phone beeped through the numbers to his office it hit him the source of his discomfort the indian had had golden eyes in the time it took for his secretary to answer twenty years of his life of denial and deception was pulled away in a stinging black undertow leaving him feeling helpless and afraid chapter montana medicine drunk crow country montana black cloud follows thundered across the dawn silence of a frostglazed little bighorn basin out of crow agency under highway and into the gravel parking lot of wileys food and gas a ochercolored olds cutlass rattletrap diesel black cloud follows stopped coughed belched and engulfed itself in a greasy black cloud of exhaust when the cloud moved on wafting like a portable eclipse through the golden poplar and ash trees on the little bighorns banks adeline eats stood by the cutlass twisting the baling wire that held the drivers door shut adelines blueblack hair was layered large and lacquered into a flip a hotpink parka over her flannel shirt and overalls added a michelin man concentriccircle symmetry to her oval shape as the cutlass chugged and bucked the thing that refused to die adeline lit a salem took a deep drag then delivered a vicious red reebok kick to black cloud followss fender stop it she said obediently the car fell silent and adeline gave the fender an affectionate pat this old car had been indirectly responsible for getting her a husband six children and a job she couldnt bring herself to be mean to it for long walking around to unlock the back door she noticed something lying in a tuft of frostcovered buffalo grass something also frost covered that looked very much like a body if hes dead she reasoned he can wait until ive made some coffee if he aint hell probably want some she let herself into the store and waddled around turning on lights and unlocking doors then started the coffee and went out to unlock the laundromat another of the cinderblock buildings in the wileys food and gas complex which also included an eightroom motel crunching back through the grass she looked at the body again which hadnt moved but for the frost old man wiley would have been out at dawn setting gopher traps all over the grounds and would have taken care of the body problem he would have also given adeline no end of shit about black cloud follows which he had been doing for fifteen years it had been wiley a white man who had named the car in the first place it was not the crow way to name cars or animals but wiley missed no chance to get in a dig at the people from whom he made his living maybe adeline thought a morning of peace was worth dealing with a body when the coffee was finished she filled two large styrofoam cups one for her and one for the body and poured a generous amount of sugar in each the body had long braids so she assumed he was crow and would probably take sugar if he was alive if he was dead adeline would drink his and she definitely wanted sugar back in the buffalo days the cheyenne prophet sweet medicine had seen a vision of men with hair on their faces who would come bringing a white sand that was poison to indians the prophecy had come true the white sand was sugar and adeline blamed the white man for poisoning her right up to two hundred pounds she took the coffee buttbumped through the back door and crunched through the grass to where the body lay he was facedown and his levi jacket and jeans were crystalline blue with frost adeline nudged him in the ribs with her foot you froze she asked nope the body said into the ground a little dust came up with the steam you hurt nope more dust drunk yep you want coffee adeline sat one of the cups by his head the body she was still thinking of him as the body rolled over and she recognized him as pokey medicine wing the liar creaking pokey sat up and tried to pick up the coffee but couldnt seem to get his frozen hand to work adeline picked up the cup and handed it to him i thought you was dead pokey i might have been just had me a medicine dream as he raised the cup to his lips the shakes set in and he had to bite the edge of the cup to steady it i died twice before you know adeline ignored the lie and pointed to one of his braids which had fallen into his coffee cup pokey pulled the braid out and wiped the beaded band around it on his jacket good coffee he said adeline shook a salem out of her pack and offered it to him thanks he said you gotta offer a prayer after a medicine dream adeline lit his cigarette with a bic lighter im a christian now she said she really hoped he wouldnt use the cigarette to carry a prayer shed only been a christian for a few weeks and the old ways made her a little uncomfortable besides pokey was probably lying through his tooth he had only one about the medicine dream pokey squinted up at her and grinned but did not pray i saw my brother franks boy the one with the yellow eyes who threw that cop off the dam you remember adeline nodded she really didnt want to hear this maybe you should tell a medicine man i am a medicine man pokey said just no one believes me i dont need no one else to tell me about my visions i saw that boy with old man coyote and there was a shade with em that looked like death i got to go to work now adeline said i need to find that boy and warn him pokey said that boys been gone for twenty years hes probably dead you was just dreaming pokey was a liar and adeline knew that there was no reason that she should let his ravings bother her but they did if youre okay i got to go to work you dont believe in medicine then mr wiley will be coming in soon i got to open the store adeline said she turned and started back toward the store is that a screech owl pokey shouted after her adeline dropped her coffee fell into a crouch and scanned the sky in a panic in the old tradition the screech owl was the worst of omens vengeful ghosts lived in screech owls seeing or hearing one was like hearing the sound of your own death adeline was terrified pokey grinned at her i guess not it must just be a hawk adeline recovered and stomped into the store praying to jesus to forgive pokey for his sins but adding to her prayer a request for jesus to beat the shit out of pokey if he had the time chapter the machines of irony bring memory santa barbara after sams secretary gave him the address of his appointment he hung up the cellular phone and punched the address into the navigation system hed had installed in the mercedes so he would always know where he was wherever sam was he was in touch in addition to the cellular phone he wore a satellite beeper that could reach him anywhere in the world he had fax machines and computers in his office and his home as well as a notebooksized computer with a modem that linked him with data bases that could provide him with everything from demographic studies to news clippings about his clients three televisions with cable kept his home alive with news weather and sports and provided insipid entertainments to fill his idle hours and keep him abreast of what was hot and what was not as well as any information he might need to construct a face to meet a face to change his personality to dovetail with that of any prospective client the bygone salesman out riding on a shoeshine and a smile had been replaced by a shapeshifting shark stalking the sale and sam having buried long ago who he really was was an excellent salesman even as some of sams devices connected him to the world others protected him from its harshness alarm systems in his car and condo kept criminals at bay while climate control kept the air comfortable and compact discs soothed away distracting noise a monstrous multiarmed black machine he kept in his spare bedroom simulated the motions of running crosscountry skiing stair climbing and swimming while monitoring his blood pressure and heart rate and making simulated ocean sounds that stimulated alpha waves in the brain and all this without the risk of the shin splints broken legs drowning or confusion that he might have experienced by actually going somewhere and doing something air bags and belts protected him when he was in the car and condoms when he was in women and there were women for the same protean guile that served him as a salesman served him also as a seducer when the women left protesting that he was charming but something was missing there was a number that he could call where someone would be nice to him for a minute sometimes while he was getting his hair cut sitting in the chair with his protections and personalities down the hairdresser would run her hands down his neck and that small human contact sent a lonesome shudder rumbling through him like a heartbreak im here to see mr cable he said to the secretary an attractive woman in her forties sam hunter aaron assurance associates i have an appointment jims expecting you she said sam liked that she used her bosss first name it confirmed the personality profile he had projected sams machines had told him that james cable was one of the two main partners who owned motion marine inc an enormously successful company that manufactured helmets and equipment for industrial deepsea diving cable had been an underwater welder on the rigs off santa barbara before he and his partner an engineer named frank cochran had invented a new fiberglass scuba helmet that allowed divers to stay in radio contact while regulating the highpressure miasma of gases that they breathed the two became millionaires within a year and now ten years later they were thinking of taking the company public cochran wanted to be sure that at least one of the partners could retain controlling interest in the company in the event that the other died sam was trying to write a multimilliondollar policy that would provide buyout capital for the remaining partner it was a simple partnership deal the sort that sam had done a hundred times and cochran the engineer with his mathematical way of thinking his need for precision and order his need to have all the loose ends tied up had been an easy sale with an engineer sam simply presented facts carefully laid out in an equationlike manner that led to the desired answer which was where do i sign engineers were predictable consistent and easy but cable the diver was going to be a pain in the ass cable was a risk taker a gambler any man who had spent ten years of his life working hundreds of feet underwater breathing helium and working with explosive gas had to have come to terms with fear and fear was what sam traded in in most cases the fear was easy to identify it was not the fear of death that motivated sams clients to buy it was the fear of dying unprepared if he did his job right the clients would feel that by turning down a policy they were somehow tempting fate to cause them to die untimely sam had yet to hear of a death considered timely in their minds they created a new superstition and like all superstitions it was based on the fear of irony so the only lottery ticket you lose will be the winning one the one time you leave your drivers license at home is the time you will be stopped for speeding and when someone offers you an insurance policy that only pays you if youre dead you better damn well buy it irony it was a tacit message but one that sam delivered with every sales pitch he walked into jim cables office with the unusual feeling of being totally unprepared maybe it was just the girl who had thrown him or the indian cable was standing behind a long desk that had been fashioned from an old dinghy he was tall with the thin athletic build of a runner and completely bald he extended his hand to sam jim cable frank told me youd be coming but im not sure i like this whole thing sam hunter sam released his hand may i sit this shouldnt take long this was not a good start cable gestured for sam to sit across from him and sat down sam remained standing he didnt want the desk to act as a barrier between them it was too easy for cable to defend do you mind if i move this chair over to your side of the desk i have some materials id like you to see and i need to be beside you you can just leave the materials ill look them over technology had helped sam over this barrier well actually its not printed matter i have it in my computer and i have to be on the same side of the screen as you okay i guess thats fine then cable rolled his chair to the side to allow sam room on the same side of the desk thats one sam thought he moved his chair sat down beside cable and opened the notebook computer well mr cable it looks like we can set this whole thing up without any more than a physical for you and frank whoa cable brought his hands up in protest we havent agreed on this yet oh sam said frank gave me the impression that the decision had been made that this was just a meeting to confirm the tax status and pension benefits of the policy i didnt know there were pension benefits thats why im here sam said it wasnt why he was there at all to explain them to you well frank and i havent gotten down to any specifics on this im not sure its a good idea at all sam needed misdirection he launched into the presentation like a pit bullwilly loman crossbreed as he spoke the computer screen supported his statements with charts graphs and projections every five seconds a message flashed across the screen faster than the eye could see but not so fast that it could not nibble on the lobes of the subconscious like a teasing lover the message was be smart buy this sam had designed the program himself the be smart part of the message could be modified for each client the options were be sexy be young be beautiful be thin be tall and sams personal favorite be god hed come up with the idea one night while watching a commercial in which six heavily muscled guys got to run around on the beach impressing beautiful women presumably because they drank light beer be a stud drink light sam finished his presentation and stopped talking abruptly feeling that he had somehow forgotten something he waited letting the silence become uncomfortable letting the conversation lay on the desk before them like a dead cat letting the diver come to the correct conclusion the first one to speak loses sam knew it he sensed that cable knew it finally jim cable said this is a great little computer you have would you consider selling it sam was thrown but what about the policy i dont think its a good idea cable said but i really like this computer i think it would be smart to buy it smart sam said yeah i just think it would be a smart thing to do so much for subliminal advertising sam made a mental note to change his message to be smart buy the policy look jim you can get a computer like this in a dozen stores in town but this partnership policy is set up for right now you are never going to be younger youll never be in better health the premium will never be lower or the tax advantage better but i dont need it my family is taken care of and i dont care who takes control of the company after im dead if frank wants to take a policy out on me ill take the physical but im not betting against myself on this there it was cable was not afraid and sam knew no way to instill the fear he needed he had read that cable had survived several diving accidents and even a helicopter crash while being shuttled to one of the offshore rigs if he hadnt glimpsed his mortality before then nothing sam could say would put the reaper in his shaving mirror it was time to walk away and salvage half of the deal with cables partner sam stood and closed the screen on the computer well jim ill talk to frank about the specifics of the policy and set up the appointment for the physical they shook hands and sam left the office trying to analyze what had gone wrong again and again the fear factor came up why couldnt he find and touch that place in jim cable granted his concentration had been shot by the mornings events really hed done a canned presentation to cover himself but to cover what this was a clean deal cut and dried when he climbed back into the mercedes there was a red feather lying on the seat he brushed it out onto the street and slammed the door he drove back to his office with the air conditioner on high still when he arrived ten minutes later his shirt was soaked with sweat chapter moments are our mentors santa barbara there are those days those moments in life when for no particular reason the senses are heightened and the commonplace becomes sublime it was one of those days for samuel hunter the appearance of the girl the wanting she had awakened in him had started it then the indians presence had so confused him that he was fumbling through the day marveling at things that before had never merited a second look walking back into his outer office he spied his secretary gabriella snow and was awed for a moment by just how tremendously how incredibly how childfrighteningly ugly she was there are those who deprived of physical beauty develop a sincerity and beauty of spirit that seems to eclipse their appearance they marry for love stay married and raise happy children who are quick to laugh and slow to judge gabriella was not one of those people in fact if not for her gruesome appearance an unpleasant personality would have been her dominant feature she was good on the phone however and sams clients were sometimes so relieved to be out of her office and into his that they bought policies out of gratitude so he kept her on hed hired her three years ago from the resume she had mailed in she was wildly overqualified for the position and sam remembered wondering why she was applying for it in the first place for three years sam had breezed by her desk without really looking at her but today in his unbalanced state her homeliness inspired him to poetry but what rhymed with gabriella she said mr aaron is very anxious to talk to you mr hunter he requested that you go right into his office as soon as you arrived gabriella youve been here three years you can call me sam sam was still thinking about poetry salmonella thank you mr hunter but i prefer to keep things businesslike mr aaron was quite adamant about seeing you immediately gabriella paused and checked a notepad on her desk then read tell him to get his ass in my office as soon as he hits the door or ill have him ratfucked with a tire iron what does that mean sam asked i would assume that he would like to see you right away sir i guessed that sam said im a little vague on the ratfucked part what do you think gabriella gabriella gabriella as fair as salmonella im sure i dont know you might ask him right sam said he walked down the hall to aaron aarons outer office composing the next line of his poem along the way it wouldnt surprise me in the least if you were mistaken for a beast aaron aaron wasnt aarons real name he had changed it so his insurance firm would be the first listed in the yellow pages sam didnt know aarons real name and he had never asked who was he to judge samuel hunter wasnt his real name either and it was certainly less desirable alphabetically aarons secretary julia a willowy actressmodeldancer who typed answered phones and referred to hairdressers as geniuses greeted sam with a smile that evinced thousands in orthodontia and bonding hi sam hes really pissed what did you do do yeah on that motion marine deal they called a few minutes ago and aaron went off i didnt do anything sam said he started into aarons office then turned to julia julia do you know what ratfuck means no aaron just said that he was going to do it to you for sucking the joy out of his new head he got a new head whats this one a wild boar he shot last year the taxidermist delivered it this morning thanks julia ill be sure to notice it good luck julia smiled then held the smile while she checked herself in the makeup mirror on her desk walking into aarons office was like stepping into a nineteenthcentury british hunt club walnut paneling adorned with the stuffed heads of a score of game animals numbered prints of ducks on the wing leather wingback chairs a cherrywood desk clear of anything that might indicate that a business was being conducted sam immediately spotted the boars head aaron its beautiful sam stood in front of the head with his arms outstretched its a masterpiece he considered genuflecting to appeal to the latent irish catholic in aaron but decided that the insincerity would be spotted aaron short fifty balding face shot with veins from drink swiveled in his highbacked leather chair and put down the vogue magazine he had been leafing through aaron had no interest in fashion it was the models that interested him sam had spent many an afternoon listening to aarons forlorn daydreams of having a showpiece wife how was i to know that katie would get fat and i would get successful i was only twenty when we got married i thought the idea of getting laid steadily was worth it i need a woman that goes with my jag not katie shes pure rambler here he would point to an ad in vogue now if i could only have a woman like that on my arm shed have you surgically removed sam would say sure be that way sam you dont know what its like to think that getting a little strange could cost you half of what you own you single guys have it all stop romanticizing aaron havent you heard sex kills sure suck the joy out of my fantasies you know i used to look forward to sex because it was fifteen minutes when i didnt have to think about death and taxes if you do think about death and taxes it lasts half an hour thats what i mean i cant even get distracted with katie anymore do you know what someone with my income has to pay in taxes the question came up in every one of their conversations they had worked together for almost twenty years and aaron always treated sam as if he were still fifteen years old i know exactly what someone with your income is supposed to pay in taxes about ten times what you actually pay and you dont think that that weighs on me the irs could take all this sam rather liked the vision of a team of irs agents loading large dead animal heads into aarons jag and driving off with antlers out every window while katie stood by shouting hey half of those are mine no matter how much aaron attained he would never let go of his fear of losing it long enough to enjoy it in his minds eye sam imagined aaron mournfully watching as they carried the wild boar head out by the tusks this thing is gorgeous sam said i think im getting a woody just looking at it i named it gabriella aaron said proudly forgetting for a moment that he was supposed to be angry then he remembered what the fuck did you just pull over at motion marine frank cochran is talking lawsuit over a little subliminal advertising i dont think so subliminal advertising jim cable fainted after that stunt you pulled they dont even know what happened yet it could be a heart attack are you out of your fucking mind i could lose the agency over this sam could see aarons blood pressure rising red on his scalp you thought it was a great idea last week when i showed it to you dont drag me into this sam youre on your own with this one ive pulled some shit in my time to push the fear factor but i never had a client attacked by an indian for christs sake indian sam almost choked he lowered himself very gently into one of the leather wingbacks what indian dont bullshit me sam i taught you everything you know about bullshitting right after you left his office jim cable walked out of the motion marine building and was attacked by a guy dressed up as an indian with a tomahawk if they catch the guy and he tells that you hired him its over for both of us sam tried to speak but could find no breath to drive his voice aaron had been his teacher and in a twisted competitive way aaron was his friend and confidant but he had never trusted aaron with his fears he had two indians and cops indians because he was one and if anyone found out it it would lead to policemen one of whom he had killed here they were after twenty years paralyzing him aaron came around the desk and took sam by the shoulders youre smarter than this kid he said softening at sams obvious confusion i know this was a big deal but you know better than to do something desperate like that you cant let them see that youre hungry thats the first rule i taught you isnt it sam didnt answer he was looking at the mule deer head mounted over aarons desk but he was seeing the indian sitting in the cafe grinning at him aaron shook him look were not totally screwed here we can draw up an agreement signing all your interest in the agency over to me and backdate it to last week then you would be working as an independent contractor like the other guys i could give you say thirty cents on the dollar for your shares under the table youd have enough to fight the good fight in court and if they let you keep your license youll always have a job to come back to what do you say sam stared at the deer head hearing aarons voice only as a distant murmur sam was twentysix years and twelve hundred miles away on a hill outside of crow agency montana the voice he was hearing was that of his first teacher his mentor his fathers brother his clan uncle a singletoothed selfproclaimed shaman named pokey medicine wing chapter the gift of a dream crow country sam then called samson hunts alone stood over the carcass of the mule deer he had just shot cradling the heavy winchester in his arms did you thank the deer for giving its life up for you pokey asked as samsons clan uncle it was pokeys job to teach the boy the ways of the crow i thanked him pokey you know it is the crow way to give your first deer away do you know who you will give it to pokey grinned around the salem he held between his lips no i didnt know who should i give it to it is a good gift for a clan uncle who has said many prayers for your success in finding a spirit helper on your vision quest i should give it to you then it is up to you but a carton of cigarettes is a good gift too if you have the money i dont have any money i will give you the deer samson hunts alone sat down on the ground by the deer carcass and hung his head he sniffed to fight back tears pokey kneeled beside him are you sad for killing the deer no i dont see why i have to give it away why cant i take it home and let grandma cook it for all of us pokey took the rifle from the boy levered a cartridge into the chamber then let out a war whoop and fired it into the air samson stared at him as if hed lost his mind you are a hunter now pokey cried samson hunts alone has killed his first deer he shouted to the sky soon he will be a man pokey crouched down to the boy again you should be happy to give the deer away you are crow and it is the crow way sam looked up his golden eyes shot with red and brimming with tears one of the boys at school says that the crow are no more than thieves and scavengers he said that the crow are cowards because we never fought the white man this boy is cheyenne pokey said yes then he is jealous because he is not crow the crow gave the cheyenne and the lakota and the blackfoot a reason to get up in the morning they outnumbered us ten to one and we held our land against them for two hundred years before the white man came tell this boy that his people should thank the crow for being such good enemies then kick his ass but he is bigger than me if your medicine is strong you will beat him when you go on your fast next week pray for warrior medicine samson didnt know what to say he would go to the wolf mountains next week for his first vision quest he would fast and pray and hope to find a spirit helper to give him medicine but he wasnt sure he believed and he didnt know how to tell pokey pokey the boy said finally very quietly his voice barely audible over the hot breeze whistling through the prairie grass a lot of people say that you dont have no medicine at all that you are just a crazy drunk pokey put his face so close to samsons that the boy could smell the cigaretteandliquor smell coming off him then softly in a gentle musical rasp he said theyre right i am a crazy drunk the others are afraid of me cause im so crazy you know why sam sniffed nope pokey reached into his pocket and pulled out a small buckskin bundle tied with a thong he untied the thong and unfolded the buckskin on the ground before the boy in it lay an array of sharp teeth claws a tuft of tan fur some loose tobacco sweet grass and sage the largest object was a wooden carving of a coyote about two inches tall do you know what this is samson pokey asked looks like a medicine bundle aint you supposed to sing a song when you open it dont have to with this one nobody ever had medicine like this i aint never showed it to anyone before what are those teeth coyote teeth coyote claws coyote fur i dont tell people about it anymore because they all say im crazy but my spirit helper is old man coyote hes just in stories sam said there isnt any old man coyote thats what you think pokey said he came to me on my first fast when i was about your age i didnt know it was him i thought it would be a bear or an otter because i was praying for war medicine but on the fourth day of my fast i looked up and there was this young brave standing there dressed in black buckskins with red woodpecker feathers down his leggings and sleeves he was wearing a coyote skin as a headdress how did you know it wasnt just somebody from the res i didnt i told him to go away and he said that he had been away long enough he said that when he gave the crows so many enemies he promised that he would always be with them so they could steal many horses and be fierce warriors he said it was almost time to come back but where is he samson asked that was a long time ago and no one has seen him if he was here they wouldnt say you were crazy old man coyote is the trickster i think he gave me this medicine to make me crazy and make me want to drink pretty eagle who was a powerful medicine man then told me how to make this bundle and he told me that if i was smart i would give it to someone else or throw it in the river but i didnt do it but if it is bad medicine if he is your spirit helper and doesnt help you does the sun rise just for you samson hunts alone no it rises all over the world but it passes you and makes you part of its circle doesnt it yeah i guess so well maybe this medicine is bigger than me maybe i am just part of the circle if it makes me unhappy then at least i know why i am unhappy do you know why you are unhappy my deer there will be other deer you have your family you are good in school you have food to eat you have water to drink you can even speak crow when i was a boy they sent me off to a bia school where they beat us if we spoke crow next week if your heart is pure you will get a spirit helper and have strong medicine you can be a great warrior a chief there arent any chiefs anymore it will be a long time before you are old enough to be a chief you are too little to be unhappy about the future but i am i dont want to be crow i dont want to be like you then be like you pokey turned away from the boy and lit another cigarette you make me angry give me your knife and i will show you how to dress this deer we will throw the entrails in the river as a gift to the earth and the water monsters pokey looked at samson as if waiting for the boy to doubt him im sorry pokey the boy unsnapped the sheath on his belt and drew a wickedly curved skinning knife he held it out to the man who took the knife and began to fielddress the deer as he drew the blade down the deers stomach he said i am going to give you a dream samson samson looked away from the deer into pokeys face there were always gifts among the crow gifts for names sun dance ceremony gifts powwow gifts at crow fair naming ceremony gifts gifts for medicine gifts to clan uncles and aunts gifts for prayers tobacco and sweet grass and shirts and blankets horses and trucks so many gifts that no one could ever really be poor and no one ever really got rich but the gift of a dream was very pure very special and could never be repaid samson had never heard anyone give a dream before i dreamed that old man coyote came to me and he said pokey when everything is right with you but you are so afraid that something might go wrong that it ruins your balance then you are coyote blue at these times i will bring you back into balance this dream that i dreamed i give to you samson what does that mean uncle pokey i dont know but it is a very important dream pokey wiped the knife on his pants and handed it to samson then hoisted the deer up on his shoulders now who are you going to give this deer to chapter a malady of medicine santa barbara look sam aaron said i can see that youre not thrilled about the buyout so be it i understand that youve put a lot into this agency i can give you forty cents on the dollar but youll have to take a note im a little cash poor since katie made me put that trophy room on the house sam looked down from the deer head aaron i didnt hire an indian to attack jim cable i still had half of the deal wrapped up with cochran which would have put me in the door at any time in the future to close cable i wouldnt have jeopardized that aaron took two hand mirrors out of his desk drawer and began to juxtapose them to get a glimpse of the back of his head sam was used to this it was aarons hourly balding check cochrans secretary saw the indian get out of your car aaron said matteroffactly then looking back to the mirrors he said ive been mixing minoxidil with a little retin a and that stuff the man from uncle sells on tv do you think its working sam thought of the feather on the car seat he was sure hed locked the car there was no way the indian could get in without setting off the alarm i dont care what anyone saw i didnt hire the fucking indian to attack cable and i cant believe you bought their story without asking me the anger felt good it cleared his head a little aaron put the mirrors down on the desk and smiled i didnt buy it sam but if it was true you cant blame me for taking a shot at your shares you greedy little fuck sam aaron lowered his voice and took his fatherly tone samuel a little wink sammy hasnt my greed always been in your best interest im just trying to keep you sharp son would you have had any respect for me if i hadnt tried to make the best of a bad situation thats the first thing i taught you i dont know any indian it didnt happen aaron if you say it didnt it didnt youve always been straight with me i dont even remember the time you cut all the cords off those smoke alarms we were selling because that lady wanted cordless models you told me to do that i was only seventeen years old right well how was i to know she smoked in bed look aaron ill find out what happened at motion marine and take care of it first thing in the morning if they call back while im out try not to sign a confession for me okay ive had an incredibly shitty day and ive got to meet someone on upper state street in a few minutes so if thats all you really like the new head normally sam would have lied but with so many questions filling his head his highly developed lying center seemed to have shut down it sucks aaron it sucks and i think you should sue the man from uncle he walked out as aaron was snatching up his hand mirrors gabriella was just hanging up the phone when sam walked in that was the security director from your condominium association mr hunter hed like to talk to you right away the association is holding an emergency meeting tonight to discuss what they are going to do about your dog i dont have a dog he was very upset i have his number but he insisted upon seeing you in person before the she checked her notepad lynch mob gets hold of you call him back and tell him that i dont have a dog dogs arent allowed in the complex he mentioned that sir that seems to be the problem he said that your dog was on your back patio howling and refused to let anyone get near it and if you didnt get up there he would have to call the police all sam could think was not today he said all right call them and tell them im on my way and call the garage down the street and have them come up and fix the flat tire on that orange datsun out front have them bill it to my card you have a three oclock appointment with mrs wittingham cancel it sam started out of the office mr hunter this is a death claim mr wittingham passed away last week and she wants you to help fill out the papers gabriella let me clue you in on something once the client is dead we can afford to be a little lax on the service the chance of repeat business is well unlikely so reschedule the appointment or handle it yourself but sir ive never done a death claim before its easy feel for a pulse if there isnt one give them the money i am not amused mr hunter i try to maintain a businesslike manner around here and you continually undermine me handle it gabriella call the garage i have to go it was only five minutes from sams office to his condo in the cliffs a threehundredunit complex on santa barbaras mesa from sams back deck he could look across the city to the santa lucia mountains and from his bedroom window he could see the ocean sam had once rented the apartment but when the cliffs went condo ten years before he optioned to buy it since then the value of his apartment had increased six hundred percent the complex offered three swimming pools saunas a weight room and tennis courts it was restricted to adults without children or dogs but cats were allowed when sam first moved in the cliffs had a reputation as a swinging singles complex a party mecca now after the rise in real estate prices and the death of the middle class most of the residents were retirees or wealthy professional couples and the cooperative agreement they all signed set strict limitations on noise and numbers of visitors a team of security guards patrolled the complex in golf carts twentyfour hours a day under the supervision of a hardnosed exburglar named josh spagnola sam parked the mercedes by spagnolas office in the back of the cliffs clubhouse which with its terracotta courtyards stucco arches and wroughtiron gates looked more like the casa grande of a spanish hacienda than a meeting place for condo dwellers the door to the office was open and sam walked in to find spagnola shouting into the phone sam had never heard the wiry security chief shout this was a bad sign no i cant just shoot the damn dog the owner is on the way but im not going into his townhouse and shooting his dog rules or no rules sam noticed that even in anger spagnola remembered to use the word townhouse to refer to the apartment no one wanted to pay a halfmillion dollars for an apartment a townhouse was another thing people were touchy about how one referred to their homes when sam was selling to people who lived in trailers he always referred to them as mobile estates the term added a certain structural integrity you never heard on the news of a tornado touching down and ripping the shit out of a park full of mobile estates i am listening dr epstein spagnola continued but you dont seem to understand my position on you missing your nap i dont give a desiccated damn i dont give a reconstituted damn i dont give a creamed damn on toast i dont give a damn im not entering mr hunters home until he arrives spagnola looked up and gestured for sam to sit then he grinned mimed a mimic of the caller he was listening to looked bored feigned falling asleep gestured the international sign language for being jerked off then said is that so doctor well as far as i know i have no superiors since the crucifixion so give it your best shot he slammed down the phone sam said got something on dr epstein spagnola smiled hes porking the cliffs highly ethical mondaywednesdayfriday masseuse everybodys porking her no everybodys porking the tuesdaythursdaysaturday masseuse mondaywednesdayfriday is very exclusive and highly ethical says so in the brochure spagnola grinned then casually picked up a legal pad from his desk and looked it over samuel my friend your puppy has kept me on the phone with charming folks like epstein all day shall i read you the log i dont know what youre talking about josh i dont have a dog then you will want to notify security about the large canine that is currently on your back deck disturbing dr epsteins nap im not kidding josh if theres a dog on my deck i dont know anything about it sam suddenly remembered that hed left the sliding door to the deck open christ yes the door is open ive told you about that before its an invitation to burglars that deck is twenty feet off the ground how did a dog get up there how did it get in my apartment without setting off the alarm i was wondering that same thing if it isnt your dog how did it get up there it looks bad the other association members are having an emergency meeting tonight to discuss the problem there isnt a problem lets just go get the damn dog and take it to the pound yes lets ill read the log to you while we walk over spagnola rose picked up the legal pad and led sam out the door then paused locked the office and set the alarm cant trust anyone he said they walked brick paths shaded with arbors of pink and red bougainvillea while spagnola read nine am mrs feldstein calls to report that a wolf has just urinated on her wisterias i ignored that one nine ohfive mrs feldstein reports that the wolf is forcibly having sex with her persian cat i went on that call myself just to see it nine ten mrs feldstein reports that the wolf ate the persian after having his way with it there was some blood and fur on her walk when i got there but no wolf is this thing a wolf sam asked i dont think so ive only seen it from below your deck it has the right coloring for a coyote but its too damn big naw it cant be a wolf you sure you didnt bring home some babe last night who forgot to tell you that she had a furry friend in the car please josh okay ten fourteen mrs narada reports that her cat has been attacked by a large dog now i send all the boys out looking but they dont find anything until eleven then one of them calls in that a big dog has just bitten holes in the tires on his golf cart and run off eleven thirty dr epstein makes his first lostnap call dog howling eleven thirtyfive mrs norcross is putting the kids out on the deck for some burgers when a big dog jumps over the rail eats the burgers growls at the kids runs off first mention of lawsuit kids weve got her right there sam said kids arent allowed her grandkids are visiting from michigan she filed the proper papers spagnola took a deep breath and started into the log again eleven fortyone large dog craps in dr yamatas aston martin twelve ohthree dog eats two count em two of mrs wittinghams siamese cats she just lost her husband last week this sort of put her over the edge we had to call dr yamata in off the putting green to give her a sedative the personalinjury lawyer in the unit next to hers was home for lunch and he came over to help he was talking class action then and we didnt even know who owned the dog yet you still dont spagnola ignored sam from twelve thirty to one we had mass sightings and frequent urinations i wont bore you with details then one of my guys spotted the dog and followed it to your building where it disappeared for a minute and reappeared on your deck disappeared josh arent you screening these guards for drug use i think he meant that he lost sight of it anyway its been on your deck for a couple of hours and all the residents are convinced that its your dog they want to boot you out of the complex they cant do that i own the place technically sam they can you own shares in the whole complex and in the event of a twothirds vote by the residents they can force you to sell your shares for what you paid for them its in the agreement you signed i looked it up they were about a hundred yards from sams building and sam could now hear the howling that apartments worth five times what i paid for it it is on the open market but not to the other residents dont worry about it sam its not your dog right right outside sams front door thirty of his neighbors were waiting talking in heated tones and glancing around there he is one shouted pointing toward sam and spagnola for a moment sam was grateful that spagnola was at his side and at spagnolas side was a special the exburglar leaned to sam and whispered dont say anything not a word this could get ugly i see at least two lawyers in that bunch spagnola raised his hands and walked toward the crowd folks i know youre angry but we need mr hunter alive if were going to deal with the problem thanks sam said under his breath no charge spagnola said it never occurred to them to kill you now theyll be embarrassed and go home lynchings are so politically incorrect you know spagnola stopped and waited sam stayed beside him as if the security chief had choreographed it the people in front of sams door began to look around avoiding eye contact with one another then shuffled off heads down in different directions youre amazing sam said to spagnola nope its just that for a lot of years my living depended on the predictability of the professional class now it depends on the predictability of the criminal class same skills less risk you want me to go in first you have the gun okay you wait here spagnola unlocked the door and palmed it open slowly when the door was open just enough for him to pass the thin security guard snaked through the opening and closed the door behind him sam noticed that the howling had stopped he put his ear to the door and listened forgetting for a moment that he had installed a soundproof fire door a few minutes passed before the latch clicked and spagnola poked his head out well sam said how attached are you to that leather sofa its insured sam said why did he tear it up is he in there hes in here but i was wondering if you had some sort of well sentimental attachment to the sofa no why whats going on spagnola threw the door open and stepped out of the way sam looked through the foyer into the sunken living room where a large tan dog had his teeth dug into the arm of the leather sofa and was humping away on it like a furry jackhammer josh shoot that animal sam i know how you feel you go through life thinking that youre the only one then you walk in on something like this its a blow to the ego just shoot the damn dog josh cant do it california law clearly states that a firearm may only be discharged in city limits in cases of imminent physical danger doesnt say a word about protecting the honor of someones couch sam ran down the steps into the living room but as he approached the dog turned and growled at him the dog laid its ears back against its head narrowed its golden eyes and still growling began to back sam into the corner of the living room josh does this qualify as imminent physical danger please say yes getting there spagnola said very calmly as he drew his weapon dont let him see youre afraid sam dogs can sense fear this isnt a dog this is a coyote this is a wild animal josh sam was flattened against the fiftytwoinch screen of his television and was still pushing so that the television was tilting back ready to fall he could smell a foul musky odor coming off the animal shoot it please now please quiet sam im aiming you cant shoot them in the head they need that to see if its rabid coyotes arent normally aggressive i saw it on pbs this one didnt see the program josh shoot him it might take two shots to drop him if he leaps cover your throat until i get the second one into him spagnola fired and the tv shattered behind sam the coyote stood its ground unaffected sam backpedaled over the destroyed television as spagnola fired again taking out a vase on the mantel the coyote looked at spagnola quizzically the third shot shattered the sliding glass door the fourth and fifth punctured a stereo speaker and the sixth ricocheted off the fireplace and out over the city when spagnolas revolver clicked on an empty chamber he turned and bolted out the front door sam climbed off the broken television and braced for the coyotes attack his ears rang with residual gunfire but he could hear laughing from across the room the coyote was gone but sitting on his couch dressed in black buckskins trimmed with red feathers was the indian his head thrown back in laughter hey sam shouted what are you doing in an instant the indian leapt up and ran through the shattered glass door onto the deck he looked over his shoulder and grinned at sam before vaulting over the railing and dropping out of sight sam ran to the deck and looked over the rail the indian was gone but he could hear his cackling laugh echoing down the canyon into town sam stumbled back from the rail and into the house where he sat down on the couch and cradled his head in his hands there had to be an explanation someone was screwing with his life he riffled through his past as far as he would allow himself looking for enemies he might have made they were there competing salesmen angry customers angrier women dotting his life like dandelions on a lawn but none would have gone to such elaborate measures to cause him trouble in an honest assessment of himself he realized that he had never really been passionate enough about anything to really make that big a difference to anyone good or bad since hed run from the reservation he couldnt afford the high profile of passionate behavior still there had to be an answer somewhere sam thought about prayer then faith then remembered something that lay tucked away in the back of his sock drawer he ran up the stairs to his bedroom and threw open the drawer he removed a small buckskin bundle and untied the thong that held it together objects he had not seen in twenty years teeth claws fur and sweet grass braids spilled out on the dresser among them lay a red feather that he had never seen before sam looked at the coyote medicine and began to tremble coyote makes the world a long time ago there was water everywhere old man coyote looked around and said hey we need some land it was his gift from the great spirit that he could command all of the animals which were called the without fires clan so he called four ducks to help him find land he ordered each of the ducks to dive under the water and find some mud the first three returned with nothing but the fourth duck because four is the sacred number and that is the way things go in these stories returned with some mud from the bottom swell said old man coyote now i will make some land he made the mountains and the rivers the prairies and the deserts the plants and the animals then he said guess ill make some people now so there will be someone to tell stories about me from the mud he made some tall and beautiful people old man coyote liked them very much i will call them absarokee which means children of the largebeaked bird someday some dumb white guys will come here and get the translation all wrong and call them crow what are they going to eat one of the ducks asked they have no feathers or fur what will they cover themselves with asked a second duck yes said a third duck theyre pretty but they wont be able to stay out in the weather old man coyote thought for a while about how much he disliked ducks then he took some more mud and made a strangelooking animal with a thick coat and horns here he said they can get everything they need from this animal ill call it a buffalo the fourth duck had been standing by watching all this and smoking a cigarette its a big animal your people wont be able to catch it he said blowing a long stream of blue smoke in old man coyotes face okay so heres another animal that they can ride so they can catch the buffalo and how will they catch that one asked the fourth look duck do i have to work out everything i made the world and these people and ive given them everything they need so just back off but if they have everything they need what will they do just sit around telling stories about you that would be good boring said the duck ill make them a bunch of enemies theyll be hopelessly outnumbered and have to fight all the time and do all kinds of war rituals hows that theyll get wiped out no ill stay with them the children of the largebeaked bird will be my favorites although some of their enemies can tell stories about me too but what if the buffalo animals all get killed wont happen theres too many of them but what if they do then i guess the people are fucked im tired and dirty and cold from standing in all that water im going to invent the sweat bath and warm up so old man coyote built a sweat lodge out of willow branches and buffalo skins he heated the rocks in a fire and put them in a pit in the middle of the sweat lodge then he and the ducks crawled inside and closed the door making it completely dark inside hey put out that cigarette old man coyote said to the fourth duck the duck threw the cigarette on the hot rocks and smoke filled the lodge that smells pretty good old man coyote said lets throw some other stuff on the fire and see how it goes he threw on some cedar needles and they smelled pretty good too then he threw on some sweet grass and some sage this stuff will be part of the sweat ceremony too and some water we need some water so it will really get hot and miserable in here and we can get truly purified and clean asked the third duck right said old man coyote first ill pour four dippers of water on the rocks for the four directions and the four ducks right said old man coyote now ill pour on seven dippers for the seven stars of the big dipper then ten more because ten is a nice even number he handed each of the ducks a willow switch to beat their backs with here wail on yourself with these what for asked the second duck tenderize er i mean it brings up the sweat and purifies you then when the ducks were beating their backs with the willow branches old man coyote said okay now im going to pour a whole bunch of dippers on the rocks im not even going to count but we are going to be really hot and really clean and pure then he poured and poured until it was so hot in the lodge that he could not stand it and he slipped out the door leaving the ducks inside later after he had plunged into the river to cool off he ate a big meal and laid down to rest that was plumb swell he said to himself i think ill give the sweat to my new people it can be their church and sacrament and they can think of me whenever they go in it is my gift to them i guess no one really needs to know about the ducks then old man coyote picked up a willow twig and picked a bit of duck meat from between his teeth the sage gives them a nice flavor though chapter the children of the largebeaked bird crow country samson hunts alone sat on a bench by the sweat lodge behind his grandmas house watching as pokey carried the hot rocks with a pitchfork from the fire to the pit in the sweat lodge samson was supposed to be paying attention to the ritual that pokey was performing and preparing himself to pray to the great spirit to bring him good medicine on his fast but more than anything he wanted to be inside with the little kids and the women watching bonanza on television grandma had cooked up a big batch of fry bread for the meal after the sweat and samsons stomach growled when he thought about it pokey straining under a pitchfork full of redhot rocks said cant nobody cross my path between the fire and the sweat during the first four trips uncle harlan who was sitting next to samson let out a sarcastic snicker pokey looked up at him his brow lowered in reproach the boys have to learn harlan pokey said harlan nodded on the other side of samson sat his two older cousins harry and festus thirteen and fourteen who had been through the sweat for purification and prayer for their success on the basketball court at hardin junior high school they had come the fifteen miles down to crow agency with harlan their father to participate in samsons sweat uncle harlan didnt believe in the old ways he often said that he didnt want his boys to grow up with their heads full of ideas that didnt work in the modern world still because of the obligations he felt to his family he often drove down for sweats participated in ritual gift giving and never missed the sun dance in june he lived in hardin north of the reservation where he rebuilt truck engines during the day and drank hard in the bars at night he fought often and lost seldom when he was drinking with uncle pokey the two of them lying on the bed of pokeys pickup staring into the limitless stars of montanas big sky passing a bottle of dickel sour mash between them harlan would talk of his time in vietnam of the two brothers he lost there and of the warrior blood that was part of the hunts alone family pokey would answer harlans painful pride with parables and mystical references until harlan could stand it no longer damn it pokey can your medicine fix a cummins diesel can it fill out a tax form can it get you a job fuck medicine fuck fasting fuck the sun dance if i thought i could do it id take joan and the kids and go a thousand miles from here youd be back pokey would say then the two of them would lie there drinking in silence for long minutes before one of them would bring up basketball hunting or truck engines some topic safe and far away from harlans anger some of those nights samson would crawl out of his cot sneak past the six cousins that slept in his room and out into the yard where he would lie by the wheel of the old truck and listen to the two men talk harlan was the only adult samson knew who would talk about the dead so the boy would lie there with his face against the cold grass hoping to hear something about his father or his mother but mostly he heard about his two uncles dead in the jungles or his grandfather who died piece by piece in a white hospital of diabetes his father had died too young to leave many stories or a strong ghost not that harlan would admit to believing in ghosts if im haunted he would tell pokey its not by my unrevenged brothers its by you and your backassward ways after time and hangovers passed samson would ask pokey about harlan and always get the same answer poor harlan he is out of balance i should dance for him at the sun dance it was no answer samson remained confused samson watched as harlan rose from the bench and undressed for the sweat he was tall and lean his skin deep redbrown in the firelight his eyes and hair black as an obsidian arrowhead pure crow brave but as samson undressed he wondered why his uncle seemed so unhappy with his heritage he treated his crow blood like a curse while pokey seemed to see it as a blessing they were half brothers sharing the same mother belonging to her clan growing up in the same house why were they so different why did neither one seem to be able to live comfortably in his own skin naked they all entered the low dome of the sweat lodge and sat in a circle around its perimeter pokey placed a bucket of water by the fire pit then he pulled down the door flap he added sweet grass and cedar to the hot rocks and fragrant smoke filled the lodge as he sang a prayer song his prayers were in english which samson knew embarrassed him some pokey like grandma had gone to a boarding school run by the bia where indians were forbidden to speak or learn their own language or religion in this way the bia hoped that the native american culture would disappear into the larger white culture assimilated harlan on the other hand was ten years younger than pokey and like samson had been taught crow in school as part of the bias move to preserve indian culture pokey poured four dippers of water onto the rocks and samson lowered his face to avoid the steam as pokey sang samson let his mind wander to the ponderosa he would like to live on that big ranch in that big house and have his own room and two guns like little joe cartwright until grandma had taken all their per capita money a year ago and bought the big blackandwhite television at the kmart in billings samson thought that everyone lived in a small house with twenty cousins and five or six aunts and uncles and their grandma everyone on the reservation seemed to before the television arrived samson did not know he was poor now he spent every evening piled in the front room with his family watching people he did not know do things he did not understand in places he could not fathom while the commercials told him that he should be just like those people none of those people ever took a sweat pokey had poured the seven dippers and the sweat lodge was so hot that samsons mind went white he lay down on the floor to breathe some cooler air someone lifted his head and asked him if he was okay he answered yes and passed out water was being splashed on his face samson came to and realized that he was being held in harlans strong arms we did a naming ceremony for you samson harlan said from now on you shall be called squats behind the bush and you owe each of us a carton of cigarettes and a new ford truck samson saw that harlan was grinning at him and he smiled back if i dont take the name do i have to give you the gifts harlan laughed and set the boy on his feet by a fiftyfivegallon drum where harry and festus were pouring dippers of water over their heads after they were dried off and redressed pokey moved the rocks out of the pit and replaced them with hot ones from the fire so the women could take their sweat pokey finished and led them into the house which was surprisingly quiet the little kids were in bed and the women filed out to the sweat silently as soon as the men entered the cheap formica table was set with five plastic bowls around a big pot of venisonandcabbage stew and a basket of fry bread harlan poured them all coffee from a big black urn on the counter while pokey dished up the stew samson attacked a piece of fry bread and was tearing away at its stretchy donutlike crust when harlan sat down next to him and said so squats behind the bush what are you gonna do tomorrow if you see old man coyote in your vision like your uncle pokey did festus and harry giggled samson answered the sarcasm in earnest pokeys the only one with coyote medicine pretty eagle said so good thing too harlan said some of us have to live in the real world harlan pokey shouted let it go its gone harlan said its as gone as can be pokey they finished their meal in silence samson wondering what harlan meant by its gone later as he fell asleep listening to the soft breathing of his cousins he imagined himself living on the ponderosa sleeping in his own room herding cattle on his own black horse carrying two shiny sixguns practicing his fastdraw and always staying on the lookout for indians chapter meet the muse mr lizard king santa barbara calliope kincaid waited on the steps of the tangerine tree cafe thinking about the past lives of lizards a small brown alligator lizard was sunning himself on the planter box by the steps and his lidless eyes glazed but seeing reminded calliope of a picture of jimi hendrix that her mother had kept next to the bed when she was growing up she wondered if this lizard really could be an incarnation of jimi and what he must feel like living in the planter box in front of a cafe eating bugs and hiding after being a rock star between the ages of seven and nine calliope had been raised a hindu and during that time she had developed an acute empathy for other creatures never sure what bird or beast might just be daddy or grandma working off some karma she had taken the concept almost to the point of agoraphobia she was afraid to go out of the house for fear that she might crush some relative doing time as a stinkbug when her mother moved into nsa buddhism and calliopes spiritual focus was changed to sitting before a gong with her mother the two of them chanting for prosperity until the apartments heater ducts began to vibrate evicted for disturbing other tenants calliopes mother turned to goddess worship which calliope liked because she didnt have to wear clothes to the rituals and there were always lots of flowers when calliope blossomed at thirteen and began to attract too much attention from neopagan males her mother turned to islam changed her daughters name to akeema mohammed kincaid and equipped her with a veil calliope who had easily grasped the concepts of karma and reincarnation of transcendentalism and oneness of harmony with nature and the goddess within was completely thrown by the concepts of guilt selfflagellation and modesty set down in islam she promptly shaved one side of her head dyed the remainder of her waistlength blond hair hot pink and began taking hallucinogenic drugs and sleeping with awkward pimpled toughboys with mohawks men replaced religion and calliope accepted their seductive lies with the same open wonder she had given the gods in an attempt to pull her daughter out of a spiritual tailspin mom turned unitarian but calliope had already slashed the ecumenical apron strings and mom was left to hopscotching religions on her own currently she lived in an ashram in oregon where she acted as the spirit channel for a fourthousandyearold superenlightened entity named babar no relation to the elephant as a child exposed to so many religions calliope had developed a malleability of faith that stayed with her into adulthood through the assimilation of many spiritual beliefs without science or cynicism to balance them calliope was able to define everything in her world accept the highs and lows of life with resolve and never be burdened by the need to understand why understand when you can believe for calliope every event was mystical and every moment magical a flat tire could be a manifestation of karma or a lizard might be jimi hendrix if she fell in love too easily and got hurt too often it wasnt bad judgment it was just faith she was humming castles made of sand to the lizard when sams mercedes pulled up to the curb she looked up and smiled at him not the least bit concerned that he was thirty minutes late it had never occurred to her that he might not show no man had ever stood her up she ran to the car and tapped on the passenger window sam pushed the button and it whirred down hang on a second i have to do something she said she went around to the front of the car and searched the grille until she found a moth that had met its end with minimal damage she plucked the moth from the grille took it to the planter box and wiggled it in front of the lizard while singing a few bars of hendrixs little wing the lizard snapped at the moth halfheartedly and slithered away under the geraniums to sulk calliope had been correct in guessing that this particular lizard had indeed been a rock star in a previous life and if she had sung a chorus of la woman or light my fire the lizard would have been delighted but how could she have known she dropped the moth into the planter box and returned to the car sorry im late sam said its only time she said im always late i had them fix your car he was trying not to look at her hed just gotten enough control of his nerves to drive and he wasnt ready to be rattled by the girl again but he wouldnt have thought of not picking her up during the whole debacle at the condo the urgency to see her again had hovered in the background of his mind and finally snapped him out of his confusion over the coyote medicine was she connected to the indian thats sweet of you she said did you look at the car look at it no i just had the garage come down its a great car calliope said it has over three hundred horsepower a sixpack of weber carburetors competition suspension and gearing itll do over a hundred and eighty on a straightaway i can blow most porsches off the road sam didnt know what to say so he said thats nice i know that women arent supposed to care about things like that my mother says that im obsessed with vehicles because i was conceived in the back of a vw microbus and spent most of my childhood in one we moved around a lot where does she live sam asked he would ask her about the indian really when the time was right oregon i didnt build the car myself i used to live with this sculptor in sedona arizona who built it for midnight drives in the desert one day i was telling him that i thought that cars had replaced guns as phallic symbols for american men and i thought it was interesting that he had one that was so small and fast the next day he gave me the datsun and went out and bought a lincoln it was very sweet very sweet sam echoed now or never he thought calliope that is your name right yes the girl said sam put on his salesmans this is a serious matter voice calliope do you know who the my name wasnt always calliope she interrupted sherman he was the sculptor started calling me calliope after the greek muse of epic poetry he said that i inspired men to art and madness i liked the way it sounded so i took it as my real name my mom even calls me calliope now sam had brought thousands of sales interviews back into control when the client tried to wander he wouldnt let this girl sidetrack him calliope who was the indian you know the indians used to change their names as they grew up and their personalities changed or when they did certain things like walks across the desert and stuff like that did you know that no i didnt sam lied but i really need to know oh theres my car sam slowed and pulled the mercedes in behind the z calliope before you go we cant have sex tonight she said i have some things to do but i can cook you dinner tomorrow if you want sam turned to her his mouth hanging open she was smiling at him waiting for his answer with her eyes wide as if shed just been surprised he realized that every time he had looked at her shed worn that same expression of wonderment and each time it had thrown him dammit he wouldnt be distracted she was sharp but he was sharper he was in control here okay he said terrific i live at seventeen and a half anapamu street thats upstairs whatever you do dont go to the downstairs door six oclock okay without waiting for his answer she was out of the car and away sam rolled down the window and shouted after her my name is sam she looked back at him and smiled then got into the datsun and fired it up sam watched the little sports car tilt with the torque of the engine as she revved it she burned off the back tires filling the air with squeals and blue smoke as she pulled away chapter quitting now greatly reduces the chance of visions crow country it was well before dawn and no lights burned in the houses and shops of crow agency as pokey piloted his old truck through town a sleepyeyed samson wobbling on the seat next to him how far is it to the fasting place samson asked about two hours but only fifty or so miles as the crow drives get it as the crow drives pokey grinned at samson and took a swig from a pint bottle of whiskey he and harlan had talked and drunk all night after samsons sweat now he was using the road like a buttered harlot he was all over the place while trying to stay in the middle and scaring samson whose head whacked the window when pokey got too much shoulder and had to yank the trucks retreads back onto the asphalt could we slow down pokey were not going that fast samson peeked at the speedometer which registered zero as did all the broken gauges in the truck pokey caught samson looking and grinned again i aint in any danger at all you know i seen my death in a medicine dream i get shot and it aint nowhere near this old truck nope im plumb safe in this truck no matter what i do what about me samson asked dont know whats your death dream i didnt have one pokey looked down at samson with a worried expression you didnt nope samson said with a gulp well then if i wreck you could be plumb fucked he began to weave more radically leaning hard into samson as the truck slipped off the shoulder again oh shit these tires are bald too dont worry son ill dance for your ghost at the sun dance pokey stop it samson had begun to giggle as his uncle leaned into him quick go to sleep fast and dream of dying on top of a pretty woman samson its your only chance pokey samson was doubled over with laughter now as pokey fishtailed the truck back and forth in the road while pumping the brakes and the clutch causing samsons head to jerk around like a rag dolls pokey shouted blacken your face samson hunts alone this is a good day to die then he slammed on the brakes and brought the truck to a skidding stop in the middle of the road samson was thrown to the floor of the truck among a collection of old beer cans and soda bottles still giggling he climbed back up onto the seat and began pounding on pokeys shoulder pokey grabbed his hands and shushed him look pokey said nodding to the front of the truck samson turned to see a huge buffalo bull crossing the road in front of them where did he come from samson asked as he watched the bull lumber out of the headlights must of wandered off the yellowtails place they got a few head of buffalo good thing you saw him in time i didnt see him them things are so dark they just eat up your headlights i was just fooling with you when i stopped we were lucky samson said gravely nope i told you we was safe now you quit being afraid of things that aint happened yet thats why i gave you that dream pokey geared up the truck and they rode in silence for a while listening to the rattling grind of the old fords engine the sky was just getting light and samson could see the new leaves coming on the trees and the blossoms on the cottonwoods he was glad his fast was to be in the time of the first grass the days would be mild and warm but not hot pokey samson said what do i do when i get thirsty pokey took a long pull on the pint before he answered you must pray that your suffering is accepted and you are given a spirit helper but what do i do what if i die you wont die when your suffering is too much you must go to the spirit world you must see yourself traveling into a hole in the ground and down a long tunnel you will come out into the light and you will be in the spirit world there you will not be hungry or thirsty wait there and your spirit helper will come to you what if my spirit helper doesnt come you must go back down the tunnel again and again looking for him in the buffalo days you had to have a spirit helper to go into battle or people thought you were a crazy dog wishing to die whats that a warrior who is so crazy or so full of sadness that he rides against the enemy just so they will kill him was my dad a crazy dog wishing to die pokey smiled and looked wistfully ahead it is bad luck to speak of it but no he did not wish to die he just got too drunk and drove too fast after his basketball games they drove south through lodge grass where the only activity was that of a few dogs trying to clear their throats for the days barking and a few ranchers cadging free coffee at the feed and grain store once through town pokey turned east on a dirt road into the rising sun to the wolf mountains in the foothills the road became deeply rutted and washed out in places pokey shifted into low and the truck ground down to a crawl after a half hour of kidneyjarring bumps and vertiginous cutbacks pokey stopped the truck on a high ridge between the peaks of two mountains from here samson could see all the way to lodge grass to the west and across the green prairies of the northern cheyenne reservation to the east lodgepole pines lined the mountain on both sides as thick as feathers on a bird thinning here near the peak where the ground was arid strewn with giant boulders and barren but for a few yucca plants and the odd tuft of buffalo grass or sage there pokey pointed east to a group of carsized boulders about fifty yards from the road that is the place where you will fast ill wait for you on this side of the road if you need me but you must only come up here if you have a vision or if you are in trouble pokey grabbed a bag from the floor of the truck and handed it to samson through the window theres a blanket in there and some mint leaves to chew when you get thirsty go now i will pray for your success as he walked down the hill toward the boulders samson felt a lump rising in his throat what good is medicine if you die of thirst what good is medicine anyway hed rather be in school this was no fun this was scary why did pokey have to be so strange why couldnt he be more like harlan or ben cartwright once on the downhill side of the boulders samson could see the place where he would sit through his fast a small stone fire ring under the overhang of one of the boulders samson sat down facing the sun which was now a great orange ball on the eastern horizon he thought of grandma at home she would be pouring lucky charms in everyones bowls about now getting his little cousin alices insulin out of the refrigerator and filling the syringe making sure everyone was dressed and ready for school uncle harlan would be sitting in the living room drinking coffee and telling all the kids to be quiet because of his hangover samsons aunts would be pulling the blankets off the sweat lodge and loading them into the back of harlans truck so they could take them to the laundromat normally samson would be trading punches in the arm with harry and festus and lying to grandma about having his homework done he wanted to be at home with everyone else not sitting by himself up here on a mountain he had never been by himself before he decided he didnt like it for the first time in his life he was lonely he tried to think of the spirit world maybe he could go there really fast find a spirit helper and go back up to the truck so pokey could take him to lodge grass and get a coke thirty minutes tops get in get out and nobody gets hurt as uncle harlan always said something he picked up in vietnam samson tried to imagine the hole he would enter the spirit world through he couldnt do it maybe a prayer o great spirit and great mother samson prayed in crow hear my prayer please let me find my spirit helper so i can go home he waited a moment okay that didnt work back to the hole in the ground after two hours he grew bored and his mind wandered to the ponderosa then to school home the planet krypton the snack bar in crow agency the mcdonalds in billings the damp basement of lodge grass high school where harlan had taken him and shown him old blackandwhite films of his father playing basketball he wondered what his father had been like then wondered about his mother who had died when he was only two her liver quit harlan said no one else would talk about the dead he tried to remember her but could remember only grandma and his aunts the new feeling of loneliness was getting worse maybe he could make up a vision he could go tell pokey that he had a vision and found his spirit helper and pokey would tell him how to make his medicine bundle and he could go home that would work he thought for a moment about what animal he should pick for his spirit helper and decided on a hawk he didnt know what hawk medicine was but it was probably pretty good for you unless you raised chickens or something samson ran up the hill and just as he was cresting the ridge he began to shout pokey pokey i had my vision i saw my spirit helper when he reached the road the truck was nowhere in sight he looked up and down the road then crossed it and looked down the other side of the ridge pokey was gone samson felt his lip begin to quiver and water fill his eyes he sat down in the dirt as the first series of chestwrenching sobs escaped him and echoed down the ridge he buried his face in his knees and cried until his throat hurt when finally he found the bottom of his sadness he looked up and wiped his eyes on his forearm why would pokey just leave him maybe he just went to buy some beer maybe he would bring back a coke samson suddenly realized that he really was thirsty the sun was moving higher in the sky and it was starting to get hot he stood and looked around for a shady place to wait but the closest shade was down by the boulders and from there he wouldnt be able to see the truck coming he sat on a small rock by the road in the full sun during the next two hours samson chewed all his mint leaves and took to sucking pebbles to keep his mouth from getting dry while he drew pictures in the dust with a stick he heard a car engine and looked up to see a cloud of dust coming off the road about two miles away that would be pokey samson stood on the rock to see if he could make out the truck as the cloud approached however he noticed that it wasnt pokeys truck at all but a big powderblue car unlike any he had seen before he sat back down on the rock and was fighting back another fit of sobs when the car skidded to a stop beside him bringing with it a choking cloud of dust there was a whirring sound and the car window slid down revealing the big round face of the driver a white man who seemed to have four or five spare chins under his first one excuse me son the driver smiled i seem to have gotten myself turned around here would you know the way to get to highway ninety its a long way samson said you have to go down the mountain into lodge grass then go to crow agency thats where the highway is the white man wasnt really white he was more of a bright pink and he smiled with his voice like samson was his best friend you lost me son lodge grass you have to stay on this road down the mountain then you have to turn i got you there son but which way did you say i should turn samson pointed down the mountain and the drivers eyes followed his finger then he turned back to samson looking confused i dont suppose you are heading that way are you son samson thought for a minute before he answered if this man would take him to the highway in crow agency he could walk home from there never trust a white man who wants to give you something pokey had said soon as you think you got it he will take it away and take everything you got along with it but samson couldnt figure out how the driver would take away a ride and all he really owned was his hunting knife if the white man tried to take that samson would cut his gizzard out im going to crow agency the boy said i can show you the way well jump in quick partner its hotter than blazes out here and its gettin in the car samson walked around the back of the car remembering what pokey had told him about not trusting white men it was the biggest bluest car he had ever seen maybe it was the heat but it seemed to take a long time to walk around it when he opened the door a blast of cold air hit him that instantly brought goose bumps to his arms and back he jumped into the car and stared in amazement at the vents in the dashboard where the cold was coming from hed never experienced airconditioning before close the door son you want to bake us samson closed the door as the car started moving its cool in here and it smells good the driver still smiling looked down at samson and tipped the straw skimmer he was wearing he was the fattest man samson had ever seen and he was wearing a powderblue suit the same shade as the car he filled the drivers seat like a bagful of sky up close samson could see that the mans skin was pink from little veins that ran through it like road maps thank you kindly son names commerce lloyd commerce purveyor of the worlds finest cleaning apparatus the miracle he held out a fat hand to samson samson shook two of the giant fingers with his right hand he let his left drop near the handle of his hunting knife i dont know what that is samson said im samson hunts alone you dont know about the miracle well samson hunts alone let me tell you in a few years the miracle will be the standard by which all vacuum cleaners will die in a few years if you dont have a miracle in your broom closet you might as well just hang a sign outside your house saying we live in filth the miracle is just the most advanced machine for the elimination of household dirt dust and disease that the world has ever known samson was amazed at how excited lloyd was it seemed that the more lloyd talked the pinker he got even if it was rude samson thought he should interrupt before lloyd hurt himself i know what a miracle is one of my aunts is a christian i dont know what a purveyor is lloyd took a deep breath and shot a smile at samson i am a salesman son one of the last truly free individuals on this planet i sell miracles son not just vacuum cleaners i sell real loavesandfishes miracles he paused for a moment and waited samson was hugging the car door his hand on his knife thinking that this was the craziest talk he had ever heard from anyone besides pokey i know what youre thinking lloyd continued youre thinking lloyd what kind of miracle do you perform am i right nope samson said i was thinking about a coke theres some in a cooler in the backseat lloyd tossed off trying to get back to his point grab me one too would you son samson scrambled over the seat and dug into a cooler where a dozen cokes lay in the ice around a fifth of rum he grabbed two and slithered back over the seat lloyd took the cokes and opened them he handed one to samson who drank half the bottle in one pull miracles lloyd said samson didnt care how crazy lloyd was life was fine the car was cool and quiet and smelled like spices he wasnt thirsty and he was going home even on the rough mountain road the car rode like a cloud he closed one eye and rested keeping the other eye on lloyd miracles samson said thats right i can make dreams out of nothing wants out of dreams needs out of wants and leave a dream in your hand you know how i do it samson shook his head this man was just like pokey if he wanted to tell you something he would tell you even if you dropped dead and rotted right before his eyes well son it all starts with a smile at the door when you hit that door people aint been sitting there waiting for you they been sitting around thinking about how miserable they are they got nothing to hang on to nothing to go on for when they answer that door theyre as sour as green oranges but i dont give it back to em i give a smile of pure honey and words just as sweet i tell them what they want to hear if theyre ugly i tell em theyre looking fine if theyre a failure i marvel at their success before they got the latch off the screen door im the best friend they ever had and why because i see them as what they would like to be not what they are for once in their life they are living their dream only because i make them think they are but then they look around and get a little uncomfortable if they got what they wanted how come they aint feeling it how come they still feel empty well son between you and me there aint no contentment no satisfaction this side of the grave you aint never going to be as pretty or as rich as you want to be no one ever has no one ever will folks dont know that though folks think that theres an answer to that scary feeling that keeps riding them no matter what they do coyote blue samson said dont talk nonsense boy im trying to teach you something where was i oh yeah they think that theres an answer so i give it to them i watch their eyes while im telling them how damn good theyre doing and when they get right to the edge of panic cause they cant see it i tell them about the miracle suddenly a clean rug is all that stands between them and all they could ever be i take out my machine and i vacuum up their beds into a little black bag then i have them boil that bag on the stove until the whole house smells like a sunripe battlefield you see all that dead skin that falls off you in your sleep is in the mattress when you boil it the smell is disgusting there is filth in these folks houses how the hell you gonna be beautiful and successful with filth all around you cant filth is the problem and the miracle is the solution now they want it so we talk some more and i make like im gonna leave but they want the machine i understand that but they already got a vacuum cleaner they dont need my machine i guess a little filth never hurt no one but they do need it they say they need it and why do they need it because now its all they got standing between them and their dream so i write them up i take their money and i leave them holding that dream in their hand while i drive away wants to needs to dreams usually in fortyfive minutes or less now thats a damn miracle son so you trick them samson said they want to be tricked i just provide a service it aint no different than going to the movies or seeing a magician you dont want to see that the pirates are using rubber swords do you you dont want to see the secret pockets up the magicians sleeves do you you want to believe in something that you know aint true just for a while people spend a lot of money and time to get tricked and i get to drive a nice car stay in good motels eat in restaurants and see the country in style samson thought about that for a while driving around in a big cool goodsmelling car would be almost as good as living on the ponderosa maybe better nobody on the reservation drove a car like this and they hardly ever ate in restaurants except the burger stand in crow agency maybe tricking people was the way to go it sure sounded better than baling hay or fixing truck engines do you think i could sell miracles samson asked lloyd laughed you got some growing to do first besides it takes a man of character to handle freedom do you have character samson is that like medicine its better than medicine you get yourself some character and come see me in a few years then well see that settled it samson was going to get himself some character and sell himself some miracles he lay back on the seat and closed his eyes lloyd started talking again the words were soft and rhythmic and soon samson hunts alone full of cocacola and miracles fell asleep samson wake up someone was shaking his shoulders he opened his eyes and saw pokey holding him at arms length what are you doing up here by the road pokey asked what samson looked around he was on the ridge where he had sat down before the big blue car had come along wheres lloyd whos lloyd pokey asked ive only been gone a couple of hours why did you come up here did you have your vision no i went for a ride i took a ride home with a man who sold miracles samson pokey said i dont think you took a ride anywhere i think you better tell me what the man said to you samson told pokey about lloyd commerce about the car as long as a house about selling miracles and tricking people and living the good life when he was finished pokey sat staring at the boy for a long time before he spoke samson you had your vision im sorry why are you sorry pokey because i didnt find my spirit helper i wish you saw a squirrel or a flicker samson but you saw a vacuum cleaner salesman pokey said forlornly but he was just a fat white man he only looked like a white man i think you saw old man coyote chapter over easy politically correct santa barbara sam spent most of the night cleaning up the debris from josh spagnolas shooting exhibition exhausted from the overall strangeness of his day he went to bed early but lay awake until well after midnight first worrying then trying to understand what was happening to him and finally fantasizing about the girl amid the misery he retained hope although he could not logically figure out why she was after all just a girl the goofiest girl he had ever met still the thought of seeing her again made him smile and he was able to escape into dreamless sleep when he awoke the next morning the world seemed a much kinder place as if during the night the calamities of the previous day had become distant and harmless order had returned at one time he might have met such a day by looking to the rising sun and thanking the great spirit for returning his harmony with the world as pokey had taught him he would have looked for rain clouds felt the promise of the days winds smelled the dew and the sage listened for the call of an eagle the best of goodluck signs and in that short time he would have confirmed that he and the world were of one spirit balanced today he missed the rising sun by three hours he met his day in the shower washing his hair with shampoo that was guaranteed to have never been put in a bunnys eyes and from which ten percent of the profits went to save the whales he lathered his face with shaving cream free of chlorofluorocarbons thereby saving the ozone layer he breakfasted on fertile eggs laid by sexually satisfied chickens that were allowed to range while listening to brahms and muffins made with pesticidefree grain so no eagleegg shells were weakened by his thoughtless consumption he scrambled the eggs in margarine free of tropical oils thus preserving the rain forest and he added milk from a carton made of recycled paper and shipped from a small family farm by the time he finished his second cup of coffee which would presumably help to educate the children of a poor peasant farmer named juan valdez sam was on the verge of congratulating himself for singlehandedly saving the planet just by getting up in the morning he would have been surprised however if someone had told him that it had been two years since he had set foot on unpaved ground he was writing a note to himself to put a new subliminal message on his computer save the world buy this policy when josh spagnola called sam did you hear what happened at the association meeting last night no josh ive been cleaning up my place the place sam i think this will be an easier transition if you start referring to it as the place you mean they voted to buy me out without even asking me i cant believe it i was actually very surprised myself people seem to dislike you in the extreme sam i think the dog was just their excuse for a general fuckover you told them it wasnt my dog didnt you i told them but it didnt matter they hate you sam the doctors and lawyers hate you because you make enough money to live here the married guys hate you because youre single the married women hate you because you remind their husbands that they arent single the old people hate you because youre young and the rest just hate you because you arent japanese oh yeah one bald guy hates you because you have hair for a guy that maintains a low profile youve built quite a little snowball of resentment sam had never given his neighbors a second thought never even spoken to most of them so now the realization that they hated him enough to take away his home was a shock ive never done anything to hurt anybody in this complex i wouldnt take it personally sam nothing brings people together like hate for profit you didnt have a chance against the clay tennis courts what does that mean we dont have clay tennis courts no but when they buy your townhouse for what you paid for it then sell it to someone more suitable at the market rate the association will have enough profit to build clay tennis courts well be the only complex in santa barbara with clay courts should raise the value of the property at least ten percent sorry sam isnt there anything i can do cant i bring legal action or something this isnt an official call sam i am calling as your friend and not on behalf of the association so let me give you my best advice on taking legal action its suicide half the guys that voted you out are lawyers in six months youd be broke and theyd be drinking your blood over backgammon the time for legal advice was eight years ago when you signed that agreement great where were you then i was stealing your rolex you stole my rolex that was you my gold rolex you dick i didnt know you then sam it was a professional thing besides the statute of limitations has run out its time to forgive and forget fuck you josh youll get a bill for the damage you caused sam do you know how concerned i am about your bill i dont give a decaying damn i dont sam hung up on the security guard the phone immediately rang and sam stared at it for a minute should he let josh get the satisfaction of the last word he looked at the shattered remains of his television picked up the phone and shouted look you wormy little fuck youre lucky i dont come down there and pop your head like a pimple sam this is julia down at the office i have aaron on the line for you sorry julia i was expecting someone else hang on a second he sat down on the couch and held the receiver to his chest while he tried to regain his composure too much change too fast he couldnt let aaron catch him with his guard down his good friend aaron his partner his mentor and josh spagnola was supposed to be his friend too what was the deal with josh hed turned on sam overnight why sam lit a cigarette and took a long drag then blew the smoke out in a slow stream before speaking into the phone julia you caught me in the shower tell aaron ill be in the office in an hour well talk then he hung up before she could respond he dialed the number of the cliffs security office josh spagnola answered josh this is sam hunter very rude sam hanging up when i am telling you how little i care is very rude thats why im calling josh ive heard your little speeches before i want to know what youve got on me then you havent seen the paper this morning i told you before ive been patching holes all fucking morning what goes seems that jim cable the diving mogul was attacked by an indian outside of his office and had a heart attack they said he had just finished an appointment with an insurance agent so whats your point josh the point is sam that after i ran out of your place yesterday i went through the apartment next door and ran out on the deck i thought i could come in from behind the dog and get a shot at it but when i got there i saw an indian vaulting over the rail of your deck the indian was wearing black just like the one they described in the paper interesting coincidence huh sam didnt know what to say spagnola had half the complex under his thumb for one reason or another but sam didnt know how the burglar used his information other than as a license to be rude sam didnt want to bring up blackmail when spagnola might just be in this to watch him squirm sam had watched a thousand clients squirm under his own manipulation but he wasnt sure how to go about it himself he decided to take a direct approach okay josh he said im squirming now what sammy i love you kid you and i are like peas in a pod you me and that aaron guy at your office you know aaron just spoke to him this morning when i called your office your secretary said that you were no longer with the firm and mr aaron was taking all your calls from now on aaron and i had a long talk did you tell him about the indian no he told me strange thing sam he seems to want you out of the business pretty badly but not just for the profit i think hes afraid of the attention youre going to get if it turns out that youre associated with the indian who attacked cable who do you think has more to lose you or aaron neither of us is losing anything josh this whole thing is a mistake i dont care what you saw i dont know anything about any indian and i resent the veiled threat no threat sam just information its the cleanest commodity you know no fingerprints no fibers no serial numbers its kind of ethereal religious in a way people will pay for something that they cant smell or taste or touch its fucking glorious isnt it i should have been a spy sam listened to spagnola sigh then to the breathing over the line here it was again the standoff how many times had he backed down over the years how many times had fear of discovery caused him to lie low and play the role of the victim too damn many he always seemed to be running from the past and avoiding the future but the future came anyway very softly barely speaking over a whisper sam said josh before you become too enraptured remember the information you dont have whats that old buddy you have no idea who i am or what im capable of there was a silence on the line as if spagnola was considering what sam had said goodbye josh sam whispered he hung up the phone grabbed his car keys and headed out the door to the mercedes as he disarmed the alarm and climbed in the car he realized that he also had no idea who he was or what he was capable of and for the first time in his life it didnt frighten him in fact it felt good coyote gets his powers one day a long time ago before there were any men or televisions and only animal people walked the earth great spirit the first worker decided that he would give everyone a new name he told the animal people to come to his lodge at sunrise and he would give each one a new name with all the powers that went with it to be fair great spirit said names will be given on a firstcome firstserved basis the earth was a pretty fair place in those days as long as you showed up on time coyote had a problem with this method however he liked to sleep until lunchtime and lie around thinking up tricks until late afternoon so getting up at sunrise was a problem but he really wanted to get a good name eagle would be good he thought i would be swift and strong or if i take the name of bear i will never be defeated by my enemies yep i got to get me a good name even if i have to stay up all night when the sun went down coyote looked all over for a good espresso bar but even in those days they were full of pretentious pseudointellectual animal people who sat around in opentoed moccasins and whined about how unfair the world was which it wasnt i dont have the stomach for that said coyote i think ill just score some magic wakeup powder and stay wired that way coyote went to see raven it was well known among the animal people that raven had a connection with a green bird from south america and was always good for some wakeup powder im sorry coyote my friend but i cannot extend you any credit ill need three prairie dogs up front if you want the product and remember i like my prairie dogs squashed real flat raven was a greasy little prick who thought he was cool because he wore sunglasses all the time even at night who was he to act so high and mighty coyote was insulted look man ill have a new name tomorrow im going to go for eagle just advance me the gram now and ill give you six prairie dogs in the morning raven shook his head coyote slunk away i can stay awake without magic coyote said i just have to concentrate coyote tried to stay awake but by the time the moon was high in the sky he started to doze off this isnt working he said i cant keep my eyes open talking to himself often gave coyote ideas which was a good thing because hardly anyone else would talk to him he broke a couple of thorns from a cactus and used them to prop his eyes open im a genius he said then he fell asleep anyway when coyote finally awoke the sun was directly overhead he rushed to great spirits lodge and burst through the door flap eagle i want eagle he said his eyes were dry and cracked from being propped open and his fur was matted with blood where the thorns had pierced his eyelids eagle was the first to go great spirit said what happened to you you look like hammered shit bad night coyote said whats left bear bear would be good theres only one name left great spirit said nobody wanted it what is it coyote youre shitting me great spirit is not a shitter coyote ran outside where the other animal people were laughing and talking about their new names and powers he tried to get them to trade names but even dung beetle told him to get lost great spirit watched coyote from his lodge and felt sorry for him come here kid great spirit said look youre stuck with a lousy name but maybe i can make up for it you have to keep the name but from now on you are chief of the without fires and from now on you can take on any shape that you choose and wear it as long as you wish coyote thought about it for a minute it was a pretty good gift maybe he should work this pity angle more often so that means that everyone has to do what i say sometimes great spirit said sometimes coyote asked great spirit nodded and coyote figured hed better leave before great spirit changed his mind thanks gs im outta here got to see someone about some sunglasses coyote loped off chapter the god the bad and the ugly santa barbara during the short drive to his office sam decided that if gabriella gave him the least little bit of shit he would fire her on the spot if his life was going to fall apart before his eyes there was no reason to suffer the slings and arrows of ungrateful employees there were also twenty younger agents who worked under him and as long as he held partnership in the agency he held the power to hire and fire let one of them mouth off he thought let one of them look sideways at me and theyre going to be a distant memory taillights on the horizon gone out shitcanned pinkslipped instantly unemployed he walked into his office with his temper locked loaded and ready to fire but was immediately disarmed when he saw gabriella tilted back in her chair skirt thrown up around her waist her legs spread wide and high heels alternately pumping in the air and digging into the back of the naked indian who was on his knees in front of her wheeling her chair back and forth thrusting into her with greedy abandon and yipping with each stroke as counterpoint to the monkey noises that escaped gabriella in rhythmic bursts hey sam shouted gabriella looked over the indians shoulder at sam and held one finger in the air as if marking a point then pointed to the message pad on the desk one call she gasped the indian pulled her to him in a particularly violent thrust and gabriella grabbed his shoulder with both hands popping her presson nails off and across the room like tiddlywinks sam shook off his shock ran forward and caught the indian around the neck in a choke hold the indian pumped wildly in the air as sam dragged him off gabriella and across the outer office he fell over backward into his office with the indian still squirming in his grasp and it occurred to him that unless things turned quickly to his advantage he was in serious danger of being humped he rolled the indian over on the carpet and pinned him facedown while he looked around for a weapon the only thing in reach was the big multiline phone on his desk sam released the choke hold and lunged for the phone catching it by the cord he swung around with it just in time to hit the indian in the face as he was rising to his hands and knees the phone exploded into a spray of electronic shrapnel and the indian fell forward onto his face unconscious but twitching against the carpet in petitmal afterhumps sam looked at the broom of colored wires at the end of the cord where the phone used to be then dropped it and staggered to his feet gabriella was standing by the door smoothing her skirt down her lipstick was smeared across her face and her hair was spiked into a fright wig of hair spray and sweat she started to speak then noticed that one of her breasts was still peeking out of her dress excuse me she turned and tucked herself in then turned back to sam ill hold your calls she said officiously then she pulled the door closed leaving sam alone in the office with the unconscious naked indian youre fired sam whispered to the closed door he looked down at the indian and saw a bloodstain spreading around his head on the carpet he didnt seem to be breathing sam fell to his knees and felt the indians neck for a pulse nothing fuck not again sam paced around the desk four times before he fell back in his leather executive chair and clamped his hands on his temples as if trying to squeeze out a solution instead he thought of police and prison and felt hope running through his fingers like liquid light leaving him dark with despair a growling noise from the floor sam looked over the desk to see the body of the indian moving he started to breathe a sigh of relief when he realized that the body wasnt moving at all it was changing his eyes went wide with terror as the arms and legs shortened and grew fur the face grew into a whiskered muzzle and the spinal column lengthened and grew into a bushy tail before sam could catch his breath again he was looking at the body of a huge black coyote the coyote got to its feet and shook its head as if clearing its ears of water then it leapt on the desk and growled at sam who rolled his chair back until it hit the wall behind his desk sam pushed himself up by the chair arms until he was almost standing against the wall desperately trying to put even a millimeter more between himself and the snarling muzzle of the coyote the coyote crawled forward on the desk until its face was only inches from sams sam could feel the coyotes moist breath on his face it smelled of something familiar something burnt he wanted to turn his head away and close his eyes until the horror went away but his gaze remained locked on the coyotes golden eyes he wanted to scream but there was no breath for it and he found his jaw was moving but no sound was coming out the coyote backed away and sat on the desk then raised its lowered ears and tilted its head to the side as if perplexed sam felt himself take a breath and the strange urge to say good doggie came over him but he remained rigid and quiet the coyote began to shake and sam thought it would attack but instead it threw back its head as if to howl the skin on the coyotes neck began to undulate and surge and took on the shape of a human face the fur receded from the face then away from the front legs which became arms then down the back legs which lengthened into crouching human legs as the fur peeled it lost its black color turning the burnt tan of a normal coyote it was as if a human was literally crawling out of a cocoon of coyote skin the black color becoming black buckskins trimmed with red feathers a minute passed in what seemed a year as the transformation took place when it was finished the indian was crouched on sams desk wearing a coyoteskin headdress that had once been his own skin fuck sam said falling back into the chair his eyes trained now on the golden eyes of the indian woof the indian said with a grin sam shook his head trying to get the image to go away his mind was still rattling around in chaos trying to put this into some sort of meaningful context but all he could do was wish that he would pass out and that his kneecaps would stop jumping with adrenaline woof the indian repeated he jumped from the desk adjusted the headdress that moments ago had been his skin then sat in the chair opposite sam got a smoke he said sam felt his mind lock on to the request yes he understood that yes he could do that a smoke he reached into his shirt pocket for his cigarettes and lighter and fumbled them out lost his grip and sent them skittering across the desk he was scrambling for them when the indian reached out and patted his hand sam screamed the highpitched wail of a little girl and jumped back into his chair which rolled back until his head snapped against the wall the indian turned his head to the side quizzically the same way the coyote had then took the cigarettes from the desk and lit two with the lighter he held one out to sam who remained pushed back in the chair the indian nodded for sam to take the cigarette then waited while sam inched forward snatched it out of his hand and quickly retreated to his position by the back wall the indian took a deep drag on the cigarette then turned his head and blew the smoke out in rings that crept across the desk like ghosts sam had curled into the fetal position in his chair and looked up only to cast a sideways glance at the indian when he took a drag from his own cigarette it occurred to him that he should feel silly but he didnt he was still too frightened to feel silly when his cigarette was half gone he started to calm down his fear was draining away being replaced with indignant anger the indian sat calmly smoking and looking around the office sam put his feet on the floor scooted the chair back under the desk and set what he hoped was a hard gaze on the indian who are you he asked the indian smiled and his eyes lit up like an excited childs i am the stink in your shoe the buzz in your ear the wind through the trees i am the who are you sam interrupted what is your name the indian continued to grin while smoke trickled between his teeth he said the cheyenne call me wihio the sioux iktome the blackfeet call me napi old man the cree call me saultaux the micmac glooscap i am the great hare on the east coast and raven on the west you know me samson hunts alone i am your spirit helper sam gulped coyote yep youre a myth a legend the indian said you are just a bunch of stories to teach children true stories no just stories old man coyote is just a fairy tale should i change shapes again you liked that no no dont do that sam had guessed the indians identity the day before when hed opened the medicine bundle but he had hoped it would all go away and he would find himself the victim of a childhood superstition religion was supposed to be a matter of faith gods were not supposed to jump on your desk and snarl at you they werent supposed to sit in your office smoking cigarettes gods didnt do anything they were supposed to ignore you and let you suffer and die having never known whether your religion was a waste of time faith sure the gods were a badly behaving lot in stories jealous impatient selfish vengeful smiting whole races of people raping virgins sending plagues and pestilence and even as gods went coyote was a particularly bad example but they were supposed to stay in the damn stories not show up and hump your homely secretary until she made monkey noises what are you doing here sam asked im here to help you help you ruined my business and got me kicked out of my home you wanted to scare the diver so i scared him you wanted the girl so i gave her to you well what about all the cats at my condo complex what about my secretary how did that help me if i was not meant to have ugly women and cats they would not be so easy to catch it was the kind of backward perverse logic that had irritated sam as a child pokey medicine wing had been a master at it it seemed to sam at times as if the entire crow nation was trying to define a siliconchip world with a stone age worldview sam thought he had escaped it why me why not someone who believes this is more fun sam resisted the urge to leap over the desk and choke the indian it was still the indian in his head he hadnt yet accepted that he was talking to coyote chief of the without fires even with the overwhelming evidence of the supernatural he searched for a natural explanation for what was happening a lifetime of disbelief is not easily shed he tried to find some parallel experience that would put things in order something hed read or seen on pbs nothing was forthcoming so he speculated how would aaron react if faced with this situation aaron didnt acknowledge his irish heritage any more than sam admitted his own crow roots what if a leprechaun suddenly appeared on aarons desk hed affect a brogue and try to talk the little fucker into putting his pot o gold into taxdeferred annuities no aaron was not the person to think of in a spiritual emergency coyote smiled as if he had read sams thoughts what do you want samson hunts alone sam didnt even hesitate to think i want my old life back to the way it was before you fucked it up why now sam was forced to think why indeed every time sam hired a new agent he glorified his and aarons lifestyles he would take a bright hungry young man for a ride in the mercedes buy him lunch at the biltmore or another of santa barbaras finer restaurants flash cash and gold cards and expensive suits plant the seed of greed as aaron called it then give the kid a means to pursue his germinating dream of material bliss while sam collected ten percent on everything he sold it was part of the show one of the many roles he played and the car the clothes the condo and the clout were merely props without the props the show could not go on why do you want your life back coyote asked as if sam had forgotten the question its safe sam blurted out so safe coyote said that you can lose it in a day to be safe is to be afraid is that what you want to be afraid im not afraid then why do you lie you want the girl yes i will help you get her i dont need your help i need you gone i am very good with women like youre good with cats and couches great heroes have great horniness you should feel what it is like to pleasure a falcon you lock talons with her in the sky and do it while you both are falling like meteors you would like it they never complain if you come too fast get out of here i will go but i will be with you coyote rose and walked to the door as he opened it he said dont be afraid he stepped out of his office and closed the door suddenly sam leapt to his feet and headed after him stay off my secretary he shouted he ripped open the door and looked into the outer office where gabriella her composure regained was typing up a claim form coyote was gone gabriella looked up and raised a disapproving eyebrow is there a problem mr hunter no sam said no problem you sounded frightened im not frightened goddammit sam slammed the door and went to the desk for a cigarette his cigarettes and lighter were gone he stood there for a moment feeling a flush of anger rise in him until he thought he would scream then he fell back into his chair and smiled as he remembered something pokey medicine wing had once told him anger is the spirits telling you that you are alive chapter cruelly turn the steelbelted radials of desire crow country in the six years since his vision quest samson had endured almost daily interpretations of the vision by pokey medicine wing again and again samson insisted that it wasnt important and again and again pokey forced the boy to recall his experience on the mountain in detail it was pokeys responsibility as a selfproclaimed medicine man to bring meaning to the symbols in the vision over the years as pokey read new meanings he tried to change his and samsons lives to fit the message of the medicine dream maybe old man coyote was trying to tell us that we should turn our dreams into money pokey said with this interpretation pokey dragged samson into a series of entrepreneurial ventures that ultimately served no purpose except to confirm to the people of crow country that pokey had finally gone fullbore batshit the first foray into the world of business was a worm ranch pokey presented the idea to samson with the same blind faith with which he told old man coyote stories and samson like so many before him was captivated with the idea of turning religion into money pokeys eyes were lit up with liquor and firelight as he spoke they are building that dam up on the bighorn river they tell us that we will prosper from all the people who will come to the reservation to fish and waterski on the new lake thats what they told us when they put the custer monument here but whites opened stores and took all the money this time we will get our share well grow worms and sell them for fishing they had no lumber to build the worm beds so pokey and samson went to the rosebud mountains and cut lodgepole pines which they brought down by the pickup load through a whole summer they hauled and built until the hunts alones five acres was nearly covered with empty worm beds pokey convinced that their success depended on getting a jump on other prospective worm ranchers instructed samson to tell everyone who asked that they were building corrals to hold tiny horses that they were raising for the little people that lived in the mountains its easier to keep a secret if people think youre crazy pokey said with the beds finished they were faced with the problem of filling them worms like cow shit pokey said we can get that for free indeed had pokey asked any of the ranchers in the area they would have let him haul away all the manure he needed but because most of the ranchers were white and pokey did not trust them he decided instead that he and samson would steal the cow pies in the dead of night so it began sunset samson and pokey driving the old pickup into a pasture pokey driving slowly along while samson followed on foot with a shovel scooping piles into the bed of the truck then the two of them stealing away with their reeking load to dump it in the worm beds then out again the crow have always been the best horse thieves samson pokey said old man coyote would be proud of the trick we have played on the ranchers pokeys enthusiasm mystified samson who couldnt muster the same selfsatisfaction at stealing something that nobody wanted nevertheless after a month of pasture raids the beds were full and they drove to the bait store in hardin to buy their breeding stock night crawlers and red worms five hundred each pokey burnt sage and sweet grass and prayed over the beds and they released the worms into the beds of manure then they waited we shouldnt disturb them until spring pokey said but many nights samson spotted him sneaking out to one of the beds with a trowel turning over a patch then skulking away one night samson was sneaking out with his own trowel when he saw pokey on his knees with his face pressed to a bed he stood up when he sensed the boy behind him you know what i was doing pokey asked no samson said hiding his trowel behind his back i was listening to the sound of money you have shit on your ear pokey from that time forward they were both more careful about their nocturnal progress checks but neither found worm one they waited through the cold montana winter sure that come spring they would be waist deep in worms and money never mind the fact that yellowtail dam wouldnt be completed for two more years after the thaw they marched to the beds together shovels in hand to turn over their squirming horn of plenty but shovel after shovel turned up empty into the third bed they began to panic and were wildly slinging shit in the air when harlan pulled up digging for horses he asked worms pokey shouted lifting the veil of secrecy with a single word where did you get the manure around pokey said around where the ranches on the res harlan began to laugh and samson was afraid for a moment that pokey would brain him with the shovel you were trying to grow worms old man coyote told us to samson said defensively we let go a thousand worms in here to breed so we could sell em to fishermen i guess old man coyote didnt tell you that cattle ranchers put a wormer in their cattle feed huh wormer pokey said that manure was poison to your worms they were probably dead ten minutes after you put them in there samson and pokey looked at each other forlornly the boys lower lip swelling with disappointment the mans temples throbbing with pain some people believe that hard work is its own reward and a job well done is a tribute to a mans character fortunately none of those people were around or they would have been ducking shovel blows pokey and samson decided to get drunk harlan stayed on to coach the boy through his first hangover and run interference with grandma who would have skinned the two men had she known they were giving liquor to a twelveyearold it was the end of summer a summer spent in sulking and speculating before pokey brought home the goats hed obtained the pair a male and a female from a dubious source in a hardin bar by winning a bet that had something to do with a pineapple a throwing knife and a waitress named debbie samson had difficulty putting the story together from pokeys drunken ravings but he gathered that because debbie had survived and the pineapple had not pokey had two goats on his hands we could breed em and sell em for meat pokey said but i got a better idea them lawyers and doctors are flying into montana from the city and paying a thousand bucks a head to shoot bighorn sheep i say we go to the airport in billings and wait for one of them to get off a plane then tell em they can come to the res and shoot one for two three hundred i can be the faithful indian guide and lead them all over hell and back and you can take the goats up into the mountains and tie them up where they can shoot em despite samsons objections that even a city lawyer might know the difference between a bighorn sheep and a nanny goat pokey insisted that come morning they would be on the road to riches come morning however when samson went outside to look at the goats he found them lying on their backs legs shot stiff to the sky with rigor mortis dead as stones in his excitement pokey had tied the goats next to a patch of hemlock and the goats perhaps sensing what was planned for them munched their last meal and joined the ranks of socrates not all of pokeys quests for spiritual capitalism were complete failures he and samson made a little money with the authentic indian frybread taco stand they set up outside of the custer battlefield national monument until the health department objected to the presence of marmot and raccoon meat in their allbeef tacos and they did make forty dollars selling eagle feathers to tourists actually the feathers of two buzzards that had dined on tainted goat carcass which they used to buy marijuana seeds that produced a respectable crop of grapesized casaba melons harlan referred to this as the magic beans incident and finally while samson was busy with school and basketball and a developing obsession with girls pokey turned to prostitution and made five bucks from the owner of the hardin eleven who paid the shaman to take his sandwich sign and go stand somewhere else samson was fifteen by the time pokey decided that perhaps they were not meant to turn their dreams into money once again he sat the boy down in the kitchen to recount the vision pokey i dont even remember much of the vision and besides how important could it be i was only nine samsons friend billy two irons was waiting outside to drive them to a fortynine party at the yellowtail dam and samson was not in the mood to be crossexamined about an event that he was trying desperately to leave behind along with the rest of the trappings of childhood do you know why the crow never fought the white man pokey asked gravely oh fuck pokey not now ive got to get going do you know why no why because of the vision of a nineyearold boy thats why as much as samson wanted to leave he had spent too many years listening to the cheyenne and lakota call his people cowards to walk out now what boy he asked our last great chief plenty coups when he was nine he went on his first fast just like you he cut pieces from his skin and suffered greatly finally his vision came and he saw the buffalo gone and then he saw the white mans cattle covering the plains he saw white men everywhere but he saw none of our people the medicine chiefs heard his vision and said that it was a message the lakota and the cheyenne had fought the white men and lost their lands the vision meant that if we fought the white men we would lose our land and be wiped out our chiefs decided not to fight and the crow survived we are here because of the vision of a nineyearold boy thats great pokey samson said having gained nothing useful from the story he was not going to quell any ridicule from noncrows by telling them that his people had changed their way of life over a mystical vision it was hard enough trying to live down the reputation of his crazy uncle as it was i have to go now he grabbed the drum that pokey had made him and took off through the living room highstepping over his eight younger cousins who were sprawled on the floor watching cartoons on televsion bye grandma he tossed over his shoulder to his grandmother who sat in a tattered easy chair among the kids adding the final touches to a beaded belt she was making for him in front of the hunts alone house a tall acnespeckled billy two irons was pouring a jug of water into the radiator of a twentyyearold ford fairlane most of the water was draining out of the bottom of the engine onto the ground at his feet that thing going to make it up to yellowtail samson called no problem bro billy said without looking up i got twenty milk jugs of water in the backseat for the trip up coming homes downhill most of the way you fix the exhaust leak yep tomato can and a hose clamp works fine as long as you keep the window down how about the brakes samson was staring over billys shoulder into the greasy cavern of the engine compartment billy capped the radiator and slammed the hood before he answered you let it coast down to about ten miles an hour and throw it in reverse itll stop on a dime then lets do it samson jumped into the car billy threw the empty milk jug into the backseat climbed in and began cranking the engine samson looked back to the house and saw pokey coming out the front door waving at them hit it man samson said lets go the car finally fired up just as pokey reached the window he shouted to be heard over the din of the damaged muffler you boys watch out for enos now we will pokey samson said as they pulled away then he turned to billy two irons is anus working nights again anus was the name they used for enos windtree a fat meanspirited halfbreed bia cop who liked nothing better than to terrorize kids partying at some remote spot on the res once at a fortynine party near lodge grass samson and billy and nearly twenty others were drinking and singing with the drums when samson heard a distinct sickening series of mechanical clicks right by his ear the sound of a twelvegauge shell being jacked into a riot gun when he turned to the noise enos hit him in the chest with the butt of the gun knocking him to the ground then enos shot the lights and windshields out of two cars before sending everyone on their way when samson told the story people just said he was just lucky enos hadnt hit him in the face or shot somebody there were rumors that it had happened before and people were dying on the lakota reservation at pine ridge killed by the tribal police in what amounted to a civil war enos works whenever he can find someone to fuck with billy said id like to hang that fat fucks scalp from my lodgepole oooooo brave warrior heap big pissed off samson chided in pidgin speaking tonto they called it you telling me you wouldnt want to see anuss head through a rifle scope yeah if i thought i could get away with it but a rifle would be too quick for an hour and a half between stops to add water to the radiator they theorized on the best way to do away with enos windtree when they finally arrived at the party it had been decided that enos should have his entire body abraded with a belt sander and a twoinch hole saw slowly driven through his skull with a drill press samson and billy had just finished with their first year of shop class and were still fascinated by the macabre potential of every power tool they had used this fascination of course was fed by their shop teacher a sevenfingered white man who described in detail every accident that had mangled mutilated or murdered some careless shop student since the turn of the century the teacher had been so successful in instilling respect for the tools in the boys that billy two irons had taken to skipping two classes after shop to mellow out and would have had a nervous breakdown had samson not finished building his friends birdhouse for him billy pulled the fairlane slowly onto the dam and up to a dozen cars that were parked haphazardly on the threehundredfoot structure he threw the car into reverse and gunned the engine until the transmission screamed in protest and the car stopped in a jerking squealing mechanical seizure samson was out of the car in an instant and a warm wind coming off the newly formed reservoir washed over him with the scent of sage twenty people were gathered at the rail of the dam beating drums and singing a song of heartbreak and betrayal in crow samson scanned the faces in the moonlight recognizing and dismissing each until he spotted ellen black feather and smiled she was wearing jeans and a tshirt her long hair was blowing in a black comet tail behind her her shirt was wrapped tight around her in the wind and samson noticed to his delight that she was braless she saw samson and returned his smile it was perfect just as he had envisioned it on a dozen nights while he lay in the dark with his cousins sleeping around him they would sing and drink for a while maybe smoke a joint if somebody had one then he and ellen would finish the evening in the backseat of the fairlane he walked to ellen and sat beside her on the rail of the dam oblivious to the threehundredfoot drop behind him as he started to beat his drum and sing he looked back to the car to see billy adding water to the radiator it suddenly occurred to him that if he were going to enjoy the favors of ellen black feather in the back of billys car it would be a good idea to move the twenty jugs of water first he excused himself with a pat on her knee and returned to the car billy help me get these jugs into the trunk theyre all empty dont worry about them im going to need the space just open the trunk okay billy handed him the car keys hunts alone you are a hopeless horndog samson grinned then took the keys and ran around to the back of the car he was loading his first armload of jugs into the trunk when he heard a car pass by and the singing abruptly stopped samson looked up to see the green tribal police car stopping in the middle of the partiers some thirty yards away fuck its anus billy said lets get out of here no not yet samson eased the trunk lid down and joined billy at the front of the car they watched enos windtree climb out of the car and reach back in for his nightstick the partiers stood stockstill as if they were standing near a rattlesnake that would strike at the first movement but their eyes were darting around looking for possible lanes of escape all except for ernest bulltail the biggest and meanest of the group who met enoss gaze straight on this is an illegal gathering enos rasped as he swaggered up to ernest you all know it and i know it the fine is two hundred dollars payable right now cough it up enos punctuated his demand by driving the end of his nightstick into ernests solar plexus doubling the big man over ernest made an effort to straighten up and enos hit him across the face with the nightstick one of the other men stepped forward but froze when enos dropped his hand to the magnum strapped to his hip now for my fine enos said fuck you anus someone screamed and samsons heart sank as he realized that it was ellen enos turned from ernest and started for the girl i know how youre going to pay up enos said to ellen with a leer samson knew he had to do something but he wasnt sure what billy was tugging on his sleeve trying to get him to go but he was fixated on enos and ellen why hadnt they brought a weapon he moved to the back of the car and opened the trunk what are you doing billy whispered looking for a weapon i dont have a gun in the car this samson said holding up a tire iron against a three fiftyseven are you nuts billy grabbed the tire iron and wrenched it out of samsons hand samson was almost in tears now with frustration he looked back up the dam to see enos his gun at ellens head putting his free hand under her shirt samson pushed billy aside then reached into the trunk and pulled out the spare tire he began creeping up the dam cradling the heavy spare in his arms the others watched him eyes wide with fear ten yards away from enos he started running the tire held out in front of him enos samson shouted the fat policeman pulled away from ellen and was bringing up his gun to fire when the tire hit him in the chest and drove him back over the railing samson followed tumbling halfway over the rail before someone caught the back of his shirt and tugged him back he didnt turn to see who it was he just stared over the railing at the dam wall that disappeared into the darkness two hundred feet below the others joined him at the rail and several minutes passed before the stunned silence was broken by billy two irons i just had that spare fixed he said part the call to action chapter forget what you know crow country of all the people who had seen enos go over the side of the dam only billy two irons seemed to have avoided a state of stunned silence while the others were still staring over the edge into the darkness billy was already formulating a plan to save his friend samson come here samson looked back at billy he was beginning to shiver with unused adrenaline a look of dreamy confusion had come over him billy put his arm around samsons shoulders and led him away from the railing look samson youre going to have to run a moment passed and samson did not answer until billy jostled him run you have to get off the res and not come back for a long time maybe never everyone here is going to think that theyre going to keep this a secret but when the cops start kicking ass your name is going to come out youve got to go man where will i go i dont know but you have to now go get in the car im going to try and raise some money grateful that someone was thinking for him and because he didnt know what else to do samson followed billys instructions he sat in the car and watched his friend going from person to person on the dam collecting money he closed his eyes and tried to think but found that there was a movie running on the back of his eyelids a slowmotion loop of a fat cop with a spare tire in his face going backward over a rail he snapped his eyes open and stared unblinking until they filled with tears a few minutes later billy threw a handful of bills on the front seat and climbed in the car i told them you were going to hide out in the mountains and i was getting money for supplies you should be able to get a long way before the cops figure out that youre not on the res theres about a hundred bucks here billy started the car and drove off the dam toward fort smith where are we going samson asked first we have to stop and fill up these jugs with water ill take you to sheridan and you can catch a bus there i dont trust this car to go any further if we break down in the middle of nowhere youre fucked samson was amazed at his friends ability to think and act so quickly left to himself he knew he would still be staring over the dam wondering what had happened instead he was on his way to wyoming i should go home and tell grandma that im going you cant ill tell them tomorrow and once youre gone you cant call or write either thats how the cops will find you how do you know that thats how they caught my brother billy said he wrote a letter from new mexico the fbi had him in two days after that but look samson you killed a cop i know you didnt mean to but that wont matter if they catch you theyll shoot you before you get a chance to tell what happened but everyone saw everyone there was crow samson they wont believe a bunch of fucking indians but enos was crow part crow anyway he was an apple only red on the outside samson started to protest again but billy shushed him start thinking about where youre going to go where do you think i should go i dont know you just need to disappear dont tell me where youre going when you figure it out either i dont want to know you could try and pass for white with those light eyes you might pull it off change your name dye your hair i dont know how to be white how hard can it be billy said samson wanted to talk to someone besides billy two irons someone who didnt make as much sense pokey he realized that for all his craziness all his ravings all his drinking and ritual mumbo jumbo pokey was the person he most trusted in the world but billy was right going home would be a mistake instead he tried to imagine what pokey would say about escaping into the white world well first samson thought he would never admit that there was a white world according to pokey there was only the world of the crow of family and clans and medicine and balance and old man coyote the white man was simply a disease that had put the crow world out of balance samson tried to look into the future to see where he would go what he would do but any plans he had ever made and there hadnt been many were no longer valid and the future was a thick white fog that would allow him to see only as far as the bus station in sheridan wyoming he felt a panic rising in his chest like a scream then it came to him this was just a different type of coyote blue he was trying to look into the future too far and it was ruining his balance he needed to focus on right now and eventually he would learn what he needed to know when the future got to him what did pokey always say if you are going to learn you need to forget what you know dont use all your money for the bus ticket billy said once you get out of the area you can hitchhike did you learn all this when your brother got in trouble yeah he writes me letters from prison about what he did wrong he put a bomb in a bia office how many letters can that take not that what he did wrong to get caught oh samson said two hours later samson was climbing on a bus headed for elko nevada carrying with him everything he owned twentythree dollars a pocketknife and a small buckskin bundle he took a window seat in the back of the bus and stared out over the dark countryside really seeing nothing as he tried to imagine where he would end up his fear of getting away was almost greater than his fear of being caught at least if he were caught his fate would be in someone elses hands after an hour or so on the road samson sensed that the bus was slowing down he looked around for a reaction from the other passengers but except for an old lady in the front who was engrossed in a romance novel they were all asleep the driver downshifted and samson felt the big diesel at his back roar as the bus pulled into the passing lane out his window he saw the back of a long powderblue car as the bus moved up samson watched the big car glide below him seeming to go on forever he saw the back of the drivers head then his face it was the fat salesman from his vision samson twisted in his seat trying to get a better look as they passed the salesman seemed to see him through the blackout windows of the bus and raised a bottle of coke as if toasting samson did you see that samson cried to the old lady did you see that car the old lady turned to him and shook her head and a cowboy in the next seat groaned did you see who was in that car samson asked the bus driver who snickered and shook his head the cowboy in the next seat was awake now and he pushed his hat from over his eyes well son now that you got me wetting myself in suspense who was in the car it was the salesman samson said the cowboy stared at him for a second in angry disbelief then pushed his hat back over his eyes and slid back down in his seat i hate fucking mexicans he said chapter lies have lives of their own it took just six weeks for samson hunts alone the crow indian to become samuel hunter the shapeshifter the transformation began with the cowboy on the bus mistaking samson for a mexican when samson left the bus in elko nevada and caught a ride with a racist trucker he became white for the first time he expected from listening to pokey all those years that upon turning white he would immediately have the urge to go out and find some indians and take their land but the urge didnt come so he sat by nodding as the trucker talked by the time he got out at sacramento california samson had memorized the truckers litany of white supremacy and was just getting into the rhythm of racism when he caught a ride with a black trucker who took amphetamines and waxed poetic about oppression injustice and the violent overthrow of the us government by either the black panthers the teamsters or the temptations samson wasnt sure which samson was booted out of the truck in santa barbara when he suggested that perhaps killing all the whites should be put off at least until they told where they had hidden all the money actually samson was somewhat relieved to be put out hed only been white for a few hours and wasnt sure that he liked it well enough to die for it his immediate concern was to get something to drink he bought a coke at a nearby convenience store and walked across the street to a park where under the boughs of a massive fig tree amid a dozen sleeping bums he sat down to consider his next move samson was just summoning up an obese case of hopelessness when a nearby bundle of rags spoke to him any booze in that cup samson had to stare at the oblong rag pile for a few seconds before he noticed there was a hairy face at one end a single bloodshot eye sparkling with hope the only break in the gray dinge gave the face away no just coke samson said hope dimmed and the eye became as empty as the socket next to it you got any money the bum asked samson shook his head he had only twelve dollars left he didnt want to share it with the rag pile youre new here samson nodded you a wet excuse me samson said are you mexican samson thought for a moment then nodded youre lucky the bum said you can get work a guy stops near here every morning with a truck picks up guys to do yard work but he only takes mexicans says whites are too lazy are they samson asked he figured that after persecuting blacks hiding money stealing land breaking treaties and keeping themselves pure maybe the whites were just tired he was glad he was mexican you speak pretty good english for a wet where does the guy with the truck stop has he been by today im not lazy the bum said i earned a degree in philosophy ill give you a dollar samson said im having trouble finding work in my field samson dug a dollar out of his pocket and held it out to the bum who snatched it and quickly secreted it among his rags he stops about a block from here in front of the allnight diner the bum pointed down the street i havent seen him go by today but i was sleeping thanks samson rose and started down the street the bum called after him hey kid come back tonight ill guard your back while you sleep if you buy a jug samson waved over his shoulder he wouldnt be back if he could avoid it a block away he joined a group of men who were waiting at the corner when a large gatesided truck pulled up the back already half full of mexicans the man who drove the truck got out and walked around to where the men were waiting he was short and brown and wore a straw stetson cowboy boots and thick black mustache over the sly grin of a chicken thief the men who worked for him called him patron but ironically the common term for his profession was coyote he scanned the group of men and made his choices with a nod and the crook of his finger the men chosen all hispanic jumped onto the back of the truck the coyote approached samson and grabbed him by the upper arm testing the muscle he said something in spanish samson panicked and answered him in crow im on the lam looking for a onearmed man that killed my wife to samsons surprise this seemed to satisfy the coyote the coyote had been smuggling illegal aliens into the country for five years and from time to time he encountered an indian from the south guatemala or honduras who could not speak spanish not being able to tell one indian language from another he assumed that samson was one of these all the better he thought it will take longer for him to find out after the coyote brought his men over the border he gave them a place to live two apartments in which they slept ten to a room food beans tortillas and rice and three dollars an hour for backbreaking work that most gringos would never consider doing he charged his customers eight dollars per manhour and pocketed the difference at the end of each week he paid his men in cash after deducting a healthy amount for food and lodging then drove them all to the post office where he helped them buy money orders to send home to their families leaving them nothing for themselves in this way the coyote could keep a crew under his thumb for three or four months before they found out that they could make more money working at menial jobs in restaurants or hotels then he would have to go back to mexico for another load lately however he had been augmenting his crew with mexicans who had found their own way over the border and this allowed him to stretch his time between border runs the work was the hardest samson had ever done and at the end of the first day back knotted and hands bloodied from swinging a pickax he slept in the back of the truck until the patron slapped him awake and led him into the apartment to show him his cot sleeping in a room with nine other people was nothing new to samson and the food although spicy was plentiful and good he fell asleep listening to the sad spanish love songs of his coworkers and feeling very much alone as the weeks passed he would hear the other men in the room whispering in the dark and this made him feel even more that he was the only person in a world of one he had no way of knowing that they were talking about him about how they never saw him send any money home and about how they could take his money and no one would know because he was a dumb indian and couldnt speak spanish samson listened and imagined that they were talking about their homes and missing their families he knew nothing of the latin quality of machismo which tacitly forbade the admission of a mans melancholy except in song the plan was to wait until the boy was taking a shower then go through his pants and take the money if he protested they would cut his throat and bury him on the large estate where they were terracing hills into formal gardens whether they would have really killed the boy was doubtful they were good men at heart and had only turned their minds to murder because it made them feel worldly and tough when the boy was gone their nocturnal whispers turned back to boasts of the women they would have the cars they would buy and the land they would own when they returned to mexico samson was saved on a hot afternoon when the owner of the estate approached the coyote while the crew was taking a break eating cold burritos in the shade of a eucalyptus tree immigration took one of the busboys in my restaurant the rich man said do any of your guys speak english ill pay you to let him go the coyote was shaking his head when samson spoke up i speak english the coyotes chickenstealing grin dropped like a rock he had thought that he would be able to hold on to the indian boy for a long time and here he had gone and learned english in his spare time the boy was worthless now better to cut the loss and see what he could get to quell their curiosity and dampen their ambition the coyote told the rest of the crew that the rich american had bought the boy for sexual purposes and they all grinned knowingly as they watched samson ride away in the long white lincoln samson found that it was easier to be mexican while working in the restaurant the work although fast paced was not heavy and he was given a cot in the storeroom to sleep on until he found a place of his own the owner was content with speaking a pidgin english peppered with spanish words and samson answered him by speaking a modified version of tontospeak by this time samson had also picked up a few essential spanish phrases where are the spoons we need more plates your sister fucks donkeys in tijuana which helped him make friends with the mexican dishwashers and cooks from the moment he had arrived in santa barbara a grinding homesickness began to settle in samsons heart when he lay in the dark storeroom at night waiting to fall asleep it would rise up and wash over him like a black tide carrying with it a slithering blind predator that gnashed at the last shreds of his hope forget what you know pokey had told him with this in mind he set to do battle with his rising hopelessness he refused to think of his family his home or his heritage instead he concentrated on the conversations he overheard in the restaurant as he cleared tables and poured coffee because he was mexican and a menial laborer he was invisible to the affluent santa barbara customers who spoke openly about the most intimate details of their lives oblivious to the spanish fly on the wall you know ashley has been having an affair with her plastic surgeon for six months and if i can get my legal ducks in a row i should be able to push the convention center through the city council and i want the bathroom southwestern but bob likes art nouveau so i called our attorney and i said i know the offshore drilling is ruining the coast but my exxon shares have split twice in two years so i said to my analyst susan and the kids went to tahoe so i thought it was the perfect chance to show marie the house the bitch spilled a whole bottle of massage oil in the hot tub and i dont give a damn whether they needed it or not if you do your job right you can sell air conditioners to eskimos need has nothing to do with it remember the three ms mesmerize motivate and manipulate youre not selling a need youre selling dreams samson said coming out of his shell to finish the sentence of a young insurance sales manager who had taken his agents to lunch so he could chew their ass samson surprised even himself by speaking up but the man at the table seemed to be giving the same speech that he had heard from the powderblue dream salesman he couldnt resist come here kid the man said he was wearing a washandwear suit as were the other five men at the table a halfdozen acrid aftershaves clashed among them whats your name samson looked around the table at the mens faces they were all white he decided at that moment to use a new name not the mexican name he had taken jose cuervo sam samson said sam hunter well sam he extended his hand my name is aaron aaron and ill bet with some training you could outsell every man at this table he put his arm around samsons shoulders and spoke to the rest of the group what do you say guys ill bet you each a hundred bucks that i can take a busboy with the right attitude and turn him into a better salesman than any of you hotshots inside of a month thats bullshit aaron the kids not even old enough to get a license he can work on my license ill sign his applications cmon hotshots do i have a bet the men fidgeted in their seats laughing nervously and trying to avoid aarons gaze knowing from aarons training that the first one to speak would lose finally one of them broke all right a hundred bucks but the kid has to do his own selling aaron looked at samson so kid are you ready to start a new job samson tried to imagine himself wearing a suit and smelling of aftershave and the idea appealed to him i dont have a place to stay he said ive been saving so i can get an apartment ive got it covered aaron said welcome aboard i guess i could give my notice fuck giving notice you only give notice if youre planning to come back youre not planning on moving backwards are you sam i guess not samson said at twentyfive aaron aaron had already accumulated fifteen years of experience in the art of deception from the time he skimped on the sugar at his first lemonade stand to the time he doubled the profits on his paper route by canceling his customers subscriptions then stealing the papers out of a vending machine to continue the deliveries aaron showed a neargenius ability for working in the gray areas between business and crime and by balancing dark desires with white lies he was able to sidestep the plague of catholic conscience that kept him from pursuing an honest career as a pirate which would have been his first choice aaron aaron was a salesman at first aarons only interest in samson was to use the boy as an instrument of embarrassment to the other salesmen but once he dressed the boy in a suit and had him trailing along on sales calls like a dutiful native gun bearer aaron found that he actually enjoyed the boys company the boys curiosity seemed boundless and answering his questions as they drove between calls allowed aaron to bask in the sound of his own voice while extolling the brilliance of his last successful presentation and too the rejection of a slammed door or a pointed no seemed softened in the sharing teaching the boy made him feel good and with this improvement in attitude he worked more sold more and allowed the boy to share in the prosperity buying him clothes and food finding him an apartment and cosigning for a loan on a used volvo for samson working under the tutelage of aaron was perfect aarons assumption that no one beside himself had the foggiest idea of how the universe worked allowed samson the opportunity to hear lectures on even the most minuscule details of society information he used to build himself into the image that aaron wanted to see samson delighted in aarons selfobsession for while the older man waxed eloquent on the virtues of being aaron it never occurred to him to ask samson about his past and the boy was able to surround himself in a chrysalis of questions and cheap suits until he was ready to emerge as a fullgrown salesman as the years passed and his memories of home were stowed and forgotten learning to sell became samsons paramount interest and aaron fascinated with seeing his own image mirrored and his own words repeated failed to notice that samson had become a better salesman than himself until other companies began approaching the boy with offers only then did aaron realize that most of his income was coming from the override commission on sams sales and that for five years sam had trained all the new salesmen to avoid losing his golden goose aaron offered sam a fiftyfifty partnership in the agency and with this added security the business became sams shelter now after twenty years with the business as his only security sam was going to aaron to sell his shares as he entered aarons office he felt a deep soulsickness that he had not felt since he had left the reservation aaron ill take forty cents on the dollar for my shares and i keep my office aaron turned slowly in the big executive chair and faced sam you know i couldnt come up with that kind of cash sam its a good move though id have to keep paying you out of override and with interest you wouldnt even take a cut in pay i dont think youre in a position to negotiate though in fact after the call i got this morning i think twenty cents on the dollar would be more than fair sam resisted the urge to dive over the desk and slap his partners bare scalp until it bled he had to take his fallback position sooner than he wanted to youre thinking that because spagnola can put me with the indian i have to sell right aaron nodded but just imagine that i ride this through aaron imagine that i dont sign off that the insurance commission suspends my license that criminal charges are filed and my name is in the paper every day guess whose name is going to be right next to mine and what happens if i maintain my association with the agency and the insurance commission starts looking into your files how many signatures have you traced over the years aaron how many people thought they were buying one policy only to find out that their signature showed up on a different one one that paid you a higher commission a sheen of sweat was appearing on aarons forehead youve done that as often as i have youd be hanging yourself thats the point aaron when i walked in here you were convinced that i was hung anyway im just making room for you on the gallows you ungrateful prick i took you in when you i know aaron thats why im giving you a chance to stay clean actually youve got more to lose than i do once your files are open then your income is going to become public knowledge oh aaron stood and paced around to the front of the desk oh he waved a finger under sams nose then turned and walked to the water cooler oh he kicked the cooler then returned to his chair sat down then stood up again oh he said it was as if the single syllable had stuck in his mouth he looked as if he were going to launch into a tirade blood rose in his face and veins bulged on his forehead oh he said he fell back in the chair and stared at the ceiling as if his brain had pushed the hold button on reality thats right aaron sam said after a moment the irs with that sam moved to the office door take your time aaron think about it talk it over with your buddy spagnola he can probably give you the current exchange rate of cigarettes for sodomy in prison aaron slowly broke his stare on the ceiling and turned to watch sam walk out in the outer office julia looked up from applying lacquer to her nails to see sam grinning his hand still on the doorknob whats with all the ohs sam julia asked it sounded like you guys were having sex or something something like that sam said his grin widening hey watch this he opened the door quickly and stuck his head back in aarons office hey aaron irs he said then he pulled the door shut muffling aarons scream of pain what was that julia asked that sam said was my teacher giving me the grade on my final exam i dont get it you will honey i dont have time to explain right now ive got a date sam left the office walking light and smiling feeling strangely as if the pieces of his life rather than fitting back together were jingling in his pocket like sleigh bells warning christmas chapter like gods own chocolate id lick her shadow off a hot sidewalk santa barbara in spite of the fact that he was losing his home and his business and was precariously close to having his greatest secret discovered by the police because of an indian god sam was not the least bit worried not with the prospect of an evening with calliope to occupy his thoughts no for once sam hunter was voting the eager ticket over the anxious taking anticipation over dread calliope lived upstairs in a cheesemoldgreen cinderblock duplex that stood in a row of a dozen identical structures where the last of santa barbaras working middle class were making their descent into poverty calliopes datsun was parked in the driveway next to a rusy vw station wagon and an ominouslooking harleydavidson chopper with a naked blond woman airbrushed on the gas tank sam paused by the harley before mounting the stairs the airbrushed woman looked familiar but before he could get a closer look calliope appeared on the deck above him hi she said she was barefoot wearing a white muslin dress loosely laced in the front a wreath of gardenia was woven into her hair youre just in time we need your help come on up sam took the stairs two at a time and stopped on the landing where calliope was wrestling with the latch on a rickety screendoor frame that was devoid of screening but had redwood lattice nailed across its lower half presumably to keep out the really large insects im having trouble with the dinner she said i hope you can fix it the screen door finally let loose with the jattering noise one associates with the impact of elmer fudds face on a rake handle calliope led sam into a kitchen done in the fabulous fifties motif of mint enamel over pink linoleum a haze of foulsmelling smoke hung about the ceiling and through it sam could make out the figure of a halfnaked man sitting in the lotus position on the counter drinking from a quart bottle of beer thats yiffer calliope said over her shoulder as she headed to the stove hes with nina yiffer vaulted off the counter on one arm fully eight feet across the kitchen to land lightly on his feet in front of sam where he engaged a complex handshake that left sam feeling as if his fingers had been braided together dude yiffer said shaking out his wild tangle of strawcolored hair as if the word had been stuck there feeling like a chameleon that has been dropped into a coffee can and is risking hemorrhage by trying to turn silver sam searched for the appropriate greeting and ended up echoing dude in jeans a sport shirt and boating moccasins with no socks sam felt grossly overdressed next to yiffer who wore only a pair of orange surf shorts and layer upon layer of tan muscle calliope biffed the grub dude yiffer said sam joined calliope at the stove where she was frantically biffing the grub i cant get the spaghetti to cook she said plunging a wooden spoon into a large saucepan from which the smoke was emanating the instructions said to boil for eight minutes but as soon as it starts to boil the smoke comes out sam waved the smoke from the pan arent you supposed to cook the noodles separately not in the sauce sam shook his head whoops calliope said im not a very good cook sorry well maybe we can salvage something sam removed the pan from the heat and peered in at the bubbling black magma then again maybe starting over would be a good idea he put the pan in the sink where a trail of ants was invading a used bowl of cereal sam turned on the water and started to swivel the faucet to wash the intruders away when calliope grabbed his hand no she said theyre okay theyll get into your food sam said i know theyve always been here i call them my kitchen pals kitchen pals sam tried to adjust his thinking she was right you couldnt just wash your kitchen pals down the drain like they were ants he felt like hed been saved from committing genocide so i guess we should start some more spaghetti she only bought one box dude yiffer said i guess we can eat salad and bread calliope said excuse me she kissed sam on the cheek and walked out of the kitchen while he stared at the ghost of her bottom through the thin dress so what do you do yiffer asked with a toss of his head im an insurance broker and you i surf and and what yiffer said sam thought he could hear the sound of the ocean whistling through yiffers ears as if through a seashell never mind he said he was distracted by the sound of a baby screaming in the next room thats grubb yiffer said sounds like hes pissed off unable to see the second b sam was confused i thought grub was biffed no grubb is calliopes rugrat go on in and meet him ninas in there with j nigel yiffworth esquire yiffer beamed with pride hes mine your attorney my son yiffer said indignantly oh sam said he resisted the urge to sit down on the floor and wait for his confusion to clear instead he walked into the living room where he found calliope sitting on an ancient sofa next to an attractive brunette who was breastfeeding an infant the sofa was lumpy enough to have had a body sewed into it stuffing spilled out of the arms where the victim had tried to escape on the floor nearby a somewhat older child was slung inside of a blue plastic donut on wheels which he was gaily ramming into everything in the room sam gasped as the child ran a wheel up over his bare ankle on a kamikaze rush to destroy the coffee table calliope said sam this is nina nina looked up and smiled and j nigel yiffworth esquire nina pulled the baby from her breast long enough to puppetmaster a nod of greeting from it which sam missed for some reason and that calliope continued pointing to the drunk driver in the blue donut thats grubb your son sam asked she nodded hes just learning to walk interesting name i named him after jane goodalls son she let him grow up with baboons very natural i was going to name him buddha but i was afraid that when he got older if someone met him on the road they might kill him right good thinking sam said pretending that he had the slightest idea of what she was talking about and that he wasnt wondering in the least who or where grubbs father was nina moved in when we were both pregnant calliope said we were each others lamaze coaches i was farther along though what about yiffer scum nina said he seems like a nice guy sam said and nina shot him an acid look as scum goes he quickly added he only lives here sometimes calliope said mostly when he doesnt have gas money for his van nina said were having a yard sale day after tomorrow to raise some money to get him out of here you might want to look at the stuff down in storage before the sale pick up a bargain before it gets picked over yiffer entered the living room munching on a loaf of french bread he stood next to sam and thrust the bread under sams chin bite no thanks sam said yiffer calliope said that bread was for all of us truth yiffer said he held the loaf out to calliope bite you ruined their dinner nina said letting j nigels head drop and wobble yiffer grinned around a mouthful of bread and gestured toward ninas exposed breast with his beer hand looking good babe nina reattached j nigel and said to sam im sorry hes only like this when hes awake to yiffer she said take some money out of my purse and go down to the corner and get a pizza sam reached for his wallet let me no calliope and nina said in unison cool yiffer exclaimed sandblasting sam with a spray of bread crumbs go nina commanded and yiffer turned and bounded out of the room in a moment sam heard the screen door open and footfalls on the steps sit down calliope said relax sam took a seat on the couch next to the two women and for the next forty minutes they exchanged pleasantries between the screaming demands of the babies until nina handed a damp j nigel to sam and left the room like most bachelors sam held a baby as if it were radioactive that fucking asshole nina shrieked from the other room frightening grubb who screamed like an airraid siren j nigel was following suit when nina returned to the living room her purse in hand he took my rent money the asshole took all my rent money can you guys watch j nigel for a minute ive got to go find him and kill him sure calliope said sam nodded adjusting j nigel for longterm holding nina left calliope turned to sam and over the din of screaming infants said alone at last i think j nigel needs changing sam said so does grubb lets take them into ninas room sam had slipped into the personality he referred to as tough and adaptable one he reserved for the more chaotic and bizarre situations he had encountered in his career i can do this he said with a grin he hadnt changed a baby since the days on the reservation when he used to help with his cousins but when he opened j nigels diaper the memory came back on him like a fetid whirlwind and he had to fight to keep from gagging the adhesive strips on disposable diapers were a completely new adventure and he found after a few minutes that he had diapered his left hand perfectly while a squirming j nigel remained naked to the world after changing grubb and returning him to his plastic donut calliope liberated sam from the diaper and started on j nigel who giggled and peed like an excited puppy at her touch sam sympathized dont feel bad she said the last time we let yiffer babysit he ducttaped j nigels diaper on and we had to use nailpolish remover to get the adhesive off i havent had much practice sam said you dont have any kids no ive never met anyone i wanted to have kids with sam wanted to smack himself for saying it remember tough and adaptable me either calliope said but grubb is the best thing that ever happened to me i used to drink and do a lot of drugs but as soon as i found out i was pregnant i stopped sam looked for an opening to ask about grubbs father but none came and the silence was becoming awkward thats great he said i had my own battle with the bottle actually it hadnt been much of a battle aaron had insisted that social drinking was part of the job but each time sam had gotten drunk he was haunted by the stereotype of the drunken indian that he thought he had left behind it had been ten years since hed had a drink im going to put these guys down calliope said why dont you go in the living room and put some music on in the living room sam found a briefcase full of loose cassette tapes most of the tapes were new age releases with enigmatic titles like tree frog whale song selections by artists with names like yanni volvofinder with further digging he found one called the language of love by a female jazz singer he liked but when he opened the box he found that the tape had been replaced with one called catbox nightmare by a band called satans smegma obviously a yifferesque selection finally he found the language of love languishing boxless in the bottom of the case and popped it into a portable stereo on a bricksandboards bookshelf calliope returned to the living room just as the first song was rising in the speakers oh i love this tape she said ive always wanted to make love to this tape ill be right back she left the room again and returned in a moment with an armload of pillows and blankets which she dropped in the middle of the floor grubb sleeps in my room and he wont be asleep for a while she began to spread the blankets out over the floor sam stood by trying to fight the objections that were rising in his mind about the speed at which things were progressing she just assumed that he would say yes it made him feel like well a slut then again if this beautiful girl wanted to make love with him who was he to object okay so he was a slut he was a tough and adaptable slut still there was one thing that bothered him what if yiffer and nina come home with the pizza oh i dont think theyll be home that soon this first time will be pretty fast hey sam thought he might have just been insulted but on second thought he realized that the girl had just voiced something that he had really been worrying about without even admitting it to himself on second thought she had relieved the pressure on him to perform calliope finished fluffing the pillows then unlaced her dress and let it drop to the floor she stepped out of it and went to the stereo where she turned up the volume then she crawled naked under the top blanket and pulled it up to her neck okay she said sam sat on the couch stunned she was stunning but where was the seduction the deception the sweet lies and tender posturing where was the hunt the catandmouse game sam just stared at her and thought this is entirely too honest are you okay she asked yes its just kind of you want me and i want you right who did she think she was you cant just go around blurting out the truth like a prophet with tourettes syndrome he said well i guess yeah thats right well she threw the covers back to make room for him sam leapt off the couch and fought his way out of his clothes he was under the covers taking her into his arms before his shirt settled to the floor at the touch of her skin her warmth he felt every muscle in his body tense then melt against her he kissed her for a long time with none of the fumbling or awkwardness that he expected he entered her and they began to move together in slow rhythm to the music calliope let out a long low moan and dug her fingers into the muscles of his back he joined her in the moan and pushed deeper losing suddenly any thoughts or images or reservations damn near losing consciousness to the warm dark rhythm a door slammed violently shaking the windows of the apartment sam pushed up on his arms what was that nothing she said pulling him down another door slammed louder than the first sam pushed up again theyre home no thats downstairs please she wrapped her legs around his back and pulled him tight distracted sam began to move again and calliope moaned a door slammed glass shattered and j nigel began crying in the front bedroom what in the hell was that nothing not now make love to me sam the house shook with the impact of a slamming door then another and grubb began to cry as well sam winced and came completely without pleasure sorry he said as he rolled over onto his back calliope stared at the ceiling for a moment as if she was bracing for the next impact when it came she leapt to her feet and stormed naked out onto the balcony she bent over the railing and shouted why are you doing this sam turned down the stereo and listened another door slammed shaking the house then a pathetic male voice came from below youve got someone up there you slut dont talk to me that way i dont act this way when you have someone down there sam wanted to join her on the balcony come to her defense hey buddy shes not the slut here but he couldnt seem to locate his pants you whore the male voice said im taking my son no youre not youll see the voice said another door slam sam flinched he was getting a little shellshocked trying to put the pieces of this mystery together between slams jerk calliope screamed she stormed inside slammed the door and breezed by sam on her way to tend to grubb and j nigel sam sat naked on the floor wishing for a cigarette or a clue and repeating his new mantra in his head tough and adaptable tough and adaptable in a few minutes after the door slams had dwindled to one every few minutes as if the guy downstairs was calming down then losing his temper in spurts calliope appeared in the doorway still naked we need to talk she said sam was dressed now desperately yearning for a cigarette but hed left them in the car and he wasnt about to pass the maniac downstairs without more information that would be good he said calliope picked up her dress and slipped it on then sat down on the couch youre probably wondering who that is downstairs for the first time she seemed really uncomfortable and sam felt for her its okay ive had some trouble with my neighbors recently it happens she smiled i used to be with him hes grubbs father i gathered that i was doing a lot of drugs then he was exciting riding his harley tattoos guns guns i left him when i found out i was pregnant he didnt want me to have the baby and he didnt want me to quit getting high but why move upstairs i didnt he moved in downstairs youre the first man that ive had over since the split i didnt know hed act this way why dont you move you know how santa barbara is i couldnt even pay rent here if it werent for nina let alone come up with first last and a cleaning deposit sam could see that she was still embarrassed you could ask the landlord to remove his doors it would be quieter im sorry i really wanted it to be nice maybe i should go despite the weirdness he didnt want to leave i wish you would stay when grubb goes to sleep we can go in my room if were quiet ill stay sam said he wont come up here and shoot us will he no i dont think so he keeps talking about getting custody of grubb killing us would look bad with the judge right sam said so what if she had been involved with a psycho at least it was a psycho who thought ahead calliope led sam down a hallway to her room at the back of the apartment ill get us some salad she said leaving sam to sit on the twin bed next to the crib where grubb was drowsily gnawing a pacifier the room looked like it had been decorated by a buddhist monk from sesame street on top of the dresser sat effigies of buddha shiva bert ernie and cookie monster as well as an incense burner a small gong and a box of pampers a stuffed mickey mouse on the dressing chair wore a necklace of quartz crystal and a rawhide ring that sam recognized as a navaho dream catcher the walls were hung with pictures of the dalai lama kali the destroyer and the smurfs looking around sam felt tempted to construct an excuse and bolt now that hed had a moment to think about it his tough and adaptable veneer was feeling pretty thin if he could just get back to normal for a while hed be okay then it hit him there was no normal to return to the controlled status quo that had been his life was no longer there it had been shattered by coyote and coyote was out there somewhere calliope and all the chaos around her had made him forget even with smurfs psychos and kitchen pals the forgetting was worth staying for chapter live via the spirit world satellite network santa barbara lonnie ray inman was sitting in a worn leather easy chair listening for noises to sift down from upstairs he had loaded and unloaded his colt python magnum four times nervously fumbling its deadly weight as he alternately entertained fantasies of vengeance and prison every few minutes he would rise and go to the window to see if the black mercedes was still parked out front then he would pause at the front closet where he opened and slammed the door until the violence in his heart subsided enough for him to sit again he was short and dark and muscles stood out on his bare arms like cables the front of his black tank top was soaked with blood where he had ripped the skin of his chest with his fingernails trying to destroy the tattoo of a naked woman the same woman whose picture was airbrushed on the tank of his harley the same woman who had turned his thoughts to murder lonnie ray inman dropped six cartridges into the cylinder of the python and snapped it shut determined this time to make it out the door and up the stairs where he would burst through the door and kill calliopes new lover fuck prison a thousand miles away ten thousand feet up in the bighorn mountains pokey medicine wing watched lonnie loading the gun pokey was into the second day of his fast and had been searching the spirit world for clues to the whereabouts of his favorite nephew samson hunts alone he had called for his spirit helper old man coyote to help him but the trickster had not appeared instead he was seeing a white city with red roofs and palm trees and a man who wanted to murder samson pokeys body sat dangerously close to death in the middle of a twohundredfoot stone medicine wheel the holiest of the crow fasting places just west of sheridan wyoming pokey had been under the hoof of a bullmoose hangover when he began the fast and now the dry mountain wind was sucking the last lifewater from his body alone in the spirit world pokey was unaware of his heart struggling to pump his thickening blood he looked for a way to warn samson and called out for old man coyote to help coyote was in the locker room of the santa barbara ywca when he heard pokeys call he had entered as a horsefly and after watching the women in the showers for a while had changed himself into a baby hedgehog and was rolled into a ball in the soap dish imitating a loofah lazy by nature coyote had given his medicine to only three people since time began pokey samson and a warrior named burnt face who had built the ancient medicine wheel so it took him a while to realize that he was being called reluctantly he left the hedgehog body in the capable hands of a soapy aerobics instructor and went to the spirit world where he found pokey waiting what coyote said old man coyote i need your help i know coyote said you are dying no i need to find my nephew samson but you are dying i am shit you should end this fast now old man but what about samson ive been helping samson dont worry but he has an enemy who is going to kill him i saw him but i dont know where he is i know he has enemies i am coyote i know everything whats this guy look like hes white he has a gun that narrows it down he has a tattoo of a woman on his chest its bleeding he looks out a window and sees a motorcycle and a black car thats all i know do you have any water on the mountain where your body is no theres a little snow i will help you coyote said go now suddenly pokey was back in his body sitting on the mountain in his lap he found a package of dry koolaid that had not been there before he looked down at it and smiled then fell forward into the dirt in the shower of the ywca a naked aerobics instructor screamed and ran into the locker room when the loofah she was using turned into a raven the bird circled the locker room twice and nipped her on the bottom with its beak before flying down the hall into the lobby and out an open skylight across town calliope took the empty salad bowl from sam and set it on the dresser next to a statue of buddha more she asked no im full sam whispered grubb had fallen asleep in his crib and sam didnt want to risk waking him calliope he said is this guy dangerous lonnie no he thinks hes tough because hes in a biker club but i dont think hes dangerous his friends are a little scary though they take a lot of pcp and it makes them spiritually dense i hate that sam said proud because he was spiritually dense without the aid of drugs im going to take the dishes out and check on j nigel why dont you light some candles i dont think we should turn on the stereo though it might irritate lonnie we wouldnt want that sam said outside a raven landed on the hood of sams car lonnie ray saw it from his window shit on it shit on it he said but as he watched the raven seemed to disappear lonnie slammed the closet door until the doorframe splintered coyote was a mosquito making his way through the air vents of the mercedes he flew out of the defroster vent and settled on the drivers seat where he became a man sams rolodex was on the passenger seat next to his pack of cigarettes coyote lit a cigarette and flipped through the rolodex until he found the card he was looking for he removed it and tucked it into the waist of his buckskins lonnie ray was rattling through the kitchen cabinets looking for liquor when he heard the pounding at his front door on his way through the living room he snatched the python off the easy chair and shoved it in his jeans at the small of his back he threw open the door and was nearly knocked down by the indian who brushed him aside on the way into the room the indian looked around the room and wheeled on lonnie ray where is he wheres the bastard hiding lonnie ray recovered his balance and dropped his right hand to the grip of the colt who the fuck are you dont worry about it wheres the guy that drives that mercedes in spite of his own anger lonnie ray was intrigued what do you want him for thats my business but if he owes you money youd better get it back before i find him you going to kill him lonnie asked if hes lucky the indian said you got a gun i dont need a gun now where is he chill man i might be able to help you out i dont have time for this the indian said ill just catch him at his house you know where he lives lonnie ray asked this was like a gift from heaven he could send the indian up to calliopes to do the dirty work no risk no prison if it didnt work he and the boys could surprise the guy at his house tomorrow no witnesses lonnie ray hadnt really relished the idea of having to shoot calliope anyway yeah i know where the bastard lives the indian said but he aint there hes somewhere around here you give me his address ill tell you where he is fuck that the indian said shoving lonnie against the wall youll tell me now lonnie brought the barrel of the python up under the indians chin i dont think so the indian froze its on a card in my pants lonnie ray held out his free hand dont ever tell someone you dont have a gun dipshit the indian lifted his buckskin shirt pulled a card from his waistband and handed it to lonnie ray who glanced at it and spun the indian around by one shoulder pointing him out the door lonnie ground the barrel of the python into the indians spine stood on his toes and whispered threateningly into the indians ear you didnt come here and you didnt see me you understand the indian nodded hes upstairs lonnie whispered now go he shoved the indian out the door and never never fuck with a brother of the guild lonnie closed the door fucking a he said with a giggle upstairs calliope said tell me what you know sam about what about anything she sat down next to him on the bed and brushed his hair back with her fingers tell me what you know the silence that followed would have been awkward except calliope seemed to expect it she stroked his hair while he tried to think of what to say he sorted through facts and figures and histories and strategies clever retorts meaningless jokes sophistries and non sequiturs rose in his mind and fell unspoken she rubbed his neck and found a knot in the muscle that she worked her fingertips into that feels good sam said thats what you know a smile rose to sams lips yes he said what do you want she asked he shot her a sideways glance and saw the candlelight gleaming in her eyes she was serious waiting for an answer is this a test no what do you want why dont you ask me what i do for a living where i live where im from how old i am you dont even know my last name would that stuff tell me who you are sam turned to face her and took her hand from his neck he still had a niggling mistrust of her and he wanted to let it go the truth now calliope are you part of something he cooked up some trick no whos he never mind sam turned away from her again stared at a candle flame on the dresser and tried to think she really didnt know about coyote what now well what do you want she asked again he snapped dammit i dont know she didnt recoil or seem hurt but began rubbing his neck again you came here because you wanted me didnt you no yes i guess i did it wasnt bad enough that she had to keep telling the truth now she was expecting it back and he was out of practice weve had sex do you want to go now christ she was like some gorgeous new age district attorney no i do you want a bowl of chocolate marshmallow ice cream that would be great sam said off the hook no further questions your honor see its not that hard to figure out what you want she got up and left the room heading for the kitchen again sam sat back and waited realizing that it had been some time since a door had slammed downstairs suddenly he was very uncomfortable with the silence when he heard footfalls on the stairs outside he leapt to his feet and ran to the kitchen chapter a white picket fence around chaos santa barbara sam hit the kitchen just as yiffer stepped through the screenless section of the screen door cool ice cream yiffer said staggering to calliopes side at the counter keep it down yiffer i just got grubb and j nigel down calliope picked up two full bowls of ice cream and nodded to the carton on the counter you can have the rest bitchin yiffer grabbed a serving spoon from the empty salad bowl and dug into the ice cream shoveling a baseballsized clump into his mouth sam watched in amazement as yiffer mouthed the ice cream until he got his jaws closed around it then swallowed the whole clump dipping his head snakelike to facilitate the passage oh shit man yiffer said as he dropped the spoon and bent over grabbing the bridge of his nose major ice cream headache ouch sam heard footsteps on the stairs outside ran to the door and popped his head out to see who was coming ready to duck back inside should it be the crazed biker from downstairs to his relief nina was trudging up the steps obviously a little drunk herself did yiffer come home sam said hes punishing himself with ice cream as we speak ill kill him she ran the rest of the way up the steps and sam helped her wrestle the door open then he stepped out of harms way as she stormed by him to yiffer who was still bent over now holding his temples you jerk nina shrieked who was that woman at the bar and where the hell is my money babe im in pain here im suffering nina raised her fist as if to hammer yiffers back then she spotted the serving spoon picked it up and began whacking the surfer unmercifully on the head with it you want pain whack ill give you pain whack whack whack suffering whack you wouldnt whack know whack suffering whack if whack well calliope said i guess you guys need a little space cmon sam she led sam out of the kitchen and back to her bedroom they sat eating and listening to yiffer whining under ninas attack after a few minutes she was losing momentum and yiffers whines turned to moans soon nina was moaning with him rhythmically sam stared at the candle on the dresser as if he hadnt noticed they do this all the time calliope offered i think nina gets in touch with that male energy that equates violence and sex excuse me hitting yiffer makes her horny oh sam said he flinched at the sound of breaking dishes from the kitchen nina screamed oh yes you asshole yes yiffer groaned the house shook with the sound of a door slamming downstairs and j nigel joined the din with a wail of his own lonnie must think that were doing it calliope said do you think hell give us time to explain before he shoots us dont think about it calliope stood and stepped out of her dress then gestured for sam to take off his shirt the moaning in the kitchen was rising in intensity and j nigel was wailing like a siren the windows rattled with a salvo of door slams sam looked at her and thought a bowl of ice cream a load of loonies and thou now he said are you sure calliope nodded she pulled his shirt off then pushed him back on the bed and took off his shoes sam let her undress him as he tried to put the noise out of his mind as she pulled the sheet over him and crawled in beside him he imagined the two of them being shot in the act when she kissed him he barely felt it in the crib next to them grubb began to stir and with the next series of door slams and a crash from the kitchen he came awake crying despite calliopes soft warmth against him and the smell of jasmine on her hair sam was unable to respond hell be okay calliope said she stroked sams cheek and kissed him gently on the forehead ill be back in a second sam said he got up and wrapped his shirt around his hips then checking the hallway he darted out of the room and into the bathroom he closed the door behind him and leaned against it staring blankly at the ceiling the sex sounds from the kitchen reached a crescendo with a piercing scream from nina then stopped leaving only the sounds of crying babies and slamming doors sam took a deep breath i cant do this he said to himself this is too weird too fucking weird he lowered the lid of the toilet and sat facing the shower stall assuming the posture of rodins thinker for once in his life it really seemed to matter that the sex be good but this was like a combat zone i cant do this he said sure you can a voice said from behind the shower curtain sam screamed and jumped to the top of the toilet tank coyote stepped out of the shower holding a beaded leather pouch what in the hell are you doing here sam asked im here to help coyote said well get out of here i dont need your help you are wasting that woman do you have any idea what is going on around here listen another door slammed and nina resumed shouting at yiffer from what sam could make out it had something to do with the yard sale you must leave here then coyote said you must find a place on the womans body and live there hear only her breath smell only her scent if you dont get out of here i wont even have a chance what if she sees you how could i explain your being here thinking about it sam realized that if he told calliope that there was an ancient trickster god in her bathroom she would accept it without question would probably ask for an introduction coyote held out the beaded pouch put this on your member what is it sam asked taking the pouch passion powder it will make you as strong and stiff as a lance sam shook the contents of the pouch a fine brown powder into the palm of his hand he sniffed it what is it corn pollen cedar sweet grass sage powdered elk semen it is an old and powerful recipe try it no way you want the woman to think you are not a man if i try it will you go coyote grinned put just a pinch on your member and you will pleasure the woman to tears and youll go coyote nodded sam tentatively took a pinch of the powder and began to sprinkle it on his penis calliope opened the bathroom door catching sam in midsprinkle you wont need that honey she said im on the pill but sam looked around for coyote but the trickster was gone i was just being responsible calliope said thank you now come to bed she took his hand and led him out of the bathroom sam submitted glancing over his shoulder for signs of coyote yiffer and nina had taken the fight to their bedroom nina was calling yiffer an idiot and going on about a newspaper ad being misplaced a door slammed downstairs and yiffer stormed out of the bedroom im going to kick his ass he shouted in the hall he looked up at calliope and sam as he passed hi kids he said then he proceeded down the hall sam could hear the kitchen screen door ripping off the hinges as yiffer went through youre history biker boy calliope pulled sam into the bedroom and closed the door shouldnt we call the police or something sam asked no hell be okay lonnies afraid of yiffer he wont fight him and hes afraid to shoot him because of jail oh everythings fine then sam said come to bed calliope said sam shot a glance to grubb who was lying quietly on his side staring suspiciously at sam over the edge of a pacifier as if saying what are you doing with my mom can we blow out the candles sam asked without a word calliope blew out the candles and pulled sam down on top of her on the bed outside the sounds of nina screaming down from the top of the stairs yiffer pounding on lonnies door and j nigel crying for attention faded into white noise you must find a place on the womans body and live there in the dark the noise far away sam ran his hands over calliopes body and the world of work and worry seemed to move away he found two depressions at the bottom of her back where sunlight collected and he lived there out of the wind and the noise he grew old there died and ascended to the great spirit found heaven in her cheek on his chest the warm wind of her breath across his stomach carried sweet grass and sage and in another lifetime he lived on the soft skin under her right breast his lips riding light over the ridge and valley of every rib shuffling through downy dewdamp hairs like a child dancing through autumn leaves on the mountain of her breast he fasted at the medicine wheel of her aureole received a vision that he and she were steam people mingled wet with no skin separating them and there he lived happy and for the first time in years he felt that he was home she followed traveled lived with him and in him as he was in her they lived lifetimes and slept and dreamed together it was swell chapter shadowphobia saturday morning josh spagnola was sleeping in and dreaming of putting shampoo into bunnies eyes when the harleydavidson crashed through his front door carrying a pound pissedoff speedcrazed biker named tinker with the crash and thunder of the bike in his living room spagnola sat up in his nest of satin sheets thinking earthquake listening for the sounds of his burglar alarms which did not come spagnolas house was wired six ways to stop an elegant picklock or spry cutpurse from entering by stealth sneak or catspaw he had in fact protected himself against someone exactly like himself that anyone would break in on a battering ram of milwaukee iron in broad daylight had never occurred to him tinker on the other hand took the words breaking and entering quite literally and found entering a rather empty experience without substantial breaking he carried on his belt a policemans riot baton a blackjack two hunting knives and a set of brass knuckles in a rare moment of sanity he had left his guns at home his lawyer had advised against guns while on probation tinker had received an earlymorning call from lonnie ray one of his brothers in the guild you want him dead tinker had asked lonnie no just fuck him up and dont wear your colors i dont want any connection to me is he big tinker had a deepseated fear of someday meeting someone as large and violent as himself i dont know just wait until i call youll see the black mercedes you got it bro tinker said and hung up tinker tried to wait for lonnies call but hed been up all night cooking up a batch of methedrine in the guilds lab and had lost his patience after sampling the product in order to take the edge off the case of beer hed drunk at daybreak his bloodlust got the better of him and he left in the bedroom hearing a harley do burnouts on his berber carpet spagnola finally realized that something was seriously wrong he leapt from bed and began searching through a trail of clothes he had left last night on the way to bed with the tuesdaythursdaysaturday masseuse from the cliffs he remembered kicking his gun belt away from the bedroom door when he sent her home at midnight and scrambled to the door he was bending to unholster the gun when tinker kicked the door open catching spagnola square in the forehead knocking him cold tinker looked down at the naked unconscious little man and let out a sigh the absence of terror was wildly unsatisfying for him as a gesture of brotherhood to lonnie he pulled the baton from his belt and with two vicious blows broke both of spagnolas legs then he sulked out of the bedroom mounted his bike and rode to the guilds clubhouse to watch saturdaymorning cartoons sam awoke to yiffer yelling get down dont let them see you sam looked around the room calliope and grubb were gone he got up and reached for his watch on the dresser while shouts and whispers continued from the living room six in the morning it must have gone on all night the shouting the pounding the babies crying he was lucky to have slept at all he dressed and walked into the living room get down yiffer said dont let them see you sam dropped to a crouch in the doorway nina and calliope were huddled under the front windows holding the babies yiffer was crouched by the door that led to the balcony he rose up to peek out the window then instantly dropped to cover what is it sam said is someone shooting nina said no its the garage sale people stay down good morning calliope said did you sleep well fine who are the garage sale people theyre fucking predators yiffer said they keep circling like sharks look yiffer gestured to the window sam duckwalked to the window and peeked over the edge dodge darts and ford escorts were cruising slowly by stopping in front of the house then moving slowly on nina said yiffer put the ad in the paper for our yard sale with the wrong date theyre all looking for us five of them have been to the door already yiffer said whatever you do dont answer it theyll tear us apart probably ten of them went to lonnies door and left when he didnt answer calliope said what happened with lonnie sam said yiffer rose up and peeked out the window christ theres a whole van full of them outside he dropped to a sitting position his back to the door to sam he said lonnie didnt answer when i went down there last night as soon as he heard me come back upstairs he got on his bike and left nina said how long are they going to circle i have to go to work today theyre never going to leave yiffer wailed hopelessly theyre going to just wait and pick us off one by one were doomed were doomed nina slapped yiffer across the face get a grip sam could think of only one thing the cigarettes on the seat of his car he had gone sixteen hours without a smoke and was feeling as if he would snap like yiffer in a few minutes if he didnt get some nicotine into his system im going out there he said he felt like john wayne before the lung cancer no dude dont do it yiffer pleaded im going sam stood up and yiffer covered his head as if expecting an explosion sam picked up grubbs plastic donut on wheels can i borrow this sure calliope said are you coming back sam paused for a minute then smiled and took her hand definitely he said i just need to take a shower and handle a few things ill call you okay calliope nodded youll never see him alive again yiffer whined nina looked up apologetically he had a lot to drink last night im sorry if our fighting disturbed you no problem sam said nice meeting you both he turned and walked through the kitchen and out the door as he went down the steps the van that yiffer had spotted screeched to a halt in front of the duplex and a dozen grayhaired ladies piled out and rushed him they met at the bottom of the steps wheres the sale one said this is the right address we checked it twice wheres the bargains the ad said bargains sam held the plastic donut up before them this is it ladies im sorry but everything was gone but this when i got here we were all too late the quick and the dead you know a collective moan came from the mob then one shouted ill give you ten bucks for it twelve another shouted twelve fifty sam gestured for them to be quiet no i need this he said solemnly he hugged the donut to his chest their purpose gone they milled around for a moment then gradually wandered back to the van sam stood for a moment watching them the other garage sale people who had been circling the block saw them leaving and sam could almost feel the disappointment settling into their collective consciousness as they broke pattern and drove off great night coyote said sams nerves had been so worn from the night and morning that he didnt even jump at the voice by his ear he looked over his shoulder to see coyote in his black buckskins and a huge white tengallon cowboy hat nice hat sam said im in disguise swell sam said i cant get rid of you can i can you wipe off your shadow thats what i thought sam said lets go the shogun of the big sky samurai golf course and hot springs was worried his name was kiro yashamoto he was driving his wife and two children in a rented jeep station wagon up a winding mountain road to look at an ancient indian medicine wheel the day before kiro had purchased two thousand acres of land with hot springs and trout stream near livingston montana for roughly the price he would have paid for a studio apartment in tokyo the deal did not worry him after the golf course and health club were built he would recoup his investment in a year from the droves of japanese tourists who would come there his children worried him during this trip kiros son tommy who was fourteen and his daughter michiko who was twelve had both decided that they wanted to attend american universities and live in the united states tommy wanted to run general motors and michiko wanted to be a patent attorney as he drove kiro listened to his children discussing their plans in english they paused only when kiro pointed out some natural wonder at which time they would dutifully acknowledge the interruption before returning to their conversation it had been the same at the custer battlefield the grand canyon and even disneyland where the children marveled at the machinations of commerce and missed those of magic my children are monsters kiro thought and i am responsible perhaps if i had read them the haikus of basho when they were little instead of that american manifesto of highpressure sales green eggs and ham kiro steered the jeep around a long gradual curve that rounded the peak of the mountain and the medicine wheel came into view huge stones formed spokes almost two hundred feet long in the center of the wheel a tattered figure lay prostrate in the dirt look father michiko said they have hired an indian to take tickets and he has fallen asleep on the job kiro got out of the jeep and walked cautiously toward the center of the wheel hed learned a lesson in caution when tommy had nearly been trampled in yellowstone national park while trying to videotape a herd of buffalo tommy and michiko ran to their fathers side while mrs yashamoto stayed in the car and checked off the medicine wheel on the itinerary and maps tommy panned the camcorder as he walked its just rocks father so is the zen garden at kyoto just rocks but you could make a wheel of rocks at your golf course and people wouldnt have to drive up here to see them you could hire a japanese to take tickets so you wouldnt lose revenue they reached the indian and tommy put the camcorder on the macro setting for a closeup look he has fallen asleep with his face on the ground kiro bent and felt the indians neck for a pulse michiko bring water from the jeep tommy put down that camera and help me turn this man over he is sick they turned the indian over and cradled his head on kiros rolledup jacket he found a beaded wallet in the indians overalls and handed it to tommy look for medical information michiko returned with a bottle of evian water and handed it to her father mother says that we should leave him here and go get help she is worried about a lawsuit for improper care kiro waved his daughter away and held the water to the indians lips this man will not live if we leave him now tommy pulled a square of paper from the beaded wallet he unfolded it and his face lit up father this indian has a personal letter from lee iacocca the president of chrysler tommy please look for medical information his name is pokey medicine wing listen dear mr medicine wing thank you for your recent suggestion for the naming of our new line of light trucks it is true that we have had great success with our dakota line of trucks as well as the cherokee comanche and apache lines of our jeepeagle division but after investigation by our marketing department we have found that the word crow has a negative connotation with the carbuying public we also found that the word absarokee was too difficult to pronounce and children of the largebeaked bird was too long and somewhat inappropriate for the name of a truck in answer to your question we are not aware of any royalties paid to the navaho tribe by the mazda corporation for the use of their name and we do not pay royalties to the comanche cherokee or apache tribes as these words are registered trademarks of the jeep corporation while your proposed boycott of chrysler products by the crow tribe and other native americans saddens us deeply research has determined that they do not represent a large enough demographic to affect our profits please accept the enclosed blanket in thanks for bringing this matter to our attention sincerely lee iacocca ceo chrysler corporation kiro said tommy put down the letter and help me sit him up so he can drink tommy said if he knows lee iacocca he will be good to have as a contact father not if he dies oh right tommy dropped to his knees and helped kiro lift pokey to a sitting position kiro held the bottle to pokeys lips and the old mans eyes opened as he drank after a few swallows he pushed the bottle away and looked up at tommy i burned the blanket he said smallpox then he passed out chapter five faces of coyote blue ever since the morning adeline eats had found the frostcovered liar in the grass behind wileys food and gas there had been a screech owl sitting atop the power pole in front of her house sitting there like feathered trouble in addition black cloud follows had blown a water pump all of her kids were coming down with the flu her husband milo had gone off to a peyote ceremony and she was trying desperately to stay out of hell it was unfair she thought that her new faith was being tested before the paint was even dry she wanted the owl to go away and take her bad luck with it but to a good christian an owl was just an owl only a traditional crow believed in the bad luck of owls a good christian would just go out there and shoo that old owl away of course it wouldnt bother a good christian adeline had come to christianity the same way she had come to sex and smoking through peer pressure thinking about her six kids and her smokers hack she wondered if perhaps peer pressure didnt always lead to the best habits her sisters had all converted and they had referred to her as the heathen of the family until she caved in and accepted christ now only three weeks after being washed in the blood of the lamb she was already backsliding like a dog surprised down a skunk hole the owl adeline looked out the front window to check on the owl he was still there had he winked at her she had pinned up her hair and was wearing sunglasses and a pair of milos overalls hoping the owl wouldnt recognize her until she figured out what to do she was tempted to pray to jesus to make the owl go away but if she did that she would be admitting that she believed in the old ways and shed go to hell there was no hell in the old ways then again she could load up milos shotgun walk out in the yard and turn that old owl into pink mist she couldnt see herself doing that either no telling what kind of trouble that would unleash and she couldnt wait for milo and ask him for help not after weeks of working on him to leave the native american church and trade in his peyote buttons for wafers and wine she ducked away from the window one of the kids coughed in the other room eventually she was going to have to take them down to the clinic for treatment but she was afraid to pass by the owl according to the priest god knew everything the sunglasses and hairdo wouldnt fool god god knew she was afraid so he knew she still had faith in the old ways so she was going to hell as sure as if shed been out all morning worshiping golden calves and graven images i got bad medicine from being crow she thought and im going to hell for being christian i should have let that old liar pokey freeze to death she slapped herself on the forehead damn another hell thought a nun with an uzi popped up on the parapet of notre dame like a ninja penguin coyote shot from the hip winging her before she could fire she tumbled over the side bounced off a gargoyle and splattered on the sidewalk below a synthesized gregorian chant began to play as her spirit rose to heaven a steel ruler in hand coyote strafed a stainedglass window and took out a bazookawielding bishop for two thousand penance points sam walked into the bedroom hair wet a towel wrapped around his hips nice shot sam said coyote glanced up from the video game the red ones have killed me three times those are cardinals you have to hit them twice to kill them wait until you get to the vatican level the pope has guiltbeam vision before coyote could look back to the screen the cathedral doors flew open and st patrick fired a wiggling salvo of heatseeking vipers hit your smart bomb sam said coyote fumbled with the control but was too late a snake latched onto his leg and exploded the screen flashed game over and a synthesized voice instructed coyote to go to confession coyote dropped the control onto the bed with a sigh sam said you did good gunning for nuns is a hard game for beginners i should have brought some cheating medicine my cheating medicine never fails this isnt like the hand game this is a game of skill who needs skill when you can have luck sam shook his head and turned to go back to the bathroom during the night something inside him had changed each time he thought things had reached a plateau of weirdness something even weirder had happened the result he realized was that he was now accepting anything that happened no matter how weird without resistance chaos was the new order in his life the phone rang and sam hoping it was calliope grabbed the receiver off the vanity samuel hunter he said you lowlife scumsucking shithead good morning to you too josh you win dickhead therell be a meeting of the coop association tonight theyll vote you back in you can keep your apartment but i want your guarantee that this is over okay i hope you know ive lost all respect for you as a professional sam the doctor says im going to walk with a limp for the rest of my life there was a crooked man who had a crooked you broke my legs my house is destroyed sam peeked into the bedroom where coyote was attacking the sistine chapel with a helicopter gunship josh i dont know what youre talking about but im glad you came to your senses fuck you im using up years of collected dirt to get your apartment back townhouse sam corrected not apartment dont fuck with me sam im in a cast up to my nipples and a sadistic nurse has been forcefeeding me green jello for an hour just tell me its over its over sam said the phone clicked sam walked back into the bedroom what did you do to spagnola coyote was rolling on the bed in exaggerated body english to tilt the gunship these birds are eating my tail rotor i cant control it uhoh st francis released the doves of death youre dead meat sam took a cigarette from the pack on the dresser and offered one to coyote what did you do to spagnola you said you wanted your old life back so you broke spagnolas legs it was a trick you cant just go around breaking peoples legs like some mafioso fairy godmother the gunship spun out of control and crashed on the mezzanine coyote threw the joystick at the screen and turned to sam how can i win if you keep talking to me you whine like an old woman i got you your house back i wouldnt have lost it if you had left me alone be logical what gods do you know that are logical name two never mind sam said he went to the closet and pulled his clothing out for the day coyote said do you have a light no no after i stole fire from the sun and gave it to your people why coyote why did you do that sam turned to point out the lighter on the dresser but the trickster was gone calliopes upbringing in the eastern religions with their emphasis on living in the now of acting not thinking had left her totally unprepared to do battle with the future shed tried to ignore it even after grubb was born but it had become more and more difficult to function on karmic autopilot now sam had entered her life and she felt like she had something to lose the future had a name she wondered what she had done to manifest the curse of a nice guy it feels wonderful but i want more calliope said i dont get it nina said they were cleaning up the kitchen grubb was scooting around on the linoleum at their feet tasting the baseboards a table leg a slowmoving bug ive always felt separate from men even during sex its like theres this part of me that watches them and im not really involved but it wasnt that way with sam it was like we were really together no barriers i wasnt watching him i was with him when we were finished i lay there watching the pulse on his neck and it was like we had gone to some other world together i wanted more so youre saying youre a hosebeast not like that it was just that i want to feel that way all the time i want my whole life to feel complete im sorry calliope i dont get it im happy if yiffer doesnt pass out before we finish i guess its not a sexual thing its a spiritual thing like theres a part of life that i can touch but i cant live in maybe we just need to find a house where your ex doesnt live downstairs that was pretty awful i couldnt believe sam didnt just leave nina threw a dish towel at calliope and missed you had a little good luck for a change accept it not every guy has to be a creep like lonnie im a little afraid to leave grubb with him when i go to work today lonnie wont hurt grubb he was just pissed that you were with someone else men are like that even when they dont want you they dont want anyone else to have you nina do you think theres something wrong with me no youre just not very good at worrying youll get the hang of it ive got to get back to the house lonnie said to cheryl who was pouring peroxide on his damaged chest she wiped away the foam with a tissue then poked the wound with a broken black fingernail ouch what are you doing bitch cheryl got up from the bed and pulled on a pair of leather pants lonnie could see her hipbones and shoulder blades pushing against her pale skin as if they would poke through any second youre always thinking of her never me what the hell is wrong with me she turned to face him and he stared at her breasts lying like flaps against her ribs she pulled back her lips in a snarl and lonnie knew his face had betrayed him fucking asshole she said pulling on a black harleydavidson tshirt its not her its the kid hes my kid i have to watch him when she goes to work bullshit then why wont you fuck me she tossed her head and her long black hair fell into her face like seaweed on the drowned because you look like you just escaped from fucking auschwitz lonnie thought hed been with cheryl for three months and had never seen her eat as far as he could figure she lived on speed come and pepsi he said i worry about the kid then get custody i can take care of him id make a good mother right you dont think so you think that vegetarian bitch is a better mother than me no you start treating me right or im gone cheryl took a purse from the floor and began digging in it where the fuck is my stash she threw the purse aside and stormed out of the room lonnie followed her carrying the denim vest sporting the guilds colors ive got to go he said cheryl was dumping a bindle of white powder into a can of pepsi bring back some crank she said as lonnie walked out she added tink called while you were sleeping he said to tell you he took care of things outside lonnie fired up his harley and pulled out into the street tinkers news should have cheered him up but it didnt he felt empty like he needed to get fucked up he always felt that way lately at one time being a brother in the guild being accepted for who he was had been enough having all the women and drugs and money and power he needed had been enough but since grubb was born he felt like he was supposed to be doing something and he didnt know what it was maybe the bitch is right he thought as long as the kid tied him to calliope he was going to feel shitty it was time to feel good again frank cochran the cofounder of motion marine inc had spent most of the morning in his office milling over the bane of his existence the human factor frank loved organization routine and predictability he liked his life to be linear moving forward from event to event without the nasty backtracking caused by surprises the human factor was his name for the variable of unpredictability that was added to the equation of life by human beings today the human factor was represented by his partner jim cable who was in the hospital after being attacked by an indian franks thinking went thus if jim dies therell be insurance hassles legal battles with the family and someone will have to comfort jims mistress but if jim lives maybe jims mistress should be comforted anyway his train of thought was broken by the buzz of the intercom on his desk mr cochran his secretary said theres a man from narc here to see you i dont have any appointments until after lunch do i the office door burst open and cochran looked up to see an indian in black buckskins striding toward him his secretary was shouting protests from her desk cochran spoke into the intercom stella do i have an appointment with this man native american reform coalition coyote said i understand that some insurance agent is taking credit for what happened to your partner cochran had a very bad feeling about this look i dont know who you are but i dont like surprises then this is going to be a very bad day for you coyote slammed the door behind him a very bad day the trickster extended his right hand nice to meet you cochran watched in horror as the indians hand began to sprout fur and claws chapter nevermore santa barbara when sam walked into his office gabriella met him with a cup of coffee mr hunter id like to apologize for my behavior yesterday i dont know what came over me thats okay i do i hope you were able to resolve the difficulties at the cliffs sam wasnt prepared for civility from gabriella it was like encountering a polite scorpion life was changing before his eyes everythings fine any calls just mr aaron she checked her message pad he would like you to stop into his office if it wouldnt be too much trouble exact words yes sir my my has the sugarplum fairy been through here today gabriella checked the pad no message sir sam smiled and walked away down the hall julia told

talk aaron dismissed sams comment with a wave thats all behind us buddy cochrans lawyer called there isnt going to be any lawsuit you and i are square what happened sam knew he should be elated at the news but instead he felt dread for a moment he had relished the idea of giving up all the pretending now what no explanation they just backed off they apologized for the mistake youll get a formal apology in the mail tomorrow i never doubted you kid not for a minute aaron did you talk to spagnola today just briefly just a social call he was pretty heavily medicated im not sure i trust him sam you want to watch your back around that guy hes unstable sam felt his ears heat up with anger aaron expected him to act like the betrayal had never happened there was a time when he would have but not now forty cents on the dollar plus interest aaron lost his friendlyguy salesmans smile but thats behind us i dont think so youre a shit aaron that doesnt surprise me but it does surprise me that you went after me when i was down i thought we were friends we are sammy good then you wont mind having the papers on my desk by midweek and you can pay the attorney fees theyre tax deductible you know and if youre late you will need the writeoff sam got up and started out of the office aaron called after him we dont have to do this now without turning sam said yes we do i do sam nodded to julia as he passed but he couldnt muster a smile what have i done he thought in his outer office gabriella was kicked back in her chair with her skirt up around her armpits she seemed to be hyperventilating and her eyes were rolled back in her head gabriella again she pointed to his office door sam threw the door open banging it against the wall and disturbing a raven that was perched in the brass hat rack just inside sam stormed over to the bird barely resisting the urge to grab it and rip its feathers out goddammit i told you to stay off my secretary sam shook his fist at the bird and what kind of bullshit did you pull over at motion marine to get them to drop the lawsuit cant you just leave me alone why are you yelling at the bird the voice came from behind him sam looked around his fist still threatening the raven coyote was standing in the opposite corner of the office by the fax machine sams anger turned to confusion he looked at the bird then coyote then the bird whos this a raven coyote speculated he turned back to the fax machine hey what is this button that says network sam was still looking at the bird it sends simultaneously to the home offices of all the companies we represent coyote pushed the button like smoke signals what sam dropped his fist ran to the fax machine and hit the cancel button a second too late the display showed the transmission had gone out sam pulled the paper from the machine and stared at it in disbelief coyote had obviously lain on the copy machine to get the image you faxed your penis that machine prints my name at the top of each transmission the girls in the home office will think highly of you then of course they will be disappointed if they ever see you naked the raven squawked and gabriella appeared at the open door mr hunter a gentleman is here to see you from the police department coyote held the xerox up to gabriella a picture of your friend he offered a sharpfeatured hispanic man in a tweed sport jacket pushed his way past gabriella into the office mr hunter im detective alphonse rivera santa barbara pd narcotics division id like to ask you a few questions he held out a business card embossed with a gold shield but did not offer to shake hands narcotics sam looked to coyote thinking he would have disappeared but the trickster had stood his ground by the fax machine on the hat rack the raven cawed nice bird rivera said i understand they can be trained to talk rivera walked to the bird and studied it pig the raven said hes not mine sam said quickly he belongs to sam looked around and gabriella was gone from the doorway he belongs to this gentleman sam pointed to coyote and you are rivera eyed coyote suspiciously coyote rivera raised an eyebrow and took a notebook from his inside jacket pocket mr hunter i have a few questions about what went on at motion marine a couple of days ago would you prefer to talk in private yes sam looked at coyote go away take the bird with you nazi scum the raven cawed ill stay coyote said sam was on the verge of screaming sweat was beading on his forehead he composed himself and turned to rivera we can talk in front of mr coyote just a few questions rivera said you had an appointment with james cable at ten is that correct i was there for about an hour i was there too coyote said rivera turned his attention to the trickster why were you there mr coyote i was raising funds for narc narc the raven said narc native american reform coalition rivera scribbled on a pad sam said i dont understand what does this have to do with narcotics we think someone put hallucinogens in the coffee over at motion marine two days ago james cable claims he was attacked by someone fitting mr coyotes description he had a heart attack i just asked him if his company would make a donation coyote said he said no and i went away he had taken the xerox of his penis from the desk and fitted it back into the fax machine he searched the buttons insurance commissioner he read as he pushed the button no sam dove over the desk for the cancel button too late he turned to rivera that document wasnt signed he grinned and tried to move the conversation away from his panic you know i was thinking weve got an indian a policeman and an insurance broker were only a construction worker away from the village people rivera ignored the comment did you have any coffee while you were at motion marine mr hunter coffee no and you didnt drink from the watercooler no i dont understand today three people at motion marine including frank cochran claim that they saw a polar bear in the offices sam looked at coyote a polar bear we think that someone slipped them some lsd were testing the water and the coffee now we just wanted to talk to anyone who has been in the building in the last two days you didnt see anyone strange hanging around while you were in the building i only saw cables secretary and cable sam said rivera flipped the notebook closed well thanks for your time if you have any strange reactions or see anything strange could you give me a call rivera handed a card to coyote and you too if you would cabron the raven said he speaks spanish too rivera said amazing the detective left the office santa barbara newspress advertising coyote read as he pushed the button the fax machine whirred sam started to go for the machine then stopped and sat down in his chair he sat for a minute rubbing his temples if that cop runs a background check on me im going to jail you know that dont you you wanted your old life back but a fucking polar bear well you have your old life back whether you want it or not i was wrong it felt good saying it the honesty in it he wanted a new life i just want you to go away im gone coyote said the girl is gone too what does that mean the feathers on coyotes shirt turned black and his fingers changed to flight feathers in an instant coyote was a raven he flew out the office door followed by the raven from the hat rack chapter all happy families santa barbara calliope stood in the driveway holding grubb waiting for lonnie to return nina had been right she wasnt very good at worrying but she was giving it a good effort she was sure that lonnie wouldnt hurt her or grubb but then again lonnie had never acted the way he had the night before she wished that she could have asked sam to stay with her and help her with a decision but it would have been too much to ask so soon she wished too that there were phones at the ashram and that she could call her mother for advice and she couldnt just jump in the car and drive to see her mother as she always had before she had her job her house and there was sam now she was trying to push the dark specter of the unknown to the back of her mind when she heard the harley approaching she looked up to see lonnie rounding the corner a block away his new girlfriend clinging to him like a leech lonnie pulled into the driveway next to her and killed the engine im late for work calliope said wiping a trail of drool from grubbs face with her finger the woman behind lonnie glared at her and calliope nodded to her and said hi lonnie reached for grubb without getting off the bike calliope hugged grubb close she said i dont want him riding on the bike with you lonnie laughed the way you drive hes a hell of a lot safer on the bike please lonnie the woman reached out and took grubb from calliope the baby began to cry hell be fine cheryl hissed why cant you just stay at home with him calliope asked places to go people to meet lonnie said i could get yiffer to watch him calliope felt her breath coming hard she didnt like the look of this hard woman holding her grubb lonnie said you tell yiffer to watch his ass or ill shoot it off lonnie i have to go cant you just stay here im only working the lunch shift today lonnie grinned arent you going to stop by the hospital on your way home hospital no why lonnie fired up the harley no reason he laughed and coaxed the big bike around in the driveway as he gunned the engine and pulled into the street cheryl shouted dont worry bitch well put a dollar on black for you over the roar of the harley calliope could hear the woman grunt as lonnie elbowed her in the ribs calliope saw grubb looking at her as they rounded the corner panic tore at her chest as what the woman had said sunk in she turned and ran back up the steps by late afternoon the contractors had replaced sams sliding glass door and patched the bullet holes in the walls sam canceled the weeks appointments which gave him time alone with his thoughts he soon found however that his thoughts like monkeys in church were bad company he tried reading to distract himself but he found that he was simply looking at the pages he tried napping but as soon as he closed his eyes images of coyote and the police filled his head when the worry became too much for him he thought of calliope which set off a whole new set of worries what had coyote meant the girl is gone did it matter she was trouble too young too goofy probably too attractive and the kid he didnt need a kid in his life either trouble if she had gone somewhere he probably was better off he didnt need the hassles that thought still bouncing through his mind he grabbed the phone and dialed her number no answer he called information and got the number for the tangerine tree cafe she hadnt shown up for work today where in the hell is she where in the hell is coyote the fucker knew where she went and he wouldnt tell what had started as a niggling irritation turned to dread why in the hell does it matter he thought terrifying and black a word rose in his mind that matched his feeling he recoiled from it but it struck him again and again like an angry viper love the sickest of ironys sick jokes the place where logic and order go to die then again maybe not it was only bad if you were hiding pretending to be something that you were not maybe the hiding could end sam got up and headed out the door in what he knew was a ridiculous effort to find calliope he drove to the cafe and confirmed what they had told him on the phone then he drove to calliopes house and found yiffer and nina getting out of the van as he pulled up nina said i dont know where she is sam she left a note saying that lonnie had taken grubb and she was going after him nothing about where she was going any note at all is a big step for her she used to disappear for days at a time with no note at all fuck sam started to get back in the car sam nina called he paused the note said to tell you she was sorry for what thats all it said thanks nina call me if she shows up sam gunned the mercedes out of the driveway having no idea where he was going he needed help all his machines and access to information wouldnt help he needed a place to start twentyfour hours ago he would have given anything to get rid of coyote now he would welcome the tricksters cryptic smartassed answers at least they were answers he drove around town looking for calliopes z feeling hope rise each time he spotted an orange car and feeling it fall when it turned out not to be calliopes after an hour he returned home where he sat on his sofa smoking and thinking everything had changed and nothing had changed his life was back to normal and normal wasnt enough anymore he wanted real at the guilds clubhouse tinker was digging at a flea bite on his leg trying to pull his grimy jeans up over heavy boots to get at the tiny invader fucking fleas he said the guilds president bonner newton let out a raucous snort you know what they say bro newton said lie down with dogs a din of harsh laughter rose in the room from the other guild members fuck you guys tinker said feigning anger while enjoying the attention it wasnt that he liked ugly chicks but who else would have him nineteen of the twenty full members of the guild were draped over furniture and sprawled on the floor smoking joints and cigarettes drinking beers and feeling at the few old ladies present outside two strikers members who had not earned their full colors sat on the front porch watching for the law the house was a ramshackle stucco bungalow that had been built in the s as part of a housing tract before the term housing tract was part of the language the walls were stained with blood beer and vomit the carpet was matted with motor oil the furniture was minimal and distressed only tinker actually lived at the clubhouse the rest of the club used it for meeting and partying the guild had paid a hundred thousand dollars in cash for the house the deed was registered under newtons married sisters name as was the ranch house the guild owned in the santa lucia mountains above santa barbara which housed the lab that provided their income ironically the ranchs nearest neighbor was a wobblyheaded expresident who had declared a war on drugs and who from time to time would stand on the veranda of his palatial ranch house sniffing the odor of cooking crank and calling mommy theres a funny smell trickling down out here the lab produced enough income to support all of the guilds members and ensure that none of them had to work except to man the counter of the harleydavidson shop that bonner newton used to launder drug money newton held an mba from stanford in an earlier time before he fell from grace for smuggling cocaine he had stalked the glasscube buildings of silicon valley wearing italian suits and commanding crews of brilliant computer designers who could define the universe in terms of two digits explain the chaos theory in twentyfive words or less and build machines that emulated human intelligence but who thought a vulva was a swedish automobile newtons experience in coddling these genius misfits served him well as president of the guild for the members of the guild were nothing more than nerds without brains fat ugly or awkward men who found no acceptance in the outside world and so escaped into the security and belonging of an outlaw biker club a harleydavidson and blind loyalty were the only requirements for membership listen up you fucks newton said calling the meeting to order bitches outside he paused and lit a cigarette while the women filed out the door glaring at him over their shoulders he was not a large or imposing man compared to the other members but his authority was not to be questioned lonnies not here yet tinker said lonnies running an errand for us newton said were going to take an impromptu road trip a little business and a little pleasure fuckin a someone yelled newton gestured for quiet seems like someone forgot to tell me that we were running low on ether up at the facility newton always referred to the crank lab as the facility tinker stopped scratching his leg and hung his head tink you fucking idiot someone said anyway newton continued i wasnt able to arrange a delivery so we have to go get it theres a rally in south dakota in a couple of days at sturgis the chicago chapter is going to meet us there with a couple of barrels i want three fiftyfivegallon drums rigged with false tops so if we get stopped by the law it looks like were hauling motor oil tinker youll drive the pickup aw come on newt tinker whined warren newton said a thin biker with curly red hair looked up you fix one of the barrels for weapons and make sure no one is packing i dont want any weapons on anyone while were riding a series of snorts moans and oh fucks passed around the room newton dismissed them with a wave advice from the gator he said gator was short for the litigator the guilds attorney melvin gold who handled all their criminal cases free of charge in exchange for the assurance that he could also handle their personal injury suits bikers got run over a lot look newton insisted half of you are on probation we dont need some rookie pig looking for glory to fuck us on a concealedweapons charge are we clear newton paused until someone answered were clear all right then lonnies making a run to vegas with his old lady to get the money to pay for the ether hell meet us in south d were out of here at nine tomorrow morning so dont get too fucked up tonight bring your camping shit let your bitches carry your stash newton dropped his cigarette and ground it out on the carpet thats all he said the room filled with conversations about the trip a few of the members got up to leave when they opened the door a single flea hopped out with them once past the steps the flea changed into a horsefly and took flight a block away the horsefly changed into a raven and headed toward the mesa and the cliffs condominium complex chapter sprinkling the son of the morning star santa barbara after almost twenty years as a salesman sam found that when he was confused his head filled with homilies that pertained to the profession win an argument lose a sale if you look hungry you will be you cant sell if you dont pitch there were hundreds of them hed been running them through his mind for hours trying to find some clue as to what he should do the one that kept returning was never confuse motion with progress to leave the house in search of calliope without a clue as to where she might be would be movement for the sake of movement progress would be actually finding a clue to her whereabouts he had no idea where to start looking for clues so he lay on his bed and smoked and tried to convince himself that he didnt want her shes probably found some other guy he thought losing the kid is just an excuse a cowardly dear john letter it was just a onenight stand and i refuse to let it mean more to me than it meant to her ive got my life back intact and theres no room for a young girl and a child nope ill rest up today and get back to work tomorrow after i close a couple of deals this week will just seem like a bad dream it was a good rationalization unfortunately he didnt believe a word of it he was worried about her sam closed his eyes and tried to imagine the pages of his appointment book it was a visualization he used to relax a salesmans version of counting sheep he saw the days and weeks spread out in front of him and he filled in the blanks with lunches and prospects by each of the names he made mental notes on how he would approach the pitch before long he was lost in a world of presentations and objections the image of the girl faded away as he started to doze off he heard the sound of heavy breathing he rolled on his side and steamy hot dog breath hit him in the face he didnt open his eyes there was no need to he knew coyote had returned perhaps if he feigned sleep the trickster would go away so he lived there in the land of dog breath a wet nose prodded his ear at least he hoped it was a nose with coyotes sexual habits it could be no he still smelled the breath it was the nose im asleep go away im asleep go away he thought hed seen opossums try the same method to fool oncoming semi trucks and it was working about as well for him he felt the coyote climb onto the bed then he felt a paw on each of his shoulders he groaned as he thought a truly sleeping guy might groan coyote whimpered and sam could feel the canine nose press against his own dog breath sam mused seems to have no distinction to it yet it is distinctly dog breath you could be at the cologne counter at bloomingdales and someone could mist your wrist with an atomizer and a single whiff would reveal the elusive scent to be dog breath as surely as if it had been squozen straight from the dog yet what a wide spectrum of foulness dog breath can span both in odor and humidity this particular version of dog breath he felt is especially steamy and carries a top note of stale cigarettes and coffee as well as the usual fetid meat and butthole smells found in more common dog breath this he thought is supernatural dog breath im not likely to be breathed upon by another dog in my lifetime that has recently enjoyed a marlboro over a cup of java despite his effort to distract himself with dog breath aesthetics sams tolerance was wearing out and he thought he might sneeze or throw up any second coyote licked him on the mouth yuck sam sat upright and wiped his mouth on his arm ack he shivered involuntarily and looked at the big coyote who grinned at him from the end of the bed there was no need for that sam said coyote whimpered and rolled over on his back in submission sam got up from the bed and grabbed his cigarettes from the nightstand why are you back you said you were gone for good coyote began to change into his human form no longer afraid sam watched the transformation with fascination in a few seconds coyote sat on the bed in his black buckskins wearing the coyoteskin headdress got a smoke he asked sam shook one out of the pack and lit it for the trickster sam took a small plastic box from his shirt pocket and held it out to coyote breath mint no i insist sam said coyote took the box and shook out a mint popped it in his mouth and handed the box back to sam the girl is going to las vegas i dont care the lie tasted foul in his mouth if she tries to take her child from the biker she will be hurt its not my problem besides shell probably find another guy to help her out sam felt both righteous and cowardly for saying it this role he was playing no longer fit quickly he added i dont need the trouble in the buffalo days your people used to say that a wife stolen and returned was twice the wife she had been they arent my people and shes not my wife you can be afraid just dont act like it what does that mean youre worse than pokey with your fucking riddles you lost pokey you lost your family you lost your name all you have left is your fear white man coyote flipped his cigarette at sam it hit him in the chest and hot ashes showered on the bed sam patted out the embers and brushed himself off i didnt ask for you to come here i dont owe the girl anything but he did owe her he wasnt sure what for yet except that she had cut something loose in him why couldnt he cut loose the habit of fear coyote went to the bedroom window and stared out without turning he said do you know about the crows who scouted for general custer sam didnt answer when they told custer that ten thousand lakota and cheyenne warriors were waiting for him at the little bighorn he called them liars and rode on the crow scouts didnt owe custer anything but they painted their faces black and said today is a good day to die the point sam bristled the point is that you will never know what they knew that courage is its own reward sam sat down on the edge of the bed and stared at coyotes back the red feathers across the buckskin shirt seemed to move on the black surface of coyotes shirt sam wondered if he might not be lightheaded from prolonged dog breath inhalation but then the feathers drew a scene and in a whirl of images and feathers sam was back on the reservation again there were three of them boys hiding in the sagebrush by the road that led into the custer battlefield national monument two were crow one cheyenne they were there on a dare that had started in ninthgrade gym class the largest boy the cheyenne was from the broken tooth family descendants of a warrior who fought with crazy horse and red cloud on this very land you going to do it said eli broken tooth or are you full of shit like all crows i said id do it samson said but im not going to be stupid about it what about you breed eli asked billy two irons you a chickenshit broken tooth had been taunting billy about his mixed blood for the whole school year and citing his own pure indian lineage the fact was that in buffalo days the mortality rate had been so high for young plains warriors that a woman might have three or four husbands in her lifetime and have children by them all sometimes one of the husbands was a white man yet since they all traced their kinship through their mothers line the white ancestor could easily be forgotten billy said ill bet you got a few whiteys in your wigwam you dont even know about broken dick samson laughed and the others shushed him the security guard was making a pass by the monuments high wroughtiron gate they ducked their heads a flashlight beam passed over them paused and moved on as the guard turned to walk up the hill toward the custer burial site you going to do it eli asked once hes past the grave he has to go check on the reno site hell take the jeep for that when we hear the jeep well go sure you will said eli you coming samson asked he was more than a little afraid the monument was federal land and this was a time when an indian causing trouble on federal land was something the government was going to great lengths to discourage after the alcatraz takeover and the killings at pine ridge i dont have to go broken tooth said my people put him there ill just sit here and twist up a doobie while you girls do your thing he grinned the gate will be the bitch billy said they looked at the fifteenfoot iron spears suspended between two stone pillars there were only two cross members they could use as footholds they watched the guard amble the hundred yards down the hill to the visitor center when they heard the jeep fire up samson and billy took off they hit the gate at the same time the gate swung with the impact and clanged against the chains and padlock that held it closed they scrambled up the bars then hung over spearpoints and dropped to the asphalt as they let go the chain sent a loud clang ringing down the valley they both landed on their butts samson looked to billy you okay billy jumped to his feet and dusted off his jeans how come the indians in the movies can do this shit in complete stealth vocational training samson said he started running up the hill toward the monument billy followed snake ahead samson said as he ran what snake sam repeated breathlessly he leapt into the air over the big diamondback rattler that was lying in the road warming itself on the asphalt billy saw the snake in time to pull up and slide on some loose gravel within striking distance when he heard billys shoes sliding he stopped and turned billy said you were saying snake right back away and go around billy samson was so out of breath he could hardly talk the rattler coiled i thought you were saying steak i was wondering why is he yelling steak at me back away and go around snake well i guess this explains it billy backed slowly away then once out of striking distance ran a wide arc around the snake and up the hill samson fell in beside him the monument was still a hundred yards away pace yourself he said did you say snake again billy said between pants rather than answer samson fell into a trot the monument was a twentyfoot granite obelisk set on a tenfoot base at the top of a hill that overlooked the entire little bighorn basin lets do it samson said heaving in breaths the hill had been longer and steeper than hed thought billy unzipped his pants and stood beside samson who had already bared his weapon you know billy said it would have been easier to gang up on eli and beat the shit out of him i think i hear the jeep coming back samson said a long yellow stream arced out of billy and splashed the side of the monument then you better get going samson strained i cant billy grunted trying to force his urine to run faster go man thats headlights i cant billy finished and zipped up then turned to face samson think rivers think waterfalls it wont come come on samson hes coming relax relax how can okay relax in a hurry samson pushed until his eyes bugged he felt a trickle then a stream coming push it samson hes coming billy began to back down the hill push it man the jeeps headlights broke over the hill and descended toward the monument duck billy said samson squatted by the base of the monument and managed to stream urine down both pant legs before he got himself reaimed billy dove for cover next to samson did you say duck samson whispered shut up billy snapped despite his fear the adrenaline had made samson giddy he grinned at billy i thought you were saying truck which would have made more sense but would you shut up billy risked a peek at the road the jeep was coming toward them rather than returning to the visitor center where it had started as the jeep approached the monument they worked their way around its base keeping the obelisk between themselves and the guard he wont stop will he billy said samson could hear the jeep slowing as it passed the monument on the other side of them not twenty feet away they held their crouch until the jeep descended the hill and stopped halfway to the gate he sees footprints billy said on asphalt he saw us im going to end up in jail like my brother no look its the fucking snake hes waiting for it to get out of the road indeed the guard was inching the jeep forward slowly enough for the rattler to slither off into the grass when the snake was gone the jeep revved up and continued down the hill by the iron gate and back around to the back of the visitor center lets go billy said they ran down the road samson almost falling while trying to zip his pants and run at the same time as they reached the gate samson grabbed billys shoulder and pulled him back what the fuck billy said samson pointed to the chain billy nodded in understanding the clanging samson went to the center of the gate and grasped it go he said when you get over hold it for me without hesitation billy leapt to the gate and climbed over sliding down the opposite side instead of dropping as before he held the gate and samson started over as samson reached the top of the gate and was working his feet between the spearpoints he heard elis laughing from down the road and he looked up a second later he heard a metal fire door slam at the visitor center the quick turn took his balance and he tried to jump but one of the spearpoints caught his jeans leg and he was slammed upside down into the gate billy held the chain but there was a dull clank as samsons forehead hit the bars it took samson a second to realize that he was still hanging from the gate his head still eight feet off the ground unhook your leg billy said ill catch you in this position samson was facing the visitor center he could see some lights going on inside he struggled to push himself up on the bar but the spearpoint was barbed i cant get it shit billy said he held the gate with one hand and drew a flick knife from his back pocket with the other ill come up and cut you down no dont let go of the gate samson said fuck it billy said he let go of the gate and it clanged with samsons swinging weight billy jumped on the bars and as he climbed samson could hear the fire door open and slam again then footsteps billy stood at the top of the stone pillar and put the knife to samsons pant leg when i cut keep hold of the bars billy pulled the knife blade through the denim and samson flipped over and slammed the bars again this time right side up the gate clanged again samson heard the jeep starting and saw the beams of the headlights come out from behind the visitor center he looked to billy jump billy leapt from the fifteenfoot pillar as he hit the pavement he yowled and crumpled my ankle samson looked to the visitor center where the jeep was pulling out he grabbed billy under the armpits and dragged him down into the ditch they waited breathlessly as the jeep stopped and the guard gun drawn checked the lock and chain once again after the guard left they crawled down the ditch toward eli when he came into view samson helped billy to his feet and supported him while he limped up to the big cheyenne who was taking a deep hit on a joint want a hit he croaked holding the joint out to billy billy took the joint sat down in the grass and took a hit eli let out a cloud of smoke and laughed that was the funniest fucking thing ive ever seen in my life then he spotted the wet streaks on samsons pants what happened hunts alone i thought you were going to piss on custers grave you get so scared you wet yourself he threw back his head to laugh and samson wound up and tagged him on the jaw with a vicious roundhouse punch eli dropped to the ground and didnt move samson looked at his damaged fist then at eli then at billy two irons he grinned billy said you couldnt have done that twenty minutes ago and saved us all this trouble could you youre right samson said i couldnt have done that twenty minutes ago lets get out of here before he comes to samson helped billy to his feet then out of the ditch onto the road as they headed toward crow agency it seemed to get darker as they walked then darker still until there was no light at all and sam was in his bedroom staring at the back of a black buckskin shirt trimmed with red woodpecker feathers it was a stupid thing to do sam said it was brave coyote said it would have been stupid if you had failed we found out later that custer wasnt even buried there his body was taken to west point so it was all for nothing and what about the night on the dam was that all for nothing how do you know about that coyote turned and stared at sam with his arms crossed his golden eyes shining with delight that was nothing but trouble sam said finally would you do it again yes sam said without thinking and the girl is nothing but trouble coyote said sam heard the words echoing in his mind going after the girl was the right thing to do after all the years of doing the safe thing it was time to do the right thing he said you really piss me off sometimes you know that anger is the gods way of letting you know you are alive sam got up and stood facetoface with the trickster trying to read something in his eyes he moved forward until their noses almost touched all you know is that shes going to las vegas no address or anything not so far but if she misses them there the biker is going on to south dakota shell follow ill tell you the rest on the way i dont suppose you could change into a learjet or something practical coyote shook his head just living things animals bugs rocks sam reached into his shirt pocket pulled out the box of breath mints and handed them to coyote the trickster raised his eyebrows in query sam said eat those i cant handle dog breath through an eighthour drive part quest chapter pavlovs dogs and the rhinestone turd las vegas the only distractions from the noise of his own mind were desertdried roadkills thrown retreads and road signs reflecting desolation sam drove smoked and fought drowsiness by worrying about how he would find the girl the trickster slept in the passenger seat sam had been to las vegas three times before with aaron to see championship boxing at caesars palace two hundred dollars bought them seats at nosebleed altitude closer to the moon than the ring but aaron insisted that there was nothing like being there without binoculars following the progress of the fight was like tracking down a rumor sam usually watched the women and did his best to keep aaron calmed down as soon as they walked into a casino aaron started this is my town the lights the excitement the women i was born for this place then aaron would drop a couple thousand at the tables and suck free gin and tonics until he staggered in the morning sam would drag aaron out of a tangle of satin sheets and hookers throw him in the shower and listen to his long lament of remorse and hangover as he lay in the backseat of the car with a jacket over his head whining the whole way home about how he would never return aaron never failed to fuel the greed machine and was always dumbfounded when it juiced him of his hope it was the machine that fascinated sam while aaron ground himself through the velvet gears sam watched the workings of the most elaborate skinner box on the face of the earth drop the coin hear the bell see the lights eat the food see the women hear the bell see the lights drop the coin again the ostentation of the casinos did not create desire for money it made money meaningless there were no mortgages in a casino no children needing food no car needing repairs no work no time no day no night those things the context of money were someplace else a place where people returned before they realized that a turd rolled in rhinestones is a turd nonetheless sam saw the glow from las vegas rising over the desert from thirty miles out he poked coyote in the leg and the trickster woke up hold the wheel sam said let me drive you can sleep youre not driving my car just hold the wheel coyote held the wheel while sam punched buttons on the console the screen of the navigation system flickered on sam punched a few more buttons and a street map of las vegas lit up green on the screen a blip representing the merecedes blinked along highway toward the city okay sam said taking the wheel again coyote studied the screen how do you win its not a game its a map the blip is us the car knows where it is going like a horse it doesnt know it just tells us where we are like looking out the window look im going to have to sleep when we get to vegas i dont even know where to start looking for calliope why dont you ask the car sam ignored the question im going to get us a room he dialed information on the cellular phone got the number of a casino hotel then called and reserved a room the exits off the highway were marked by names of casinos they led to not by the names of streets or roads sam took the exit marked camelot he followed the signs down the surface streets lined with pawnshops convenience stores and lowslung cinderblock buildings under neon signs that proclaimed cash for your car checks cashed here marriages and divorces twentyfourhour drivethru window coyote said what are these places sam tried to think of a quick explanation but was too weary from lack of sleep to tackle the concept of las vegas in twentyfive words or less finally he said these are places where you go if you want to fuck up your life and you dont have a lot of time to do it in are we going to stop no i seem to be fucking up at a fine rate of speed thank you sam spotted the pseudomedieval towers of camelot rising above the strip multicolored pennons flying from standards tipped with aircraft warning lights he wondered what the real king arthur if there was a king arthur and who was he to question the truth behind myth would have thought about the casino named after his legendary city would he recognize anything would he cower in fear at the sight of his first electric light flush toilet automobile would he be reduced to a pathetic quixote attacking this place where chivalry was a quaint marketing idea or would the once and future king lay eyes on a leggy keno girl and raise another lance to lead the knights of the round table in a charge the women sam decided would be arthurs touchstone and his downfall he shot a glance at coyote when we get there youre going to see a lot of women without a lot of clothes on stay away from them coyote looked surprised i never touch a woman who does not want it dont touch sam interrupted coyote slouched in his seat or need it he whispered sam drove the mercedes over a giant drawbridge and stopped at the valet parking station where a dozen young men dressed like squires were scrambling around unloading cars filling out slips and driving cars away this is it sam said he popped the trunk and got out leaving the engine running a warm desert wind washed over him at the same time a young man ran around the car and held out a numbered slip of paper your ticket milord sam dug in his pocket for a bill to tip the kid but found nothing im sorry he said i dont have any cash on me ill get your name and leave a tip at the desk the kid tried to force a smile and failed very good milord he jumped in the car and slammed the door sam cringed and tapped on the window the window whirred down the kid waited sam leaned in and read the kids plastic badge look uh squire tom i really will leave a tip at the desk for you we left in a hurry and i forgot to get cash the kid waited gunning the engine theres an alarm remote on the keys could you turn it on after you park it one chirp is armed squire tom nodded and pulled away sam heard him say the pox on you moorish pig over the squeal of the tires how authentic sam thought he watched the mercedes disappear around the corner and wondered why valet parking always made him feel as if he had seen his car for the last time coyote stood across the lane waving to the car he looked over moorish pig the dark skin i guess said sam he led coyote past a halfdozen squires and an overweight guy in a purpleandyellow jesters outfit with a radio on his belt and a badge that read lord larry over another drawbridge and into the casino trumpets played a fanfare as they crossed the threshold under a brace of huge broadswords a jolly electronic voice welcomed them to camelot sam spotted a woman in a peasant dress by a sign reading ye olde information the badge she wore next to a magnificent display of cleavage read lusty wench wendy sam pulled coyote back and approached the girl excuse me er wendy i have a room reserved and i need to find a cash machine the girl spoke in a whining fakeenglishovertruebrooklyn accent well she threw out a hip struck a pose if milords proceed through the casino to the left to the second arch ye will find the registration desk theres cash machines by every arch milord thanks sam said he started to walk away then turned back to the girl excuse me but ive been here before and i thought everyone was a lord or a lady lusty wench is a new one the english accent had overheated and failed yeah about three months ago they said it was getting sorta confusing you know six lord steves ten lady debbies they use a bunch of other medieval titles now the bellboys are serfs lusty wenches alchemists stuff like that oh thanks sam said as if he understood he led coyote into the chaos of the casino looking for a cash machine while trying to move quickly coyotes appearance was attracting attention and when people looked up from a slot machine or blackjack table sam knew they were truly distracted as they passed a carousel of slot machines a middleaged woman who was pumping quarters into a machine by the handful leaned so far back to get a look at the trickster that she nearly toppled off her stool sam caught her and steadied her he works at the frontier up the strip sam said coyote peeked over sams shoulder winked at the woman then licked his eyebrows the womans jaw dropped exotic dancer sam explained the woman nodded a little stunned and returned her attention to the slot machine i wish you wouldnt do that sam said to coyote and dont you have any other clothes something a little more conservative wool coyote made an incredibly realistic sheep noise a pit boss at the blackjack tables raised an eyebrow and two security jesters fell in behind sam and coyote be cool sam said he turned under a hanging tapestry of a unicorn and stopped by a cash machine checking over his shoulder for the security jesters they waited and watched standing a few feet away while sam took a deck of credit cards from his wallet and shuffled through them when he inserted one of the cards in the machine and punched his identification number the jesters moved off theyre gone coyote said yeah as long as it looks like youre going to spend money i guess it doesnt matter what you look like coyote watched as the cash machine spit a stack of twenties into the tray you win he said you picked the right numbers the first time yeah im lucky that way try again see if you win sam grinned im very good at this game he put a different card into the machine and punched the same pin number while coyote watched the machine whirred and another stack of twenties shot into the tray you won play again no we need to check in sam picked up the money and walked to a registration desk that was long enough to land planes on at this hour of the morning there were only two people on the desk a lusty wench named chantel and a very tall thin very black man in a business suit and wraparound sunglasses who stood back from the desk and watched unmoving hunter samuel sam said i have a reservation he placed a credit card on the desk the girl typed for a second the computer beeped and the girl looked over her shoulder at the black man who moved like liquid to her side he consulted the screen for a moment what now sam thought the black man looked down at sam and a crescent moon of a smile appeared on the night sky of his face he picked up sams credit card and handed it back mr hunter thank you for joining us again the rooms on camelot sir and if theres anything i can get you please dont hesitate to call down and ask sam was dumbfounded then he remembered the last time he had stayed here aaron had lost almost twenty thousand dollars and billed it to their suite of rooms the suite had been registered in sams name vegas loves a loser thank you sam read the mans nameplate which was pinned at sams eye level mf no lord no squire no title at all just mf the second elevator on your left mr hunter the lusty wench said twentyseventh floor thanks sam said coyote grinned at the girl and sam dragged him away to the elevator where the trickster immediately punched in four floor numbers and stood back this time i will win its a fucking elevator sam said just push twentyseven but that is not the lucky number sam sighed and pushed the floor number then waited while they stopped at all the floors coyote had pushed on their way to twentyseven once in the room sam stripped to his shorts and fell onto one of the kingsize beds get some sleep if you can ill try and figure out how to find calliope in the morning im too tired to think now you sleep coyote said i will think of a plan sam didnt answer he was already asleep coyote loses his ass coyote and his friend beaver had been hunting all day but neither had found any game after a while they sat down on some rocks and began talking this is your fault coyote said i can always find game i dont think so beaver said if you are such a good hunter why is your wife so skinny coyote thought about his skinny wife and beavers fat little wife and he was jealous well how about a bet he said tomorrow we will each go out hunting if you get more rabbits you can come to my lodge and sleep with my wife so you can see that my skinny wife is better but if i get more rabbits i get to sleep with your wife sounds fair beaver said the next day after the hunt coyote came to beavers lodge carrying his one scrawny rabbit oh mrs beaver he called ive come to collect on my bet mrs beaver called from inside the lodge oh coyote you are a great hunter mr beaver just stopped by with twenty rabbits on his way to your lodge you better go stop him and tell him that you got more right coyote said ill be right back he slunk off to his lodge dragging his rabbit his wife was waiting outside nice rabbit she said beaver is inside ill see you in the morning coyotes wife went into the lodge and pulled down the door flap all night coyote sat outside his lodge shivering and listening at one point he heard his wife cry out beaver coyote shouted dont you hurt my wife hes not hurting me mrs coyote said i like it swell coyote said the next morning beaver came out of coyotes lodge singing and grinning no hard feelings right a bet is a bet coyote said mrs coyote peeked out and said maybe this will teach you not to gamble right coyote said then he called to beaver hey how about playing the hand game with me double or nothing sounds good beaver said lets go down to the river at the river coyote said this is for a night with your wife then he picked the wrong hand you really shouldnt gamble beaver said ill bet you my best horse for a night with your wife coyote said after a while coyote had lost all his horses his lodge his wife and his clothes one more time he said but you dont have anything left beaver said ill bet you my ass against everything else i dont want your ass beaver said i thought you were my friend okay beaver said he hid the stone behind his back coyote picked the wrong hand can i borrow your knife coyote said i dont want your ass beaver said a bet is a bet coyote said he took beavers knife and cut off his ass boy that stings ive got to go beaver said ill tell your wife she can come and sleep in my lodge if she wants to he picked up all of coyotes things and went home when coyote got home his wife was waiting beaver took the lodge she said yep coyote said wheres your ass she asked beaver got that too you know she said theres a twelvestep program for gambling you should look into it twelve steps coyote laughed ill bet i can do it in six chapter coyote in trickster town las vegas coyote had been a long time in the spirit world where everyone knew him so no one would gamble with him now that he was in trickster town he wanted to make up for lost time he waited for sam to fall asleep then he took the salesmans wallet and went down the elevator to the casino coyote saw hundreds of shiny machines blinking and ringing and clanking big coins into hollow metal bowls he saw green tables where people traded money for colorful chips and a woman in a cage who paid money for the chips he saw a wheel with a ball that went around and around when the ball stopped a man took everyones chips the key to that one coyote thought is to grab your chips when you see the ball slowing down at one green table a shaman with a stick chanted while players threw bones there was much shouting and moaning after each throw and the shaman took many chips from the players that is a game of magic coyote thought i will be very good at that one but first i must use sams cheating medicine on this machine the trickster stood by a machine that he had seen sam win from two times he took one of the gold cards from sams wallet and slipped it into the machine then he pressed the number that he had seen sam use the machine beeped and spit the card out panther piss coyote swore ive lost he pounded on the machine then stepped back and drew another card from sams wallet he put it in the machine and pressed the number the machine beeped and spit out the card balls coyote said this cheating medicine is no good a round woman in pink stretch pants who was standing behind coyote cleared her throat and made an impatient humphing noise coyote turned to her get your own machine this one is mine the woman glared at the trickster and tapped her foot go go go coyote said waving her away there are many machines to play on i was here first go away he put another card into the machine and hunched over the keyboard so the woman would not steal his cheating medicine he looked back over his shoulder she was trying to see what he was doing go away woman my cheating medicine will not help you even if you win you will still be ugly the woman wrapped the strap of her pocketbook around her wrist and wound up to swing it at coyote coyote was going to turn into a flea and disappear into the carpet but he would have had to drop sams wallet to do it so he hesitated and the woman let fly coyote ducked and covered his head but the blow didnt come instead he heard a solid thud above his head and looked up to see a huge black hand holding the pocketbook in the air the woman dangling from the strap at the other end coyote looked up further craning his neck until he saw a dazzling crescent moon of a smile in the face like night sky is there a problem said the crescent moon in a soft calm deep voice the giant lowered the woman who stood stunned staring up at what looked like a living lateafternoon shadow in sunglasses the giant was used to shocking people white people anyway a sevenfoot black man anywhere off a basketball court nonplussed most he squeezed the womans shoulder gently to bring her back to her senses are you all right maam again the smile fine im fine the woman said and she tottered off into the casino to tell her husband that by god they would spend their next vacation in hawaii where natives and giants if they were there at all were part of the entertainment the giant turned his attention to coyote and you sir can i help you with anything you look like raven coyote said do you always wear sunglasses always sir the giant said with a slight bow he pointed to the brass nameplate on his black suit jacket im mf customer service at your service sir whats the mf stand for coyote asked just mf sir i am the youngest of nine children i suppose my mother was too tired to come up with a full name this was not entirely true nor entirely false the giants mother had indeed been weary by the time he was born but she had also developed an unnatural obsession with dental hygiene as a child after she was chosen to be one of the first students ever to participate in a crest toothpaste test it had been her single moment of glory her fifteen minutes of fame and her best checkup ever when she grew up she married a navy man named nathan fresh and as she bore her children she christened them in remembrance of her day in the dental sun the first of the fresh children a boy was named fluoristat then came three more boys tartar plaque and molar then two girls gingivitis and flossie the latter after the famous dental hygiene cow after normal deliveries of two more sons bicuspid and incisor she had a long difficult labor with her largest and last son minty later mother fresh swore that had the child taken one more minute to come into the world she would have named him mr tooth decay out of spite a fact that gave little solace to the man named minty fresh coyote said people think that it stands for motherfucker dont they no minty said no one has ever mentioned it oh coyote said can you fix this machine when i give it the cheating number it just beeps minty fresh looked at the cash machine which was still blinking the message instructions in english spanish or japanese choose one youll need to choose a language sir he reached down and pushed the english button it should be fine now coyote inserted a card and punched two numbers on the keyboard then looked at minty this is my secret number yes minty said if you need anything at all please ask for me personally he turned and walked away coyote finished punching the pin number when the machine prompted him for an amount he punched in the maximum allowed by the sixfigure field the machine whirred and spit five hundred dollars into the tray then flashed a message saying that this was the cards transaction limit coyote tried the card again and got another five hundred the third time the machine refused the transaction so coyote tried another card after running all of sams cards to their limit he walked away from the machine with twenty thousand dollars in cash coyote went to the roulette table and held the fourinch brick of twenties out to the croupier a slight oriental woman in a redandpurple silk doublet with a name badge that read lady lihn the croupier said on the table she gestured for coyote to put the money down she nodded to a pit boss watch count please she said mechanically the pit boss a sharpfaced slickhaired italian man wearing a polyester suit and a tenthousanddollar rolex moved to her side and watched as she counted the bills out on the table changing twenty thousand lady lihn said how would you like this sir red ones coyote said the pit boss raised an eyebrow and smirked lady lihn looked irritated red is five dollar no room on table the pit boss addressed coyote perhaps youd like two hundred in fives and the rest in hundreds sir what color are the hundreds coyote said black lady lihn said yellows coyote said yellows are two dollars you pick coyote said lady lihn counted out racks of chips and pushed them in front of coyote the pit boss nodded to a cocktail waitress then to the stack of chips in front of coyote which the cocktail waitress interpreted as take the order the cocktail waitress would bring strong drinks until coyote started to get drunk then she would bring watered drinks until he looked tired when she would offer coffee and disappear until the caffeine kicked in can i bring you something to drink coyote turned to the cocktail waitress and stared into her cleavage yes he said the waitress held a pen ready over a cocktail napkin what can i bring you coyote shot a glance to a woman at the table who was drinking a mai tai resplendent with paper parasols and swordskewered tropical fruit he grabbed the womans drink and downed half of it nearly taking his eye out with the plastic broadsword one of these coyote said he replaced the drink in front of the woman who didnt seem to notice that it had been missing shed been riding the alcoholandcaffeine roller coaster for hours and was absorbed in winning back her childrens college fund bets down lady lihn said coyote put a single red chip on black and the ball was dropped coyote watched the ball race around the outside of the wheel when it slowed and dropped to the numbers he reached for his bet no touch bet lady lihn snapped in an instant the pit boss the cocktail waitress and two security jesters in steeltoed elf shoes were at coyotes side the trickster pulled his hand back it will be hard to trick these people coyote thought they talk like wolves all twitches and gestures and smells the ball dropped into a red slot and lady lihn placed another red chip next to coyotes i win i win i win coyote chanted he did a skipping dance around the table and sang a victory song above the casino in a mirrored dome a video camera picked up coyotes dancing image and sent it to a deck of monitors where three men watched and in turn watched each other watch one pressed a button and picked up a telephone mf he said this is god customer service on table fiftynine the indian you were talking to a few minutes ago watch him im on it minty fresh said he turned to the girl who was working behind the computer god wants me on the floor the girl nodded as minty walked by her she sang softly he knows when you are sleeping he knows when youre awake minty fresh smiled he really didnt mind being watched because of his size people had always watched him he had never blended into any background never entered a room unnoticed never been able to sneak up on someone attracting attention was as natural to him as being and for every originalthinking dolt who asked him how the weather was up there there was a woman who wanted to research the wives tale of proportional handfootpenis size a tale minty thought dreamed up by the unsatisfied wives of smallfooted men minty spotted the indian at the roulette table the two security jesters had moved off a few feet but were still watching as was the pit boss when minty came to the table they nodded in acknowledgment and moved off the croupier looked at minty and immediately looked back to the bets on the table minty fresh put her on edge it wasnt his size that rattled her but the fact that no one was exactly sure what his job was only that when there was a problem he was there he handled things lady lihn dropped the ball into the wheel it raced then rattled into a slot and she raked all the bets off the table coyote cursed and let out a howl the woman playing next to him staggered back and wandered away carrying visions of her children wearing paper hats and saying i was going to go to college but my mother went to vegas instead would you like fries with that coyote looked at minty fresh she was bad luck i lost half of my chips because of her perhaps you should move to a different table minty said we can open a private table just for you coyote grinned at minty you think you have a table where you can trick me no sir minty said a little embarrassed we dont wish to trick you theres nothing wrong with tricking people they pay you to be tricked we like to think of it as entertainment coyote laughed like movie stars and magicians tricksters people want to be tricked but you know that dont you he picked up his chips and walked to a crap table minty thought for a moment before following the indian he prided himself on being able to handle any situation with complete calm but he found dealing with this indian made him nervous and a little afraid but of what something in the eyes he moved in behind coyote who was throwing chips on the crap table you cant bet the numbers until the point has been made sir said the stickman a thin balding man in his forties he pushed coyotes chips back across the table the stickman looked over coyotes head and nodded to minty fresh before pushing the dice to the shooter place your bets he said and the dealers working at either end of the table checked the bets on the felt new shooter coming out the stickman said a blond woman in a business suit and perfect newswoman makeup picked up the dice and blew on them come on seven she said baby needs new shoes coyote twisted his neck to look at minty fresh does talking to them work minty nodded to the table as the woman let fly with the dice rolling a two snake eyes the croupier said lizard dick coyote shouted back the blond woman cursed and walked away from the table the stickman shot a glance to minty then continued two craps no pass no come place your bets new shooter coming out he pushed the dice to coyote who threw a handful of black chips on the table and picked up the dice you are small but i am your friend coyote said to the dice you have beautiful spots he pulled the rawhide pouch from his belt and poured a fine powder on the dice you cant do that sir the stickman said minty fresh gently took the dice from coyote and handed them to the boxman who sat across from the stickman watching an enormous rack of chips that was the tables bank he inspected the dice then gave them to the stickman who dropped them in his tray and pushed a fresh pair to the trickster what is this shade coyote said the shaman gets to use his power stick but i cant use my cheating powder im afraid not minty said coyote picked up the new dice and chucked them to the end of the table eight easy the stickman said did i win coyote asked minty no now you have to roll another eight before you roll a seven or eleven coyote rolled again the dice showed a pair of fours eight winner hard way the stickman chanted the dealer placed a stack of black chips next to coyotes bet ha coyote said taunting minty fresh see i am good at this game very good minty said with a smile you roll again coyote placed the remainder of his chips on the table the dealer immediately shot a glance to the boxman who looked to minty fresh minty nodded the boxman nodded the dealer counted coyotes chips and stacked them on the pass line playing twentyone thousand coyote threw the dice two the stickman said the dealer raked in coyotes chips and handed them to the boxman who stacked the racks in the table bank i lost coyote said incredulously sorry minty said but you didnt crap out you can shoot again ill be back coyote said he walked away and minty followed him through the casino into the lobby and out the door coyote handed the valet ticket to a kid named squire jeff then turned to minty who stood by the valet counter ill be back with more money well hold a place for you sir minty said relieved that the indian was leaving i was just learning your game shade you didnt trick me of course not sir squire jeff pulled up in the mercedes got out and waited with his hand out coyote started to get into the car then stopped and looked at the valet he took the pouch from his belt and poured a bit of powder into the kids hand then got in the car and drove away minty felt a wave of relief wash over him as he watched the mercedes cross the drawbridge squire jeff still holding his palm out turned to minty fresh what am i supposed to do with this you could snort it squire jeff sniffed at the powder then wrinkled his nose and brushed the powder from his hand fucking indian you work inside right minty nodded squire jeff looked minty up and down you play any ball one year unlv injury attitude minty said he walked back into the casino chapter wheels deals and the persistance of visions las vegas calliope sat in her car shivering and watching she was parked up the street from a vegas harleydavidson shop where she had once gone with lonnie on a delivery for the guild the street was deserted and dark except for the odd glow of neon in the window of a closed pawnshop litter danced in dust devils of desert wind that had grown cold through the night calliope curled up in the drivers seat and tried to cover herself with one of grubbs blankets the smell that came off the blanket a mix of sour milk and sweet baby made her sad and even though she had stopped breastfeeding months ago her breasts ached for her son she caught some motion out of the corner of her eye two figures coming out of an alley onto the sidewalk men they were walking toward the car calliope slid down in the drivers seat the mother instinct the feeling of righteous invincibility that had filled her when she had come here was leaking away right now she was not protecting her child she was afraid for herself as the men approached she saw that they were young toughs swaggering with their own willingness to violence even as they staggered from the effect of some drink or drug she slid farther down in the seat and when their shadows fell across the cars hood she twisted down and covered herself with grubbs blanket she heard their footsteps scrape and stop at the car heard their voices above her check out this motherfucker some tall dollars here theres a grand in tires on this thing pop the hood calliope heard someone trying to open the door locked hang on a minute i saw a brick back a ways footsteps away the car rocked with the continued yanking at the door handle calliope could hear the keys swinging in the ignition the second man was coming back her breath caught she waited for the crash sweat trickled down her forehead and dripped onto the gearshift knob no man not the windshield you cant drive it with a broken windshield oh right calliope braced herself for the impact of the brick then something in her mind screamed no her feet were still on the pedals she pushed the clutch and gas to the floor reached out from under the blanket and turned the key the z roared to life thundered then screamed as she kept the gas to the floor she sat up and glanced at the two startled men who were cowering a few feet away instantly their surprise turned to anger and the taller of the two raised the brick calliope popped the clutch and fought to keep the car straight as the tires burned off on the asphalt she heard a loud crack behind her and felt splinters of glass hit her from behind she powershifted through three gears turning over the tires and kicking the car sideways with each slam of the shifter by the time she backed off the gas the speedometer was threatening there was a thumping coming from the engine and a highpitched wailing coming from somewhere she looked into the rearview mirror to see the hole in the back window and behind it flashing red and blue police lights she hesitated only long enough to throw grubbs blanket off her shoulders then slammed the z into third floored it and said a quick prayer to kali the destroyer if lonnie ray inman had ever made the connection that whenever he read the words american standard spelled out in cornflower blue against white porcelain he felt a sudden urge to urinate he might have understood why grubb upon seeing white plastic bundles piled haphazardly on the motelroom floor crawled doggedly to and whizzed gleefully on twenty thousand dollars worth of methamphetamine to grubb the bundles looked like pampers a fine and private place to pee jesus christ cheryl lonnie yelled he crawled out of his diaper cant you keep an eye on him for a fucking minute fuck you you watch him stud hes your kid cheryl threw a pillow at lonnie as she stormed naked into the bathroom you were the one that said youd make a good mother throw me a towel cheryl stood in front of the mirror working her jaw back and forth get your own towel i think you fucked up my jaw i did i didnt do shit thats the problem isnt it cheryl had been lolling lonnies limpness around in her mouth for an hour trying to get a reaction out of him when she heard a sharp crack in her right ear and felt a painful grating in the back of her jaw lonnie grabbed a towel off the rack and went to where grubb was happily splashing away on the drugs lonnie picked up the baby and put him on the bed then went back to clean off the packages oh christ cheryl clean up the kid will you fuck off lonnie stormed into the bathroom and grabbed her by the hair yanking her head back until she was staring up at him he spoke to her through gritted teeth you clean up the kid now or ill snap your fucking neck you understand he yanked her head back further ive got to turn this shit early in the morning and then ride to south dakota and i need to get some fucking sleep if i have to kill you to get it i will you understand he relaxed his grip on her hair and she nodded tears welled up in her eyes he dragged her out of the bathroom and threw her on the bed with grubb then threw the towel in her face now clean up the kid lonnie took another towel and wiped each of the packages before packing them into grubbs diaper bag cheryl rolled grubb over and dried his bottom last time i take a vacation with you she said no gambling no shows no fucking i said she looked at him no fu the word caught in her throat he was aiming his pistol at her head until he saw the orange z rocket by him the cop thought that the worst thing he was going to have to deal with on this shift was not smoking he was wearing a patch on his left shoulder that was supposed to feed nicotine into his blood to keep him from craving cigarettes but the urge to smoke was still there so he fought it by eating donuts hed gained ten pounds in a week and he was musing over the idea of inventing a donut patch when the sports car roared by him out of habit he butted a halfeaten cruller in the ashtray hit the lights and siren and pulled out in pursuit the z already had about eight blocks on him and he estimated it was doing about a hundred he was reaching for the radio to call ahead for help when a black mercedes pulled out from a side street in front of him he slammed on the brakes and threw the cruiser sideways bringing it to a stop not ten feet from impact the mercedes was at a dead stop blocking both lanes the cop watched the zs taillights fade in the distance on the other side he killed the siren and switched the radio to the public address system get out of the car now he waited but no one got out of the car in fact he couldnt see a driver at all yet the mercedes was still running he considered calling for backup then decided to handle it himself he stepped out of the cruiser with his gun drawn careful to stay behind the car door you in the mercedes get out slowly he saw something move in the car but it didnt look like a person holding his revolver at ready he shined his flashlight at the car movement but no driver he saw three possibilities the driver was unconscious or was waiting to peel away when he moved away from the cruiser or was lying in wait with a shotgun to blow his head off he decided it would be safest to assume the last and without further warning he crept to a spot just under the open driversside window he heard a scratching sound just above his head and came up gun first to catch a glimpse of the back end of the skunk just as it sprayed him in the face as he wiped his eyes he heard laughing and the mercedes pulling away clyde owner of clydes cash for your car said no offense chief but you dont see many indians in mercedes he kicked a tire and bent down to look at the lines of the paint job for signs of bodywork keeping a hand on his head to steady his toupee looks clean its a good car coyote said clyde narrowed his eyes and smiled clyde had seen a little too much sun in his sixty years and this sly smile what he used to call his gotcha look made him look like an old chinese woman and you have the title right chief title thats what i thought clyde stepped up to coyote his head about level with the tricksters sternum are you a policeman or are you working in the service of any lawenforcement agency nope well then lets do some business clyde grinned now you and i know that we could fry eggs on this car am i right of course i am and youre not from around here or youd have your own connections and wouldnt be here am i right of course i am and you dont want to take this car out on the interstate where the state patrol would spot it as hot in a second no you dont he paused for effect just to make sure everyone knew he was in control ill give you five thousand dollars for it not enough said coyote look this car has a machine that tells you where you are clyde glanced inside the mercedes at the navigation system then shrugged chief you see all these cars clyde gestured to a dozen cars on his lot coyote looked around and nodded well all these cars got something thatll tell you where youre at i call them windows you look out of em now do you want to sell a car six thousand coyote said clyde crossed his arms and waited tapped his foot smiled into the night sky five coyote said ill be right back with your money chief can i have my boy give you a lift somewhere sure coyote said clyde went into his office a mobile home whose entire side functioned as clydes sign in a moment he returned with a stack of hundreds he counted them into coyotes hand a greasy teenager pulled up in an old chevy this is clyde junior clyde said hell take you wherever you need to go its a good car coyote said he handed the keys to clyde and climbed into the chevy as they pulled away coyote dug into his medicine pouch and pulled out a small plastic box that had once been on sams key ring he pushed the red button once and a chirping sound came from under the hood of the mercedes to signal that the alarm was armed kiro yashamoto stood in the corner of the treatment room watching two doctors battle for a mans life one doctor was young white and wore a stethoscope around his neck he was fighting death with electronic monitors oxygen a battery of injected drugs and a degree from michigan state the other doctor was an old indian man as wrinkled and weathered as the patient who fought with prayers songs and by blowing on the patient through a mouthful of charcoal he held no degree but had been called to healing by the trumpeting of a white elk in the spirit world despite the difference in their methods the two worked as a team kiro could see that they respected each other and he wished that his children were here to see these two cultures working together not for profit but out of a common compassion alas he had left them outside in the clinics small waiting room and neither of the doctors would allow more people in here a tall lanky indian man dressed in denim stood in the corner opposite kiro his hair was cut short and shot with gray kiro guessed he was in his sixties but it was hard to tell with these people he saw kiro watching and quietly crossed the room my name is harlan hunts alone he said extending his hand how do you do kiro said he took harlans hand and bowed slightly then caught himself in the inappropriate gesture and felt embarrassed harlan patted kiros shoulder pokey is my brother i wanted to thank you for bringing him here the doctor said he would have died without your help it was nothing kiro said just the same harlan smiled the medicine man stopped singing and harlan quickly turned to him hes gone the medicine man said the white doctor looked at the monitor a steady blip played across the screen hes fine his blood pressures coming up not dead said the medicine man gone pokey began mumbling then speaking kiro could not hear what he was saying through the oxygen mask thats not crow what is that asked the white doctor navaho said the medicine man he doesnt speak navaho harlan said he doesnt even speak crow he doesnt here the medicine man said hes not here on a stone wall carvings of dead gods and the shadow of a man with the head of a dog pokey looks but there is no figure casting the shadow he turns to run stop the shadow says pokey stops but does not look back who are you tell him there is death where he goes tell who the trickster tell him and tell him i am coming back who are you the shade and the wall are gone ahead lie prairies pokey runs calls old man coyote what im busy twice in a few days is too much dont talk to me for another forty years a shadow said to tell you that there is death where you are going a shadow a man with the head of a dog i thought it was you playing a trick on me nope so he said that there is death where i am going he ought to know anything else he said to tell you that he is coming back well no shit you have to go old man youre dying again i am yeah didnt you drink that koolaid i left you there was no water who was go now the green line went flat the monitor screeched out an alarm were losing him the doctor said he grabbed a syringe filled it with epinephrine and drove it into pokeys chest the medicine man began to sing a death song chapter hang with a horse thief wake up walking las vegas minty fresh was staring at nothing and thinking zipadeedoodah when the girl behind the desk grabbed his arm startling him are you all right she said fine what is it god on the phone for you thank you minty picked up the phone and tried to drive zipadeedoodah out of his head mf here he said your indian is back in the building main entrance keep an eye on him right minty hung up he checked his watch and realized that he must have been staring for ten minutes before the call why couldnt he shake that song he hadnt heard it since his grandmother had taken him to see song of the south when he was a child grandma had heard the uncle remus stories of brer fox and brer rabbit from her own grandmother who had been a slave she said that the stories came with the slaves from west africa there brer rabbit was known as esau the trickster maybe it was the indian talking about tricking people that had set it off since the indian had come into the casino minty had felt uneasy it was as if the indian could look into his soul and see secrets that he himself did not know he looked up to see the indian coming through the lobby minty smiled mr coyote youre back how do you know my name minty was spun by the question he felt his shell of cool detachment cracking and dropping off like old paint i i dont know its okay coyote said i want everyone to know my name not like you you carry your name like a man with a knife hidden in his boot you should wear your name like a red bow tie ill try to remember that minty said trying to sound patronizing if the casino knew his real name theyd have him greeting people in clown shoes and a purple wig within the hour a red bow tie indeed coyote fanned a handful of hundreds and waved them under mintys nose did you save my place at the table im sure we can find you a suitable place follow me minty led coyote to an outoftheway crap table where only a few players were gathered one of them a lanky middleaged man in a cowboy hat and jeans turned and looked coyote up and down then scoffed and turned to the stickman shaking his head in disgust prairie niggers he said under his breath minty moved up behind the cowboy and bent over until his mouth was even with the cowboys ear i beg your pardon the cowboy spun around and stumbled back against the table his eyes wide nothin he said minty remained crouched over his face almost touching the cowboys is there a problem sir no no problem the cowboy said he turned and scraped his chips off the table and quickly walked away minty stood slowly and caught the stickman glaring at him a wave of embarrassment burned over him that sort of direct intimidation was completely out of line bad form bad judgment he imagined that there would be a call from god waiting for him when he returned to the desk he turned to coyote who was staring down the front of a cocktail waitresss dress minty said can we get you something to drink umbrellas and swords lots of them very good minty nodded to the cocktail waitress mai tai extra fruit coyote handed his cash to the dealer black ones the dealer counted the money and handed it to the supervisor changing five thousand the other players looked up at coyote then minty then quickly looked down to avoid eye contact a pair of freshfaced newlyweds stood at the head of the table exchanging kisses and whispers the stickman pushed the dice to the woman who giggled as she picked them up thats my lucky girl her husband said kissing her ear new shooter coming out the stickman said is she lucky coyote asked shes made me the luckiest man in the world the young husband said the girl blushed and buried her face in her husbands shoulder minty found that he was irritated by the couples fawning and wondered why he saw it ten times a day newlyweds at the tables acting like they were the first to discover love glued together for a few days of starryeyed public foreplay between bouts in a hotel bed and theyd be back in twenty years separating when they hit the door her locking onto a slot machine while he played blackjack and dreamed of sneaking off to a jiggle show minty wanted to warn them that time would make hypocrites of them one day youll wake up and find that youre married to a husband and a father a wife and a mother and youll wonder whatever happened to the lover that you swapped spit and sweetness with over a crap table but why did it matter it never had before its this indian minty thought hes making me lose it coyote placed all his chips on the pass line are you lucky he said to the bride she smiled and nodded her husband placed a twodollar chip on the pass line go ahead honey he held her shoulders bracing her against the weight of the dice and the girl let fly two snake eyes no pass the stickman raked in the bets coyote dove over the table and caught the woman by the throat riding her to the floor the husband stepped aside as the light of his life went down you are not lucky coyote screeched you lost all my money you are not lucky the girl clawed at his face with lacegloved hands minty fresh caught coyote by the back of the neck and pulled him off the girl with one hand waving away the security jesters who had appeared with the other ive got this handled he nodded to the girl on the floor and the jesters helped her to her feet minty dragged coyote away from the table she lied she lied perhaps youd like to rest for a while minty said as if he was taking coyotes hat rather than dragging him across the floor can we get you something to eat the dining room is closed but our snack bar is open minty was acutely aware that he was in the process of losing his job he should have turned the indian over to security after years as the officer of order he was falling apart i need to get more money coyote said calming down now minty set coyote on his feet keeping a restraining hand on the tricksters neck youre sharing a room with mr hunter arent you ill have the bellman take you up to the room coyote thought for a moment no my money is at another hotel and i dont have a car thats not a problem sir ill call around a limo and drive you myself minty steered coyote out a side exit of the casino and walked him to the valet booth where he ordered a limo from the attendant in a moment a stretch lincoln pulled up to the curb and an eager squire held the door while coyote climbed in minty adjusted the seat before climbing in still his knees were up around the wheel as he drove he tried to form some sort of rationalization for his mistakes something to wash him clean with the management perhaps the indian would lose enough money to justify the lapses of judgment where are you staying sir the frontier minty nodded and pulled out onto the strip call camelot he said a series of beeps sounded in the car and a womans voice came on the speaker camelot desk please thank you a series of clicks and a different voice camelot reservations this is mf minty said im taking a customer to the frontier ill return in a few minutes very good sir theres a message for you from upstairs do you want me to put you through no thank you there was no sense in rushing to the mailbox if you knew there was a letter bomb waiting for you off minty said there was a click coyote was hanging on the back of the seat looking down at the cellular phone you can talk to machines just this one voice activated so you can keep your hands on the wheel i can talk to animals can you take other forms minty smiled the indian was a nut case but at least he was an amusing nut case actually he said this is another form in real life im a short jewish woman i wouldnt have known coyote said it must be the sunglasses he looked at the dashboard does this car tell you where you are no ha mine is better pardon me follow that car coyote said pointing ahead to a z with a shattered back window turning off the strip for a second minty was tempted to follow the car then he caught himself i cant do that sir what was it about this indian that he could twist the world if he wasnt fired when he got back to the casino minty decided he would hire a hooker to rub his temples and tell him that everything was okay until he believed it or ran out of money whichever came first maybe the indian was right about people wanting to be tricked i need cigarettes coyote said we have complimentary cigarettes at the casino sir no i need some now at that store coyote pointed to a minimart across the strip as you wish minty said he pulled the limo into the minimart and turned off the engine coyote said im out of money until we go to my motel allow me sir minty opened the car door and unfolded himself onto the curb ill pay you back not necessary sir camelot will take care of it salems coyote said a carton minty closed the door and walked into the minimart he found the cigarettes then grabbed a package of twinkies off the shelf for himself he checked the date on the twinkies july good they had another thirty years of guaranteed freshness he fell in line behind a drunk man who was waving a gas card at the clerk look man its this simple you charge my card for forty bucks worth of gas and give me twenty in cash you get a hundredpercent profit minty listened to the clerk try to explain why this couldnt be done and smiled in sympathy as if to say they lose their money then they lose their minds the clerk rolled his eyes as if to say this might take a while minty looked outside to check on his passenger and saw the limo backing away from the curb he tossed the cigarettes and twinkies on the counter and ran out losing his glasses as he ducked to get through the doors he reached the street as the limo accelerated out of reach then stopped and stared down the strip watching the lincolns taillights until they blended into a million other lights acid panic rose in his throat then subsided replaced by the resolved calm of the doomed he turned and walked slowly back to the minimart to find his glasses as he reached the door the drunk his gas card still in hand stumbled through and minty caught him by the shoulders to avoid a collision the drunk looked up then tore himself away and stepped back jesus christ boy what happened to your eyes you been sittin too close to the tv minty raised his hand to cover his golden eyes then dropped it and shrugged zipadeedoodah he said with a grin dawn was starting to break and the sky was turning from red to blue coyote sat in the limo which was parked a block behind calliopes orange z which was parked a block away from nardonnes harleydavidson shop lonnies bike was parked outside call sam coyote said nothing happened he pounded on the car phone i said call sam nothing happened call sams room coyote said to the phone nothing happened and the trickster yipped with anger call sams room or ill rip your cord off he picked up the receiver and beat it on the dashboard then he saw a sticker with the casinos logo stuck to the receiver call camelot he said the phone lit up and beeped through some numbers the phone rang once and a woman answered camelot i want to talk to sam do you have a last name sir no just coyote im sorry sir we have no guest listed under coyote not me im here

to try call the girl he said to the phone the phone beeped through the numbers this is carla a sexy womans voice said would you like this on your phone bill or your credit card phone bill coyote said if you like leather press one carla said twins press two for california blondes press three big bottoms press coyote picked up the handset and pressed three another sexy voice came on hi im brandy who are you coyote would you like to know what im wearing coyote no i have to tell the girl to stay here until sam comes well take as long as sam needs is sam getting hard no hes pissed off about his car there was a pause and the sound of her lighting a cigarette brandy said okay lets start over minty waited for the second limo at the pay phone outside the minimart he flipped through his address book until he found the detectives number then dialed the phone rang twice then there was the sound of the receiver rattling and falling finally a sleepy hostile mans voice said what minty said jake this is mf at camelot fuck that this is harassment its its five thirty in the morning you said i could have all the time i needed to pay im not calling about that jake i need a favor one of the limos has been stolen why call me at home you guys have lojack beacons in those limos dont you call the station theyll track it and have it back in half an hour i cant call the station jake this is delicate i

in it meet me at the station in a half hour whats the range on the tracker about a mile depending on the terrain farther in the desert youre not going to be able to cover much area with only one car then make it fifteen minutes and jake what thank you minty hung up so much for the police he thought now if i can get it back before the casino finds out if not i guess its time to go shopping for a red bow tie calliope was sure she could do it if grubb was trapped under a chrysler she could lift the car and pull him out you heard about it all the time hundredpound mom lifts twoton car to save trapped tot it seemed to happen often enough that it should be part of lamaze training okay now breathe focus grab the bumper now lift yep she could do it a chrysler on each arm if she had to she wasnt so sure about getting grubb back from lonnie maybe if that other woman wasnt with him being so hostile and negative she was feeling a little better now that the sun was coming up shed been shivering since the punks had broken her back window from nerves and the cold and she didnt have enough gas money to leave the z running with the heater on while she waited for lonnie to come out of the harley shop she might not have enough to make it home as it was besides something was wrong with the car shed tached it too high while running from the police and something had given way in clatter and smoke as she watched lonnie came through the front door of the shop carrying grubbs diaper bag calliope swallowed hard trying to push down her fear fear of failure she got out of the z the woman followed lonnie holding grubb in her arms calliope ran toward them then stopped when she saw the womans face it was like one painful purple bruise with eyes lonnie calliope called lonnie and the woman turned grubb saw his mother and reached out lonnie pushed down grubbs hand what are you doing here i came to get grubb you shouldnt have taken him talk to the judge hes mine half the time he was right calliope had gone to social services once before when lonnie took grubb on a road trip her caseworker told her that the law couldnt do anything to help you dont want him you just want to hurt me lonnie laughed threw his head back and shook with laughter for all the times he had postured and threatened and screamed and pounded he had never really scared her she was scared now you shouldnt take him on a run like this lonnie what if you get busted run what run were just on a little family camping trip arent we cheryl the woman tucked her face behind grubb give him to me please calliope pleaded lonnie climbed onto his bike grinning and hit the starter the bike fired up and lonnie shouted over the engine go home ill bring him back in a few days cheryl climbed on behind him and he dropped the bike into gear no calliope started to run after them lonnie gunned the bike and roared off she shuffled to a stop and saw grubb reaching out over cheryls shoulder her eyes blurred with tears she turned and ran to her car wiped her eyes and saw the limo parked down the street someone was sitting in it just watching her what are you looking at she screamed sam made the chambermaid help him search the hotel room for his wallet for fifteen minutes before giving up and leaving her with a promise of a tip on the credit card he was thinking this is like being stuck in some kafkaesque roadrunner cartoon when the taxi from the acme cab company pulled up the driver wearing a fez animated by hieronymus bosch sam thought in the cab he said do you know a harleydavidson shop called nardonnes bad part of town cost you double its broad daylight oh it is my shift is over sorry okay double sam said why quibble he couldnt pay the guy anyway when they pulled in behind the limo sam said wait here ill get your money he got out and looked down the street to the harley shop then went up to the limo and pounded on the blackedout window the window whirred down coyote grinned where is she took off just now why didnt you stop her she didnt want to be stopped well find her shes following the biker and we know where hes going the cabdriver beeped his horn give me my wallet sam said coyote handed the wallet out the window sam rifled through it and came up empty theres no money left nope coyote said the cabdriver leaned on the horn sam signaled for him to wait ran around to the other side of the limo and got in go sam said what about the cabdriver fuck him thats the spirit coyote started the limo and peeled away he checked the rearview mirror hes not following good hes talking to his radio got a smoke sam dug a pack of cigarettes out of his jacket pocket tapped one out and lit it wheres my car i sold it you cant sell it without the title i got a good deal five thousand are you nuts five thousand wouldnt buy the stereo i needed to win my money back i won a lot of money on the machine you put the cards in but a shaman with a stick won it back from me sam butted his cigarette in the ashtray and hung his head in his hands trying to let it all sink in so you sold my car for five grand yep coyote snatched the mashed cigarette and relit it and where is that money the shaman had strong cheating medicine thats the kind of thinking that got manhattan sold for a box of beads so they still tell that story it was one of my best tricks they gave us many beads for that island they didnt know that you cant own land sam sighed and slouched in his seat thinking he should be angry or worried about his car but strangely he was more concerned with catching calliope they were on the highway now sam glanced at the speedometer slow down to the speed limit we dont need cop trouble im assuming you stole this car i counted coup stealing a tethered horse tell me sam said coyote told the story of minty and the limo turning it into a fable full of danger and magic making himself the hero he was coming to the part about the car phone when it rang sam reached for the answer button and pulled back his hand in disgust whats this gunk all over the phone it looks like im not to that part of the story yet then you answer it speak coyote said and the phone lit up and clicked is that you brandy a very deep calm voice came over the speakerphone i want the car back now pull over and stop im a couple of minutes behind you the police are off coyote said the phone hung up coyote turned to sam this is a good car you can talk to the phone her name is brandy shes very friendly uhhuh sam said that wasnt her pull off at the next exit chapter food gas enlightenment next right kings lake nevada the exit sign said kings lake but when they pulled off and followed the ramp around the base of a mesa there was no lake no life at all just a dirt road and a strip of gray wooden buildings with faded facades a weathered wooden sign read emergency nevada the population had been crossed out and repainted a dozen times until finally someone had painted a big zero at the bottom and the words we gived up coyote stopped the car what do you want to do here i dont know but we had to get off the highway before they caught up with us sam got out of the car and peered down the empty dirt street shielding his eyes against the sun with his hand a prairie dog scampered across the road and under the wooden sidewalk this road continues out of town maybe it joins up with another major road somewhere else we need a map no map in the car coyote said we can ask someone sam looked around at the empty buildings right lets just stop in at the chamber of commerce and ask someone thats been dead for a hundred years can we do that coyote asked with complete sincerity no we cant do that its a ghost town theres no one here i was going to ask that prairie dog coyote walked to where the prairie dog had disappeared under the walkway hey little one come out sam stood behind the trickster shaking his head he heard a squeak from under the walk coyote looked to sam he doesnt trust you he wont come out unless you go away tell him were in a hurry sam couldnt believe he was being snubbed by a rodent he knows that but he says you have shifty eyes go over there and wait coyote pointed down the sidewalk sam walked past a hitching post and sat on a bench in front of the abandoned saloon he watched the road leading to the highway waiting for the dust cloud from pursuing police cars the road remained empty he watched the prairie dog scamper out from under the sidewalk and stand on his hind legs as coyote talked to him maybe he had been a little hasty in thinking calliope nuts for talking to her kitchen pals they probably thought he had shifty eyes as well after a few moments of talking and chattering coyote threw his head back and laughed then left the prairie dog in the street and came to where sam was sitting youve got to hear this one coyote said this farmer has a pig with a wooden leg hey sam interrupted does he know where the road goes oh yeah but this is a really good joke you see coyote sam shouted coyote looked hurt youre nasty no wonder he doesnt trust you he says that he saw an orange sports car go by a while ago he says that theres a repair place down the road tell him thanks sam said coyote headed back toward the prairie dog sam dug into his windbreaker for his cigarettes and found a chocolate mint he had taken from the hotel room pillow the night before wait sam called he ran to coyotes side the prairie dog bolted under the sidewalk let me talk to him sam bent down and placed the mint in the dirt by the sidewalk look we really appreciate your help the prairie dog didnt answer im not a bad guy once you get to know me sam said he waited wondering what exactly he was waiting for after a minute he started feeling really stupid okay then have a nice day he went back to where coyote stood looking at a sign on the saloon door no indians or dogs allowed coyote said what do they have against dogs what about the indians part coyote shrugged it pisses me off sam yanked the sign off the door and threw it into the street good youre still alive lets go coyote turned and headed for the car ill drive sam said coyote threw the keys over his shoulder sam snatched them out of the air as they pulled away the prairie dog dashed into the street and grabbed the mint thinking that pig joke works every time they drove for twenty minutes bouncing the big lincoln over ruts and rocks and pushing it through washedout winderoded terrain where the road was reduced to the mere suggestion of tire tracks the cellular phone rang twice more but they did not answer it sam was suspecting that once again coyote was playing some sort of trick when he spotted the corrugated steel building sticking up out of the desert the building consisted of one story roughly the size of a twocar garage the steel walls were striped with rust and pulling away from the frame in places the area around the building was littered with abandoned vehicles some dating back fifty years above the doorway a ragged hole that had been cut with a torch hung an elegantly handlettered sign that read satori japanese auto repair in the doorway stood a slightly built oriental man in saffron robes grinning as they pulled up calliopes z was parked in front sam stopped the car and got out the oriental man folded his hands and bowed sam nodded in return and approached the man do you know where the girl is that was driving that car what is the sound of one hand clapping the monk said sam said excuse me the monk ran to sam and jumped up screaming in sams face dont think act thinking he was being attacked sam raised his arms to cover his face and inadvertently hit the monk in the mouth with his elbow knocking the little man to the ground the monk looked up at sam and smiled that was the right answer his teeth were red with blood im sorry sam said offering his hand to help the monk up i didnt know what you were doing the monk waved sam away climbed to his feet and began to dust himself off the first step to knowledge is not knowing the girl is inside with the master thanks sam said he motioned for coyote to follow and went into the building it was one room dimly lit from the doorway and by sunlight filtering through the gaps in the walls around the edges workbenches were stacked with greasy car parts and tools in the center of the room on a grass mat calliope sat with another monk this one ancient drinking tea from tiny cups she looked up and saw sam then without a word ran into his arms i lost him sam the car started making this horrible noise and i had to pull off the highway lonnie took grubb and hes gone sam held her and patted her head telling her it would be okay not really believing it but knowing that was what you were supposed to say she was soft and warm against him and a musky smell of girl sweat and jasmine was coming off her hair he felt himself getting aroused and hated himself for the inappropriateness of the feeling thinking you sick bastard almost as in answer calliope said you feel too good and buried her face in his chest she was crying behind them still standing in the doorway coyote said lets go calliope looked around at him then to sam sam said a friend calliope this is coyote coyote calliope howdy coyote said calliope smiled the master will now fix the car the younger monk said sam looked to the tatami mat the old monk was gone the young monk turned and went out into the sun outside the zs hood was open and the old monk was bent over the engine running his hands over the hoses and wires but staring off into the distance sam realized that he was blind and noticed that there were fingers missing from each of his hands whats he doing coyote asked quiet the young monk said he is finding the problem we really have to get going sam said can we leave the car here and pick it up later the monk said does a dog have a buddha nature does a fish have a watertight asshole said coyote the young monk turned to the trickster and bowed you are wise he said this is nuts sam said weve got another car lets go weve lost them calliope said no we havent we know where theyre going cal how do you know its a long story coyote helped not enough coyote said he pointed to the police cruiser that was bouncing across the desert toward them sam looked to the limo and realized that they had run out of time and more important places to run the cruiser slid to a stop by the limo and they were all engulfed by a cloud of dust when it cleared a sevenfoot black man stood beside the limo a bald man in a sport coat was leveling a riot shotgun over the hood at them id like the keys to the limousine please minty said calliope looked at sam are we in trouble this is not good sam said the monk said life is suffering you need to get laid coyote said sam dug into his pocket for the keys careful said the man with the gun minty fresh approached sam relax jake he said then to sam mr hunter the police are not really involved in this i just want two things i want the keys to the car and i want to know what the hell is going on here quiet the monk said the master is finished they looked to the z where the old monk was staring blankly in their direction disharmony in the cam chakra he announced the young monk bowed sam wondered about the masters missing fingers well minty said sam said do you have a little time minty fresh sat on the tatami mat with sam while the young monk who they had found out was named steve served them tea hed sent jake back to town and the others were outside fiddling with the broken sports car minty wanted some answers mr hunter he began there is something very strange about your friend really he seems fine to me tell me though do you think i have shifty eyes sam affected his best innocent look oh no two of them minty thought they look normal to me they didnt look normal at all they were golden minty hadnt noticed before sam said i mean do i look untrustworthy to you mr hunter you stole my employers car im really sorry about that besides that though do i look shifty minty sighed no not particularly how about if you were shorter say eight inches tall mr hunter what is this all about we really needed the car it doesnt justify taking it but we would have brought it back look im not going to involve the police in this just tell me sam took minty through the story of lonnie taking grubb and the chase leaving out as many details about coyote as he could making their destination in south dakota seem close easy the story was slanted however sam told it with a purpose in mind thinking as he spoke you cant sell if you dont pitch sam closed if we dont have the limo we wont be able to find lonnie and get calliopes baby back you have a mother dont you sam waited im sorry mr hunter i cant let you have it its not mine id lose my job well bring it back after we get grubb im sorry minty said he climbed to his feet and walked to the door then turned im really sorry he pushed his sunglasses up on his face and ducked through the hole in the steel sam followed him out mr f sam called minty looked up as he reached the car yes thanks for not going to the cops i understand your position minty nodded and got in the lincoln calliope came up beside sam and stood with him watching minty drive away she said grubb is all i have sam reached out and took her hand not knowing what to say having failed at the only thing he was really good at talking people into doing things they didnt want to do the young monk came out of the door behind them the master is fixing your car he said he was stirring some green tea into an earthenware bowl with a bamboo whisk more tea they stood together in the sun watching the old man work he fingered each bolt carefully before fitting a wrench to it then removed the bolt so quickly that his hands blurred with the movement sam said how long dont talk to him when he works steve cautioned he will finish when he finishes but dont talk to him when you work work when you talk talk do you get many customers i mean you are pretty far out here three steve said he was wearing a straw hat to protect his shaved head three today no just three then what do you do in the meantime we wait thats all steve said is that all the patriarch daruma did at the wall for nine years there was no anger in his voice we wait but how do you pay your rent buy food there is no rent the owner of kings lake augustus brine brings us food he is a fisherman kings lake is up the road right what is it a resort a house of pleasure a whorehouse that supports buddhist monks how sweet calliope said hes got it coyote said pointing to the master who was holding up a rod of polished metal a bent push rod steve said the master carried the push rod into the shop they all followed and watched as the old man tightened the rod into a vise he picked up a hammer and stood over the vise his free hand feeling the rod without warning the old man screamed and delivered a clanging blow to the push rod then bowed and set the hammer on the bench fixed steve said bowing is that how he lost his fingers to achieve enlightenment one must give up the things of this world like piano lessons coyote said chapter hope is bulletproof truth just hard to hit as minty fresh drove back to las vegas he thought about what sam had said you have a mother dont you and the question set minty fresh to thinking about a phone call from his mother that had changed his life youre the only one left can do something baby the others are too far or too far gone please come home baby i need you even when he had to duck to pass through her front door she still called him baby that tone hed heard it in her voice before when she was tugging at her husband to get him to stop strapping her youngest but he hadnt gone back for her had he it was a call deep with duty and silent pride that brought him home he went back for nathan nathan fresh had never been home when any of his nine children were born he was a sailor and as far as he knew when you came home from sea a new child would be waiting for you the others grew an inch or two at a time and the shoes that one was wearing when you left would be on the next one down when you got home he loved his children foreign creatures that they were and trusted his wife to raise them as long as they could line up snap to and pass inspection when he came home and although he was gone most of the time making the high seas safe for democracy he was a presence in the house photographs in crisp dress whites and blues stared down from the walls commendations and medals a letter once a week read out loud at the supper table and a thousand warnings of what papa would do to a doomed misbehaver when he got home to the fresh children papa was only a little bit more real than santa claus and only a bit more conspicuous on the ship chief petty officer nathan fresh was known only as the chief feared and respected tough and fair starched razor creased and polished always in trim and intolerant of anyone who wasnt the chief did you notice that he was black only five foot five barely pounds no but did you see his eyes like smiles when he was showing the pictures of his kids when he was telling tales of lobbing shells the size of refrigerators into the hills of korea did you ever mention retirement to him thats a frost thats a chill minty fresh the youngest of nine the one born with golden eyes knew the chill hes not mine papa said said it only once minty stayed out of papas way when he could wore dark glasses when he couldnt at age ten he stood six feet tall and no amount of slouching would roll papas resentment off his back his place in the family was a single line at the bottom of a letter babys fine too far enough from love momma to deny the association at night by flashlight he wrote his own letters my team is going to the state championships i was voted allconference the press calls me m f cool because i wear tinted goggles when i play and sunglasses during interviews the colleges are calling already and sending recruiters to the games youd be proud momma swears youre wrong in the bathroom he watched the letters go in tiny pieces around the bowl down and out to sea minty fresh left for the university of nevada at las vegas the week after high school graduation the same week that nathan fresh took his mandatory retirement from the navy and came home to san diego for good the coach at unlv wanted minty to lift weights all summer beef up for the big boys the coach gave momma fresh a new washer and dryer nathan fresh put them out on the porch the day before the first game when unlv was going to unleash its secret weapon on the unsuspecting ncaa a sevenfoot center with a threefoot vertical leap who could benchpress four hundred pounds and shoot ninety percent from the freethrow line m f cool got the call im on my way momma he said my father needs me he said to the coach when we brought you up from nothing gave you a full scholarship put up with the goggles and the shades and the silly name gave your mother a washer and dryer no you wont miss the season opener youre mine how touching minty said no one has ever said that to me before perhaps he thought later stuffing the coach in that locker had been a mistake but at the time a few hours in seclusion among socks and jocks seemed just what the coach needed to gain some perspective he broke the key off in the padlock tore the m f cool label off the locker and went home hes been gone four days now momma said he drinks and gambles hangs out at the pool hall til all hours but he always came home before since he retired hes changed i dont know him neither do i bring him home baby minty took a cab to the waterfront and ducked in and out of a dozen bars and pool halls before he realized that nathan would go anywhere but the waterfront there were sailors there reminders after two days of searching he found nathan barely able to stand shooting pool with a fat mexican in a cantina outside of tijuana chief lets go mommas waiting i aint no chief go away i got a game going minty put his hand on his fathers shoulder cringing at the smell of tequila and vomit coming off him papa shes worried the fat mexican moved around the table to where minty stood and pushed him away with a cue stick my friend this one goes nowhere until we get what he owes us two other mexicans moved off their barstools now you go he poked minty in the chest with the cue stick and nathan fresh wheeled on him and bellowed in finest chief petty officer form dont you touch my son you fucking greaseball the mexicans cue caught nathan on the bridge of the nose and nathan went down limp minty palmed the mexicans head and slammed his face into the pool table then turned in time to catch each of the two coming off the bar with a fist in the throat another with a knife went airborne into a corona mirror which broke louder than his neck two more went down one with a skull fractured by a billiard ball one his shoulder wrenched from its socket went into shock there were seven in all broken or unconscious before the cantina cleared and minty dripping blood from a cut on his arm carried his father out momma met them at the hospital and stood with minty as nathan came around what are you doing here you yelloweyed freak minty walked out of the room momma followed he dont mean it baby he really dont i know momma where you going back to vegas you call when he sobers up hell want to talk to you call me if you need me momma he said he kissed her on the forehead and walked out she called him every week and he could tell by her whisper that nathan was home was fine it made him fine too not m f cool just mf the one who handled things all that was missing was the feeling of being needed essential bound to duty sam had said you have a mother dont you minty steered the limo off the next exit across the overpass and back on the highway headed back to kings lake it had taken steve the buddhist monk only a half hour to put the car back together when sam tried to figure out a way to pay for the repairs steve said all misery comes from desire and connection to the material go sam said thanks now he was driving the z into utah calliope was asleep on coyotes lap coyote snored sam passed the time trying to figure out how long it would take to get to sturgis south dakota the location of the rally that the guild was going to about twenty hours he thought if the car held together from time to time he looked over at calliope and felt a twinge of jealousy toward coyote she looked like a child when she slept he wanted to protect her hold her but it was that childlike quality that frightened him as well her ability to dismiss facts deny the negative to see things so clearly but so clearly wrong it was as if she refused to accept what any reasonable adult knew the world was a dangerous hostile place he brushed a strand of hair out of her face before looking back to the road she murmured and came awake with a yawn i was dreaming about sea turtles that they were really dinosaur angels and thats all it was a dream sam had been thinking about it too long so there was anger in his voice when he asked her why didnt you call me before you went after lonnie i dont know i was worried if it werent for coyote i would have never found you are you two related she seemed to be ignoring his anger you look a lot alike he has the same eyes and skin no i just know him sam didnt want to explain he wanted an answer why didnt you call me calliope recoiled at his harshness i had to go get grubb i could have gone with you would you have is that what you wanted im here arent i it would have been a hell of a lot easier if i didnt have to chase you across two states and maybe you wouldnt have done it if it was a hell of a lot easier would you the question and her tone threw him he thought for a minute looking at the road i dont know i know she said softly i dont know much but i know about that youre not the only man that ever wanted me or wanted to rescue me they all do sam men are addicted to the wanting you like the idea of having me and the idea of rescuing me thats what attracted you to me in the first place remember thats not true it is true thats why i had sex with you so soon i dont get it this was not at all how sam had expected her to react his brief moment of selfrighteousness had degraded into selfdoubt i did it to see if you could get past the fantasy of wanting me and rescuing me to the reality of me me with a baby and no education and a lousy job me with no idea what im going to do next i cant stand the wanting coming at me all the time i have to get past it like i did with you or ignore it so you were testing me sam said thats why you took off without telling me no it wasnt a test i liked you but i have grubb to take care of now i cant afford to hope she was starting to tear up sam felt as if hed just been caught stomping a litter of kittens she took grubbs blanket from behind the seat and wiped her eyes you okay sam asked she nodded sometimes i want to be touched and i pretend that im in love and that someone loves me i just take my moments and forget about hope you were going to be a moment sam but i started to have hope if id called you and you had said no then i would have lost my hope again thats not how i am sam said how are you then sam drove in silence for a while trying to think of something to say the right thing to say but that wasnt the answer either he always knew the right thing to say to get what he wanted or had until coyote showed up but now he didnt know what he wanted calliope had declared wanting a mortal sin talking to a woman to anyone without having an agenda was completely foreign to him where was he supposed to speak from what point of view who was he supposed to be he was afraid to look at her felt heat rise in his face when he thought about her looking at him waiting maybe the truth where do you go to find the truth she had found it let it go at him she had laid her hope in his hands and she was waiting to see what he would do with it finally he said im a fullblooded crow indian i was raised on a reservation in montana when i was fifteen i killed a man and i ran away and ive spent my life pretending to be someone im not ive never been married and ive never been in love and thats not something i know how to pretend im not even sure why im here except that you woke something up in me and it seemed to make sense to run after something instead of away for a change if thats the horrible act of wanting then so be it and by the way you are sitting on the lap of an ancient indian god now he looked at her he was a little out of breath and his mind was racing but he felt incredibly relieved he felt like he needed a cigarette and a towel and maybe a shower and breakfast calliope looked from sam to coyote and then to sam again her eyes were wider each time she looked back coyote stopped his snoring and languidly opened one eye hi he said he closed his eye and resumed snoring calliope bent over and kissed sams cheek i think that went well dont you sam laughed and grabbed her knee look weve still got twenty hours on the road and im going to need you to drive so get some sleep okay i dont trust him at the wheel sam nodded toward coyote but hes a god calliope said as flies to wanton boys are we to the godsthey kill us for their sport what an icky thing to say sorry shakespeare wrote it i cant get it out of my mind this week its like an old song that gets stuck that happened to me once with rocky raccoon right sam said its exactly like that chapter shifting sam drove through the day and into the night and finally stopped at a truck stop outside of salt lake city calliope and coyote had been awake for the last few hours but neither had spoken very much calliope seemed embarrassed about talking to the trickster now that she knew he was a god and coyote just stared out the window either lost in his own thoughts or sam thought this more likely absorbed in some new scheme to throw peoples lives into chaos from time to time someone would break the silence by saying pretty rock a statement which covered the complete observational spectrum for utahs landscape then they would lapse into silence for a half hour or so sam led them into the truck stop and they all took stools at a carousel counter among truckers and a couple of grungy hitchhikers who were hoping to cadge a ride a barrelshaped woman in an orange polyester uniform approached and poured them coffee without asking if they wanted it her name tag read arlene you want something to eat honey she asked calliope with an accent warm with southern hospitality sam wondered about this no matter where you go truckstop waitresses have a southern accent do you have oatmeal calliope asked how bout a little brown sugar on that arlene asked she looked over rhinestoneframed reading glasses calliope smiled that would be nice how bout you darlin she said to coyote drinks umbrellas and swords now you know bettern that come into mormon country and order drinks she shamed him with a wave of her finger coyote turned to sam mormon country they settled in this area they believe that jesus visited the indian people after he rose from the dead oh him i remember him hairy face made a big deal about dying and coming back to life one time ha he was funny he tried to teach me how to walk on water i can do it pretty good in the wintertime arlene giggled girlishly i dont think you need any more to drink hon how bout some ham and eggs sam said thatll be fine two of those over easy sam watched arlene move around the counter flirting with some of the truckers like a saloon girl clucking over others like a mother hen she snuck a cinnamon roll to a scruffy teenage hitchhiker with no money and asked after him like an older sister then moved across the counter and found the kid a ride with a gruff cowboy trucker one minute she was swearing like a sailor the next she was blushing like a virgin and all the customers who sat at her counter got what they needed sam realized that he was watching a shapeshifter a kind and giving creature perhaps he was meant to notice perhaps that was what he needed she was good maybe he was too he turned to calliope and caught her in the middle of losing a bite of oatmeal down her chin we can do this he said well get him back i know she said you do she nodded wiping oatmeal off her chin with a napkin thats the scary thing about hope she said if you let it go too long it turns into faith she scooped another bite of cereal sam smiled he wished that he shared her confidence did you ever go to south dakota with lonnie will we be able to find them i went to the big summer rally not this time of year they dont camp with the other bikers they rent land from a farmer in the hills all the guild chapters stay together there could you find it again i think so but theres only one dirt road leading in there how will we get grubb out well i guess just walking in and asking for him isnt going to work they usually have guns they get drunk and play shooting games coyote said wait for them to go to sleep then sneak in and count coup they dont really sleep calliope said they do crank and drink all weekend then we will have to trick them i was afraid youd say that sam said he spun on his stool and looked out the windows of the truck stop to the gas pumps where a black stretch lincoln was just pulling away sam woke up in the passenger seat the z was parked sideways on the side of the road the headlights trained over a pasture the drivers seat was empty coyote who was curled up in the tiny space behind the seat growled and popped his head out between the seat whats going on i dont know sam looked around for calliope it was raining out maybe she stopped to take a leak there she is coyote pointed to a spot by the barbedwire fence where calliope was standing by a young calf working furiously on something at the fence a mother cow stood by watching the calfs tail is stuck on the barbed wire coyote said sam opened the car door and stepped out into the rain just as calliope finished untangling the calf which scampered to its mother its okay she called i got him she waved for him to get back into the car she ran to the car and got in sorry i had to stop he looked so sad its okay pasture pals right sam said she grinned as she started the car i thought we could use the karma balance sam looked for a road sign where are we almost there we have to get going theres been a car behind us for a while i got way ahead of it but i felt like it was following us she pulled onto the road ramming through the gears like a grand prix driver sam was peeking at the speedometer when he saw a colored light blow by in the corner of his eye what was that the only stoplight in sturgis calliope said im sorry guys it sort of snuck up on me the z goes better than it stops were here already sam said but its still dark out its a few more miles to the farm calliope said sam if a cop saw me go through that light can you take the wheel my license is suspended sam checked his watch amazed at their progress you must have averaged ninety the whole way i had to go to jail the last time they caught me three months they taught me to do nails for vocational training you did three months for a traffic violation there were a few of them calliope said it wasnt bad i got a degree im a certified nail technician now in jail it was mostly lovehate nails but i was good at it i would have had a career except the polish fumes give me a headache coyote pulled grubbs blanket out of the hole in the back window and looked through its clear theres a car behind us but its not a cop the sleeping town was only a block long a stoplight with accessories calliope drove them through town and turned south on a county road that wound into the black hills its a couple of minutes up this road to the turnoff then about a mile in on a dirt road sam said turn off the lights when you make the turn well drive halfway in and walk the rest of the way calliope made the turn onto a singlelane dirt road that led through a thick stand of lodgepole pines the road was deeply rutted the ruts filled with water the z bucked and bottomed out in several places keep it moving steady sam said dont hit the gas or the wheels will dig into the mud christ its dark its the trees calliope said theres a clearing ahead where they camp sam was trying to peer into the darkness to his right he thought he saw something stop calliope let the z roll to a stop okay sam said hit the parking lights just for a second calliope clicked the parking lights on and off thats what i thought sam said theres a cattle gate back there to the right back the z in there so we can turn it around giving up coyote said if we have to get out of here fast i dont want to have to back down this road he got out of the car and directed calliope as she backed the z in and turned it off we walk from here they got out of the car and started down the road stepping between the puddles the air was damp and cold and smelled faintly of wood smoke and pine when the moonlight broke through the trees they could see their breath calliope said wait she turned and ran back to the car then returned in a moment with grubbs blanket in hand hell want his wubby sam smiled in spite of himself knowing the girl couldnt see his face in the dark never face heavily armed bikers without your wubby coyote and cottontail its an old story coyote and his friend cottontail were hiding on a wooded hill above a camp watching some girls dance around the fire coyote said id sure like to get close to some of them you wont get near them cottontail said they know who you are maybe not little one maybe not coyote said ill go down there in disguise they wont let any man get close to them cottontail said i wont be a man coyote said here hold this coyote took off his penis and handed it to cottontail now when i come back into the woods i will call to you and you can bring me my penis then coyote changed into an old woman and went down to the camp he danced with the girls and pinched them and slapped their bottoms oh grandmother the girls said you are wicked you must be that old trickster coyote im just an old woman coyote said here feel under my dress one of the girls felt under coyotes dress and said she is just an old woman coyote pointed to two of the prettiest girls lets dance in the trees he said he danced with the girls into the woods and tickled them and made them roll around with him laughing he touched them under their dresses until they said oh grandmother you are wicked cottontail come here coyote called but there was no answer wait here for your old grandmother to return coyote told the girls he ran all over the woods calling for cottontail but could not find him he went over that hill to the next one and still no cottontail he was excited and wanted very much to have sex with the girls but alas he could not find his penis finally the sun started coming up and the girls called old grandmother we cant wait for you any longer we have to go home coyote stalked the hills cursing that cottontail i will kill him for stealing my penis as he walked he passed three other girls coming out of the woods they were giggling and one of them was saying he was so little but he had such a big thing i thought i would split coyote ran in the direction the girls had come from and found cottontail sitting under a tree having a smoke ill kill you you little thief coyote cried but coyote i pleasured the three many times and four times i made each of them cry out coyote was too tired from tickling and dancing all night to stay mad really four times each yep cottontail said handing coyote his member i feel like i was there coyote said you got a smoke sure said cottontail are you going to need your penis tonight coyote laughed and smoked with cottontail while his little friend told the story of his long night of pleasuring chapter like flies they heard the bikers before they saw them raucous laughter and lynyrd skynyrd from a boom box they followed the road around a long gradual curve that descended into a valley stepping carefully to avoid the deep puddles the trees were thinning out now and sam could make out the light of a huge bonfire below them in the valley and figures moving around the fire a lot of them someone fired a pistol into the air and the report echoed around the valley do they have sentries or something sam whispered to calliope i dont remember i was pretty drunk when i was here before well we cant just walk in this way coyote said pointing to a path that led away from the road they followed the trickster up the path through thick undergrowth and up onto a ridge that looked down on the clearing from the top of the ridge they could see the entire camp the fire was burning in the center of the camp with perhaps a hundred bikers and women gathered around it drinking and dancing the bikes were parked by the road leading in there was a stand of tents and smaller campfires on the opposite side of the camp with two pickup trucks parked nearby lynyrd skynyrd sang gimme back my bullets i dont see grubb calliope said or the woman coyote said wait calliope said listen amid the din of rock and roll laughter shouts screams and gunfire they heard the sound of a baby crying its coming from the tents coyote said follow me coyote led them further down the ridge until they were about fifty yards from the tents and could see four women sitting around a campfire drinking and talking one of them was holding grubb there he is calliope said she started down the ridge and sam caught her arm if you go down there that woman will call for lonnie and the others what can i do we have to get him take off your clothes coyote said sam sneered at the trickster i dont think so here take this coyote said handing something to sam sam couldnt make out what it was in the dark but it felt warm and soft he recoiled and dropped it ouch coyote said his voice soft now feminine is that any way to treat a lady sam looked moved closer to the trickster and saw that he was no longer a he still in his black buckskins he had changed into a woman i dont believe it sam said youre lovely calliope said thanks coyote said give me your clothes these dont fit me now he started undressing in the dim moonlight that filtered through the trees sam watched the women undress calliope was right the trickster was gorgeous a perfect female mirror of the male coyote an indian goddess sam felt a little sick at the thought and looked away coyote said ill go down and get the child be ready to run and pick that up ill need it he pointed to the ground where sam had dropped his penis sam picked up the member in two fingers and held it out as if it would bite him im not comfortable with this ill hold it calliope said now dressed in the black buckskins no you wont sam said well she cocked a hip and waited for him to make a decision sam put the penis in his jacket pocket im not comfortable with this i want you to know men are such babies coyote said he hugged calliope girl to girl and made his way down the hill sam watched the trickster move away from them toward the fire unable to look away he became nervous with his own thoughts calliope patted his shoulder its okay she said in my jeans he really does have a great ass tinker lay in the bed of the pickup sulking listening to the nearby women going on about how badly they were treated by their men and how cute the baby was the little bastard had been crying for an hour what the fuck had lonnie been thinking bringing a crumbsnatcher to a rally from time to time tinker sat up and looked over the edge of the pickup to pick out which of the women he would fantasize about getting a blow job from fat chance stuck here in the truck fucking bonner and his military discipline this is a business trip bonner had said a business trip we wouldnt be taking if tinker would have taken care of business so tink you guard the truck no partying what was the point rallying with your bros if you couldnt get fucked up and start a few fights fuck this action at least it had stopped raining tinker peeked over the edge of the truck to see a new chick coming up to the fire what a piece she was right out of penthouse or something she looked indian long blueblack hair what a fucking body he watched her fawn over the baby and touch cheryls face lonnie had fucked her up bad tink wondered what it was like to hit a chick he was getting hard thinking about it the indian chick was holding the baby now walking around the fire rocking it she walked behind one of the tents then ducked down tinker saw her shoot out the other side in a crouch headed up the hill with the baby two people were coming down to meet her hey bitch cheryl yelled the other women were on their feet yelling going after the indian chick tinker jumped out of the truck and started to circle around and up the hill to head off the indian chick as he ran he drew his magnum from his shoulder holster he slipped fell to one knee and drew down on the indian chick no fuck it if he hit the rugrat bonner would have his ass he climbed to his feet and lumbered across the hill watching the indian chick hand the rugrat to a blond chick they were on the path at the top of the ridge gotcha hed take the lower path and be waiting for them they had to come out at the road as tinker made his way up the dark path he heard scooters firing up below him good bonner would get there and he would already have it handled hed be out of the doghouse he reached the spot where the two paths intersected and stopped he could hear them coming up the path the baby still crying he leveled his magnum down the path and waited if the dude showed first hed waste him without a word he saw a shadow then a foot tinker cocked the magnum put the sight where the chest would appear a rush went through him waiting waiting now a vise clamped down over the gun and he felt it wrenched out of his hand taking skin with it another clamp locked down on his neck and he looked up into the eyes of his deepest fear he felt his face come down on something hard and the bones of his nose crush his head was wrenched back and slammed down again then it went dark shade coyote said minty fresh threw tinkers unconscious body aside and looked up at the indian woman who are you sam said mf what are you doing here the name is minty fresh he held tinkers magnum out to sam then let it drop im learning how to sneak up on people he saw the baby and smiled you got him it was a fine trick coyote said who are you minty insisted its your old buddy coyote coyote cupped his breasts minty stepped back from the woman to get a better look somethings different right haircut we have to go calliope said to where minty said calliope looked at sam panicked confused sam had no answer coyote said montana the crow res come with us shade itll be fun minty turned to the roar of bikes behind him theyre coming up the road he said ill block them as long as i can with the limo they made their way down the path to where the z was parked the limo was parked in front ill drive sam instructed cal you and grubb in the back they got in the car as lights from the harleys broke through the woods minty got in the limo started it and pulled it forward to make way for the z sam pulled the z into the road careful not to spin the wheels in the mud you guys okay he said to calliope who had curled herself around grubb go she said the bikers broke into view lonnie ray in front minty hit the brights on the limo hoping to blind them he checked the mirror to see the z pulling away then started to back the limo up careful to keep it in the middle of the road to block the bikes as lonnie approached the limo he drew a pistol from his jacket and leveled it at minty through the windshield minty ducked and hit the gas the limo revved and stopped the back wheels of the heavy car buried in the mud lonnie jumped off his bike onto the hood of the limo and braced himself on the roof as he aimed and fired at the z at the sound of the shot minty looked up to see the barrel of lonnies pistol pointing at him through the windshield the other bikers unable to get past moved up around the limo youre finished spook lonnie hissed he cocked the pistol move the car out of the road i dont think so minty said lonnie jumped off the hood of the lincoln and stuck the pistol through the window into mintys temple i said move it you move it minty said he pushed the limo door open knocking lonnie to the ground two bikers yanked him from the car and rode him to the ground minty felt a boot in his kidney then a fist in the stomach then the blows fell on him like rain he heard calliopes z downshifting in the distance and smiled sam pulled the z back onto the pavement and floored it everyone okay grubb was still crying sam shouted calliope are you okay coyote turned in the passenger seat and reached back shes hit theres blood oh fuck is she shes dead sam coyote said part home coyote hears his heart it is an old story from the time of the animal people coyote was in his canoe and had paddled all day and all night only to find that he didnt know where he wanted to go he sat in his canoe drifting for a while thinking that something was wrong he wanted to do something but he didnt know what it was so he made some mountains and gave them names but that didnt make him happy he tried to think but he wasnt very good at it and he kept hearing a thumping noise that bothered him where should i go what should i do how can i think with all this noise coyote was becoming sad because he could not think so he called out to the old mother who was the earth old mother he said can you stop this thumping noise so i can figure out where i am supposed to be old mother heard coyote and laughed at him silly coyote she said that thumping noise is the sound of your own heart beating listen to it it is the sound of the drums when you hear your heart you must think of the drums the sound of home i knew that coyote said chapter there are no orphans among the crow it was five hours from sturgis to crow agency and coyote back in his black buckskins drove the whole way sam sat in the passenger seat dazed staring but seeing nothing holding grubb rocking the baby in a rhythm to a pulsing emptiness in his chest and trying not to look at calliopes lifeless body in the back mercifully there was no thinking or remembering his mind had shut down to protect him coyote was quiet as they drove through town an old warning sounded deep in sams mind and he mumbled i shouldnt be here im in trouble you have to go home coyote said okay sam said he thought he should protest but he couldnt think clearly enough to remember why when we get there no tricks okay act human for a while please for a while coyote said a mile out of town coyote pulled the z into the muddy driveway of the hunts alone house stay here coyote said he got out of the car and went up the cement steps to the door sam looked around seeing the house like a memory it hadnt changed much the house had been painted and peeled a couple of times and there were two horses a paint and a buckskin in the back field an old airstream trailer was parked by the sweat lodge and there were a couple more abandoned cars rusting in the side lot it all felt wrong to have run so long to end up back where he had started the danger that he had run from was still here and now with calliope dead he felt even weaker than the fifteenyearold who had left so many years ago as frightening as it had been to leave it had been a beginning full of hope and possibility this felt like the end coyote knocked on the door and waited a crow woman in jeans and a sweatshirt about thirty answered she was holding a baby yes coyote said ive brought your cousin home we need help come in she said coyote went into the house and came back to the car a few minutes later he opened the door startling sam lets go inside coyote said i told the woman inside what happened he helped sam out of the car and pointed him to the door where the woman waited sam walked stiffly up the steps and past the woman into the house he stood in the center of the living room rocking grubb coyote came in the door behind him can i bring her in he asked the woman the woman looked horrified at the thought of a dead body in the house sam turned suddenly no not in the house no coyote waited the woman looked uncomfortable you could put her in the trailer out back coyote went back out the woman came to sam and pulled the blanket away from grubbs face has he eaten ii dont know not for a while he needs a change cmon give she put her own baby on the couch and coaxed grubb out of sams arms she spread the blanket on the coffee table and laid grubb down on his back ive heard about you she said im cindy festus is my husband sam didnt answer she took grubbs dirty diaper off him and set it aside hes at work now with his dad they have their own shop in hardin harry works with them too grandma sam said she looked up and shook her head years ago before i met festus she brightened trying to change the subject and the mood we have three other kids two other boys and a girl theyre in school the little one in head start sam stared over her head at the elkhorn hat rack hung with baseball caps an old stetson and a ceremonial headdress an obsidianpoint buffalo lance hung beside it next to an old winchester and a sports illustrated swimsuit calendar hes a strong baby cindy said grabbing grubbs fidgeting fists sam looked back at her pokey he looked down and away a wave of grief washing over him he walked to the kitchen doorway and stared at the ceiling the first tears stinging as they welled up pokeys okay cindy said he went into the clinic last week he almost he was real sick they wanted to move him to the hospital in billings but harlan wouldnt let them cindy finished diapering grubb and propped him up on the couch next to her own baby ill fix him a bottle she walked past sam into the kitchen he turned away from her as she went by do you want some food coffee sam turned to her she never hurt anybody she just wanted her baby back he covered his face cindy moved to him and put her arms around him coyote came in the front door sam we have to go sam took cindy by the shoulders and gently pushed her away then turned and looked at grubb who was dozing on the couch hell be okay cindy said ill watch him sam didnt move sam coyote said lets go see pokey heading back through crow agency to the clinic sam noticed the new modern tribal building and the new stadium behind it wileys food and gas was still across the highway just as it had been before kids were still hanging around outside the burger stand two old men shared a bottle outside the tobacco store a mother led a pack of kids out of the general store each carrying a bag of groceries i shouldnt be here sam said coyote ignored him and kept driving the clinic was housed in an old twostory house at the far end of town a line of people mostly women and kids waited outside coyote pulled into the muddy parking lot next to a rustedout buick they crawled out of the car and walked up to the door some of the kids whispered and giggled pointing at coyote an old man who was wheeling an oxygen cylinder behind him said crow fair aint til next summer boy why you dressed for a powwow be cool sam said to coyote dont scare him coyote shrugged and followed sam into the waiting room a tenbyten parlor with a checked linoleum floor and mintgreen walls hung with racks of pamphlets twenty people sat in folding chairs along the walls reading old copies of people or just staring at their shoes sam approached a window where a crow woman was absorbed in scribbling on index cards intent on not looking at those who waited excuse me sam said the woman didnt look up fill this out she handed a form and a stick pen over the counter when you hand it in with the pen ill give you a number im not here for treatment sam said and the woman looked up for the first time im here to see pokey medicine wing the woman seemed annoyed just a minute she got up and walked through the door into the back in a moment a door into the waiting room opened and everyone looked up a young white doctor poked his head out spotted sam and coyote and signaled for them to come in everyone in the waiting room looked back down inside the door the doctor looked them up and down sam in his dirty windbreaker and slacks coyote in his buckskins are you family hes my clan uncle sam said the doctor nodded to coyote and you just a friend sam said youll have to wait outside the doctor said sam looked at coyote keep it under control okay i said i would the trickster went back into the waiting room he should be in a real hospital the doctor said he was technically dead twice we brought him back with the defibrillator hes stable now but we dont have the staff here to watch him he should be in an icu sam hadnt heard a word of it can i see him follow me the doctor turned and led sam down a narrow hallway and up a flight of steps he was severely dehydrated and suffering from hypothermia i think hed been drinking even before he went on the fast it leached all the fluids out of his body his liver is shot and his heart sustained some damage the doctor stopped and opened a door just a few minutes hes very weak the doctor went in with sam pokey was lying in a hospital bed tubes and wires connecting him to bottles and machines his skin was a browngray color mr medicine wing the doctor said softly someone is here to see you pokeys eyes opened slowly hey samson he said he smiled and sam noticed that he still hadnt gotten false teeth hey pokey sam said you got bigger yeah sam said seeing pokey was breaking through his fog and he was starting to hurt again you look like shit pokey said so do you must run in the family pokey grinned you got a smoke sam shook his head i dont think that would be a good idea i hear youre still drinking yeah i went to some meetings they said i needed to get a higher power if i wanted to quit i told them that a higher power was why i was drinking in the first place hes outside now waiting pokey nodded and closed his eyes i had a couple of visions about you meeting up with him all those years hes quiet then i get a bunch of visions i thought you was dead until i had the first one i couldnt come home i shouldnt have pokey dismissed the thought with a weak wave of his hand you had to go enos wouldve killed you he checked on us for years lookin in our mailbox for letters watching the house he drove himself plumb crazy he give up on you when grandma died and you didnt come home sam had listened to the last part of the speech sitting on the edge of the bed with his back to pokey his knees had given out at the news that enos was alive he stared at the door i dont feel anything he said you okay pokey said trying to grab his nephews arm theres nothing im not even afraid whats wrong sam looked over his shoulder at pokey i thought i killed him you busted him up real good broke both his legs and an arm sliding down the face of the dam tub a lard didnt even have the manners to drown i been running for nothing i i should of never give you that coyote medicine pokey said his breath was starting to come in rasping gasps i thought if i got rid of it i wouldnt be crazy no more its okay sam patted pokeys arm i dont think you had a choice pokey continued to breathe heavily i saw a shadow that said you were going where there was death i didnt know where to find you i told old man coyote he said he knew pokey gripped sams arm he said he knew samson you got to get away from him calm down pokey sam stood and put his hands on pokeys shoulder its okay pokey it wasnt my death do you want the doctor pokey shook his head his breathing started to calm sam took a pitcher of water from the bedside table and poured some into a paper cup he held it while pokey drank then helped the old man lie back whose death pokey asked sam put the cup down a girl he looked away you loved her sam nodded still looking away she had a baby cindys watching him when did it happen this morning was old man coyote with you when it happened yes ask him to bring her back he owes you that shes dead pokey shes gone i been dead twice in the last two days i aint gone she was shot pokey a bullet went through her spine samson look at me pokey pulled himself up on the bed so he could look sam in the eye he owes you theres a story that old man coyote invented death so there wouldnt be too many people theres another story that his wife was killed and he went into the underworld to get her there was a shade there that let her go as long as coyote promised not to look at her until he got back to the world but he looked so now no one can come back pokey i cant do this right now i cant listen to this he stole your life samson sam shook his head violently this just happened to me i didnt make any of it happen then make it happen now pokey shouted sam stopped in the buffalo days they said that a warrior who had counted coup and had an arrow bundle could move in and out of the underworld he could hide there from his enemies go samson old man coyote can help you find your girl shes dead pokey the underworld is just old superstition mumbo jumbo pokey said yes crazy talk thats right voodoo exactly like coyote medicine no well sam didnt answer he was gritting his teeth glaring at his uncle pokey smiled you still hate it when i talk about the old ways try it samson what do you have to lose nothing sam said theres nothing at all the doctor opened the door and said thats enough he needs to rest fuck off paleface pokey said sam said just one more minute please one minute the doctor said holding up his finger as he backed out of the room sam looked at pokey fuck off paleface he laughed it felt good be nice squats behind the bush im sick sam felt something moving through him as he grinned at pokey something warm like hope now quick before you die again you old fuck where do i get an arrow bundle sam came striding out of the clinic and grabbed coyote by the arm pulling him away from a group of kids he was lying to what had been a paralyzing grief had changed to purpose sam felt incredibly alive lets go give me the keys whats going on coyote said why the hurry did the old man die sam climbed into the z and fired it up ive got to get to a phone and ive got to get some clothes what happened in there you knew she was going to be killed didnt you i knew someone would pokey says that you can go in and out of the land of the dead i can oh the underworld yeah i can i dont like to though were going its depressing you wont like it pokey thinks you can bring calliope back i tried that once it didnt work its not up to me then were going to talk to whoever its up to arent you afraid im a little past that why do you need clothes were going to billings first to get something its depressing you wont like it theres a big cliff in billings that was a buffalo jump but our people never drove the herds over it the buffalo used to go up to the edge and say oh no its billings then theyd just jump over out of depression nope you dont want to go to billings sam pulled into the hunts alone driveway shut off the car and turned to coyote whats in the underworld what are you so afraid of chapter a doctorate in deception according to pokey at the time the white men came there were seven sacred arrow bundles each had been made by four medicine men who had the same vision at the same time once the bundles were made the medicine men vowed never to gather again afraid that if their combined power were stolen by one he would become invincible and abuse the power these bundles contained the most powerful of warrior medicine able to protect the carrier from an enemys weapon give him the ability to travel swiftly and escape to the underworld in an emergency to return later unharmed of the original seven bundles two had been destroyed by fire two by flood two were locked away in museums in washington and the last to leave the reservation was in the hands of a private collector in billings who had bought it from a family who had been converted to christianity and thought the bundle might jeopardize their salvation at first sam suspected pokeys story his choice finally to believe it was based more on heart than logic whether the story of the bundles was true or not didnt matter as much as the hope it inspired action based on hope just felt better than the paralysis of certainty when sam came through the door of the hunts alone house cindy hardly recognized him when she had first met him he seemed weak wasted and without reason to live now he was moving and talking with purpose sam said cindy im sorry about before i dont want to impose youre family she said and that was all the explanation needed thanks sam said we went to see pokey hes doing fine did they say when he can come home were bringing him home tonight if things go the way they should can i use the phone cindy waved toward the kitchen table where the phone sat amid a stack of cereal boxes and bowls sam checked on grubb found him sleeping and went to the phone the first call went out to the museum of the west in cody wyoming yes they knew a serious collector of indian artifacts in billings they had bought several pieces from him over the years his name was arnstead houston the next call was to his office in santa barbara gabriella i need you to take the key i gave you and go to my house in my closet theres a corduroy jacket with suede elbow patches load it in my garment bag with the khaki pants a flannel shirt and that goofy indiana jones hat that aaron gave me for christmas put in my blue pinstripe suit shirt shoes and tie to match then grab my briefcase and get it all on the next plane to billings montana buy a seat for it if you have to put it on the corporate card and run the name arnstead houston through all our companies client files go to the insurance institute if you have to its a billings address he waited while gabriella put the name through the computer and came back with the name of houstons homeowners insurance carrier give me the agents number sam scribbled it down call me back at this number as soon as you confirm the arrival time of my stuff in billings he gave her the hunts alone number he dialed the number of houstons insurance agent in billings and spoke in an oklahoma accent yes im interested in insuring some valuable indian artifacts arnie houston recommended you sam waited i didnt figure you handled that sort of thing do you remember who you referred arnie to boulder casualty you got a number for them thanks pardner sam hung up the phone and it rang immediately hello five today thats the earliest thanks gabriella oh i forgot call and reserve a car at the billings airport something with fourwheel drive a blazer or a bronco or something white if they have it ill pick it up at five yes the corporate card fuck aaron tell him im on a hunting trip and gabby you are incredible you really are i know ive never told you that before because it was time i did take care he disconnected and dialed another number waited then spoke with an english accent yes boulder casualty this is samuel smythewhite with sothebys london so sorry to bother you but weve a bit of a problem that you may be able to help us with it seems weve recently acquired some red indian items a bit unusual for us and were at a loss as for someone to authenticate them the owner who must remain anonymous im afraid has suggested that you insure this sort of thing and might know of an appraiser yes ill wait sam held the phone aside and lit a cigarette no no location is not a problem sothebys will fly him to london sam scribbled something jolly good yes thank you he disconnected and dialed arnstead houstons number hello mr houston this is bill lanier im the new head of ethnic studies at the university of washington yes the reason im calling is that i just got a call from boulder casualty it seems that there is an item in your collection that has been severely undervalued and theyd like us to take a look at it to make sure the schedule of coverage is in line of course the new appraisal would increase the price if you should ever want to sell it sam paused and listened he continued a crow medicine bundle yes this ones a cylinder a hollowedout cedar log thats right well sir well need to take a look at it in person we happen to have a tribal expert visiting the campus right now we could be in billings by five thirty tonight no im afraid he has to fly to a dig in arizona tomorrow it will have to be tonight yes i have your address thank you sir sam hung up sat back and let out a long sigh the whole process had taken less than five minutes when he turned around both cindy and coyote were staring at him cindys mouth was hanging open what was that coyote asked you sam said are now working indirectly as an artifacts expert for the boulder casualty insurance company and i am now a professor of anthropology at the university of washington ive been looking for a job cindy said shaking her head they always make me fill out an application coyote looked at cindy he has shifty eyes dont you think arnie houston sat in his den looking at the arrow bundle on the coffee table before him a hollowedout log full of junk but there was nothing quite so exciting as turning junk into money and he was so excited now he could have peed his wranglers god bless archaeology god bless museums god bless historic preservation god bless america where else could a piece of oilfield trash with a fourthgrade education be living in a twentyroom house with a new corvette in the garage wearing thousanddollar seaturtleskin boots and two pounds of silver and turquoise jewelry and all of it from buying and selling indian junk god bless every eggheaded gopherhearted anthropologist that ever wrote a paper or dug a hole damn arnie got up and went over to his bar where he poured himself a snifter of patron tequila thirty bucks a bottle but the finest cactus juice ever burned hair off your tongue and it calms you down cant let them think youre in it for the money the dumb shits most of em could say howdy in thirtyseven dead languages tell you the time a day a shaman shit two hundred years ago plus the ritual that went with it but couldnt tell a nickel from a knothole when it came to money they always went to the tribal council or a medicine man when they wanted to buy something that was their big mistake you got to do your research find out what familys got something and then find the one in the family who drinks the most when hes feeling his firewater you be there with the cash presto you got yourself a priceless indian artifact for dirt cheap arnie had just picked up a whole basket of heirloom beadwork over at the yakima res a hundred bucks the yakima were just getting into crack cocaine and arnie was in on the ground floor with investment capital the beads had been in the families for hundreds of years and hed already had an offer of ten thousand for them from the museum of the west upon authentication of course anthropologists heres to em arnie thought he toasted the fish in the aquarium by the bar and tossed back the patron then took a gamble by looking out the front window a white blazer pulled into the circular driveway and two men got out both of them tall one an indian in a suit and the other in a corduroy jacket and khakis the anthropologist the indian must be the expert he talked about on the phone city indian making a living off of being indian going on about exploitation and such worthless troublemakers wouldnt shoot one if i needed to unload my gun arnie stashed the snifter under the bar and went to the front door he brushed back the sides of his hair with his fingers careful not to disturb the five strands combed over the top and opened the door mr houston im dr lanier from the university of washington this is running elk the gentleman i mentioned on the phone the indian nodded come on in arnie said waving them into the tiled foyer i took it out of the safe and put it on the table for you he didnt really have a safe but it sounded good he led them into the den and stood by the coffee table here she is the indian moved to the fish tank and peered in the professor walked around the table looking at the log as if he were afraid to pick it up have you opened it arnie had to think what was the best answer these fellows liked playing detective finding their own clues no sir the fella i got it from told me what was inside though four arrows an eagle skull and some er damn how do you describe it it was just brown powdery shit and some sacred powder and who did you get it from fellow on the res old family but he didnt want me to say hes afraid of the traditionals getting revenge on him im going to have to open it to determine the value quite so the indian said still looking in the fish tank the anthropologist shot him a nasty look what was up with these two an indian who talks like a brit if that didnt just beat the ugly off an ape its okay with me arnie said looks like them ends just come off like bottle caps thats exactly how they had come off when he opened it jolly good old chap the indian said the fish say that its been opened before thank you running elk said the professor he seemed kinda ticked he set his briefcase on the table next to the bundle snapped open the lid and removed some white cotton gloves we dont want to disturb the integrity of the contents he said slipping on the gloves id prefer to do this in the lab but i assure you ill be careful you can blow the damn thing up for all i care arnie thought as long as the price is right but what was the deal with the indian and the fish tank the professor removed the end of the wooden cylinder and placed it on the table he removed one of the four arrows and studied its length when he looked at the point his face lit up my god running elk do you see what i see what what arnie said was this good or bad the indian looked up from the fish tank oh capital hes promised them one of those plastic bubbling scuba divers if he sells it what arnie said the professor scowled at the indian and held the arrow up for arnie to see mr houston you see this arrow point uhhuh this is a smallgame point and the flaking is not the pattern you find on crow points from the buffalo days so so i think this bundle is from the time before the crows split from the hidatsa if thats the case this bundle may be priceless arnie saw a swimming pool appearing in his backyard with a whole shitpot of girls in bikinis sitting around it rubbing oil on his back how can you be sure ill have to take it back to the university to have it carbondated the professor put the arrow back into the bundle from his briefcase he pulled out a sheaf of forms i hope youll understand mr houston the university cant bond something like this for its full value but i could write a guarantee of perhaps two hundred thousand until the return the professor waited his pen poised over the form arnie pretended to think about it in fact he was thinking about the new swimming pool now it was indoors and had a big hot tub full of dollies i guess that will be all right he said the professor began writing on the form we should have it back to you within the week ill see to it personally that its handled carefully if youll just sign here he pushed the form over to arnie there it was in big black numbers it was all he needed to see arnie signed and pushed the paper back to the professor the professor closed his briefcase and got up well id like to get this back to the lab by tonight and start the work on it ill call you as soon as we know for sure he picked up the bundle and headed for the door you take care now thanks arnie said holding the door for them no thank you mr houston cheerio the indian said as they climbed into the blazer oh yes your mates said theyd like a flipper video and a bit of brine shrimp to eat arnie watched the blazer pulling away boy the old professor was sure giving running elk hell for something eggheads he wondered for a minute why the blazer had mud on the license plates when it was so clean everywhere else hell with it it was time to celebrate a buddy had given him the number of a little dolly who for two hundred dollars would come over in her cheerleader outfit hed been saving it for a special occasion and it looked like it was time to dig out that ol number and see if she really could suck the furniture out of a room through the keyhole as soon as they were out of sight of arnies house sam took the indiana jones hat off and smacked coyote with it what were you thinking you almost blew it the fish said he tricked someone to get that bundle and what did we just do thats different it was a crow bundle you wanted to blow it didnt you why didnt you just hump his couch or something why didnt you just tell him the truth well coyote said if your trick worked it would make a good story ill take that as as compliment sam was no longer angry they had the bundle now it was time to think about the next part of the plan he believed what pokey had told him about the power of the bundle and all pokey had ever asked of him was to be believed he said coyote will you help me get pokey out of the clinic another trick coyote asked of sorts ill help but i wont go to the underworld with you chapter doors some of the color had returned to pokeys face and someone had taken the braids out of his hair and brushed it he opened his eyes when sam entered the room you got it pokey said its in the car sam said coyote came in behind him pokey grinned old man coyote howdy coyote said how many times you died now old man a bunch its plumb wearing me out pokey said the medicine man got tired of singing the death song and went home i think he got scared pokey pulled a cassette out from under his covers and held it up i got it on tape for the next time sam said pokey we have the arrow bundle what do we do now ask him pokey said pointing to coyote i aint going coyote said he has to go alone samson needs a medicine man to sing the bundle song thats why were here sam said you want me i didnt think you believed i had medicine samson things change pokey i need you well then get me out of here pokey started to sit up sam pushed him back i dont think you should be walking samson i done told you i had my death vision i dont die in no hospital i get shot now help me get up he struggled to a sitting position and sam helped him turn so his feet hung off the bed youre right i dont think i can walk sam turned to coyote you promised to help the clinic was officially closed for the day but the skeleton staff of two nurses was still on adeline eats sat in the waiting room with her six children who were all green with flu insisting that she wasnt going anywhere until they got treatment even if she had to wait all night for the twentieth time the nurse at the window was explaining that the doctor had gone home for the night when she heard the hoof beats on the stairs she dropped her clipboard and ran out of the office to see a black horse coming down the stairs an old halfnaked man bouncing on its back she ducked back into her office to avoid being trampled and looked up in time to see a man in a corduroy jacket running behind the horse out the front door the nurse ran out into the waiting room to the front door which dangled in pieces on its hinges she watched the horse stop beside a white blazer and rear up the old man his gray hair streaming in the wind let out a war whoop and fell into the arms of the man in corduroy then as she watched the horse started bubbling and changing until it was a man in black buckskins the nurse stumbled back in shock someone tapped her on the shoulder and she jumped a foot off the ground she came down holding her chest adeline eats said you got room for my kids now or what riding in the blazer pokey said old man coyote how do i send samson to the underworld just open the bundle and sing the song he will go sam said what happens then what do i do my medicine ends when you get there you will see the one that weighs the souls dont be afraid of him just ask him if you can bring the girl back thats it dont worry about the monster the underworld is not what you think coyote rolled down the car window i have something that i want to do ill be there when you return coyote dove out the car window changing instantly into a hawk and flying off into the night sky wait sam said what monster he stopped the car pokey giggled like a child a horse and a hawk in one night samson do you know how lucky we are sam leaned forward and put his head against the wheel lucky wasnt the world that came to mind pokey pokey had called harlan and the boys down from hardin while they prepared the sweat sam stood at the door of the airstream trailer trying to make himself open it for the first time in years he was aware of his childhood fear of the dead and unrevenged ghosts and he hesitated since pokey had given him hope of bringing calliope back he hadnt really thought of her as dead he wanted to see her before he went to the underworld but he was afraid strange he thought after all these years of selling the fear of death talking about it every day now im afraid shes not dead not really he threw the door open and stepped into the trailer calliopes body was lying on the builtin cot by the door amid camping equipment and fishing rods coyote had covered her with a blanket leaving her face exposed she could have been sleeping sam sat on the cot by her and brushed a strand of hair away from her face she was cold he looked away i wanted you to know he didnt know what to say there was no face to put on to meet this face if she would just open her eyes he swallowed hard i wanted you to know that i would do anything for you that all this craziness was will be worth it if i can bring you back ive been hiding out for my whole life and i dont want to live that way anymore anyway i wanted you to know that grubb will be okay my family will take care of him ill be with you one way or another sam leaned over and kissed her soon he said he got up and walked out of the trailer across the yard the fire crackled and licked the sky heating the rocks for the sweat pokey sat on a lawn chair the arrow bundle in his lap his eyes glistening orange in the firelight harlan was carrying rocks from the fire to the pit inside the sweat lodge sam stood by with harry and festus watching after the initial surprise that sam was still alive harry and festus simply fell into their normal roles of listening to their father argue with pokey sam noticed that they had the lean muscular frame of their father the same squareset jaw harlan was a little thinner now and his hair had gone gray but otherwise to sam he seemed the same the boys and me have to go to work in the morning harlan said we cant stay late pokey no drinking i aint going to drink pokey said harlan dropped a hot rock into the pit and wiped sweat from his forehead i cant believe that doctor let you come home just yesterday he was puttin your death on my hands for not moving you to the hospital in billings hes a pissant pokey said hows it coming harlan scraped another rock out of the fire and scooped it up with the pitchfork this ought to do it he unbuckled his pants and began to get undressed the others followed his lead hanging their clothes on pokeys chair sam took the bundle from pokey and put it in the sweat lodge then helped the old man out of his hospital gown pokey crawled into the sweat lodge where the others sat in a semicircle facing him before i drop the door i got to open this here bundle its a real old one so no one knows the right song im going to have to make it up as i go along okay pokey held up the bundle and sang a prayer song thanking the spirits for the gift of the sweat he laid out a square of buckskin for the objects in the medicine bundle i dont know whats going to happen here but harlan you and the boys got to pray that samson has a safe journey hes going on a kind of vision quest but he aint going to the spirit world pokey looked at sam youve seen her since you got here right yes sam said and shes still in the trailer yes who harry asked never mind pokey said they hadnt told harlan and the boys about calliope or coyote here we go he threw a handful of sage onto the stones when the smoke rose he held the bundle in it then took off the cap he began singing as he took each object from the bundle and set it on the buckskin sam closed his eyes and concentrated on going to the underworld and what he had to do there heya heya heya an arrow heya heya heya another arrow heya heya heya another arrow heya heya heya the last arrow heya heya heya an eagle skull heya heya heya some brown stuff some brown stuff harlan said well i dont know what it is pokey said it looks like brown stuff to me whatever it is its working festus said pointing to sam who was shivering even in the heat of the sweat lodge his eyes were open but rolled back in his head showing no pupils im dropping the door pokey said now pray for his return like you never prayed before chapter let slip the dogs of irony the owl was still perched on the power pole adeline eats sat in her easy chair reading the book of job trying to keep her dinner down on the way back from the clinic the kids had elected to have pancakes for dinner and adeline had eaten a mountainous stack and all the mistakes now the matriarchs of breakfast aunt jemima and mrs butterworth were waging a bubbling battle in her stomach while her kids burned with fever and job suffered boils adeline admired job for keeping his faith all she had was a house full of sick kids a husband with a peyote hangover an owl out front and a little difficulty reading small print through her sunglasses and she was ready to pack it in to her reserved spot in hell old job was quite a guy especially with god acting like such a prick what was that about when her sisters talked about the bible it was all the sermon on the mount and the song of solomon proverbs and psalms never smitings and plagues and her sisters had never mentioned that god was a racist he sure hated those old philistines adeline had a cousin in philadelphia she wore a little too much eye shadow but that didnt seem a sin you should get smote and circumcised for adelines religious reverie was interrupted by a tidal surge of acid in her stomach she put the bible down and went to the kitchen for some peptobismol she found the bottle and wrestled with the childguard cap for five minutes before deciding to smite its head off with the cleaver milo used for hacking deer joints she was raising the cleaver when the doorbell rang like a call from the governor she waddled to the door and threw it open an enormously fat white man in a powderblue suit was standing on the steps hat in hand sample case at his side grinning like a possum eating shit he looked vaguely familiar pardon me maam he said i was looking for a mrs adeline eats but i have

sunglasses he couldnt tolerate bright light for a day or two after a peyote ceremony what in the hell is going on out here i was just talking to this salesman adeline said what salesman adeline turned around the salesman his sample case and the garbage bag full of overthecounter icons were gone the brown bottle of miracle medicine sat on the table here honey take some of this she said youll feel better she felt better already sam felt as if he were passing out then the vertigo of falling the sounds around him faded pokeys voice became distant then silent he felt his stomach lurch as if he had just gone into the big drop of a roller coaster then an impact that flattened him on the ground he looked up expecting to see the others around him in the sweat lodge the lodge and everyone in it was gone there was nothing but blackness and the sound of his own breathing a thousand questions raced through his brain but he realized that each one led to another and the best strategy was to maintain a state of automatic action and remember why he was here he stood and squinted into the darkness two golden eyes were floating in front of him he heard the sound of an animal breathing suddenly a stone platform started to glow on it stood a figure a mans body with a dogs head wearing an egyptian kilt except for the golden eyes he was black so black he appeared to absorb light he carried a golden staff tipped with the effigy of a falcon beside him on the platform was the source of the breathing sounds a beast the size of a hippo with the jaws of a crocodile on the body of a lion it snorted and snapped at the air flicking foam from its jaws behind them both stood a giant balance scale despite all he had been through sam felt a wave of mindblanking terror pass through him he wanted to run but couldnt move with the light coming off the pedestal he could see human bones scattered around him he realized that he was standing on his toes every muscle in his body rigid the black dog man snapped his staff on the platform okay up on the scale he said then he narrowed his gaze and stepped down from the platform wait a minute youre alive go away we only do the dead out out out of all the strange things sam had seen in the last week watching the dog mouth forming human speech was the strangest it looked like the creature was trying to yak up a chicken bone suddenly the fear was gone this was too goofy like an alpo commercial filmed in hell are you the one im supposed to talk to about about getting some help look i tried to warn you that my brother was going to cause you problems i sent my agent to help you your brother coyote is my brother he didnt tell you no he never mentioned a brother he said i had to find the one that weighs the souls the dog man scoffed well theres the scale and here i am take a wild guess go ahead einstein figure it out i cant believe he didnt mention me he sat down hung his head and began scratching himself behind the ears hes an ingrate the monster growled and sam jumped back thats ammut the dog man said he wants to eat you sam shuddered maybe later im here to ask a favor you dont even know who i am do you that hurts you think i dont have feelings im sorry sam said im a little preoccupied i didnt mean to be rude preoccupied naked in a supernatural world talking to the dogfood god trying to get back the woman he loved excuse my manners he thought im sam hunter and you are anubis son of osiris god of the underworld he scratched behind his ears harder and his leg began to bounce with pleasure osiris youre egyptian my people lived in the nile valley yes but you said that you were coyotes brother he didnt tell you that story either anubis was irritated no sorry sam said how could calliopes life be in the hands of this neurotic canine he decided to try to placate the god but id love to hear it anubis pricked up his long ears it was long ago he began and the god osiris brought to the people of the nile valley the knowledge to plant grain and he brought great floods to nourish the grains with his queen isis he ruled all of civilization until his brother set the dark one became jealous and killed osiris tearing his body into fourteen pieces and scattering them over the valley but osiris had consorted with sets wife nephthys and she gave birth to two dogheaded sons anubis and aputet when set found the boys he put them into baskets and set them afloat in the nile later isis found anubis and adopted him but aputet floated out to sea and across the ocean to another land in the west here the dogheaded god puffed himself up with pride anubis was always the one bound to duty the faithful he found the pieces of our father and bound them together so that osiris lived again for that he was given the job of weighing human souls against truth and taking people to the underworld and my brother anubis said grew up in a wild land with the powers of a god and no sense of duty or justice all he cares about is the stories people tell about him and he never remembers his brother who has saved him so many times he never visits youre sure coyote never told you this sam didnt know what to say he thought of the coyote tales he had heard as a child and how this seemed to fit no i was told he brought my people the buffalo and taught us how to live off the land he did those things to serve himself without a way to live how could they tell stories about him he has used me for years to make his stories now he has returned to earth and used you it all fit he fucked up my life and got calliope killed for the stories sam was trying to control his anger im here because he wants people to tell stories about him he had to or he would end up like me anubis lowered his voice your people dont have a word in their language for computer or vcr or television the children are losing the old stories the stories of hunting buffalo and counting coup thats not their world coyote was afraid he would be forgotten like me with the new stories hes real again you lived the stories that will bring him back he doesnt care about the people only that they are talking about him i tried i sent my agent to help you sam looked at anubis the big black guy minty you sent him hes mine a dutiful son but he doesnt know it anubis said i can no longer walk in your world because i am a dead god i died of change so i sent the black one to help you he is mine like you are aputets im his what does that mean you were born for his stories to live them to carry them on he wants little kids to hear stories about killing innocent women thats supposed to be good for a people he doesnt care as long as the stories are told they will hold his people together he says people need a good bad example it gives them pride in doing the right thing i have always done the right thing and my people are gone because of it swallowed up by the christian god so how does the story end sam asked can i bring back calliope she didnt do anything wrong i weigh the souls of the dead against truth if there is balance then the soul passes on if not i feed it to ammut the monster snarled at the mention of his name im stuck here doing this tedious work while my brother roams the world having fun its not fair sam kept pressing let me take the girl back its not her fault that coyote is a jerk no anubis said my brother needs to learn a lesson he has never had to sacrifice anything let her live and ill tell your story youll be remembered again people will believe sam had to keep pressing like the other stories the god affected a whiny mocking tone then along came coyotes brother who jumped over him four times and he came back to life i never even get my name mentioned please sam pleaded anubis shook his head slowly no tell my brother he needs to learn to sacrifice for his people i have done what i can do the jackalheaded god stood and walked off the pedestal into the darkness the monster at his heels wait sam started to run after him the pedestal went dark and he felt the loss of his love even as the ground dropped out from under him just before dawn coyote climbed into the sweat lodge and sat beside pokey sams body was shaking his eyes still rolled back in his head wait he screamed he jerked as if someone had applied a current to his body and his eyes rolled down the door flap of the sweat lodge was thrown open and the first light of dawn was spilling through hows my brother coyote asked sam lunged for coyotes throat you killed her for stories pokey caught him from behind in a bear hug no samson pokey struggled to hold sam you were gone all night harlan and his boys left someone named minty fresh called the house for you he said to tell you that some bikers are coming here to take the child he said they would be here about dawn chapter crazy dogs wishing to die the underworld made calliopes death real stripping sam of the last of his hope leaving him like a raw screaming nerve he ran naked out of the sweat lodge and dove into the cooling fire pit samson stop it pokey shouted sam grabbed handfuls of ashes and rubbed them on his face and chest then ran through the yard and into the house coyote and pokey close behind him they found him in the living room pulling the buffalo lance off the wall the women had taken the children and retreated to the bedrooms pokey could hear them crying coyote grabbed sam by the shoulder stop this sam shrieked and swung around with the lance slashing coyote across the chest with the long obsidian point the trickster fell back bleeding sam ran out of the house go get him pokey said to coyote coyote got up and ran out the front door in time to see sam vaulting the fence into the side field sam jumped on the back of a buckskin horse and wrapped a hand in its long mane then dug his heels in and smacked the lance across its hindquarters the horse shot forward and over the fence into the road taking a line of barbed wire out with its front legs sam wait coyote shouted sam pulled the horse up and looked back at the trickster pokey joined coyote on the porch samson dont do this pokey said im tired of being afraid pokey this is a good day to die sam slapped the horses flank with the lance and galloped down the road get the gate coyote shouted to pokey he ran to the field scooping up a handful of mud from some tire tracks as he ran and rubbing it on his face and chest he vaulted the fence and the paint horse spooked by the commotion ran to the other side of the pasture come coyote commanded the paint horse stopped as if it had been jerked back by an invisible rope then turned and galloped back to the trickster coyote calmed it then climbed the fence and jumped on its back pokey swung the gate open and coyote rode the horse through up the driveway and down the road after sam rarely does one encounter a combination of human traits quite so frightening as a psychopath with a purpose yet as dawn broke in crow agency forty examples of that particular perversion cruised in a double column of harleydavidsons off the ramp from highway under the overpass by wileys food and gas and down the main street of town lonnie ray inman rode at the head of the column followed closely by bonner newton on one side and tinker on the other behind them were the other members of the guilds santa barbara chapter and behind them joiners from other guild chapters who pumped with the mere idea of selfrighteous vengeance had volunteered to come along pulling into town they were losing some of their resolve and confused glances passed from one biker to another they knew they were coming to the crow reservation to get a kid who had been stolen but now that they were here what were they supposed to do no one was out on the street at this hour to observe their fierce show of unity and force it was rapidly turing into an unsatisfying experience especially for those who were not used to wearing shoulder holsters and were a little chafed under the arms lonnie slowed the column to a creep as he looked down the side streets of crow agency for signs of the orange z at the edge of town near the tobacco shop he signaled the column to stop it was obvious they were about to head into open ranchland the big bikes thundered out iron flatulence as they idled putting up a din that rattled the windows of crow agency a few lights went on in town a few faces appeared in windows lonnie ray signaled bonner to join him for a conference bonner newton was moving to his side when they heard the war cry lonnie and bonner looked down the road to see two men on horses charging them one waving a spear over his head and screaming bonner was the first to recover from the shock and started to draw his pistol when a shot went off to his left and the speedometer on his bike exploded peppering him with splinters of glass and metal i wouldnt draw that the voice came from the rooftops i wouldnt fucking move bonner looked up to see someone holding a scoped hunting rifle on them the horsemen were still bearing down on them one of the bikers in the column started to draw and a shot came from the other direction taking the light off his bike there was another one on the roof across the street the bikers looked around there were four men with scoped highpowered rifles pointing down on them from different rooftops i can take a flea off a gnats ass at two hundred yards with this harlan shouted over his rifle you let them popguns stay where they are sam screamed again a long rasping wail hes not fucking stopping tinker said he drew his magnum and fired before harlan put a bullet in his shoulder spinning him off his bike to the pavement coyote grabbed his chest and rolled off his horse bouncing into the ditch seeing that sam wasnt going to stop bonner newton dropped his bike and dove into the gutter covering his head lonnie watched the crazed horseman streaked with ashes and sweat bearing down on him sam was only a few yards away raising his lance for the kill when lonnie went for his gun sam yanked on the horses mane jumping it over the front of the bike one hoof hit lonnie in the chest another took off a piece of his right ear before the horse stumbled into the bikers behind him sam rolled free and up to his feet he ran back to where lonnie lay and raised the lance above his head as lonnies eyes went wide and he screamed samson harlan shouted sam put all his weight behind the lance and came down with it screaming at the top of his lungs at the last second he spun the lance and touched lonnie on the chest with the butt end go away he said sam stumbled away and dropped the lance thats it harlan shouted everybody just turn your bikes around and go back the way you came well drop the first one that looks like hes doing the wrong thing the bikers looked around in confusion festus harry and billy two irons kept their rifles shouldered and trained on the column bonner newton climbed to his feet turn around he said waving his hand in the air he looked at lonnie see if tink can ride lets get the fuck out of here sam walked back down the road to where coyote had fallen the trickster was lying naked in the ditch covered with mud his leg bent under him blood was coursing from a hole in his chest and he was breathing in short rattling pants sam bent over him and held his head coyotes eyes slowly opened thats the last coup coyote said you counted the last coup its a new world now the trickster coughed foamy blood covered his lips sam had no anger left no thoughts no words a minute passed he heard someone blowing a car horn somewhere and harlan saying let him through finally sam said what can i do tell the stories coyote said he closed his eyes and stopped breathing sam gently lowered the tricksters head and lay down in the ditch beside him he heard a car pull up on the road above but did not look up a car door footsteps and hands under his body lifting him he opened his eyes to see a battered black face with golden eyes are you okay minty fresh said sam didnt answer he felt himself being put in a car ill take you home minty said sam sat in the limo the car door open staring at the dashboard someone walked up beside him and said nice outfit hunts alone sam looked up to see billy two irons standing over him older and just as thin but unmistakably billy two irons sam managed a weak smile your face cleared up yeah billy said i got laid too only last week but whos counting after thirtyfive years sam looked forward trying to squint back tears billy shuffled a bit with discomfort this guys going to take you home ill stop by when things settle down a little sam nodded it was a good day to die youre always trying to cheer me up billy said dont take off again okay he patted sams shoulder and opened the back door of the limo for minty fresh who laid coyotes body on the backseat then closed the door minty closed sams door then went around and got in on the drivers side he put the key in the ignition and paused without looking at sam he said im sorry your uncle told me about the girl they beat on me pretty bad and i told them where you were going i screwed up im sorry if i could make it up sam didnt look up how did you get away they found my casino id i think the rumors about the mafia running the casinos is what stopped them they were afraid of retribution i called the casino and got your office number your secretary gave me the number here i called as soon as i got away sam didnt say anything minty started the limo and pulled slowly onto the road headed out of town to the hunts alone place sam said what are you going to do with his body i dont know i guess it will come to me like everything else ive done in the last two days sam looked at minty and for the first time saw the golden eyes surrounded with bruises do you know whats happened here do you know what we are minty shook his head what we are no i was a troubleshooter in a casino until yesterday now i guess im a car thief you didnt really have any choice but i think its over now youre free now sure throw that responsibility on me minty said he grinned sam reached deep down and found he had a smile left like the last worm in the bait can they were approaching the hunts alone place minty turned into the driveway and stopped do you need any help no ill be okay sam said automatically not knowing what he needed he opened the car door where will you go like i said i guess it will come to me maybe san diego you can stay here if you want no i dont think so but thanks im feeling like theres still something i have to do when it comes to you remember the sacred number is four you jump over the body four times am i supposed to know what that means you will sam said good luck he got out of the car and stood at the end of the driveway watching minty drive away what now he hadnt died and he didnt have a life to return to nothing empty dead inside he turned and started toward the house cindy and another woman appeared at the door and waited from the shocked look on their faces sam realized how crazed he must look naked covered with soot streaked with sweat and tears he waved to them and headed around the house to wash himself in the barrel back by the sweat lodge as he walked by the airstream he heard the door unlatch and looked up calliope stepped out of the trailer sam she said i had the strangest dream she looked around the yard then at the trailer i didnt just land on the wicked witch of the east did i sam closed his eyes and took her in his arms he held her there for a long time laughing then sobbing then laughing again feeling as if he had at last come home crazy dogs wishing to die one day a long time ago coyote was coming along when he saw a cowboy sitting on his horse rolling a cigarette coyote watched the cowboy take a little pouch of tobacco out of his shirt pocket and then some rolling papers he poured some tobacco into a paper then pulled the strings of the pouch tight with his teeth and put it back in his pocket then he rolled up the paper licked it and stuck the cigarette in his mouth he lit it with a match coyote had smoked a pipe many times but he had never seen anything quite so wonderful as rolling a cigarette i want to do that coyote said let me do that you cant the cowboy said why not you aint got a shirt so you aint got a shirt pocket for your tobacco pouch coyote didnt wear a shirt in those days he looked at his bare chest then at the cowboys shirt i can make a pocket in my chest well why dont you do that the cowboy unfolded his pocketknife and handed it to coyote coyote looked one more time at the cowboys pocket to get the size right then he made a deep cut in his chest he looked a little surprised then he fell over dead the cowboy got back his pocketknife and rode off a little while later coyotes brother came along and saw the trickster lying dead on the ground he jumped over coyotes body four times and coyote sprang up good as new you did it again coyotes brother said i really wanted to roll a cigarette like the cowboy coyotes brother shook his head he said if youre going to live around these white folks coyote you got to learn just because you want something it dont mean that its good for you i knew that coyote said chapter there aint no cure for coyote blue there is a saying that goes back to the buffalo days there are no orphans among the crow even today if someone stays for a time on the reservation he will be adopted by a crow family regardless of his race the idea of a person without family makes the crow uncomfortable so when samuel hunter became once again samson hunts alone he found that there was family waiting for him as well as his new white wife and her son pokey said there aint near enough blond indians if you ask me and even as he left his old name behind with his old life sam maintained his shapeshifter ways putting on each face as it was needed sometimes he was quick and clever and other times he was simple when simple served his purpose when he spoke for the crow to the government he wore traditional tribal dress and an eagle feather in his hair but when he reported to his own people he dug out one of his armani suits and the rolex that had long since stopped running because that is what they needed to see he was given the honor of pouring for the sweat and the responsibility to carry on the old ways and he programmed a computer to speak crow and using it at the age of eighty pokey medicine wing learned to speak his own language and sam put on many faces when he told the stories when he told the old stories of how old man coyote made the world of how he got his power to change shapes of cottontail and raven and the other animal people sam was like the trickster himself grinning and laughing making rude noises his golden eyes shining like fire when he told the new stories of the crow man who had forgotten who he was of a japanese businessman who saved the life of an old shaman of a black man who helped rescue a white child from the enemy of all the tricks and machines that coyote used to bring the crow man home and of the last coup his voice took on a melancholy sweetness and his eyes went wide and bright as if life itself was a delightful surprise and when he told the story of the journey into the underworld of how coyotes brother let calliope live again because the trickster gave his own life sam became grave and dark and those who doubted were quickly convinced when they saw the scar on calliopes back from the bullet that had killed her but even as sam put on these faces and wore these personalities he knew exactly who he was he was happy after a while calliope became pregnant and sams peace was again thrown out of balance he was jumpy and nervous until the day the little girl was born and he saw that she had calliopes deep brown eyes not the golden eyes of a trickster and meanwhile as grubb grew he found that he could frighten his adopted father by hiding and making the sound of a coyote howling and for this he suffered long lectures from his old uncle pokey about respecting his elders when grubb was nine in the time of the new grass sam took him to the great medicine wheel for his first fast during the ride in pokeys ancient pickup truck sam instructed grubb on how to enter the spirit world and prepared him for what to expect there and one last thing sam said as he left the boy on the mountain if a fat guy in a big blue car comes along and offers you a ride dont get in what grubb saw on his vision and what happened when he grew up is a story for another time but it should be noted here that over the years as he grew into manhood his eyes faded gradually from dark brown to a bright shining gold coyote medicine will do them white folks some good pokey said with a grin end
