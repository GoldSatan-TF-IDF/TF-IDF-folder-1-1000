fortress of spears anthony riches prologue rome august ad the first of the young senators bodyguards died slowly choking to death on the cobbles with his sword only half drawn from its scabbard he stared up at his killer with bulging eyes while the assassin turned away from him and drew his gladius facing the younger of the two men with a grim smile he had stepped out of a side alley in a street whose sudden quiet should have been enough of a warning to an experienced man punching a halffist into the veteran soldiers throat before the bodyguard had the time to realise that he was under attack the senator and his remaining protector fell back a few paces both men staring in amazement at their companion as he writhed and kicked in the throes of his death spasm another man stepped from the alleys shadows in the killers wake and leaned against the wall of a shop in the late afternoons warmth his face set in an expression of boredom where the bodyguards murderer was heavyset with arms that rippled with hard muscle the man that accompanied him was tall and thin his voice when he spoke was agreeable and almost soothing in the softness of its tone greeting tiberius sulpicius quirinius forgive me but i cant help thinking that youve made something of a blunder in your choice of protection today hiring retired soldiers is all very well but they do tend to know more about throwing spears at barbarians than the dangers of the streets as your man here is so noisily demonstrating and the savings to be had from hiring a boy to do a mans work are so often outweighed by the resulting costs wouldnt you agree senator quirinius given that you chose to chance a district as rough as the subura with only these two innocents for protection the prostrate bodyguard shuddered in one last desperate effort to breathe through his ruptured throat and then sagged back to lie still on the stones quirinius drew himself up staring at the taller of the two men with an air of confidence that he was a long way from feeling what in hades do you think youre doing who are you to challenge an unarmed senator of rome in the open street the thin man smiled widely spreading his hands in greeting who am i senator im tiberius varius excingus and im one of the emperors corn officers this is my colleague quintus sestius rapax hes a praetorian officer believe it or not but hes never lost the taste for killing even after his richly deserved promotion to centurion as to what were doing well you might be a senator but youre clearly still wet behind the ears or you might have been a little more careful in the last few hours the praetorians eyes were alive with calculation as he stepped in to face the remaining bodyguard he nodded to the boy barely fifteen from the look of it then pointed back with his sword at the uniformed men who were guarding the far end of the street from prying eyes his voice harsh from years of bellowing orders across parade grounds youre staying to fight then eh boy you can still save yourself if you run now my men will let you leave if you drop the sword and walk away he waited watching the conflicting emotions play out on the boys face no the bodyguard shook his head wide eyed and clearly terrified but either unwilling or simply unable to turn and run and the praetorian laughed softly just as well theyd probably have killed you if only for fun or just because youve seen my face and you senator will you not be joining the fight youve got no weapon i suppose only a fool would have walked into a trap like this without a blade of some nature but i suppose its a little too late for you to reflect on that he stamped forward smashing aside the boys raised sword with his own and putting a bunched fist into his face hard enough to break his nose then thrust the blade up into his defenceless victims chest before he could recover from the blow dumping him on his back in a fastspreading puddle of blood the senator looked about him seeking a means of escape but the shops that lined the street were closed and the killers walk towards him was more saunter than stalk the taller of the two men spoke again strolling across the streets cobbles until he was close enough for the senator to see the thin scar that lined the left side of his face the bad news senator is that youre not the only person youve doomed with your loose talk and im afraid that the damage cant be limited to these two poor individuals im told you have a young wife and an infant son and so regrettably our next call will have to be on the pair of them you have sisters too i believe believe me senator when the throne decides to remove a threat it does so in a particularly thorough way to ensure that nobody stays alive who might later seek their revenge quirinius spread his hands his voice wavering in desperation couldnt i pay us off you dont have enough money senator call on our better nature im really not sure whether ive got one but i can assure you that my colleague rapax here most certainly does not he enjoys these little diversions far too much to have any underlying decency no senator the time to be having second thoughts about all this was before you walked into praetorian prefect perenniss office and told him your story regarding the death of his son and exactly who it was that killed him you blurted out that the fugitive marcus valerius aquila was the murderer and is hiding with an auxiliary cohort of tungrians in northern britannia under the name of marcus tribulus corvus far too easily im afraid rapax stepped closer to the young noble smiling easily into the other mans eyes then looked down at the stream of urine puddling around his feet he shook his head his voice a hoarse growl tinged with the barest hint of irritation take a moment to compose yourself boy a man should go to meet his gods with dignity the senator stared helplessly back at the assassins stonehard face his knees shivering with the imminence of his death the praetorian raised his sword and expertly stabbed the point into the conjunction of shoulder and neck watching dispassionately as quirinius slumped slowly to the cobbles the life faded from his eyes blood gushing down his toga and staining the white linen crimson as it poured from the artery rapax had opened excingus shook his head sadly its amazing how many people one man can condemn to death with just a few loose words i hope youve plenty of energy left in you colleague for i fear we have a long evening ahead of us britannia september ad the barbarian scouts shivered in the cold predawn air staring out into the forests black emptiness and waiting for the dawn that would release them from their task of watching the silent trees for any sign of a roman attack the youngest of them yawned loudly stretching his arms out in front of him to dispel the stiffness that was afflicting all three of them before whispering to the small groups leader theres nothing out there nothing for miles the romans are camped out on the plain behind a wall of earth not crawling round the forest like wild pigs its time we were back inside the camp the oldest of the three nodded almost unseen in the darkness keen to be warming his feet and hands at the fire rather than crouching in the shadow of a fallen tree and waiting in the cold for nothing to happen he shook his head stubbornly raising a finger in admonishment to both men weve been trusted to watch this side of the camp to sound the warning if we hear as much as a badger stirring the leaves and thats what well do until the suns over the horizon and eyes are stronger than ears if either of you dont like that you can fuck off back into the camp and discuss it with he started at a sudden sound thinking for a moment that someone was wielding an axe at the palisade a hundred paces to their rear before he realised that the younger of the two men facing him had been punched sideways to the ground with something protruding from his ear the stink of blood was suddenly heavy in the air the older warrior slumped away from the log a split second later with an agonised bubbling grunt his eyes rolled upwards as the arrow buried deep in his chest took his life their leader ripped the hunting horn from his belt grabbing a deep breath and putting it to his lips only to shudder with the bonecrunching impact of an arrow into his own ribs the horn fell from his nerveless fingers to the fallen leaves with a soft thud and he stared stupidly for a moment at the short length of its feathered wooden shaft jutting from his chest feeling his blood spraying from the terrible wound chopped deep into his body by its irontipped head his vision narrowing he sank slowly to his knees caught for a moment between life and death as a noiseless figure ghosted across the forest floor towards him without any sound that the dying barbarian could make out the shadowy figure was abruptly beside him a tall lean man dressed in a grey cloak and with a roman gladius gleaming palely in his right hand his face painted with stripes of dark mud beneath a crosscrested helmet to match the forests dappled moonlit floor he grabbed at the tottering warriors hair to steady him and lifted his sword to strike angling the blade for the killing thrust he looked into the dying mans eyes for a moment then ran the gladiuss razorsharp blade through the helpless tribesmans throat and eased him down to lie glassy eyed in the leaves putting a hand inside the tunic beneath his mail armour he touched a pendant hanging around his neck and muttered a quiet prayer unconquered almighty mithras grant you safe passage to your god he dropped into the fallen trees shelter staring intently at the palisade for any sign that the scouts deaths had not gone unnoticed by the warband camped behind its protective wall his brown eyes were pools of darkness in the night as he stared fiercely into the gloom his fingers white with their grip on the swords hilt after a long moment of complete silence other than for the rustle of leaves in the nights gentle breeze he turned and whistled softly a dozen men rose from the cover of the undergrowth fifty paces from the camps palisade and crossed the space between the forest edge and the fallen tree with swift caution weaving noiselessly around the stumps of trees felled to build the camps wall they dropped into the fallen trees cover and were instantly still each one of them aware that any unexpected sound might waken the barbarians sleeping beyond the palisade half of the small group were at first glance declared enemies of the other half dozen their shaggy hair and long swords in stark contrast to the soldiers closecropped heads and short infantry blades after a moment one of the barbarians bent close to the cloaked swordsman speaking softly into his ear i told you this was the place two knives they wouldnt have put men to watch the forest here without a quick route to safety back through their wall the roman nodded whispering his reply and since qadir put the watchers down silently we still have the advantage of surprise behind the barbarian one of the soldiers his helmet crested front to back to denote his status as a chosen man and the centurions deputy nodded recognition of his officers quiet compliment he finished slinging his bow across his muscular shoulders and pulled his gladius from its sheath while the centurion pointed to the wooden wall looming over the stumpstudded clearing and the palisade breach is to the left of the hidden doorway the barbarian nodded confidently yes as we discussed a twenty pace section of the wall from the hidden opening is ready to fall if the retaining bars are removed and now with your permission he drew a long hunting knife from his belt and reversed its grip so that the silver line of its blade was concealed behind his arm the roman officer nodded decisively quickly and quietly now martos therell be plenty of noise soon enough dont worry centurion corvus for the chance to twist my knife in calguss guts i would go silent for the rest of my days the barbarian turned to his men as the shaggyhaired warriors clustered around him there were three of them one young one old and one about my age you and you youre the closest we have to them with me and quietly any man that makes a noise will have me to reckon with the three men slipped away quickly merging with the looming bulk of the timber palisade that had been thrown up around the barbarian camp calgus king of the selgovae people and selfstyled lord of the northern tribes knew the argument if it could be deemed worthy of the name was getting away from him too quickly for there to be any chance of his regaining control of the situation for a fleeting moment he considered taking his sword to the venicone chieftain who was so blatantly defying him in his own camp but the halfdozen hardfaced killers arrayed behind the man and the heavy war hammer carried over his shoulder killed the thought before it had time to muster any conviction he might have been standing inside his own tent in the middle of thousands of his own people but these flinteyed maniacs would tear through his bodyguard and kill him before any of his men were sufficiently awake to react drust shook his head vehemently flicking his hand in a violently dismissive gesture this war of yours is doomed to fail calgus doomed by your own hand and the venicone tribe will not stand alongside you while the invaders grind us all into these hills he flicked the hand again the gesture inches from calguss face our part in this war is done we will fall back to our own lands and wait for the romans to decide whether were worth the trouble of pursuit he turned to walk away and calgus reached out to take his arm i had thought the venicone under king drust had the venicone leader spun back at the touch of calguss hand on the sleeve of his rough woollen tunic his braided red hair whipping about his face with the speed of his reaction his men froze as he lifted a hand to still their instant response their eyes burning with the urge to fight and he leaned in close to his former ally speaking softly despite his anger you thought there was more to us perhaps you wonder that i can walk away from a war not yet finished there was a time not long distant when i would have agreed with you i considered you a comrade calgus a man i could stand alongside in the fight to evict the romans from our soil but hear me now when i warn you one last time the next time you lay a finger on me i will let these animals behind me loose on your bodyguard just to see who comes off best and you and i will discover which of us is doomed to die at the others hand you thought me stupid eh calgus you thought i would never hear the rumours of your betrayal of our votadini brothers after they had triumphed in battle for you and that you did this because their king disputed your plans one time too many perhaps even simply because you could my men were a cunthair from victory in their fight with the romans at the ford with more than a thousand heads for the taking until martos of the votadini a man deliberately betrayed and left for the romans to slaughter by you led his warriors into battle against mine at the crucial moment and turned our victory into bloody defeat in a hundred heartbeats apparently even the romans know better than you how to treat an ally and while ill have no truck with them neither will i risk your friendship for an hour longer you have poisoned our own people against us you fool and you will pay for that mistake with your own blood and that of your tribe sneering disdainfully he turned away and ducked through the tents doorway leaving calgus staring after him a soft voice spoke from behind him although there was iron in the words you must stop him my lord if he takes his men north we will not have enough strength to defend this place against two legions should the romans attack calgus spun back to face the speaker glaring with frustration into his seamed face before nodding at the old man resignedly his adviser was a man of unerring instincts even if some of his advice had resulted in more difficulty than had at first seemed apparent and what do you propose aed that i should beg our comrade to stay ill not make a fool of myself to no purpose the old man smiled gently spreading his hands out no my lord i fully agree your authority must be maintained at all costs i was simply about to suggest that you might have something to offer drust in return for his continued support calgus frowned what can i possibly offer the venicone that would persuade them to stay and fight something my lord which since you have possessed it for less than a month you will never truly miss something which you can always take back later once the brigantes south of the wall are freed from under the roman boot and swell your army to an irresistible size calgus nodded slowly as the realisation of aeds meaning took effect yes he hurried from the tent in the wake of the venicone chieftain there was a long moment of silence before one of martoss men reappeared from the gloom gesturing the remainder of the raiding party forward marcus led his men across the ground between the fallen tree and the wooden wall in a crouching run finding the gap in the palisade just as martos had described it to the legions senior officers the previous day the two ends of the wooden wall were overlapped making the thin gap between them almost invisible give me ten frontrankers and i could defend that little gap against a fucking legion marcus looked over his shoulder to find one of his men standing close behind him the stark white line that marked his face from the point of his right eyebrow to his jawbone was still visible beneath the mud daubed across his features while the soldier was hardly one of his more stealthy men he had point blank refused to allow his centurion to accompany martoss warriors to the enemy walls without his being one of the soldiers alongside him marcus pulled off his helmet handing it to the other man here scarface make yourself useful and take this im going in to find martos get your ropes in place and be ready to guide the cohort in if i sound the call the soldier shook his head with resigned disgust if youre going into that nest of bluenoses with them he tipped his helmeted head to indicate the votadini tribesman then youd best be looking like one of them he fished a small bundle out from beneath his mail handing it to marcus who opened it to find a mass of hair spilling out into his hands he stared down at the object with fascinated disgust this is its clean i washed the skin in the river only a few days ago put it on marcuss skin crawled as he pulled another mans scalp over his head allowing the long black hair to settle over his shoulders scarface squinted at him in the darkness your own mother wouldnt recognise you try to bring it back theres a soldier in the sixth century offered me ten denarii for it squeezing between the gap in the palisade with his gladius drawn marcus found the barbarians busy dragging the last of the guards into the fourfootdeep ditch that ran around the camp behind the palisade martos turned to him with a grin shaking his head at the sight of a roman officer with another mans hair draped across his head it suits you perhaps you should have been born north of the frontier marcus slid his gladius back into its scabbard and covered the swords goldandsilver eagleshead pommel with his cloak the palisade is as you expected the barbarian nodded yes i told you there were preprepared exits on all four sides of the camp and i remembered the location of this one perfectly twenty paces of the wall with the logs chopped almost clean away at their bases the whole section braced into one solid section and then locked in place with wooden beams to stop it falling over if some idiot leans against it weve taken down the bracing beams that hold the whole thing to the wall on either side so all your men have to do is give their ropes a solid pull and the whole section will fall and make a nice handy ramp into the camp and now if youre ready for calgus marcus nodded looking about him at the sleeping barbarian camp in the predawn gloom the tribes tents receded into the darkness the occasional fire kept burning to provide a quick source of flame there will be men awake even at this time martos nodded yes its certain they know that the legions are camped on the plain close by and that they may attack at any time perhaps even today some men will sleep like dogs others will lie awake for fear of the morning but we will walk with confidence to calguss tent and the men that are awake will see what they expect to see their own people going about their leaders orders come the halfdozen barbarians gathered around the roman officer following martoss lead as he strode confidently into the heart of the slumbering enemy camp they walked for a minute or so angling to the left and climbing the slope away from the safety of the palisade until martos raised a hand to halt them he looked around him and then ducked into the cover of a large tent gathering his men to him with a gesture and whispering so quietly as to be almost inaudible this is calguss tent there will be guards at the entrance so once were inside i want silence until we have everyone inside either dead or gagged and calgus is mine he looked around the group to ensure that he was perfectly understood then dug the point of his knifes blade into the tents side and drew it swiftly downwards opening a long slit in the rough canvas wall marcus stepped in through the hole first with his gladius drawn finding the tents spacious interior dimly lit by a pair of oil lamps the sole occupant a stooped figure stood with his back to him and he bounded forward with two quick paces to wrap his arm around the mans mouth and jaw muffling any cry for help with the fabric of his cloak and the armour that clad his sleeve beneath the rough wool guard the door and keep that slit held tight the two warriors moved quickly at martoss whispered command temporarily securing the tent against chance discovery and their chieftain stalked around the captive until he came into the old mans field of view marcus felt him shrink away from the votadini princes harsh stare and tightened his grip against any attempt to raise the alarm but felt only capitulation in the way the old man held tightly against him pressed back in a futile effort to escape the nightmare unfolding in front of him martos lifted his knife to the old mans face tapping a sunken cheek with the point aed not what id hoped for but a fair start i came seeking your master but instead i have the sour shrunken old fuck that drips his poison into calguss mind doubtless it was your idea that my warband be abandoned in the path of the roman cavalry after the fight for white strength led into their path to be chopped to pieces in revenge for the massacre of their cohort and why to get me out of the way so that calgus would be free to murder my uncle and take control of our kingdom he put the knifes point under the old mans chin digging the sharp iron up into the sagging flesh until a thin runnel of blood ran down aeds neck and into the folds of his robe and now thanks to you i am a prince without his people my family are either dead or suffering so badly that i could wish them dead so lets not bother with any of the usual denials because if you dont answer me quick and straight ill slice you open and pull your guts out for you to carry around for a while calgus where is he drust laughed in calguss face for a second time his eyes bright with amusement you offer me the votadinis land calgus you might as well offer me the moon for all the cost to you and for all the chance that i might be able to keep the ground you offer even if i were minded to accept if i wanted the votadinis land i would have taken it long since you fool he turned back to his men pointing to the northern face of the camps protective palisade we need to be away from here before full dawn you take a message up the hill the fence is to be opened and our people ready to run north turning back to face calgus he put both hands on his hips the votadini are nothing more than the romans lapdogs calgus their royal women drip with jewellery made in the south and their men wear swords with keener edges than would be the case if they were locally forged if we occupy the dinpaladyr well have less than a month before a legion marches up batters down the fortress of the spears walls with their catapults and puts us all to the sword the romans like their trade with the votadini and through them with the rest of you fools and they wont be abandoning that easy money without a fight so no calgus you took the votadinis land and now you can defend it or else run and hide when they kick down your gate and come looking for their revenge on you i can run now away to the safety of my own land behind their old north wall and they will leave me well alone if they know whats good for them they might even pay me tribute to keep me behind my walls and out of the fight but you calgus you have ruined their forts and slaughtered their soldiers you could run to the ends of the world and they would still never stop hunting you so if i were you id his eyes suddenly narrowed at the sound of shouting from over calguss shoulder another voice joined the first and a sudden scream of agony rent the air drust turned and roared at the men gathered about him get that fucking fence open its time to leave the first selgovae warrior through the tent door died silently his throat torn open by a hunting knife wielded by the votadini hed knocked aside in his haste to enter the tent he staggered three paces into the tents halflight with his lifeblood pumping down his chest and his bowels noisily emptying into his rough woollen trousers before he pitched full length to the pale turf lord calgus there are romans in the the second man was still only halfway through the flap doof shouting wildly that the alarm was raised when the first warriors killer backhanded the short blade into his belly and ripped it out through his side spilling the slippery rope of his guts and wrenching a grunted scream of pain from his contorted mouth as he fell to his knees martos shrugged into the old mans white face time to leave release him marcus aed barely had time to register the sudden cool air on his face as the roman stepped back lifting his arm away and pushing him on to martoss knife before a sudden burning pain ripped into his body looking down in horror he saw the weapons blade protruding from his belly in martoss expert hand staggering in sudden shock as the votadini prince pulled the weapon down into his lower abdomen before twisting it savagely and pulling it free wiping the bloody iron on his robe a rush of warm blood gushed from the wound filling the air with its metallic stink underlaid by the smell of excrement and the old man dropped to his knees and bent double with the excruciating agony of his wound die hard aed hard and slowly he gestured to the hole in the tents rear stooping to pick up a small wooden box that rested at the foot of calguss bedroll and lifting the lid to peer inside then angled the casket to show marcus the contents i should have known nothing but paper i suppose calguss private letters might be of some value if only to give your tribune something to read once the fightings over he tossed the chest to one of his men and the small group stepped out into the dawns pale light through the rent in the tents back wall marcus quickly taking stock of their situation in the sure knowledge that if the presence of a roman officer in the enemys camp became known they would be beset from all sides in seconds all about them warriors were crawling from their tents and reaching for their weapons not yet aware of the interlopers in their midst but only seconds from making that discovery theres no time for slow and quiet now follow me he drew his gladius and set off at a dead run down the path between the tents sprinting towards the palisade where his men were waiting martos and his warriors close on his heels the crude wig that had masked the romans features fell away and revealed his short cropped black hair and a tribesman blinking away sleep in his path gaped in amazement throwing his head back to shout a warning as marcuss gladius ripped open his throat before one of martoss warriors shouldercharged him into the side of another tent without breaking stride a chorus of shouts was following them now alerting the men in front of them even if the cause of the uproar was still unclear blearyeyed tribesmen turned to crane their necks instinctively reaching for weapons as they sought the source of the commotion martos drew level with the centurion straining every sinew in his magnificent physique as he pounded along beside the man who had been his enemy only days before a straggling group of selgovae warriors was gathering across their path hefting their weapons in readiness for a fight as the intruders charged towards them marcus tossed the gladius into his left hand and drew his spatha on the run flashing the long blade out and bellowing a rising scream of defiance as he ploughed into their midst flicking aside a spearthrust with the long cavalry sword and ducking under a swinging blade before upending the swords owner with his leg hacked off at the knee spinning away to his left in a double flicker of razoredged iron martos matched the ferocity of his attack hacking his way into the selgovae with a fury that scattered the warriors his men crowding in around him to protect their prince at any cost a tribesman hacked down two handed at marcus with a heavy sword the blade sliding down his angled spatha as marcus pivoted around his right arm reversing his lefthanded grip on the gladiuss eaglehead pommel and backhanding the short blade through the swordsmans ribs before spinning again tearing the blade free and cutting low felling another warrior both his hamstrings severed by the spathas harsh bite two more warriors ran in to the fight and marcus turned to confront them starting as a spear hissed past his head and punched the closer of the pair back with his eyes rolling back to show only the whites the other man swung his sword up to attack only to stagger as an arrow flicked through the throng of votadini and embedded itself in his throat a strong grip on the neck of his mail armour pulled the young centurion away from the fight the four surviving barbarians and marcuss own men forming a thin line against the gathering mass of enraged selgovae warriors qadir and his two fellow hamians were nocking and loosing arrows with a speed and accuracy that were for the moment felling as many tribesmen as were joining the uncertain warriors facing off the outnumbered romans scarface grinned apologetically as his officer spun to face him backing off a step at the look on marcuss face no time for that centurion the fence is coming down with a creaking screaming tear of rending wood the twentyfootwide section of the palisade that martos had identified to him on their way in fell away from the rest of the wall as the dust of its falling settled marcus saw the men who had dragged it down drop their ropes and take up their weapons forming an unbroken line of shields in seconds a lean centurion limped out in front of them pointing with his sword and bellowing an order in a voice that carried far across the barbarian camp tungrians advance calgus stared across the camp with mounting consternation hearing the bray of trumpets that he knew must presage an attack by the legions with a sudden flicker of fire in the purple dawn sky half a dozen blazing fire pots arced high over the camps southern wall landing in gouts of flame as they shattered to release their burning liquid contents and set instant flame to both men and tents behind him drust smiled knowingly unsurprised at this turn in events the romans are inside your walls calgus your game is finished he nodded to the largest of his bodyguards tapping the back of his head the man took two steps forward before punching calgus behind the ear with as much force as he could muster his massive fist hammering the unwitting tribal leader to the ground twitching and barely conscious nicely done maon now tie his arms and legs and gag him he may prove a useful bargaining counter to have behind our walls should the romans come knocking he turned away from the scene of chaos lets be away now before the legions close the gap in the northern fence and pin us against their shields the warriors around him turned at his command and climbed the gentle slope towards the camps northern fence its line of tree trunks now marred by a gap to match that ripped open by the romans down the slope to the east drust looked about him and found the scurrying figure of his body servant running for the kings tent clearly intent on salvaging the most precious of his masters possessions he smiled quietly to himself at the mans evident urgency very wise little man id have the skin off your balls were it any other way he turned away confident that his servant would be out of the camp with the warbands rearguard and ran for the gap in the palisade intent on making sure that no attempt to close the gap in the fence could be made before his men were all through it and into the safety of the forest behind him in the kings tent and unseen by the hundreds of men streaming past up the camps slope the slave dropped to his knees and started to frantically cram his masters most treasured possessions into a goatskin bag he was reaching for the most important item of all when a ballista bolt fired blindly over the camps palisade by the legion artillery supporting the attack punched through the tents canvas wall and spent its lethal power in his body spearing through his heart and covering the far wall with a spray of crimson arterial blood his eyesight dimming the dying servant reached out a hand to grasp the shining gold ring then froze into immobility his last conscious memory the agonising iron cold of the missile which had transfixed him marcus and his men stepped clear of the tungrian advance and the cohorts leading century strode past them and into the enemys stronghold soldiers running hard for both ends of the centurys line to lengthen the shield wall against a barbarian counterattack as quickly as possible the cohorts nd century followed them in and veered to the left their centurion shooting marcus a quick grin as he ran past bellowing orders at his men the rd century breaking to their right as the cohorts line grew in strength their spears flickered out to kill those tribesmen who had failed to retreat in the face of their remorseless advance more centuries poured through the palisade breach and fanned out on both sides to further strengthen their foothold in the enemy camp and marcus saluted the cohorts first spear clasping hands with him as the other man jumped from the palisades wooden slope to the ground i dont think ive ever been quite so pleased to see your face sir his superior officer smiled grimly motioning for them to step aside as another century stamped up the fallen palisades wooden ramp and hurried off into the fight marcuss friend and brother officer rufius winked at him as he pointed up the slope with his vine stick shouting the command for the th century to form line in a bellow made hoarse by the twentyfive years of legion service he had completed before joining the tungrians first spear frontiniuss chin jutted between the cheek pieces of his helmet as he stared out into the barbarian camp watching as the sea of barbarian tents took fire from the flame pots being hurled over the palisade by the legions artillery the blazes flickering light illuminating the enemy warriors as they crowded forward to join battle with their attackers a job well done centurion corvus now we finish these bluefaced bastards once and for good your boys will be along in a moment take them to the left push up the hill and link up with the left flank of the century that went up in front of you in the meanwhile our axemen will make this gap in the fence big enough that even the sixth legions road menders will feel safe to join us ah heres your century now he pointed back into the empty space between forest and palisade and marcus followed his outstretched arm to find his th century marching into view their oneeyed watch officer striding alongside them with qadirs brassknobbed chosen mans pole in his hand while morban marcuss veteran standardbearer was at their head marcus saluted the first spear then trotted out to meet his men returning the watch officers salute and barking his orders to the men around him as qadir retrieved his pole and dropped back to his usual place at the centurys rear well done cyclops to your places gentlemen were turning left and advancing up the inner wall until we make contact with the century to our right then we take our place to their left and keep advancing alongside them he trotted over to the head of the century returning the standardbearers salute and shouting over the crash of hobnails and the jingle of equipment as they mounted the fallen palisades wooden ramp morban take them left up the hill the standardbearer shot him a quick nod then bellowed over his shoulder at the lanky trumpeter marching behind him blow the trumpets harsh note snapped the centurys heads up and morban canted the standard to the left marcus stepped out in front of the marching century turning to face the troops and raising his gladius high and pointing to their left follow me he jumped down from the wooden ramp watching the marching soldiers as morban led them over the onefoot drop and up the slope to their left satisfied that they had made the turn successfully he turned gulped a lungful of air and ran hard up the slope past the leading ranks of the centurys column and on up the hill he ignored the fact that cyclops had broken ranks to run alongside him as he searched through the billowing smoke for the century that had preceded them knowing that nothing he could say would reduce the mans protective instincts towards his officer toiling through the reek drifting slowly across the chaotic battlefield he suddenly ran into clear air and stopped aghast at the scene unfolding in front of him the century that had advanced up the hill only moments before him was being overrun by hundreds of barbarian warriors the soldiers fighting a desperate but doomed defensive action as their enraged enemy hammered against their faltering shield wall one man after another going down into the trampled mud to be finished off with swords and spears by the rampaging horde as he watched the other centurys centurion anonymous in the drifting smoke stepped into the front line with a bellow of defiance and started fighting for his centurys survival without his even being aware of it a growl of anger rippled in his throat as he watched his brother officer fighting for his life and he put a hand on the hilt of his spatha no marcus turned to find his watch officers one good eye fierce with determination no use in your throwing yourself away take the lads in there and pull those poor bastards out of the fire those thats left he nodded slowly turning away from the scene of his comrades massacre when he spoke his voice was harsh with fresh purpose get back to your men cyclops he ran back down the slope through the smoke his mind working quickly almost falling over morban in the murk twenty paces more and then put them into line to the right facing up the hill no horns the standardbearer nodded at him and stamped away up the hill while marcus pulled a soldier out of the marching ranks and barked a command in the mans ear run back down the hill to the first spear tell him theres a century being torn to pieces up here and we need urgent reinforcement now go he pushed the soldier hard sending him away down the slope then turned back to the marching column morban barely visible through the smoke had the standard held horizontally over his head with its metal hand pointing to his right scarface make sure they make the turn the veteran soldier snapped a salute and ran to march at morbans shoulder ready to stand firm once the standardbearer made the rightangled turn to put the th in line facing the enemy rather than risk encountering them in the vulnerable column of march the line abruptly turned right the soldiers following their standard without much of a clue as to what was happening and just as well marcus mused given what they would be facing in less than a minute he stepped in alongside his deputy pointing past the marching soldiers and up the smokewreathed slope qadir there are hundreds of barbarians less than a hundred paces that way and theyve already torn up one century when we march out of this damned smoke theyll throw themselves on to us like dogs on raw meat so give me your pole and get your bow ready you and your mates anyone that looks like they might be important anyone with a lot of gold or thats shouting the odds a bit too loudly put them down the big hamian handed over his sixfoot brassknobbed pole unslinging the bow from across his shoulders and barking a command in aramaic to the dozen or so other hamians marching in the th centurys ranks marcus shot a glance back down the centurys line waiting a few seconds to allow the last of the marching soldiers to make the turn then drew breath to bellow his orders ninth century halt the column stamped to a halt troops coughing and spluttering as they breathed in the thickening smoke from the rapidly spreading fires to the left face form lines of battle he waited while the soldiers straightened their lines the frontrankers raising their shields and hefting their spears the rearrankers crowding close to the men in front of them ready to grip their belts and hold them steady once the fighting started ninth century marcuss voice rang out over the short double line the din of battle from their right muffled by the smoke and the distant roar of blazing canvas when we march forward we will soon come upon the remains of one of our sister centuries they were surprised in the line of march and never stood any chance of resisting the barbarians you however are ready to fight armed and armoured drilled and trained to perfection any one of you is worth a dozen of those bluenosed bastards so we will go forward we will find the men that killed our brothers and we will kill as many of them as possible before our reinforcement arrives at the walk advance the century started forward as one man and while marcus had qadirs pole ready to push between the shoulders of any man hanging back he quickly realised that he wasnt going to need it ten twenty paces they advanced without any sign of an end to the dirty grey smoke what was making eyes water and lungs strain for breath and then in the blink of an eye they were back out in the crisp dawn air with the scene of the other centurys massacre laid out before them the slope was littered with corpses clad in the same equipment his men were wearing their mail armour a dull iron grey against the barbarian camps trampled mud a few of the fallen soldiers were still moving their wounds severe enough to leave them helpless but not enough to have killed them immediately half a dozen barbarians were moving among them their swords black with the blood they had spilled and as marcus watched the nearest of them raised his blade in readiness to dispatch another of the wounded qadir snapped his bow up and with a sonorous note from the bowstring put an arrow into his neck dropping him choking and kicking to the ground beside his intended victim a couple of the barbarians closest to the dying warrior looked up at the sudden commotion gaping in surprise at the th centurys unexpected appearance from out of the smoke even as the other hamians shot them down with a swift precision that rivalled qadirs forcing himself to ignore the dead and dying tungrians scattered across the ground before him marcus pushed through the centurys battle line and looked around him for some sign of the barbarians who had massacred his fellow soldiers only minutes before the smoke eddied with the gentle morning breeze again affording him a momentary glimpse of the fight taking place down the slope to their right the tungrian line was now fully embattled struggling to hold back easily three times their own strength of enemy warriors who were throwing themselves at the shield wall with the desperate fury of men who knew that if they failed to break through the soldiers they were as good as dead before the curtain of smoke closed again he realised with a sickening jolt exactly what it was that the barbarians had impaled on their spearheads and were waving up and down in front of the tungrian soldiers he turned back to his men with his eyes blazing and the muscles around his jaw rippling as he fought to hold his temper ninth century right wheel he held his breath for a long moment while the century swung ponderously through their quarterturn to face down the slope the hamians were all at sea with the manoeuvre still new to the disciplines of infantry fighting after choosing to join the century less than a week before but the men around each of them gently pulled and pushed them through the lines reorientation with more than one kind word or pat on the shoulder for men who had been derided as nothing more than a burden on the cohort only days before marcus smiled to himself despite his anger acknowledging their justified change of status the battle at the red rivers ford had seen to that in one desperate bloody afternoon of seemingly doomed resistance to the venicone tribes assault within a minute the line was aligned with the direction in which a swelling roar of battle was reaching them through the smoke the soldiers looking anxiously down their ranks at him as he pulled both swords from their places on his belt his face grim with purpose morban now no longer the pivot for their swing to the right scuttled down the lines rear to his place immediately behind their attack the trumpeter running behind him marcus raised his voice again steeling himself for the attack ninth century your enemy are down there hidden in the smoke a few of the soldiers he realised were translating his words for those men around them with insufficient latin to keep up with his angry words when i give the command we will march down this slope until we have them in sight they will be close ninth century close enough for you to smell the shit that will stream down their legs when they see us come out of nowhere at their backs a few men laughed the delight of imminent combat evident in their wide eyes and flared nostrils the rest of them were for the most part stone faced working hard to hold their nerve with battle only seconds away marcus nodded to the trumpeter who blew the advance strong and clear ninth century advance as the two lines of soldiers stepped off down the hill scarface thrust one of his spears at the man behind him you pass this forward to me when ive put the first one through some fuckers back and make sure youre ready with it as soon as ive thrown this one or therell be a short and very interesting discussion once weve sorted these longhaired cunts out the men around him smiled despite themselves as amused as they always were by his blend of bombast and singleminded purpose without taking his eyes off the ground in front of him the veteran soldier hawked noisily and spat into the grass the rest of you stop your grinning and get your fucking spears ready to throw thirty paces down the slope the century got their first glimpse of the enemy through a momentary gap in the smoke the mass of tribesmen were pressing harder on the tungrian line than before clearly wearing the embattled soldiers down by the sheer weight of their numbers and the cohorts grip on its foothold inside the barbarian camp had visibly reduced in size since marcuss last quick look another ten paces saw the century within a spearsthrow of the raging tribesmen and yet still undetected marcus lifted his sword and then dropped the blade whatever the trumpeter might have been feeling his lungs seemed unaffected a loud note from his horn pealing out over the battlefield and snatching the attention of the enemy warriors the th centurys front rank roared their defiance shaking their spears at the surprised barbarians and marcus raised his sword again spears the men in the front rank leaned backwards their left arms reaching forward for balance as they pulled their spears back until the iron heads were level with their helmets scarface turned his face and kissed the cold iron feeling the blades ragged edge on his lower lip then locked his gaze on a warrior twenty paces distant in the barbarian warbands rear throw the front rank took a collective two steps forward exhaling noisily as they hurled their weapons into the enemy warriors spears throw reaching back to take their second spears from the men behind them the soldiers hurled themselves forward again and launched a second volley into the barbarian rear dozens of the enemy were now out of the fight some toppled to the ground others on their knees or held upright by the crush of their numbers form line the century was back in line within seconds staring down at their enemy as a wave of confusion spread through the barbarians swords the front rank unsheathed their short swords a sudden pale gleam in the dawn light marcus pointed his sword at the enemy warriors raising his voice to a roar attack scarface pointed his sword at the barbarian hed decided to kill first screaming his challenge come on you fuckers he bounded down the hill the men to either side of him howling their own battle cries as they made their own charges punching his shield into the barbarians face and stabbing his gladius into his guts before the other man had the chance to recover from the blow driven by their recent experience of battle with the tribes and knowing what would inevitably come next the front rank pulled their shields together to form a defensive wall while the rearrankers stepped in close and caught hold of their belts steadying them against the assault to come with a roar of anger the barbarian warband slammed back against their defence hammering at their shields and helmeted heads with swords and spears as they recovered from their shock and threw themselves at the new threat tribune licinius spurred his horse forward up the line of the th legions column to meet the scout riders racing towards him from the barbarian camps northern face his cavalry wing was strung out over the hundreds of paces behind him still making their way through the forest that surrounded the camp along a tortuous hunters path that had been scouted as an approach route in the days that had followed the neardisaster at the red river sending half a legion down the path first had been a necessary measure given the need for the heavy infantry to break into the camp and defeat the warband before the cavalry could follow up and chase down any survivors but their lack of urgency in the approach march had tested his patience beyond its limits the lead rider reined in his sweating horse alongside the tribunes magnificent grey his voice urgent as he saluted his superior and launched into a description of what was happening at the head of the column the northern palisade has been breached from the inside tribune and theres a warband running north in tribal strength we saw their rearguard heading off into the forest at least a thousand men strong and they looked like venicones licinius nodded thinking quickly those tattooed buggers must have decided to quit calguss war even before the attack on the camp became evident to them what about the legion the decurion shook his head dismissively too slow and too late id say tribune the leading cohorts are just wasting time forming up on the open ground between forest and palisade with no sign that they intend getting stuck in any time soon liciniuss temper boiled over with me he spurred the grey down the line of troops followed by his bodyguard seeking out the group of men that represented the point of the th legions spear tribune laenas might i ask exactly what the fuck you think youre doing the legions secondincommand a tribune whose tunic bore the broad purple stripe of the roman senatorial class and a man unused to having his judgement questioned turned away from a frustratedlooking group of the cohorts senior centurions with a look of incredulity opening his mouth to snarl a response that died in his throat when he saw who was doing the questioning ah tribune licinius were ah just making sure that weve got everything in place before licinius rode over his halfhearted explanation with a patrician disregard for manners leaning in close and speaking in quiet but fierce tones what it looks like tribune laenas is that youre dithering in the face of a fight these gentlemen around you know that the time to strike was while the barbarians were still escaping into the forest since even my old ears can clearly make out the sound of battle from inside that palisade i suggest that you get your cohorts through the gap those bluenosed blighters have torn in the fence and get them into action if that is you dont want to be dismissed and censured for lack of commitment by the governor and let me make this very clear if your soldiers arent out of my way very quickly i will simply ride my cavalry through and if need be over them theres a venicone warband making their escape while we sit here wasting time and i intend making sure that as few as possible of them get away if youll get your men out of my path he sat back in his saddle with one eyebrow raised laenas swallowed unhappily then turned back to face his officers ah gentlemen we will advance into the enemy camp and join battle immediately the legions most senior centurion nodded briskly his smile speaking volumes for his pleasure at the cavalrymans intervention at the double march tribune laenas swallowed and nodded indeed at the double march first spear canutius its a good thing weve got the advantage of the slope qadir nodded in response to marcuss shouted comment the century were starting to tire the front rank becoming more interested in keeping their feet and fending off the barbarian spears than taking their iron to the enemy who in their turn had burned through their first rage and were attacking with less vigour than moments before a horn sounded across the smokewreathed camp from the northern palisade and the front rank of a legion cohort swept into view through a gap in the camps northern fence marcus shot the oncoming legionnaires a dark glance about bloody time too qadir shook his shoulder pointing across the tungrian line look fresh troops were pouring into the space behind the tungrian cohort moving quickly to bolster their sagging line its the second cohort first spear neuto was never going to leave us in the sh marcus stopped in midsentence his eyes suddenly caught by an object being waved around over the heads of the barbarians a dozen paces from the centurys line qadir caught his stare and looked to see what had taken his attention it was a mans head still wearing the crosscrested helmet that denoted his centurions rank evidently hacked from his body and impaled on the point of a spear as a crude trophy with which the romans could be taunted as qadir watched marcuss face went white with anger and his eyes narrowed in calculation he turned to the hamian reaching down and picking up a fallen shield his voice stony as he turned to face the howling mob railing at the centurys shields shoot to my right and keep shooting guessing what was about to happen qadir reached out a hand to restrain his friend but marcus was too quick for him pushing through the astonished rearrankers and stepping into the front rank alongside scarface stopping a swordblow with his shield he stepped forward and stabbed his gladius into the tribesmans throat as the enemy warrior fought to free his blade from the painted wooden surface turning back to stare with a blankeyed intensity at the wideeyed soldiers guard my left he turned back and stepped into the seething mass of warriors hacking down a man to his right and blocking another swordblow from his left with the shield shouting a terse order over his shoulder qadir shoot to my right the hamian shook himself free from the amazement of seeing his centurion actually throw himself into the mass of his enemies and bellowed a command in his own language hamians to me nocking an arrow and loosing it with one fluid motion he sent the irontipped head through the throat of a warrior poised to bury his axe into marcuss helmet ramming his gladius deep into another barbarians chest and feeling the blades reluctance to come free of the wounds tight grip the young centurion released the weapons ornate handle without a second thought kicking the dying warrior back into the men behind him grabbing the axe from the tribesman tottering backwards with qadirs arrow buried in his throat he levelled his shield and hurled it horizontally into the press of the enemy flattening another of the men facing him with a ruptured throat then raised the axe two handed and gathered himself to attack again another hamian reached qadirs side at the same second ripping his bow from its place across his back and reaching for an arrow with the same unconscious grace with which the chosen man exercised his craft with only a split seconds time spent finding a point of aim he sent the missile into the fray around his centurion with an almost thoughtless speed that nevertheless sent another of the men facing marcus staggering back into the men behind him in a spray of his own blood at the same instant scarface shook off his own momentary panic hurling a furious command at the frontrankers to his left as he waded forward into the barbarians with me you bastards slamming down his shield to block off a spearthrust aimed at his legs he thrust his swords blade into the barbarians throat and twisted the hilt opening the warriors neck wide in a shower of hot blood that flicked across the halfdozen men who had advanced into the barbarian mass alongside him glancing up he was momentarily open mouthed at the sight of his officer hurling his shield into the warbands mass and grasping an axe two handed before throwing himself at the warriors gathering around him with an incoherent scream clearly lost to his rage the speed and savagery of his onslaught cleared a path into the heart of the warband as warriors fell away from him with their bodies rent by the weapons heavy blade those as yet untouched by the unexpected attack backing away from the berserk roman qadir and his fellow archers were ten strong now and their arrows were killing the warriors to marcuss right faster than they could be replaced by the men behind them the barbarians eyes flickering from their unhinged enemy his armour dripping with the blood of the dying men scattered around him to the archers dealing out impersonal death to them from behind the roman line scarface and his fellow soldiers now formed the other side of their centurions tenuous link to his century their shields forming a diagonal wall from the centurys line to scarface at its farthest extension a man fell forward into the seething mass of barbarians facing them his throat skewered by a barbed spear thrust over the rim of his shield and then pulled back to haul him bodily out of the shield wall and qadir pushed a rearranker forward to take his place before lifting his bow to shoot again the soldiers were holding out well enough stabbing into the mass of their enemies and parrying the inevitable counterattacks in a way that the veteran soldier knew could only last so long before they succumbed to the overwhelming strength gathering against them he dragged in a deep breath meaning to entreat marcus to retreat from his exposed position but before he could do so the axe snagged between a dying mans ribs and stuck fast a warrior in the mass facing him stabbed at marcuss face the blade slicing a long cut in his cheek as he swayed backwards to evade the attack releasing his grasp on the axes handle as he bent to scoop up a dying warriors sword from the ground beside him stamping forward he hacked the swords blade at his attackers legs dropping the man to his knees with the muscles of both thighs opened to the bone drawing his spatha the roman roared his bloodsoaked defiance at the barbarians now visibly shrinking away from him a single man stepped forward to meet him in the space that had opened around the roman one hand grasping a massive battleaxe the other a spear on which the centurions head was impaled and as scarface realised whose the head was his eyes narrowed in pain oh dear fuck marcus jumped forward to meet the newcomers attack a fresh flight of arrows punching into the men to his right as he stopped the barbarian champions axe with crossed swords halting the blade inches from his head before slamming his helmets brow guard forward in a vicious headbutt which sent the enemy warrior staggering backwards blood streaming from his shattered nose he followed up with lightning speed his spatha hacking off the reeling barbarians right arm at the wrist before the other man ever realised what was happening to him thrusting forward with the barbarian weapon he ran the warrior clean through leaving the blade sheathed in his opponents chest and tearing the spear from his grip while the barbarians around him watched in amazed silence he pulled the severed head from the bloody blade tossed the weapon aside and tucked the grisly trophy under his left arm stepping back a pace he growled a quiet order to scarface fall back slowly the tribesmen watched in silence as the romans retreated to their line one pace at a time never once looking back from their enemies while the hamians waited with arrows nocked and ready to fly regaining the relative safety of the tungrian line marcus blew out a long shaky breath tears running through the blood painted across his face between his cheek guards as he stared down into the paincontorted face that stared back up at him he lifted his head to watch numbly as the th legions leading cohort smashed into the barbarian rear less than a hundred paces from the tungrians place on the slope ill see you buried properly tiberius rufius and then ill take as many of my men as will follow me track down that bastard calgus and make sure he dies in agony for you he turned back to morban who was standing at his shoulder aghast at the death of the man who was both marcuss saviour and his closest friend his voice hoarse with sudden grief standardbearer at the slow march retreat back up the slope now theyve finally got here wed best give the bloody legion some room to work king drust looked about him as the venicone warband climbed the bare hillside high above the doomed barbarian camp scanning the empty ground to either side before glancing back over his shoulder panting with the effort of the climb up the wooded slope below the forests upper limit was five hundred paces behind the rearmost of the venicone warriors whose initial headlong charge from the embattled camp had quickly been reduced to a long loping stride as they had weaved their way through the densely packed trees his warriors were marching in a long straggling column as they climbed the mountains unforgiving slope moving in family groups of spearmen and archers whose breath steamed around them in the cold morning air he spat on to the hillsides thin turf and grunted a comment at the leader of his personal bodyguard jogging along beside him perhaps we got away clean but i doubt it those roman bastards dont give up that easily the other man grimaced at the pain gnawing at his chest as the effort of the long climb started to tell upon him aye and were leaving a trail that a blind man could follow the king nodded looking back at the treeline again their soldiers will never catch us not over this ground and carrying that much weight in weapons and armour its their horsemen that worry me worry you drust i thought you and your tribesmen feared no man the king looked up to find that calgus still being carried over the massive shoulder of the man who had beaten him into unconsciousness had regained his wits his voice was weak with the aftereffects of being stunned but the acerbic note was unmistakable he reached out and tapped calguss head with his knuckle causing the rebellions former leader to wince in pain calgus you still live then i thought maon might have hit you too hard but i see your skull is every bit as thick as i imagined calgus smiled wanly insult me as you will drust i can see that i am due a long period at your mercy before you sell me to the romans if they let you escape that is drust laughed in his face hefting his hammer with a grim smile oh theyll do their very best to stop us calgus and they might kill a few of us but all theyll really manage to do is pick off a few weaklings and provide us with fresh a horn sounded back down the slope and drust turned back to stare down at the trees a single horseman had fought clear of the forests thick growth and was sounding the signal to alert his comrades of the venicone warbands presence high on the hill to their north drust laughed at calguss expression caught between hope and fear its a tough choice eh calgus to be carried off into slavery by me or to be rescued by the romans whose strongest desire is to put you on a cross and watch the crows pull your eyes out while youre still breathing cut his bonds and put him down maon ill have your swordarm free for more important work calgus can either keep up this gentle pace were setting or he can fall behind and find out what the romans have in store for him he raised his voice to a bellow my brother warriors very soon now the roman horsemen will be snapping at our heels eager to take our heads for the bounty they will earn for each man they kill we must keep moving no matter how many times they attack if they can stop us here they will bring their soldiers up the hill to surround us and slaughter us from behind their shields keep moving and use your spears to make them keep their distance archers pick your targets well and wait until you cannot miss before you shoot we must keep moving cross this miserable bump of a hill and make for our own land the horsemen will give it up soon enough and remember brothers tonight we dine on horse flesh calgus initially unsteady on his feet after being unceremoniously tipped on to them by the massively built maon gritted his teeth and fell in alongside drust a cynical smile playing across his face despite the pain throbbing in his head and the weakness in his knees tonight we dine on horse flesh and i thought i was the expert at keeping the facts from my people the venicone king looked back at the forests edge again where another halfdozen horsemen had emerged from the trees and were trotting their mounts easily up the bare slope behind the warband enjoy your good humour while it lasts calgus im away to find my body slave and relieve him of a heavy burden those bastards are going to keep us in sight until enough of them have gathered to start picking off the stragglers with their spears and shooting arrows into us from our flanks and you calgus have no shield look at him strutting around like he had anything to do with the fighting soldier manius poured a small measure of water on to his cupped palm rubbing it vigorously on to his face to dislodge as much of the dried blood as possible then poured another measure on to his sweatcrusted hair grimacing at the dirt that came away on his hand he shot another glance at the th legions first spear as the senior officer walked past the tungrians bellowing a command at his men and nudged the man standing next to him all big and brave when its all done bar the shouting but nowhere to be seen when the irons flying from what ive heard a legionary from their first cohort was telling me that a roared command from their centurion a twentyyear veteran with a battered face by the name of otho silenced him stand to seventh century stop your moaning and get in line theres work to be done and were the men to do it the voices of the cohorts other centurions were ringing out along the length of the defensive position that the tungrians had fought grimly to defend in the dawns pale light urging their men back on to their feet good old knuckles now theres an officer wholl stand in line when the time comes and you wouldnt want to trade blows with anyone with his mouth still open shut it now or ill come and shut it for you manius nodded to his mate with a knowing look but kept his mouth closed otho glanced along the line of his men for a long moment satisfying himself that he had their full attention before speaking again thats better we have new orders seventh century we are to search whatever parts of this camp the legions havent already burned to the ground for anything that might be of value to the empire there will still be a few of the bluefaced bastards hiding and waiting for dark to fall so dont use the door of any tent unless you want your head taken off cut a flap in the side of the tent with your sword have a good look through it and if its empty step inside to see what you can find if you can see anyone inside the tent do not go in after him but call on him to surrender if you have to surround the tent and use your spears to drive him out and dont kill any of the bastards unless you absolutely have to theyre worth a lot of money to the empire tribune scaurus will catch shit from above if we dont bring a few of them out alive and we all know that shit rolls downhill inside the tent you may find weapons and personal effects abandoned in the battle do not try to hang on to any such item not if you dont want me in your face any man found attempting to hide any booty will probably be flogged in front of the cohort but hell already have a set of lumps courtesy of this he held up his right fist the knuckles crisscrossed with the scars of fights long forgotten right get to it seventh century advance the centuries advanced slowly up the hill skirting round the smouldering remains of tents which had caught fire during the battle and concentrating on those which had survived enjoying the late mornings gentle sunshine as they searched the camp at as leisurely pace as their officers would allow after an hour of slow climbing with nothing more than the occasional discovery and capture of a hiding barbarian to show for their efforts the cohort entered the section of the camp which had been used by the venicones approaching the next in an apparently unending succession of tents to be searched maniuss tent party went about their task in exactly the same way they had approached every other search that morning hacking an upsidedown v out of the tents wall with his razoredged dagger the senior soldier looked cautiously through the opening hed made calling a warning back to his comrades body looks like hes dead dropping his shield he stepped in through the hole with the dagger held ready to fight looking round the tents interior for any lurking enemy clear this ones definitely dead hes got a ballista bolt through his spine might be something here though putting a boot on the crouching corpses shoulder he pushed the dead barbarian away from a small wooden chest what have we got here all the usual barbarian rubbish i suppose spoon knife cloak brooches he slipped the jewellery into his purse then frowned as he caught sight of something gleaming brightly in the sprawled barbarians hand reaching down to pry it loose from the dead mans cold fingers with his pulse quickening so whats this then i wonder all bright and shiny he turned back to the rent in the tents wall and called softly to the soldier standing on the other side look at this he held up the torc for the other man to see hefting the weight of it weighs as much as my dagger we should call for knuckles the look on his face belied the words and his comrade took one look and nodded agreement with the unspoken sentiment what and have that old bastard walk away with enough money to put every man in the tent party on the street set up for life thats ours mate we fought for it and were keeping it stuff that thing into your armour under your shieldarm thats our retirement fund youve got there well not stop them tonight by late afternoon the venicones were a dozen miles to the northwest of the barbarian camps smoking ruin and still marching while the petrianas cavalrymen rode to either side and behind them battered shields and bloodied spears told their own stories but for every halfdozen barbarian bodies spreadeagled on the hillsides in the warbands trampled wake their backs arched in death by the impact of the cavalrymens spears the petriana had paid the painful price of a dead rider tribune licinius sat on his horse on a slope to one side of their path and watched the tribesmen trotting wearily across the hills thin turf in the suns slowly ebbing light nodding his head at the decurions ranged alongside him decisively theyll make another few miles before night falls and camp in the open tonight theres nothing to give them any shelter that they could reach before dusk well have to fall back to the legions get a nights sleep and some food into men and beasts then get these lazy buggers back out here to renew hostilities tomorrow morning after a day like today well all benefit from a few hours without having to stare at those bloody savages and their spoils his men had watched in horror that morning as those riders foolhardy enough to risk a charge at the warbands flanks had been mobbed by the venicones seeing their fellow soldiers dragged from their horses and killed with a savagery that made their last moments a screaming bloody nightmare any man that had ridden to the aid of a comrade in such circumstances had achieved no more than to sign his own death warrant and the horsemen had been forced to watch the swift and horrible demise of their comrades without any means of either rescue or revenge worse still for men trained to put the welfare of their mounts before their own more than one riderless horse had been pulled into the warband and swiftly butchered for the meat to be had from its steaming corpse while the cavalrymen had shouted enraged curses and oaths of revenge at the fleeing barbarians their initial hotblooded attempts to disrupt the tribesmens flight had quickly reduced in intensity as the likely fate of any man that rode too close to their enemy sank in for the most part they had ridden in sullen silence alongside their enemy casting dark glances at men carrying trophies of weapons and armour torn from their dead comrades or laden with heavy chunks of bloody meat should we leave scouts to keep watch on them tribune licinius shook his head at the question i see no need theyre leaving a trail in the grass that well pick up easily enough in the morning no well not risk another man in pursuing these bloodyhanded bastards and tomorrow well have the rations to stay with them for a few days and a few other tricks to make them sorry theyve taken their knives to our horses come on gentlemen lets drag our men away from their dreams of revenge and take them home for the night so then he just says guard my left and jumps into the bluenoses like a madman grabs an axe and paints himself from head to foot with blood there was guts and shit everywhere spotting centurion julius approaching over cyclopss shoulder the soldier known to his mates as scarface snapped to attention saluting the th centurys officer as he stopped to stand in front of the halfdozen men grouped a few paces from the door of their officers tent looking about the group the heavybuilt centurion hooked a thumb over his shoulder his blackbearded face creasing into its habitual sneer of disdain you rearrank heroes have got better things to be doing than encouraging this idler to spin his tales go and do them now the soldiers took their cue dispersing back to their respective centuries without a backward glance at the watch officer who making to leave in his own turn found himself detained by a pointed finger and a hard stare not you cyclops nor you scarface you two and i need words the oneeyed watch officer nodded meekly recalling his previous encounters with julius in the days before marcus had taken an interest in him and commanded him to drag himself free from his downward spiral of infringement against authority and ever harsher punishment wheres your centurion watch officer augustus pointed at the tent behind him not come out since we got back to camp sir hes and your optio scarface spoke up with the wounded centurion he sent me to collect some water the centurion leaned in closer hard eyes boring into scarfaces and took a firm grip of the soldiers tunic best be on your way then hadnt you soldier but before you go a word of advice if i catch you boasting about what centurion corvus did today again ill have you round the back of the command tent for a short and painful lesson in the lost art of keeping your bloody mouth shut youre supposed to have a reputation for watching over him like a mother hen and yet here you are mouthing off to anyone thatll listen about what a great warrior he is perhaps you ought to be the one whos called latrine behind his back youre more deserving of the name than me from what i can see now get out of my sight scarface hurried away red faced and chastened but the burly centurion had already forgotten him as he turned back to the watch officer its true then hes shut himself in there and wont come out cyclops nodded silently his misery so evident that even julius who under normal circumstances would have wasted no time telling the watch officer to pull himself together and get on with doing his job was almost lost for words himself he patted the other man on the shoulder and gestured to the line of tents behind him best if you make sure your men have got their gear sorted out and then get them rolled up in their cloaks and asleep the rumours are flying that were back on the march in the morning looking for more barbarians heads cyclops nodded again saluting the burly centurion and turning away to do his bidding while julius stood and stared at the tents closed entrance flap for a long moment before stepping through it inside he found marcus sitting in neardarkness his armour still crusted with the dried blood of the men he had killed fighting his way to retrieve his friends head come on lad theres no time for this nonsense youre a centurion youve got men bleeding out there and youve left your optio to pick up the pieces you need to hes dead julius the best friend i had in the world julius followed his exhausted vacant stare and started with shock tiberius rufiuss severed head was propped against the tent wall his dead eyes staring glassily back at marcus jupiters fucking cock and balls i dont you just cant words failing him the big centurion shook his head in disbelief and reached down for the dead mans head leave him alone the barely restrained animal ferocity in the romans voice froze julius in midstoop he turned to look at his friend finding himself eye to eye with a face he barely recognised as the man he had watched pull himself from the edge of oblivion to command a century of tungrians alongside him marcus spoke again through gritted teeth his face stonily implacable you leave him alone julius i havent finished making my peace with him yet not by a long march the fight went out of him like a snuffed candle as if he had nothing more to give just leave me alone with him i need more time to say goodbye to him julius straightened shrugging helplessly this is wrong marcus you just cant do this the young centurion had slumped back against the tent wall his entire focus on his dead friends head julius shook his head in helpless exasperation and ducked out through the flap you the passing soldier froze at the bellowed command snapping to attention and staring at him warily i want a lamp and some oil to light your centurions tent fetch them here now tribune scaurus walked into his tent as the sun was dipping to touch the western horizon dropping his helmet and sword belt on to the rough wooden table and nodding wearily to his two senior centurions after the rout and destruction of the selgovae tribes warriors trapped in their camp and battered into ruin by two legions and with their fleeing survivors hunted down by the auxiliary cohorts that accompanied the main force he had been summoned to a senior officers conference with the governor and his legion commanders that had lasted most of the evening he turned back to the tents door muttering a quiet command to his lone bodyguard the massively built german nodded closing the tents flap and turning to stand guard over his masters privacy arminius will make sure were not disturbed this information is for you and you alone at least for the time being taking a cup of wine from first spear frontiniuss outstretched hand scaurus raised it to the two men and tipped it back swallowing the contents in a single gulp thank you sextus mithras unconquered i needed that it baffles me how a man as abstemious as ulpius marcellus ever reached the rank of governor he certainly isnt one for handing round the drinks not even after a successful battle s gentlemen how are our men frontinius rubbed his shaved head before answering his features shadowed with fatigue our section of the camp is built and secure tribune and the men of both cohorts are bedded down with double guards in case any stray barbarian gets the idea to come looking for revenge in the dark his colleague neuto the nd cohorts senior centurion nodded agreement the first cohort got the worst of the fighting this morning so we agreed to let the second take guard duty for the night scaurus accepted the decision without surprise since his promotion to command of both tungrian cohorts after the untimely death of the nds prefect and with a promotion from prefect to tribune to reflect his increased responsibility and status he had found the two former comrades worked so well together that his decisionmaking capabilities were rarely called into play any more dead frontinius ignored the wax tablet open in his hand his tired face grim as he recounted the damage done to his cohort in the dawn battle to break into the barbarian camp yes another two men dead from their wounds so the first cohort has now lost a hundred and thirtyseven men today eightyseven of them dead and another dozen or so likely to die before dawn the bandage carriers reckon that about twenty of the wounded will fight again given time but the rest are finished as soldiers most of the surviving centuries are still at more or less effective fighting strength though since the majority of the dead were from the sixth the tribune nodded yes the governor sends his respects and sympathy as did legatus equitius on behalf of the sixth legion he collared me afterwards sent you his regards and told me that if theres anything he can do short of giving us men to make up our losses we have only to ask is there anything we could ask him for the th legions commanding officer had been frontiniuss prefect until a few months earlier in the year and their relationship had been a strong one the first spear shook his head other than taking centurion corvus off our hands given that once again hes the talk of the bloody camp and likely to bring inquisitive senior officers down on us like flies on freshly laid shit no tribune i dont think theres anything the legatus can do for us scaurus was silent for a moment and how is the centurion frontinius shook his head julius found him sitting in his tent with poor rufiuss head and refusing to come out says hes had enough of leading his friends to their deaths what with antenoch a few days ago and now the best friend he had left in the world dubnus could probably have dragged him out of it quickly enough but hes fifty miles away with a spear wound in his guts which only leaves julius and hes about as sensitive with these things as i am added to which he tells me that the man very nearly went for him when he tried to reunite rufiuss head with the rest of him scaurus nodded and theres not one of us that would relish being on the wrong end of that best you leave him to me then first spear neuto hows the second cohort no more deaths tribune but then we only took a handful of serious wounds apart from the fifteen men who were killed this morning sextus and i have agreed that the second will take the lead in our next battle if theres a lead to be taken and if theres a battle to be fought given that weve just torn the selgovaes fighting strength limb from limb scaurus rubbed a hand over his narrow face his grey eyes ringed by the fatigue of the previous weeks ceaseless activity whether therell be any more fighting this year i couldnt say but i can assure you both that this campaign isnt over not for us at least frontinius frowned for us what about the rest of the army the rest of the army sextus frontinius has other fish to fry the prefect unrolled the map he kept in his field chest laid it across his table and weighted the corners with his helmet and weapons he pointed to a spot on the map north of the wall that spanned the province to separate civilisation from the northern tribes and a good distance to the east of the road that ran northwards from the wall bisecting the tribal lands beyond the frontier thats us battle won and the selgovae well and truly put back in their place he tapped the map to the west of the road indicating the selgovaes tribal lands theyll have to be kept in their place of course but a single cohort could probably manage that given that weve killed most of their fighting strength today the cugerni and vangiones cohorts ought to be more than enough force to keep their heads down you know how that works both of the senior centurions nodded with grim faces and neutos voice was harsh as he spoke oh yes tribune we know how that works go in hard and do whatever it takes to make sure the stupid bluenosed bastards are clear that they lost burn their villages at any sign of resistance confiscate anything theyre not clever enough to hide and give them a winter they wont forget for a while therell be a skirmish or two but theyre out of the fight after today and us we drew the more interesting job id say the tribune pointed to the land to the east of the north road were ordered to head north and east and liberate the votadini from whoever it was that calgus sent north to rule them once hed killed king brennus since we dont know how many warriors calgus sent north with their new king were to advance at full strength and in full battle order and weve been given six squadrons of horsemen from the petriana wing to scout for us the governor thinks that calgus may have run for the safety of the votadini capital given that weve not found his body on the battlefield which makes him very keen to liberate it from the last of his men and see what we find first spear frontinius frowned again raising a bemused eyebrow at his superior his voice acerbic with disapproval two cohorts sixteen hundred men even if we were at full strength we ought to be twice the number and with a bloody sight more than two hundred horsemen not only do we not know how many warriors might be waiting for us but theres still the small question of the venicones the last i heard on the subject was that some weakchinned fool in a stripy tunic dithered outside the barbarian camp for long enough that the entire venicone warband was able to make a sharp exit through the north fence scaurus nodded sharply his eyes signalling disapproval of the language his subordinate was using to describe a senior officer if not the offended sentiment behind them i know first spear and i wont bore you with the excitement that little error of judgement has inspired among the great and the good except to tell you that weve had a cohort detached from the twentieth legion under the command of the weakchinned fool in question attached to us apparently it was either that or go home in disgrace for letting the venicones escape from under his nose so hes chosen to work under me for a few weeks as punishment and the venicones last seen running hard to the north after a day spent exchanging iron and insults with the petriana honours even apparently according to the first message riders back from the fight with several hundred of their warriors killed by the cavalry as they fell out of the line of march with exhaustion but fifty or so of tribune liciniuss men torn limb from limb as a result of getting carried away and riding too close to the enemy with the excitement of it all neuto stared at the map for a moment before speaking his voice rich with irony so while the legions get to sit back and count barbarian heads we go north with three cohorts one commanded by some custardlivered aristo and a couple of hundred horsemen not only charged with taking the dinpaladyr but potentially having to fend off the entire venicone warband as well scaurus nodded his smile tight almost first spear but the legions wont be getting any time to polish up their armour the one thing i havent mentioned yet is going to keep them very busy until the snow comes both of the senior centurions eyes narrowed neuto breathed the question in a hushed tone his face set in the expectation of bad news the brigantes scaurus nodded yes first spear the brigantes calgus has the fullscale revolt he was desperate for only just too late for it to do him any good and we gentlemen will just have to manage with what were given curse this fucking rebellion another couple of days would have seen us on the wall with the aquila boy in our grasp instead of which were sat here like spare pricks waiting for the bloody army to get off their arses and clear these impudent brits away only these useless provincial bastards are too scared of a few uppity bluepainted farmers to get out into the countryside and do what needs to be done the bloody guard would go through this lot like a hot knife through butter centurions rapax and excingus were standing on the walls of the waterfall town fort forty miles to the north of the legionary fortress at elm grove staring out at the dusks purple landscape in frustration the praetorian was complaining bitterly to his colleague slapping his palm down on the walls stone parapet to emphasise his disgust with the soldiers manning the fort below them all the way to the edge of the bloody empire in less than a month changing horses three times a day until my arse feels like its made of leather and now were sat here looking at the hills and wondering how the fuck were going to get any farther north a few of the locals get uppity and these cowards all run home to mummy and wait for someone else to sort it out for them excingus laughed wryly shaking his head in mock dismay yes colleague i have little doubt that your fellow guardsmen would cleave a bloody path through these rebels were they here which nevertheless leaves us with the same question do we wait for the legions to finish their business in the frontier zone and turn south to clear out these bandits or do we make our own way north immediately in pursuance of prefect perenniss orders i think you can guess my preference but i must defer to you in all such military matters rapax gave him a dirty look tapping the hilt of his sword thoughtfully your preference and mine are one and the same brother to get north and find the aquila brat before he takes flight again it could be rough though two centurions and a few guardsmen wont offer much resistance to a decentsized warband should we happen across one even if the soldiers in question are praetorians and i unlike you have fought against barbarians in the last emperors wars against the quadi and marcomanni ive heard the screams of men staked out for flaying and disembowelling men taken in battle or from the camp in the night and never seen again except for their ruined corpses on the tribes sacrificial altars we can ride north tomorrow morning and hope to make our way through to the wall without seeing another living soul trusting that the advantage of surprise will be on our side he grinned darkly at the corn officer since only a bunch of madmen would attempt such a thing im sure my guardsmen will think ive kissed my marbles goodbye but theyll do what i tell them readily enough so the question isnt really a military matter since militarily the idea of riding north from here without enough men to sweep away the tribesmen in our path is quite likely to prove suicidal he raised an eyebrow at his colleague inviting him to comment the corn officer stared out into the darkening and silent hills to the north for a long moment before speaking agreed riding north tomorrow does seem to carry somewhat more risk than waiting here for the army to march south and restore order if it were that simple the decision would already be made as far as im concerned but im afraid it isnt if we sit here for the best part of another month what are the odds that the news of a praetorian and a corn officer coming north will reach the army in the north well in advance of our arrival pretty good id say given what we know of the average soldiers love of gossip and if that news reaches either the aquila boy or the men sheltering him from justice ill wager my balls to a denarius that hell be away to another hiding place before we ever reach the wall much less find this tungrian cohort hes supposed to be hiding with he paused smiling at his colleagues sour expression yes and therein lies the problem with inaction eh quintus if we go home empty handed having paused here for the legions to regain control and make it safe for us to proceed i wouldnt expect all that happy a welcome when we get there so no the problem isnt military its more about balancing the uncertain risk of being killed or captured by the rebels against the absolute certainty of what will happen to us both if we go back without the prize i say we go north tomorrow and use your undoubted skills to avoid the barbarians and get us through to the wall in one piece rapax grimaced nodding his head reluctantly in that case youd better go and see the centurion of the guard and get us some better directions than out of the north gate and dont stop riding until you see the wall and ill go and break the good news to my lads theyre going to love this you there whos that sneaking round the camp after dark soldier manius very nearly lost control of his bowels as he recognised the voice challenging him from the shadows of a pair of tents the familiar sound of a gladius being pulled from its scabbard freezing him where he stood its me centurion manius otho stepped forward from the shadows his familiar ruined face creased into a frown what in hades are you doing out here i was just about to put my bloody iron through you manius caught a whiff of wine on the centurions breath and breathed a little more easily i couldnt sleep centurion so i came out here to avoid waking my mates up and to get some air to his surprise the officer nodded sagely puffing a snort of recognition from his flattened nose cant sleep nor can i too many good men dead too many men he staggered and manius put out a hand to steady him pulling it back hastily as the drunken officer started at the gesture get your fucking hands off me get back to your tent and go to sleep yes sir saluting the wary soldier turned away and walked back towards his tent then slid into the cover of the shadows and watched while otho weaved unsteadily away to his own bed blowing out a long slow breath of relief somewhere close by a man whimpered in his sleep reliving some horror or other from the dawns desperate fighting waiting until otho was safely out of sight manius resumed his progress through the camp using the rows of canvas tents for cover his armour exchanged for a clean tunic and his cloak with only his dagger for protection he worked his way from the st tungrian cohorts section of the camp through the nd cohorts tents and on into the area reserved for the petrianas cavalrymen skirting round the tethered horses well aware that any one of them could kick him unconscious if he were unwise enough to present them with an unexpected presence in their midst he made his way slowly and stealthily into the heart of the cavalry wings lines until he came upon the tent he was seeking several times the size of those around it bigger even than that in which the wings tribune worked and slept it contained every stores item required to keep the wing in the field for an extended period loosening his dagger in the sheath hidden under his cloak he stepped through the tents flap to find its single occupant hunched over a scroll at his desk his lips moving silently as he totted up the days consumption of his precious equipment without looking up from his task he spoke in an irritated tone shaking his head slightly and what might you be needing a new sword a couple of spears perhaps you lost your boots in the fighting today eh i swear ive not met a bigger bunch of robbers than his voice tailed off as he glanced up to find the infantryman waiting silently before him one hand sliding beneath the tables surface to reach for the handle of a club he kept there to discourage anyone with the idea that his equipment might be available without the necessary permissions and formal records the soldier held up his empty hands in reassurance reaching into his tunic despite the now openly wielded club and fishing out a piece of jewellery of quite abnormal proportions the yellow light from the storemans lamps shone from its ornate surface in a manner guaranteed to beguile a man whose entire life had been devoted to the pursuit of gold and the club clattered unheeded to the floor as the supply officer advanced round his desk and stared dumbfounded at the heavy torc gripped in the unknown soldiers hand rediscovering his voice he spoke again his tone softer than before as if he knew that this was a prize to be pursued with delicate care quite amazing he coughed clearing his throat before continuing adopting a more businesslike tone as the torcs initial impact on him began to subside and so soldier manius shook his head his face tense im not that stupid if were going to do business i need to be sure that my piece of the bargain will be between the two of us if anyone outside of my tent party discovers im carrying the sort of coin this will earn theyll have it off me quicker than you could rob a new recruit of half a years pay for his gear and this little beauty is our retirement me and my mates the supply officer kept a straight face nodding his under standing there are thieves all around my friend and so i completely understand your need to remain nameless might i ask how you came by this interesting spoil of battle it was my understanding that such a precious ornament would most likely decorate the neck of a tribal chief and yet no such head is reported as having been taken today how can i be sure that this is what it seems the tungrian snorted smiling with little humour in his face oh its real i can guarantee you that we were first into the barbarian camp once the fence came down and when the bluenoses finally broke and ran it was my cohort that swept up the hillside ripping through their tents and capturing those men that were trying to hide from us in them taking them to be slaves i found a barbarian hunched over this with the missile from a bolt thrower stuck clean through him he was probably supposed to be looking after it when the artillery boys got lucky but it was me and my mates that struck the gold they uncovered so now then what will you offer me for this pretty little trinket the supply officer held out a hand for the torc smiling at the reluctance with which the nameless soldier handed across the heavy ornament examining it closely under the light of one of his lamps he nodded his head in appreciation quite lovely beautifully engraved clearly authentic and once a suitable provenance has been dreamed up with a little more romance than some poor bugger getting an accidental bolt in the back itll be worth a small fortune from the right collector i cant offer you any more than five hundred for it though he handed the torc back to the openmouthed soldier shrugging at the other mans obvious outrage what were you expecting ten thousand denarii and a night alone with the prettiest horse in the cohort he sighed wearily as if explaining the mechanics of fencing stolen tribal jewellery were a routine topic of conversation and manius narrowed his eyes at the storemans wellpractised act without the ability to gainsay his words look whatever your name is this stuff doesnt just sell itself ill sell it to a man in the south of the province for a profit of course hell move it to rome to a businessman he knows for a profit he in turn will know the right dealer in such precious and risky items a man who knows where the discreet and wealthy customers are found for this sort of rather specialised merchandise and he in turn will take a profit realising that the tungrian still didnt understand he shook his head with a gentle smile what youre doing right now is illegal you should have handed this in to your centurion when you found it and he should then have passed it up to your first spear and so on by now this little trinket should be on the governors desk with him feeling rather smug about being able to send it to the emperor with his compliments instead of which youre sneaking around the camp and trying to find a buyer for it and inviting me to join you in your crime the dealer in rome will have his wind stopped for good if hes caught trading this since in reality hes robbing the throne of a nice heavy bag of gold oh yes we all do it but getting caught with this little beauty would be a death sentence to anyone in the chain ive described and theyre all going to want a nice big slice of it to take the risk thats why fifty thousand paid to the dealer in rome becomes twentyfive thousand paid to the man that takes it to him which becomes ten thousand to my man in the south which becomes five thousand to me if im lucky and ive got the worst risk of all since i have to find the money to pay you here on the edge of the world and i have to get the item in question across a country that just wont stop rebelling to my man in the south thatll cost me at least a thousand and probably more he sighed shaking his head and raising both hands in the universal gesture of surrender all right and against all my commercial instincts ill give you a thousand how many of you are there left alive in your tent party five well there you go then thats a nice clean two hundred apiece two years wages and none of the usual deductions a man can do a lot with that much coin what do you say the soldiers face darkened but he knew he was left with little alternative go on then give me the cash and ill be away the other man shook his head quickly no can do im afraid ive only got a few hundred on me and ill have to borrow the rest from an associate leave the piece with me and ill make sure the balance gets to you the tungrian shook his head disbelievingly right thatll be easy with you not knowing my name he stuffed the torc back into his tunic turning for the tents flap ill come back to you tomorrow night so you have the money ready and well have a deal any delay and the price doubles to compensate me for my risk in holding it for you he ducked out of the tent and into the night starting his cautious passage through the camp to his own cohorts lines the supply officer once he was sure that the soldier was really gone smiled broadly to himself as he reached for his cloak with the senior centurions away to their cohorts eager to start their preparations for the next days march north scaurus stretched his weary frame and opened the tents door to find arminius waiting for him go and get some rest my friend were marching north tomorrow and ill need you fresh for the fight now which way to the first cohorts lines the massively built german crossed his scarred arms and fixed the tribune with a level stare you want me to go and rest look at the state of you scaurus raised an eyebrow and took a breath preparing to speak but closed his mouth as the german bent slightly to speak quietly into his face you will recall the day you took me prisoner the day thunaraz looked down from the clouds and threw his lightning bolts to gift you victory at the moment of your defeat and condemn my people to defeat and slavery curse him i told you then and i tell you again now that i will fight for you i will die for you and i will worship your god mithras alongside you but i will never spare you my opinion and it is my opinion that you do need sleep and that you do not need to take any part in preparing your men for war tonight the tribunes reply was quiet but equally firm theres one particular man that needs my help arminius the german shook his head no you represent authority and centurion corvus will surely never bow to authority while he has his best friends head staring at him leave the boy to me and get your head down if i fail to reawaken his interest in life then you can take your turn at persuading him later although if what i plan fails mithras alone knows what will be required to bring him back to life scaurus nodded wearily patting the big mans shoulder with something approaching affection then turned and closed the tents door flap arminius stared at the canvas in silence for a long moment then turned and walked swiftly for the st cohorts section of the camp as he approached the first of the cohorts sentry points two men stepped forward with raised spears the weapons points glinting in the torchlight halt whats the watchword the german laughed advancing until the spearheads were almost touching the mail shirt that covered his massive chest watchword how the fuck would i know the watchword you stupid bastards ive been keeping guard outside the tribunes tent for the last hour without the time to play your little soldier games now shift your arses out of my way or ill put those spears where theyll never see the light of day again the soldiers looked at each other uncertainly but were saved from their dithering by the appearance of julius walking briskly towards them let him through hes too stupid to remember the watchword even if hed bothered to find out what it was arminius stepped past the soldiers clasping hands with their officer julius its good to see that you came through todays madness unscratched the big centurion turned his right arm over to reveal a long shallow slice into the flesh of his forearm not quite unmarked this will make a nice addition to my scar collection even if i have a way to go before i can match yours the warrior that did it is currently considering his lot from the roof of my tent or at least his head is cheeky bluenosed bastard and to what do we owe the honour of your visit so late in the day the german grimaced there is a young officer who has taken to his tent i believe and refuses to consider leaving it for fear of causing the deaths of more of his friends the smile vanished from juliuss face yes his century is sitting shivering in their tents with their chins wobbling and when i went to reason with him he nearly took my head off weve got until dawn to get him back on his feet or else hell have to be left behind when we march arminius nodded leave him to me julius watched the german head off down the line of tents with tired eyes then turned back to the sentries with a dismissive sneer and the next man that turns up here without the watchword and shouting the odds remember the golden rule if in doubt spears first and questions later you call yourselves soldiers arminius found the man he was looking for without too many problems where the tungrians had their tents laid out in straight lines their votadini allies shelters were gathered around their leaders tent in a tight circle he stopped at the perimeter of the huddle of tents and shouted across them his voice a commanding bark martos after a moments pause a warrior that arminius recognised as one of the princes bodyguard strolled out to meet him eyeing the german flatly and keeping his hands close to a pair of fighting knives tucked in his belt why do you call upon a prince of the votadini and a free man as if you were his master rather than addressing him with the respect that your slavery to the romans demands the german chuckled darkly putting his hands on his hips with supreme selfconfidence free men you and your prince submitted to roman rule just as completely as i once you were betrayed by calgus and defeated by these soldiers camped around you and you are not the man i wish to speak with tell your master i need his help with centurion corvus the votadini warrior stared hard at him for a long moment then turned on his heel and walked back into the cluster of tents after a moment martos stepped out of his tent and beckoned the german to join him he took a lungful of the cold night air and stared up at the blazing stars in the coalblack sky above them waiting for arminius to negotiate his way through the tents when the german stood before him he continued to stare upwards speaking without looking at the other man my kinsman tells me that you wish to speak with me he told me that i had only to say the word and he would gut you like a rabbit and i told him that taking his knives to you would be a very good way to die before his time he is frustrated like all of my men not to have been turned loose to hunt down calgus once his warriors were beaten although i suppose that we will get over the disappointment especially as we expect he has run to the last of his men who currently hold our capital so you have my attention what can i do for you that will not wait for daylight his gaze came to rest on arminius who inclined his head respectfully prince martos our friend centurion corvus has taken to his tent and will not come out instead he sits hunched over the head of his colleague rufius terrified of leading any more of his comrades to bloody death i think weve seen this before you and i and i think we both understand what will happen if he cannot be persuaded to change his mind martos nodded he is a fugitive from their justice without the shelter provided by the tungrians he will soon be discovered and when that happens riders will be sent to this cohort to arrest the tribune and first spear and take them to explain how they came to be providing our friend with a hiding place in which to escape from the emperors justice they would join him in a slow and painful death were he to be uncovered for who he really is but why should this concern me i like the man but if he insists on cutting his own throat then little i can do or say will prevent him from doing so and as for frontinius and scaurus well one roman officer is much like any other i would imagine arminius spoke quickly his voice kept low to avoid their being overheard we march tomorrow to free your tribal capital from whatever hold calgus still has over your people my master is sympathetic to your peoples plight whereas the man that will probably replace him if corvus is discovered is a roman aristocrat and cares no more for the likes of you and me than for any other barbarian worse than that he is a man of little courage from what we saw today i fear for your peoples safety if he becomes the commander of the force on which your tribes survival rests martos eyed the german for a moment you present me with little choice then either we get the centurion back on his feet or we risk losing the officer most likely to want my people free without the spilling of any more of their blood he sighed again i find myself drawn into matters for which i care little when all i want is to be set loose to hunt down calgus come on then german lets put some strength back in this romans backbone they walked quickly to the th centurys tents martos waving away the bodyguards who ran to join him as he strode away any man that can best me and this ugly german bastard deserves our heads the ths tents were pitched in an orderly manner and the soldiers were already tucked away and asleep exhausted by the exertions of the day but half a dozen men were standing around their centurions tent with worried faces seeing the two barbarians approaching qadir and cyclops sent the rest away to join their tent parties and greeted the two with respectful nods both men knew that martoss intervention in the battle of the red river had saved the cohort from being overrun and arminius was universally recognised as a man not to be crossed hes still in there eh cyclops the watch officer nodded indicating the tents door flap with a wave of his hand young gentleman wont come out wont eat or take a drink either just sits there staring at centurion rufiuss head martos put a hand on his shoulder gently easing him to one side leave him to us the two men stepped into the tent finding it lit by a single guttering lamp whose fuel was nearly exhausted martos looked at arminius who nodded silently and backed out of the door calling for more oil marcus was sitting on his bedroll the severed head of his friend facing him across the dimly lit space propped against the oiled leather of the tents wall the tent reeked of blood and sweat and marcuss armour and flesh were still caked with gore the untreated cut on his cheek a line of crusted blood i see your friend rufius is dead a pity he was a steady hand in a fight from what little i knew of him in my tribe when a warrior brother falls in battle we take a drink and celebrate his life we commend his spirit to the gods and pray that our exit from this life will be as noble as his i have heard that he died with half a dozen dead men littering the ground around him and i have also heard that you centurion corvus hacked apart a dozen men to take his head back from our mutual enemies you romans clearly have your own ways of marking such a glorious death and such a feat of revenge but this does not seem fitting arminius stepped back into the tent with another lamp then busied himself pouring oil into the first one while martos looked on weighing up the exhausted and demoralised man slumped on the ground in front of him he squatted in front of marcus looking into the younger mans redrimmed eyes so centurion you have a choice come with us now leave the past behind you and look forward to tomorrow come with us now and we will drink to your friends feats of this and other days we will send him to his gods with our thanks for the time he gave us or you can stay here and wallow in your misery and tomorrow we will be forced to march away and leave you with the legions where you will eventually be discovered to be a fugitive from justice he eyed the downcast roman with a calculating eye before continuing rufius saved your life before you found your new home with these people right when your father was executed by the emperor and your family slaughtered it was rufius who helped you to escape from the men hunting you marcus nodded smiling wanly at the memory as he answered he wasnt the greatest of warriors but he was every inch a soldier he stood alongside me twice with his sword drawn when he hardly knew me he brought me to the cohort persuaded me to change my name from valerius aquila to tribulus corvus he shook his head with the memory of that cold spring morning earlier in the year so you owed him your life twice over is that why you jumped into the warband today you should have been killed in an instant but between your mens efforts and the favour of mithras you killed a dozen men or more and walked out alive with what was left of your friend your name is on the lips of every man in camp thanks to that moment of madness and the story grows with every telling as does the number of people who hear about an insane young roman fighting with an auxiliary cohort we march north tomorrow and if you dont lead your men out of camp tomorrow morning it will only be a matter of days before someone puts the pieces of your story together and you find yourself in irons waiting for the carpenters to finish building not only your cross but those on which everyone who has protected you will die in agony alongside you marcus stood up stretching the stiffness out of his joints so if i dont pull myself together i risk dragging everyone else into my private hades and what if i do march north how long will it be before i see another of my friends hacked to pieces in front of me he stared aggressively at the two men challenging either of them to reply martos spoke into the charged silence his voice harsh with emotion how long who knows were warriors my friend marcus we all live with death none of us enjoys losing a friend but none of us has much choice in the matter your father had you trained to fight he made sure you knew how to throw your iron around he gave you the skills you need to kill anyone that puts himself in your way more than that he gifted you the intelligence and aggression to survive and perhaps even to take revenge for his murder when enough time has passed but you wont make a life here without facing death the way you have today and you will face it again and again your friends will die marcus its a fact of life ive lost friends and kinsmen and so has arminius you have two choices centurion you can either learn to deal with it or you give up now and spare those close to you by taking your own life arminius stepped in close to the exhausted centurion gently tapping his bloody chain mail with a sad smile and whichever you choose you must make that choice quickly now if youre not with us when we march tomorrow morning youll represent a death sentence to the man ive sworn to protect with my own life and i cannot allow that to happen marcus closed his eyes and stood silently for a moment swaying slightly on his feet with exhaustion then opened his eyes and regarded them without any hint of emotion very well you are both good men and i trust your judgement i will seek to deal with my loss and not betray those left alive for the sake of those already dead martos put a gentle hand on his shoulder guiding him towards the tent door good life is for the living two knives and the more death you see the more you will come to appreciate that truth lets get you out of that mail and washed and then the three of us can take rufiuss head down to the fire thats been set to deny the crows our dead and reunite him with his brothersinarms after that id say that well all need a drink and a chance to remember the man at his best before we leave him here for good stores officer octavius found his intended partner in the torcs purchase absent when he made his way to the mans section of the petrianas camp enquiries as to the whereabouts of decurion cyrus were met with the combination of indifference and near outright hostility to which he had become accustomed in his service as a stores officer the most helpful comment he got was from a man whose sword he had replaced with moderately good grace less than an hour before prompting a temporary truce in the usual state of open warfare between the cavalry wings fighting men and the storeman they were rightly convinced was making a small fortune from supplying their needs hes out at the turf wall supervising the guards one of the decurions stopped an arrow this afternoon so cyrus has gone over to make sure doublepay silus is up to doing his job for now i can take you over to see him if its urgent his look of appraisal was enough to put octavius on his guard in an instant the stores officer and decurion cyrus were well known throughout the wing as men with a shared objective wealth and all of the privileges it could buy them cyrus was reputed despite his relatively lowly position as a squadron commander to be wealthy well beyond the expectations of any of his peers or indeed the wings senior officers it was muttered that he had chanced across a large cache of barbarian gold in the previous few months and had contrived to keep the majority of it for himself with a few wellplaced bribes as for keeping that portion that he had managed to retain to himself his fearsome reputation for swift violence in the face of any perceived slight or wrong had guaranteed that nobody who had even the scantest idea as to what was kept in his campaign chest harboured any thought of theft octavius detested though he was by the petrianas men carried no such threat and any man that suspected the presence of easy gain in his doings would have little to put him off the idea of taking a knife to either the stores tent canvas wall or should the necessity arise its occupant nothing that wont wait ill catch up with him later the storeman turned away with a quiet curse but his mood quickly lightened with the realisation that the army was unlikely to be moving from their camp alongside the ruins of the barbarian stronghold for a day or two there were sacrifices of thanks to be made to various gods equipment to be recovered from the dead wounded to be carried away for treatment and the corpses of the fallen to be gathered and burned he was sure that the governor would be unlikely to throw battleweary soldiers on to the road without a compelling need for such a course of action he would have plenty of time to speak with his business partner once his nights business was complete posting arminius to keep guard on the command tent delayed the arrival of the latest piece of bad news at soldier level in the tungrian cohorts by no more than an hour and by the time of the morning meal every man in the tungrian section of the camp was fully aware of both the facts as they were known and the inevitable speculation wrapped around them every fort on the wall burned out ive heard women and children raped and murdered and the greybeards pegged out for the crows morban shook his head angrily at the trumpeters excited statement reaching across their small tent and gripping the younger man by the tunic with an angry glint in his eyes short of stature and bandy legged the standardbearer was nevertheless solid with muscle and a dangerous man when roused then youll do well to keep your mouth shut and what youve heard to yourself its just a story to you eh well to some of your mates its their women youre talking about being fucked stupid by those dirty bluenose bastards some of them have kids too so get your bloody horn and get ready for morning parade he stamped out of the tent his breath misting in the early morning chill almost tripping over the child sitting outside seemingly oblivious to the cold the boy was intent on the knife he held in one hand and was dragging the edge of its blade across a sharpening stone he glanced up at his grandfather before returning his gaze to the weapons edge i thought i could hear you and that bloody stone lupus morban squatted down next to his grandson holding out a hand for the knife the boy surrendered it reluctantly and stared fixedly at it while his grandfather examined the edge snatching his thumb away with a curse as the blade drew a thin line of blood cocidius but thats sharp six more months of your constant sharpening and youll have nothing left lad he handed the weapon back watching as lupus slid it into the sheath on his belt look lupus you dont need to sharpen a knife every day this isnt normal his voice faltered foundering on the certainty that nothing he said was going to make any impact on the boy who was staring at the ground in misery antenoch told me to make sure i always had a sharp edge on my knife morban nodded blinking away the tears that were threatening to run down his cheeks the boy despite not having reached the age of thirteen years had used the knife to hamstring a barbarian warrior at the battle of the red river ford taking revenge for the murder of his friend antenoch he put a hand under the boys chin lifting his face until they were looking into each others eyes i know its not easy for me either antenoch was my friend as well as looking after you when i couldnt i the boy started to cry and morban gathered him into his arms and hugged him tightly feeling the childs body shake as he sobbed out his misery and his feeling of helplessness intensified after a few minutes the sobbing eased and the standardbearer was able to gently remove the boys arms from around his neck and hold him out at arms length come on now lad weve got a parade to get organised i dont even know if centurion corvus will be join as if on cue marcus stepped out of his tent pitched alongside that used by the standardbearer and trumpeter and looked about him his eyes were red with fatigue and his armour was still covered in dried blood which was flaking away as the rings rubbed against each other with his movements but his face had a determined set despite the exhaustion that shadowed his features morban took one quick glance and turned to bellow down the line of tents qadir two knives is up and about and you lad go and get your cleaning gear hes going to need a bloody good brushing before he goes on parade storeman octavius caught up with decurion cyrus shortly after breakfast strolling through a surprisingly busy morning to find his wouldbe partner supervising a flurry of activity having enjoyed a few hours of sleep he was aghast to see that the squadrons tents were being struck and loaded on to the wings baggage animals while individual troopers were fussing over their mounts and checking equipment with the solemn faces of men going back into the fight whats happening how can we be on the move so soon and with the battlefield still littered with gear cyrus grinned down at him mirthlessly shaking his head in dark amusement always the last to know eh octavius the whole camps on the move man both legions going south to put a brigantian rebellion back in its place and were going north to see if we can bottle up the venicones and prevent them from escaping back to their lands north of the abandoned wall most of us that is some poor bastards have been detailed to ride to the northeast with the auxiliaries and take back some fortress that calgus still holds the stores officers eyes widened in nearpanic and he gripped the decurions arm without being aware of the action but ive got a deal for us cyrus reached out with his other hand and plucked the storemans grip from his sleeve speaking in a quiet but fierce tone not now cant you see the interest youre causing two or three men were already watching the pair with thinly disguised curiosity and the decurion turned away to check the fastenings on his saddle speaking quietly over his shoulder whats so urgent that it cant wait a few days ive got a soldier from one of the tungrian cohorts offering me a bloody great big gold barbarian torc and he says it belonged to a tribal chief itll sell in rome for a hundred thousand minimum and ive got him on the hook for a thousand we can probably make at least twenty thousand on the deal if you can just lend me five hundred to make up the purchase price cyrus turned back to him taking his spear and showing him its iron head as if to discuss some feature of its manufacture firstly my friend theres no way im going to put my hand into my purse with this collection of thieves and idlers watching and secondly both tungrian cohorts are away off to the northeast with that aristo felix and six squadrons something about cleaning out a nest of bluenoses up north so that torcs about to march out of the camp it seems that your deals walking out on you centurion dubnus shifted uncomfortably on the examination table feeling the doctors cool hands gently probing around the fresh scar that would be his permanent reminder of the battle at the red river the spear wound had been inflicted by a barbarian who had run full pelt into his centurys line and punched his weapons iron head through the big mans armour burying it deep in his side to put him out of the fight and into the hands of the noisy valley fortresss medical staff i cant feel anything to indicate any infection centurion and your wound seems to have healed nicely enough youre a lucky man you can get back on your feet for a few hours a day nothing strenuous mind you and no clever ideas about sneaking back to your cohort either i know youre desperate to get back into the fight but you wont be fit to get back into armour for at least a month do you understand what im saying this time dubnus returned her questioning stare with a rueful smile he had been caught at his rooms window a few days previously watching the legionaries practising with their weapons when he was supposed to be confined to bed i understand doctor ill sit in my chair and listen to the idiots comparing the size of their scars she nodded firmly good and no trying to make your way down the corridor unobserved either you need at least another week of inactivity before we can be sure that your wound is really healed he nodded sitting up with the help of the doctors orderly julius a quiet and goodnatured man rarely without a smile on his face is there any news from the legions julius answered after a moments silence shooting a troubled glance at his mistress yes centurion a message rider arrived last evening i would have woken you when i heard the message he was carrying but you looked so and the orderly smiled at the questioning tone but the doctor turned back to him and wagged a finger calm yourself centurion theres nothing either of us can do whatever the news might be as it happens the news is good or so it seems the rebellion is broken their camp stormed and destroyed and those barbarians who escaped are scattered and running for their lives and no theres no detail as to which units took what part in the fight dubnus pulled his tunic back on gingerly feeling the fresh scar tissue flexing with his movements doctor she shook her head after all thats happened in the last few months i think you should call me felicia centurion very well felicia whatever fighting he might have seen marcus will have come through it in one piece hes faster with two swords than i am with one his century are determined not to let their young gentleman come to any harm and hes got tiberius rufius to keep him from making an idiot of himself hell be back here soon enough her eyes moist felicia reached out for the big soldiers hand i know and if anything were to have happened to him i could cope with it its just the not knowing dubnus gave her a wry smile i know believe me cooped up in here i know exactly what you mean and now i must give you this he picked up a small clothwrapped package and handed it to her catching juliuss eye and tipping his head at the door the orderly took the hint and made his excuses while the doctor unwrapped the cloth revealing a small knife in a soft leather sheath what its for your protection i asked the soldier that you discharged yesterday to bring it in for me i want you to promise that youll wear it until marcus can come for you you need to be able to protect yourself if the need arises you know where a man is vulnerable to a small blade just as well as i do and that ones long enough to open a throat if need be it will strap around your leg above the knee and be hidden under your stola promise me that youll wear it she drew the knife from its sheath examining the razorsharp sixinch blade with a critical eye well used to gauging the sharpness of her surgical tools dubnus i took an oath to protect human life not to take it the big centurion shook his head but his reply was gentle these are difficult times and youre too precious to my friend for me to see you without some way of defending yourself what if the brigantes break into this fort he took a deep breath in through his nose then exhaled and raised a questioning eyebrow and besides its not just about you any more is it the tungrian cohorts marched two abreast down the wellbeaten track that ran from the barbarian camp to the edge of the forest and which would bring them out on to the flatter land of the red rivers flood plain the gently waving branches above their heads cast sundappled patterns across their ranks until they marched out on to the rolling plain leaving behind the forest in which calgus had planned to ambush and destroy the legions before the presence of his venicone allies had been detected by a chance encounter with one of marcuss soldiers emerging from the trees on to the plains gently undulating ground the centuries drew up in parade formation and waited for the other components of tribune scauruss command to make their appearance marching at the head of his th century and still wrapped in the grief of rufiuss sudden and violent death marcus was nevertheless aware of a collective melancholy sitting heavily on his men a feeling he was himself quite powerless to resist when the cohorts column halted he stood his men at ease and strolled out in front of them staring hollow eyed up and down the tungrian cohorts line and noting with a sudden pang the absence of rufiuss th century and the stocky figure of his friend out in front of them after a few minutes a column of legionaries began to emerge from the trees their centurions drawing them up in front of the tungrian line and standing them to attention until the cohorts full strength was arrayed across the plain first spear frontinius spoke without taking his eyes off the legion detachments flag the representation of the leaping boar that the th had made its badge over a century before we are honoured the twentieths legatus has given you their first cohort to play with he must have a soft spot for you tribune scaurus nodded watching as the cohorts five centurions walked the lengths of their doublestrength centuries checking their mens line and equipment with an attention to detail that would have done honour to preparation for a triumphal parade through rome he answered his deputys question in a matteroffact tone not taking his eyes off the legion cohorts fluttering detachment banner indeed i believe that postumius avitus macrinus had a good relationship with my sponsor before he left rome to serve in britannia ah here comes their tribune id suggest first spear that you leave the talking to me no matter what the man says this man is the son of a most distinguished family and im not sure that hes going to find this very easy they stood in silence as the detachments tribune walked across the gap between the two cohorts his first spear walking at his shoulder and one pace behind he halted in front of scaurus and nodded brusquely while his senior centurion snapped to attention and stared blankly over scauruss head a man of about twentyfive tribune laenas was of aboveaverage height with black hair and a broad face which unsurprisingly under the circumstances was set in a look of deep dissatisfaction marcus popillius laenas tribune twentieth legion valiant and victorious reporting for duty as ordered scaurus stood in silence holding the younger mans gaze and waiting patiently after a long moments wait laenas raised an eyebrow ah is there something wrong colleague a small matter of military courtesy popillius laenas i fear that it is usual for the officers of a detachment to salute its commander laenas raised both eyebrows with surprise scaurus nodded in confirmation willing his face not to reveal the amusement he was feeling at the look on the other mans face i am your commanding officer popillius laenas and when i gather my officers i expect them all to salute me including you when i give a command i expect the appropriate respect and a speedy response with a salute in short tribune i expect you to behave in a way that recognises our relative ranks while your cohort forms part of my command the young aristocrat stared at him in amazement youre seriously expecting me to salute you but im scaurus nodded raising a hand to forestall the other man yes i know youre a broadstripe tribune and youve only ever saluted your legatus who like you is of the senatorial class and i as we are both only too well aware am an equestrian the broad stripe on your tunic far outweighs the narrow stripe on mine and in any other situation i would be the one deferring to superior rank if i meet you in the street in rome some day then i will be the man showing respect for his social better and i will do so promptly and with all due deference to your rank today however tribune laenas you will have to adjust to the idea of saluting me and you will have to make that adjustment quickly unlike some senior officers of my class i do not intend to ignore the correct disciplines of this military life which we have chosen laenas looked at him for so long that first spear frontinius was convinced he had decided to be deliberately insolent and was tensed for the explosion that he knew such a reaction would elicit from scaurus but to his relief the young tribune simply raised one hand to his forehead a look of bemusement on his face youll have to forgive me tribune im not used to taking orders from anyone below the rank of the legions legatus ill do my best to remember in future scaurus nodded impassively thank you tribune laenas im sure well both soon get used to the idea strange though it may be and this is your first spear i presume yes tribune senior centurion canutius canutius saluted crisply tribune the first cohort of twentieth valiant and victorious is ready for detached duty we have seven hundred and fortythree men fit for he stopped speaking as scaurus raised a hand and pointed at something over laenass shoulder my apologies first spear but i think our detachment from the petriana has arrived the horsemen of the petriana wing were indeed making their appearance each rider leading his horse down through the trees and into the morning sunlight more than a few of the cavalrymen were leading a second horse and as the squadrons began to form up facing end on to the infantry cohorts marcus realised that there were thirty or so empty saddles among the twohundredodd horsemen of his cavalry squadrons frontinius leaned close to his tribunes ear speaking quietly to avoid being overheard thats strange i thought we were being loaned six squadrons i can only see five that and a lot of riderless horses scaurus nodded thoughtfully youre right lets see what tribune licinius has to say on the subject the petrianas commander was the last man out of the forest and he strode briskly across to scaurus with a businesslike air a vaguely familiar decurion walking behind him and leading a magnificent spirited black stallion which jerked at the reins every few seconds its evident desire to be away across the rolling ground at a gallop manifest in every movement his own grey horse was waiting for him at the forests edge along with his personal bodyguard scaurus snapped to attention followed by the three first spears and a second later popillius laenas licinius smiled lopsidedly shaking his head gently theres no need for you to be saluting me tribune were of an equal rank now and youll only go embarrassing me in front of the governor or worse still a legatus he looked around at the three first spears and laenas favouring them with a wintry smile morning gentlemen please do stand at ease while i take your tribune off for a quick chat he took scaurus by the arm and led him a few paces away from the group of his officers stopping to talk once there was no chance of their being overheard i havent got long so well have to make this quick the rest of my command is champing at the bit to go north and get stuck back into those venicone bastards youve probably already worked out that im stretching my orders just a little and giving you five full squadrons and one more consisting of horses whose riders were killed yesterday we had a bit of a time of it im afraid so im assuming that you can spare me from giving you another thirty men by putting some of your own in their saddles im putting my men under the command of decurion felix a young man whos not just an excellent officer but also very well connected if you take my meaning unlike some sons of influence however he insisted on starting his service as a cavalry squadron commander despite the fact that his father could have pulled a few strings and seen him start off as a legion tribune like that fool laenas apparently he wanted to see the life of a soldier from the ground up a position which i find myself forced to respect given the capabilities of a certain legion tribune not far from here he raised an eyebrow at the look on scauruss face and yes i can see you trying to work out where youve seen him before hes the man you rescued from the votadini during the disaster at white strength scaurus nodded oh yes now i remember him he had a barbarian hunting arrow stuck in his armpit less than a fortnight ago as i recall are you really sure hes fit for duty licinius nodded briskly centurion corvuss wifetobe seems to have worked miracles got the bloody thing out without causing any more damage than it had already inflicted on him and im told hell make a full recovery soon enough just give him time for the wound to fully heal and you will find him to be not only an efficient officer but a good fighting man to boot i cant take him back into the fight yet though and i cant spare you anyone thats fully fit so youre both going to have to make the most of it oh and watch out for his horse hes a magnificent animal but hes also an eviltempered bugger and now i must get back to my men before they decide to ride north for revenge without me i wouldnt put it past them either not with the mood they were in last night the best of luck with your mission to liberate the poor old votadini he clapped scaurus on the shoulder and turned away mounting his horse and riding back up the path with his bodyguard in close attendance the tribune turned back to his own men taking the measure of the decurion standing slightly apart from them weve met before i think decurion felix the other man nodded raising his right arm gingerly in a careful salute indeed we have tribune i was lucky enough to be saved from the barbarians by that large german gentleman standing behind you and one of your centurions they found me as good as dead with an arrow sticking out of my armpit and poor old hades here not much better off scaurus nodded youre the man that rode through the barbarian warband during the battle for white strength and lived to tell the tale you must have balls the size of goose eggs the decurion tilted his head to acknowledge the compliment amulius cornelius felix tribune and im gaius rutilius scaurus tribune commanding first and second tungrian cohorts and temporarily appointed to lead this detachment how long is it since you were wounded decurion felix frowned in concentration for a moment fifteen days tribune just over two weeks are you sure that youre fit enough for field duty the cavalryman smiled slightly not really but given another week ill be perfectly fine in the meantime im more than capable of riding and issuing these layabouts with orders and we have another four decurions who can do the running around until i can lift a sword again tribune licinius commends you as a competent officer and tells me that youll be worth the wait he also tells me to keep an eye open for your horse felix smiled easily pulling his mounts head down until it was alongside his own stroking the animals long face affectionately what dear old hades here hes what i suppose might be called a lively character if he were a man the first time i set eyes on him he was busy kicking lumps off another poor horse through a gap in the fence between them and i knew straight away hed be perfect for me just dont get too close to his hindquarters because like any good soldier he doesnt like anybody or anything behind him that he cant see and he kicks like a bolt thrower the tribune also explained why i can see so many empty saddles in your ranks decurion he suggests that i find thirty riders from my three infantry cohorts and group them into a sixth squadron i think i may have an officer with the appropriate skills to lead them but hell need a good doublepay to help him knock them into shape do you have anyone in mind felix smiled easily nodding slightly a man with the tact and diplomacy required for turning infantrymen into cavalrymen oh yes tribune ive got just the man for the job fuck me you lot have got to be pulling my bowstring decurion felixs doublepay man stalked down the line of volunteers with a pained expression shaking his head unhappily tribune scauruss announcement of a requirement for men with riding skills had prompted twenty or so men from each of the tungrian cohorts to step out of the ranks of their centuries ignoring the insults and abuse their fellow soldiers had rained upon them and a similar number of legionaries had volunteered from the st cohort marcus had stayed put with his century until tribune scaurus had taken him to one side and bluntly ordered him to volunteer for one thing those men are going to need an officer and youre probably the only man on the field other than me with anything like proper cavalry training and for another just in case i need to remind you your heroics of yesterday have once again swollen your reputation in the army to the point where the wrong people are going to be asking questions youll be better off out of sight scouting out in front of the main force for a while id say you can take my man arminius with you itll be amusing to see him on a horse again and perhaps hell be of some use to you nodding his understanding with an impassive expression marcus had saluted and walked out to join the group of men nervously waiting to see what being a cavalryman was going to mean to them doublepay man silus gave him an astonished glance before turning back to face the volunteers recomposing his face into the expression of disgust hed been wearing before noticing the centurions unexpected presence cavalrymen most of you lot yourself obviously excepted centurion wouldnt have been judged fit to shovel shit out of the stables when i joined up youre not bloody cavalrymen youre just a shower of footslogging mules and thats all youre good for come on there must be some of you that want to fuck off now and spare me the bother of telling you to bugger off once it becomes clear that youre all bloody useless no he sighed and shook his head with exasperation are you sure about this decurion felix nodded tersely yes doublepay and preferably before the three cohorts standing watching us die of boredom evidently exasperated silus beckoned one of the riders forward from the ranks spoke to him for a moment and then turned back to the volunteers the cavalryman led his horse out of the squadrons ranks and stood waiting the animal bending its neck to crop at the plains lush grass weve got fortyseven of you mules including the officer and that needs to be reduced to the thirtyone men wholl be riding instead of footslogging today since thats all the horses we have spare after yesterdays fighting so heres a simple test all you have to do is get on that horse over there he pointed to the sturdy mount now being held by its rider beside him the horse was fully equipped complete with a fourhorned saddle and a leather chamfron to protect its snout the eyes covered with perforated bronze eye guards shes a docile enough beast so i dont expect shell kick too many of you not unless you climb aboard her like youre trying to take your pork sword to her after a night in the beer shop perhaps youd like to go first centurion and show the rest of your men what were looking for marcus gave silus a long stare holding his gaze until the other man looked away before turning to the mare taking stock of her size and apparent demeanour as he walked over to the animal he took the bridle from her rider and gently pulled the beasts head towards him talking quietly into her ear and stroking her muzzle gently once the animal was apparently comfortable with his presence he took a slow sideways step towards the waiting saddle continuing to stroke her neck talking to the horse in soft tones grasping the saddles projecting front horn he vaulted into the saddle making light of the weight of his armour and turned to address the watching infantrymen soldiers look closely and youll see that im deliberately relaxing on to the saddle here and allowing it to flex under my weight rather than sitting up stiffly im doing that because that allows these saddle horns to grip my thighs and that will keep me astride this horse no matter what i might ask her to do theres another reason for taking a relaxed saddle as well if you can manage it apart from the benefit of actually staying on the horse if you try to sit up for any sort of time your legs will start to hurt more than you can imagine save all that standing up in the saddle stuff for the first time we see some fighting the mare stood quietly then allowed herself to be encouraged into a sprightly trot around a tight circle before the young centurion swung his leg back over its back and dropped neatly to the ground doublepay silus nodded his reluctant respect his mouth twisted into a tight smile very good centurion its nice to see an officer that understands horses youve got a lovely loose seat and your mount and dismount were as good as any soldier in the petriana wing could have managed id like to see you handle a spear up there mind you but youll do for today now lets have another one of you mules up here and see what youre made marcuss voice rode over his instructions harsh enough to raise decurion felixs eyebrow a word doublepay silus walked across to where marcus was waiting for him a wary look on his face centurion come and look at this marcus took his arm and led him around to the horses far side pointing to the shoulder straps there to disguise his true purpose from the watching soldiery these men standing around us doublepay are tungrians the cavalryman frowned unclear as to this unknown officers purpose but unnerved by the harsh tone of his voice sir marcus sighed shaking his head slightly as i thought you havent got a clue what youre dealing with allow me to educate you you will remember if youve been with the petriana for any length of time the battle of lost eagle he raised an eyebrow waiting for the other mans response which was still bullish despite a slight uncertainty in his voice unclear of where this strange and apparently cavalrytrained officer was taking the discussion it would be hard to forget centurion we took hundreds of bluenose heads that day once the fuckers broke and ran it was bloody wonderful he flinched as marcus interrupted him again his eyes wide with barely restrained anger and do you remember doublepay sitting on your big fat arse and watching some bunch of dozy mules hold off those bluenoses for an hour or so before they broke and ran and you big brave horsemen decided to actually take part in the battle the other mans face took on a nervous look with the sudden hostility in marcuss voice thats a bit unfair centurion we not from where my men were standing the cavalryman flinched at the anger in marcuss voice decurion felix standing a dozen paces from them heard his fellow officers angry tones and smiled slightly taking a sudden interest in the hilt of his spatha we fought ten times our strength in barbarians to a standstill that afternoon while the petriana sat and did nothing to aid us the tungrian soldiers standing around you doublepay spilled blood and lost friends that afternoon while you sat and waited for us to send them running for you to chase down you all rode back from that hunt with heads by the halfdozen but my men were too tired too damned numb to take their swords to the corpses of the men theyd killed every one of these men has been blooded doublepay and stared into the eyes of men that could have been their brothers as they died on our iron theyve seen more fighting in the last few months than is good for them id say or good for anyone else that tries to play the fool with them if your intention here is to humiliate them because they cant vault into the saddle like a man thats been practising the trick for the last year id advise you to consider what a man thats been humiliated and who has no concern for the consequences of taking revenge for a slight might consider doing to you once night has fallen across tonights camp silus swallowed nervously without even being aware of it i see your point centurion perhaps i could marcus nodded his disgust evident in the curl of his lip yes perhaps you could doublepay he gestured to the waiting infantrymen after you the cavalryman gave his decurion a swift glance finding little in cornelius felixs face to encourage him he coughed groping for the right reaction the words spilling out a fraction too quickly for any of the men gathered around him to be fooled i think youre right centurion that strap does appear to be worn ill have the saddler replace it once we rejoin the rest of the wing marcus nodded magnanimously quite so doublepay and now you were saying time for my fellow infantrymen to take their turn displaying the cavalry mount silus shook his head decisively i dont think they can be expected to perform to that standard centurion a hand up into the saddle i think and a quick trot round thatll be enough to show me what theyve got marcus nodded shooting a quick glance at cornelius felix to find the decurion indicating his own approval a hint of a smile on his face he turned back to the volunteers taking stock of the men from his own cohort who had stepped forward looking for the chance to become cavalrymen lurking among them was a familiar figure and while silus took the next man out in front of the group to try his hand with the waiting horse marcus strode into the group tapping the man on the shoulder and pulling him to one side scarface i didnt know you could ride in fact if i didnt know better id say you were determined never to let me out of your sight no matter what you have to put yourself through can you even get up on a horse without falling over the other side and breaking your neck the soldier blushed but stuck his chest out in response to the challenge i was born on a farm centurion i learned to ride young and youre not going to go charging around the hills with this shower of donkey wallopers without one of us to keep an eye out for you us the soldier blushed a deeper shade of red his eyes narrowing with something close to but not quite righteous anger youve been a bit of a wild one ever since you joined the cohort centurion all summer youve been running from one fight to the next and never a thought for your men or for the pretty girl thats waiting for you at noisy valley all the lads that matter in the ninth century think youve a death wish and weve decided to keep you alive until winter at least and im the only one that can ride he stopped talking having realised that marcus was looking over his shoulder a wry smile creasing his face perhaps you are scarface and perhaps youre not the soldier turned to find qadir standing behind him marcus raised an eyebrow and are you another one of us qadir the hamian shook his head giving scarface a disgusted look well done then soldier youre alone with the centurion for a moment and it seems that youve already spilled the beans to him go and climb on that horse and leave us to talk red faced and abashed the soldier slunk away to take his place in the queue to mount the longsuffering mare while marcus gave his deputy a puzzled frown so how do you get to walk away from the ninth so easily given their lack of an officer qadir shrugged i just told the tribune what i can do on a horse he thought it would be a good idea if i were riding alongside you so he gave morban my stick to poke in the soldiers backs for a while and your trumpeter gets to polish morbans standard twice a day and just what can you do on a horse qadir smiled and marcus caught a brief glimpse of a relaxed confidence he hadnt seen in the mans demeanour at any point in the weeks they had spent together since their first meeting in the port of arab town i have some small skill in the saddle i something behind marcus caught the hamians eye and his jaw dropped fractionally oh deasura thats not a sight youll see every day marcus turned and stifled a laugh in the face of an irascible german sitting uncomfortably on the now distinctly unhappylooking cavalry horse he walked around the mare his face alive with the first smile since rufiuss death well arminius i cant say youre the most natural horseman ive ever seen arminius sneered down at the men standing around him then leaned out of the saddle and put a sausagesized finger in doublepay siluss face just so were clear i hate horses tribune scaurus says i ride like a mule tender with bleeding piles and that i have all the skill in the saddle of a sack full of shit and despite that before you open your mouth im one of your thirtyone horsemen and thats official you dont like it i dont like it but the tribune couldnt give a toss what either of us think wherever centurion corvus goes i go so there it is he climbed down from the horse and clenched both of his massive fists scowling around him and anyone that finds that funny had better be ready for an unscheduled sleep doublepay silus looked at him thoughtfully then beckoned his payandahalf across to join him see that he pointed at the german and the other man nodded with pursed lips what have we got thatll carry him thirty miles in a day without breaking down inside a week south of the wall in a copse overlooking the sailors town fort centurion rapax and his colleague excingus were exchanging uneasy glances the fort was silent without any movement and rapax had been watching its walls intently for long enough to be sure it was deserted excingus fished out his pocket tablet once again checking their route against the directions hed been given in yew grove two days before north from waterfall town ten miles across the river dam and then another nine miles north up the road to vintners way then carry on to sailors town he paused giving the silent fort another long searching stare well thats bloody sailors town right enough and it looks just as dead as the first two ghost towns weve ridden past this morning i say we push on and get to this noisy valley place soonest rapax spat on the copses dry earth that centurion you got the directions from was close to soiling himself and there he was with half a cohort between his precious skin and the local thrill seekers he had no patrols out looking for information so he had no idea of what might have happened up this way in the last few days i didnt like the last place but we were close enough to friendly forces for the locals to be keeping a low profile here on the other hand excingus nodded and stared across the three hundred paces that separated copse and fort were too far out to see whats in there perhaps we should get a little closer his colleague shook his head decisively sniffing the air smell that its faint but were downwind from the fort thats the smell of rotting meat old son once youve had a noseful of that reek you never forget it that forts full of nothing but corpses and flies and the tribesmen are out there somewhere lurking close to the road and waiting for some more soldiers to blunder into their trap we can only guess what the men who were manning the place went through before they died but i dont intend sharing their fate well go round it my friend and give the barbarians plenty of chance to show themselves the small party mounted their horses and walked them carefully and quietly round to the forts east putting the higher ground between it and them to mask their movements from any watchers in the fort as much as possible only when the fort was completely out of sight was rapax willing to allow them to return to the road and even then it was clear he was still reluctant he gathered his men about him looking hard into each mans eyes as he spoke as if weighing them for their ability to deal with the pressure they were all feeling there are fifteen of us if we bump into anything more than a couple of dozen of them well have no option but to run away from them as fast as these horses will carry us he cast a dark glace around his tent party and any of you that decide that keeping your skin intact might best be achieved by outpacing the rest of us had better be ready to see the colour of your guts when i catch up with you right then march i should have known that wed end up with nothing better to do than exercise these animals and scratch our backsides with the boredom the makeshift cavalry squadron had ridden to the south and east patrolling the empty rolling landscape under doublepay siluss critical eye each of the soldiers was getting to know the horse with which he had been paired as they trotted easily across the rolling ground well to the south of the hills over which the remainder of the petriana wing were pursuing the venicones the detachments other squadrons had been thrown along the edge of the range sweeping the margins of the forests that covered its margins for stray tribesmen but the trainees were restricted to more sedate duty as they got to know their horses marcus was riding a big rangy grey which seemed steady enough although qadir had already confided to his friend that he had overheard the doublepay referring to the animal as bonehead for qadirs part silus had taken one look at his riding style and pointed him at a finelimbed and wellmuscled chestnut mare ive been holding that one back in the expectation of not finding anyone capable of getting the best out of her but id say youre probably matched see what you make of her horse and rider made a fine combination and the mare seemed to ripple with power whenever qadir applied the slightest encouragement so youre not just a skilled archer but an accomplished horseman to boot the hamian bowed his head at marcuss assessment of his skills i havent ridden a horse this well bred for nearly ten years and so i am a little rusty i suppose it will all come back to me soon enough marcus grinned across at his friend raising an inquisitive eyebrow yes but what is it thats coming back eh chosen where exactly i wonder did you learn to ride like a parthian qadir shrugged dismissively my family had a little money and my father considered horsemanship the prime virtue of any mans life and so it was that i was trained from a very early age to ride with all the skill of the desert arabs he paid to teach me they taught me all the tricks they knew and drilled me in the use of the bow from the back of a horse until i was their equal until today i had more or less forgotten that time or perhaps pushed it to the back of my mind to avoid dwelling upon its loss marcuss grey pricked his ears up and raised his head without any change in his pace suddenly alert despite the lack of any obvious cause for reaction the animals head swivelling to left and right as he searched the ground in front of them for whatever it was that had caught his attention with an explosion of movement less than a hundred paces from the two horsemen a deer broke cover sprinting away from them and eliciting an uncompromising response from marcuss mount the big horse pinned back his ears and went from their easy trot to a full gallop in half a dozen strides almost throwing marcus from his saddle with the speed of his reaction regaining his seat the centurion decided to let the animal run enjoying the unaccustomed sensation of his mounts raw speed looking back over his shoulder he saw that qadir despite the fact that he had been caught by surprise by the horses sudden charge was crouched over his own horses back as the chestnut mare swiftly gathered pace supremely confident in his ability to stay in the saddle the hamian dropped his mounts reins and pulled his bow loose from the leather carrying case across his shoulder reaching for an arrow as the chestnut started to catch marcuss grey eyes narrowed as he calculated the distance to the fleeing deer farther back the doublepay and his deputy were also riding hard in pursuit the rest of the newly formed squadron looking on with expressions of either amusement or amazement marcus tightened his grip on his spear putting his heels into the greys ribs to encourage the horse to greater efforts and touching the reins to guide him around a small copse of a dozen or so stunted trees as he flashed past the thicket he glanced into the trees his gaze momentarily catching a flash of red in the greens and browns of the undergrowth and with a sudden hard tug at the greys reins he turned the horse sharply pulling his shield from its place on the horses left flank and readying his spear to stab into the foliage with a desperate shout a tribesman pushed his way out of the trees bellowing his defiance and brandishing his sword at horse and rider but the grey was seemingly as keen for the fight as he was for the chase ignoring both the barbarians noise and his blade as he pushed in towards the new threat turning slightly to the right without any conscious effort on marcuss behalf the horses move both presented his riders shield and opened the angle for his spear as marcus punched the weapon forward and down sinking its heavy iron head deep into the tribesmans neck the spears razoredged blade sliced open the warriors throat and he fell back from the challenge choking on his own blood pulling the greys head farther round to the right keeping the shield between him and the trees marcus walked the animal along the treeline searching for any sign that other tribesmen were lurking in the shadows without warning five men burst from the copse and ran from the horsemen most of them clearly wounded from the previous days fighting and incapable of much more than a limping shuffle marcus shook his head in disbelief turning to follow them at little more than a trot and raising his weapon to strike again slamming his spears iron head squarely into the rearmost mans spine and shunting him forward half a dozen paces before heaving the weapon free and dumping him to the ground an arrow whistled past his head with a foot or so to spare dropping one of the faster runners in a confusion of limbs as the fallen tribesman arched his back and scrabbled for the arrows shaft a moment later qadir loosed another missile and a second warrior staggered forward and down on to his knees with an arrowhead lodged deep in the square of his back the last two barbarians stopped and turned to face their pursuers with their swords drawn one of them barely able to stand from a roughly bandaged leg wound the other a tall powerful warrior raising his sword and stepping forward to protect his comrade marcus cantered the grey past them outside the reach of their weapons reaching round to stab his spears bloodied blade into the wounded mans chest and dropping him to his knees in grunting agony the last warrior raised his sword in futile defiance and qadir put one last arrow to his bow drawing the missile back in readiness for the splitsecond flight that would bury its evil threebladed iron head in the barbarians chest marcus looked back at the man and at the last possible moment realised that there was something familiar in the barbarians stance as he prepared to fight and die qadir alive the big hamian stopped in midshot not yet taking the tension off the arrow poised to fly from his bow and marcus trotted his horse back to within a few paces of the defiant warrior aligning his spears goreslathered blade with the barbarians chest the tribesman stood his ground his sword held in both hands ready to swing if the roman came within reach but his face spoke of desperate exhaustion rather than any eagerness to fight marcus peered hard at his face nodding slightly as if some suspicion were confirmed by closer scrutiny surrender to me now and youll get fair treatment lift that sword to me and ill put you down with a wound like his he pointed the spear at the fallen man panting for breath on the ground next to the barbarian and if you wait here for much longer therell be another half dozen or more of us all looking for a head to take and only you on your feet decide now the warrior closed his eyes and raised his head to the sky then dropped the sword to the ground and slumped to his knees just as doublepay silus galloped his horse round the copse and pulled up alongside marcus levelling his spear at the defenceless warrior well done centurion do you need a hand sending this big bugger to meet his ancestors marcus shook his head pointing at the corpses and dying men scattered around them his voice hard with authority if you want a head to decorate your saddle take any one of those that takes your fancy neither my comrade here nor i have any appetite for the practice but this one doublepay is mine he dismounted as the remainder of the squadron cantered up stepping carefully up to the barbarian picking up the mans sword and passing it to qadir to remove any temptation for renewed resistance his captive looked up from his kneeling position glancing around at the hostile men crowding in to see their centurions captive speaking in rough latin without any sign of fear so what you do now torture and then knife marcus shrugged keeping his eyes on the other man and his hand on the ornate eagle pommel of his gladius theres no need for me to torture you all i want is for you to tell me your story since the last time we met and if you do that with honesty then i will release you unharmed centurion i think wed be best marcus spoke without turning away from the captured briton who was now regarding his captor with a puzzled look no doublepay this is not negotiable if this man tells us what has happened to him in the very few weeks since he and i last met and if i believe that hes telling the truth then he walks free i suggest that you carry on with our patrol and i will stay here long enough to hear him out ill keep a few men with me for safety though because i know from recent experience that hes a fighter my men qadir scarface and arminius ought to be more than enough there was a moments silence from the man behind him and marcus found himself fighting a powerful urge to turn and pull the doublepay down from his horse his blood still boiling from both the brief fight and the lingering frustrated rage left by the previous days dreadful events his right fist clenched so hard that he could feel the nails biting into the skin of his palm and looking up from his captive he found arminius perched atop his new mount colossus shaking his head minutely his eyes slitted in silent warning siluss response when he spoke again was bleak and marcus had no need to turn around to know that his new subordinate would be white with anger at being put down so hard very well sir well leave the wounded to you though thats the way the petriana works if you wound a man then you finish that man squadron follow me marcus waited until the squadron was halfway to the horizon before speaking again so briton before we talk will you send your fallen brothers to their gods or will you allow a roman to do the job for you the big man stirred himself standing to face his captor and looming over the roman arminius dismounted from the huge horse that silus had allocated to him and took a pace from its side while keeping a grip on its reins putting his muscular bulk close enough that the tribesman would be dissuaded from any attempt at violence but the look he got from the briton almost a head taller than the german was anything but intimidated i have no weapon marcus shrugged taking the long sword back from qadir and holding its hilt out to the barbarian then use this and dont forget that my colleague here could put three arrows in your back before you could run a hundred paces the warrior took the weapon without comment turning away to the man lying alongside him now deathly pale and hovering on the edge of consciousness with his eyes staring glassily at the sky he put the swords point on to the dying warriors chest then turned back to marcus with the weapon poised for the kill this man was brother i ask favour of coin marcus fished a sestertius from the pouch on his belt and handed it over without comment the barbarian bent and slipped the coin into his comrades mouth patting the dying mans face and muttering a few quiet words then stood again quickly pushing the point into his chest to stop his heart he turned away from the corpse with tears in his eyes glancing around him at the dead and wounded men scattered around them marcus nodded gesturing for him to continue well wait here while you give them dignity the tribesman nodded to marcus and turned away to the remainder of his fallen comrades he worked quickly and efficiently using the sword where he found that the sprawled bodies were not yet dead and returned to the waiting soldiers once the task was complete handing the sword back to marcus the centurion took the weapon from him pushing its blade deep into the turf beside him and gesturing for the briton to sit folding himself down on to the grass at the same time so briton am i right in thinking that we know each other the giant nodded turning his arm over to reveal a c branded into his flesh with a line scored through the letter overlaying the original brand the th legions bull emblem burned in below the marks yes remember you marcus nodded and of the other three men surrounding them only scarface showed any sign of understanding his centurions meaning this is the barbarian slave that fought with us to take the fort marcus put out his hand your name is lugos as i recall the briton looked at the offered hand for a moment before taking it in a firm grasp yes i lugos marcus turned to qadir and arminius both of whom looked baffled and curious in equal measures lugos was captured after the battle of lost eagle and put to work carrying the ram that battered down the gates of a carvetii fort we were tasked to take a few weeks ago once we were through the gates the slaves were freed to run wild and distract the defenders and a few of us including lugos here scarface bridled and me and this particularly insubordinate soldier managed to fight our way through the forts defences and finish the fight quickly and cleanly after which he was clearly rewarded by the sixth legion with release from his captivity and told to go home but what happened after that the briton shrugged his shoulders no escape war try go home but calgus men find make join warband i find brother we fight together when legion attack brother wounded we run with many men when dark come we escape hide in trees then you come and i killed him marcus closed his eyes shaking his head at the situations grim irony lugos stood in silence and stared wet eyed at the ground his body sagging as the determination that had driven his efforts of the last few days seeped away and left only the numb reality of the corpse on the ground beside him the young centurion took a deep breath then turned back to face the stricken barbarian i cannot apologise for killing your brother lugos nor can i regret the fact that i fulfilled my role in pursuing your group to destruction no matter how painful that might be to you all i can do is to wish that it might have been different that fate had not brought us back together in such a cruel manner and keep the bargain i struck with you lugos lifted his gaze and looked at him again his eyes still red so briton tell me of your last day what have you seen since the legions brought the fire to calguss camp in the forest the briton spoke for several minutes and when he fell silent again marcus nodded his head slowly looking at arminius and finding his face equally troubled youre sure about this this man harn was leading the warband east when you slipped away from them not heading for the north yes go to alauna harn say plenty food there soldiers be gone and that didnt tempt you lugos shook his head with absolute certainty alauna holy place alauna mean shrine my speak harn take warriors to alauna he insult great goddess bring death to he and his sons sons yes sons they march with harn arminius shrugged its not unusual i was only twelve summers when first my father and his brothers took me to war it is in such company that a boy grows to manhood before his time lugus nodded his agreement good sons strong and tall make fine warriors yes marcus stared bleakly to the east if they live that long i dont know about you but those hills scare the shit out of me the legionary spat over the wall that ran above the noisy valley fortresss south gate staring bleakly out at the hills that sloped down to the banks of the river tinea as it swept past their walls cold and dark in its course from the mountains to the sea as hostile as any ground they had fought over to the north of the wall in the last six months his fellow soldier nodded dourly turning his head to take the late afternoons winddriven drizzle on the side of his helmet rather than straight into his face not surprising given what happened to those poor bastards in the third century fuck knows what the tribune was thinking of when he sent them south it was a common theme in their desultory timekilling conversations as the cohorts men patrolled their walls and worried about their immediate futures a patrol in force had been sent out into the brigantian countryside to the south of the river in the first days of this fresh rebellion with orders from tribune paulus to march the ten miles to sailors town they had been intended to strengthen the small garrison that had been left to hold the remote fort when the rest of the cohort based there had marched north to join the fight with calgus it was a needless and stupid risk the legionaries guarding the south gate had told each other as the cohorts rd century had marched out grim faced to confront the rebellion on its own ground every legionary in the fortress agreed that the bloody auxiliaries should have been left to look out for themselves even the rd centurys centurion had seemed to share their opinion of his orders to make contact with the isolated garrison on the long road south to the legions fortress at elm grove as he had pulled on his helmet for the march itself a rarity in that under normal circumstances it would have been carried across his chest until needed he had confided to the duty centurion of the guard that he entertained small hopes of reaching the fort without trouble less than five hours later the rd century or rather what was left of it had struggled back through the gates in bloody disarray those poor bastards looked like they didnt have another step in them and that was the ones that hadnt stopped arrows or spears the centurys watch officer a stocky soldier with fifteen years service called titus the only surviving man of any rank had sat shivering in the warmth of tribune pauluss office in his bloodspattered armour eyes still pinned wide by shock and had told a story that had chilled the blood of the senior officer sitting opposite in his crisp tunic they came out of the trees on both sides of the road two or three hundred of them they went for the centurion like a pack of dogs and they had the chosen man on his back a moment later the front half of the century was chopped to mince and the rear rank broke and ran i tried to stop them but it was useless they ran like children last thing i saw was the fucking bluenoses waving the centurions head around bastards tribune paulus had been uncertain whether the watch officer had intended the epithet for the barbarians or his own men although the look that the man gave him as he was dismissed made him wonder whether there might have been a third target for the other mans ire the legionary spat over the wall again shaking his head and scowling out at the grey hills looming across the valley we can only hope that the idiots realised theres no way to get through to the south whoever the vardulli cohort left minding the shop at sailors town is already on a stake or else in some very nasty shit indeed and we can only hope that the bloody bluenoses decide that were too tough a nut he stopped squinting out into the afternoons gloom hang on can you see what i can see the other man followed his pointing hand horsemen crossing the bridge the riders were pushing their mounts hard no more than a dozen of them where the soldiers guarding the fortresss walls would have sworn nothing less than a cavalry wing could have made it through the sea of hostile tribesmen blocking the road from the south the legionary shouted down to the men guarding the gate below him call out the centurion theres riders coming in the centurys full strength poured out into the street spears and shields forming a hasty wall across the narrow gap between the buildings to either side while their centurion stalked forward with his sword drawn and bawled an order for the mansized wicket gate to be opened he peered through the gap into the drizzle as the small party reined in their horses ten paces from the wall sizing up the men astride their exhausted horses and seeing uniforms that were clearly roman but yet not familiar two of the riders were wounded one grimacing at the pain of an arrow protruding from his thigh the other man only still on his horse because another soldier was holding him up a slow dribble of blood running from a deep wound on his right forearm to drip from his hand all of them looked at the end of their endurance two of the riders wore the crosscrested helmets that were the mark of a centurion but in a province gone wild with bloodlust and with an unknown number of soldiers dead in the land south of the wall that meant little enough to a man entrusted with the security of a legions supply base who the fuck are you i see uniforms that i dont recognise and two officers helmets in a group of a dozen men and that dont add up quickly now the darker faced of the two centurions jumped down from his saddle and stalked forward his face set in disdain stopping so close to the legion centurion that the brow pieces of their helmets were nearly touching he fixed hard eyes on the other man and when he spoke his harsh growl set the duty officers nerves jangling who we are has nothing to do with you centurion i am a praetorian guard officer and my colleague here is from the camp of the foreigners in rome weve ridden fifteen hundred miles in less than a month and fought our way through a barbarian ambush that took two of my men and wounded two more so if that gate isnt open very fucking quickly ill have you as a replacement for one of the men ive lost today he lowered his voice an octave and fixed the legion centurion with a gaze of such malevolence that it momentarily rooted the man to the spot your rank centurion will be that of soldier and i will take full advantage of that rank would you like to test out that promise the centurion was turning away to order the gates open before the last words had left the praetorians mouth his face suddenly pale at their implication his mind was still reeling ten minutes later as he escorted the pair to the tribunes office and happily took his leave of them gentlemen the tribune was of the equestrian class and if not quite as supremely selfconfident as the legions senatorial broadstripe tribune he had enough breeding and military experience to feel himself more than capable of managing any situation he might find put in front of him he took his seat behind the desk indicating that the two men should do the same they sat both men placing their swords across their knees their wet armour dropping spots of water on the immaculately polished wooden floor the burly praetorian took the lead his voice rasping out in the offices quiet greetings tribune im quintus sestius rapax centurion praetorian guard and this is my colleague tiberius varius excingus centurion from the camp of the foreigners the praetorian paused for a moment watching the tribunes face intently sure enough the mans eyebrows twitched upwards minutely and while rapax could find some respect for the mans almost complete control over his reaction to the identity of his travelling companion he knew at that second that they had his measure im sextus pedius paulus tribune sixth imperial legion and commanding officer here what brings a praetorian and a corn officer to noisy valley surely youd have been better waiting until this local rebellion burned out before risking the north road i hear you have lost men to an encounter with the rebels rapax shrugged dismissing his losses as a regrettable necessity we have travelled here from the imperial palace tribune without pause for anything other than snatched meals and a few hours sleep each night changing horses several times a day at the courier stables to cover as much distance as possible that will give you some understanding of the urgency of our mission and the reason why we pressed on at the cost of two good men killed by those barbarian bastards we carry authorisation to command the support and assistance of any man in the empire should we have the need to do so he paused to hand over a message scroll embossed with the imperial seal and our mission tribune is to one moment centurion the tribune held up a hand to silence the praetorian whose eyes narrowed at the interruption scanning the scroll as he unrolled it he frowned staring hard at the name written at the bottom of the document this order is signed by the praetorian prefect the emperors name is nowhere to be seen other than where the writer states that the emperor commands all true and loyal subjects to provide whatever service may be required by centurions rapax and excingus either together or individually he waved the scroll at the praetorian with a puzzled frown how is this an imperial decree excingus spoke for the first time and rapax sat back with a quiet smile as his colleague shook his head dismissively his soft voice dismissing the objection without any hint of concern youve been away from rome for a good while tribune i guessed as much during your absence tribune my colleagues noble prefect sextus tigidius perennis has risen far in the estimation of our glorious emperor the prefects colleague coprefect of the guard publius tarrutenius paternus has been executed for the crime of procuring the murder of the emperors closest friend palace chamberlain saoterus not only has prefect perennis been granted sole command of the praetorian guard as a result but he has also been granted responsibility for far more than just safeguarding the imperial family the prefect now conducts a substantial part of the thrones affairs in order to free the emperor for more important matters as the emperors right hand therefore the prefect has both the right and the duty to pursue the thrones enemies no matter where they may seek to take shelter from his masters divine vengeance it is the prefects strong expectation that any man of integrity and loyalty to the throne will provide my colleague here with any assistance he might need but he asked me to accompany centurion rapax as a means of ensuring that help under any circumstance you will im sure be aware of the special trust reposed in the camp of the foreigners by every emperor since the divine hadrian himself turned the corn officers to his service tribune paulus sat back in his chair taking fresh stock of the two men facing him a praetorian centurion with the looks of a killer and an imperial spy more than happy to lean on the unnerving reputation of his office to get whatever he wanted and both of them it seemed operating under the authority of a man known to be gathering power at a fearsome rate he thought quickly calculating how far he might push any resistance before making a target of himself ive heard of pairings such as yours before gentlemen and to be frank the example thats been set hasnt been a good one what guarantee do i have that youll exercise your powers with appropriate responsibility rapax stared back at him with a look that sent a shiver up the tribunes back his hoarse voice flatly uncompromising theres nothing to fear from us tribune once weve tracked down this traitor well do our business quickly and quietly and return to rome to inform my prefect that justice has been done and seen to be done centurion the praetorian shrugged anyone thats been sheltering the fugitive can expect to suffer imperial justice thats inevitable but we understand the value of restraint after all youre fighting a war here and we wouldnt want to impede your efforts to put this barbarian scum back in their place the tribune nodded quickly and quietly then and no excessive punishment of any officers who might have been deceived by this man aquila excingus nodded firmly i think we understand each other tribune in return for your assistance well make sure that justice is served without a lot of unhelpful excitement tribune paulus nodded and shifted his weight forward in the chair putting his hands on the desk in readiness to stand but neither of the men facing him showed any sign of getting to their feet excingus frowned slightly raising a hand to forestall paulus there is just one more thing tribune hearing your name just now i was reminded of something i was told shortly before i left rome paulus nodded politely and sat back feeling sudden discomfort with this new and apparently spontaneous line of discussion yes it was the day before we left the city a former tribune of the sixth legion was found with his throat slit apparently by his own hand the bodies of his wife child and closest relatives were found in the house with him all dead from stab wounds the assumption is that he must have lost his mind as a result of his experiences here in britannia and run amok with a dagger before using it to take his own life a terrible shame the child was less than two years old and his wife was such a pretty little thing before he took his knife to her i believe his name was quirinius he made a show of consulting his tablet ah yes tiberius sulpicius quirinius he was a senator since his father had killed himself only a few weeks before seems it ran in the family paulus stared at the two men with a growing sense of horror both at the news they bore and its implications excingus continued his expression suddenly almost predatory senator quirinius left a journal of sorts in which he made several interesting statements regarding his experiences in britannia the most startling of these was his professed knowledge of exactly who killed tribune titus tigidius perennis he waited for paulus to react stringing the silence out until the tribune had no option but to fill it but perennis died in battle he was excingus shook his head firmly and thats what his father believed until senator quiriniuss journal came to light it seems that far from dying at the hands of the barbarians dying honourably with blood on his sword the prefects son was murdered by a roman the missing son of senator aquila seems to have made his way to britannia in an attempt to avoid his fate and tribune perennis in turn seems to have managed to find him we believe that aquila must have killed him in order to maintain the secrecy around his hiding place here on the frontier paulus pursed his lips and looked baffled who would have harboured a known fugitive that would be a death sentence excingus nodded agreement and not just for anyone foolish enough to protect the fugitive anyone else that became aware of his presence and failed to report it to the relevant authorities would carry the same burden of guilt and the same punishment he fixed paulus with a hard stare and his tone become accusatory as he continued the thing is tribune that senator quiriniuss journal was quite adamant about two closely related facts the first was that he had been told who it was that had killed your colleague perennis the second was that it was you who had shared that knowledge with him apparently while you were under the influence of drink one night after the battle in which your legion was stripped of its eagle and half its fighting strength the battle in which the prefects son died in fact paulus sat back in his chair his face pale with shock i told him yes i told him that a centurion serving with an auxiliary cohort attached to our legion was reputed to have killed the tribune before the battle and that centurion was the fugitive aquila paulus shook his head his face blank i genuinely couldnt say centurion he was just another auxiliary centurion to me from which cohort the first tungrian as i recall it and how did you know that this centurion was in fact the tribunes killer paulus looked up a hard edge coming into his voice if i tell you that how am i to be sure you wont take your threats to another good man excingus smiled evenly that depends on you tribune there may be no need to involve anyone else in this as long as my colleague here and i know where to go hunting for this fugitive of course ill interrogate my way through this entire province if im forced to do so but itll cost me time i badly need to avoid wasting time in which the fugitive might be running for another hiding place i should add that it would go badly for you too in that case and you have a large family in hispania i believe the tribunes face hardened and his knuckles whitened against the dark wood of his desk rapax slid a hand to the hilt of his dagger his body tensing after a moment paulus slumped slightly in his chair the fight seeming to go out of him as the consequences of any rash action sank in very well i have no option but to take you at your word that youll go after this aquila rather than carving a bloody path through a body of loyal soldiers he sighed closing his eyes in resignation as he spoke a man ive known since childhood is serving as an officer with another auxiliary cohort he pointed the centurion out to me during the battles aftermath the tungrians had held off ten times their strength for longer than wed have ever thought possible buying time for the other legions to reach the battlefield naturally we wanted to have a look at the damage theyd done to the warband so we walked up the hill over a carpet of bodies so thick that they were two and three deep at the point where the two lines had clashed there were officers from half a dozen units standing around and marvelling at the scale of the slaughter and that the tungrians had survived such an onslaught and the smell he shook his head slightly at the memory of the reek of blood and faeces that had permeated his clothes for days afterwards one of the tungrian centurions walked past covered in blood and wide eyed with the strain of what his cohort had endured and i commented to my friend the decurion that he had two swords strapped to his belt thats when he told me that hed seen the same man earlier that day standing over the body of tribune perennis excingus raised an eyebrow and thats all he told you none of the grisly details paulus laughed without mirth oh i tried to get them out of him all right i might not have liked perennis very much but he was still a roman tribune and my colleague my friend just smiled at me and told me that the less i knew the safer it would be for me it seems wed both have been better off if id never heard any of it excingus nodded a glint of triumph in his eyes yes and better still for your colleague quirinius given that he couldnt keep his mouth shut and now tribune ill trouble you for that one last piece of information itll be hard for you to give it to me but itll go harder on you and yours if you keep it from me who was this friend of yours exactly out on the hills to the north of the wall the venicones had restarted their long march to their homeland at first light by midmorning their pace across the barren hillsides was little better than a walk despite the likelihood that the roman cavalry would find them and recommence the deadly game that had played out the previous day many of drusts men had not eaten anything since the previous morning the day had dawned bright and clear and was now warm enough to make the marching barbarians sweat heavily in the absence of any breeze to cool their labouring bodies come on my lads well all just have to keep marching if were going to avoid being speared by those horseshagging bastards another few miles will see us safe the venicone kings voice was hoarse with bellowing his commands but there was still a hard edge to his shouted encouragement that compelled calgus to open his legs and stride out despite his own experience in the art of cajoling his own men to greater efforts he had watched drust fighting off the roman cavalry the previous day pulling a horseman from his mounts back with his war hammers spike and cutting the stunned horsemans throat with a hunting knife the size of a short sword before he could recover from the fall putting his head back in a savage howl of triumph as the soldier had spasmed out his death throes at his feet more than once he had led the brief attacks that had punished those riders who had ridden too close to the warband swinging his heavy polearm to fell their horses and leave the romans easy meat for the men of his bodyguard clustered about him even the discovery that his body slave was missing along with the gold torc that was the kings badge of authority had failed to put the man off his stride although for all of drusts bravado calgus doubted that the loss was anything like as trivial as the venicone was making out smiling wryly at his own acceptance of the need for pragmatism in defeat when less than a week before he had been the leader of ten thousand warriors and on the verge of a victory to upset the balance of power across the entire province calgus put his head back and dragged down a lungful of air into his burning chest forcing his feet to even greater speed despite the burning pains in his legs from the previous days exertions are you enjoying this yet calgus he glanced wearily sideways to find that the venicone king had fallen in alongside him a grim smile on his face as he regarded his captives gritted teeth its a long time since you walked so far or so fast id imagine i could always lend you a blade of course and let you make a run for it we cant be all that far from your own land so you might make it to safety calgus snorted waving a hand at the treeless hills across which the warband was making its laboured progress you know as well as i do that their cavalry will be close at hand now trotting happily along the trail were leaving with their spears ready for use one man alone in country this open wouldnt last any time at all he coughed and spat phlegm on to the thin grass at his feet and drust laughed this little march is doing you wonders calgus were working you harder than youve managed in years and to think you could have been no more than a head on a pole by now if not for the venicones calgus shook his head in disbelief i imagine youre still planning to see me decorating some romans spear unless by some good fortune they get to you first so where are you taking me my most unwelcome host drust leaned towards him conspiratorially looking round to ensure that his people were all sufficiently engrossed in their own struggle to keep moving before speaking his voice lowered to avoid it carrying you know what calgus i dont have the first idea were in the middle of nowhere in land ive not trodden before in my life with a pack of roman cavalrymen on our tail and nowhere to seek shelter from them all i can do is keep my people moving and hope that well reach some feature that we can defend against the romans before they find some means of bringing us to bay on ground that suits them the rebellions former leader nodded lowering his own voice in turn well i know where we are drust and i know where we need to go if you want a chance to hold these bastards at arms length for long enough that theyll lose interest in a tired shout of warning sounded from the rear of the column and both men craned their necks to stare back down the wide track of flattened grass the warband was leaving in its wake a body of horsemen had crested the rise over which the venicones had laboured less than half an hour before no more than a thousand paces behind them drust spat on to the ground hefting his hammer which calgus noted still had a few hairs clinging to its flat face it was too good to last ill leave you to contemplate your fate and how you might want to buy yourself a little extra time rather than dying out here on their spears while i make sure that our rearguard have their wits about them tribune licinius had ridden hard overtaking his leading squadrons minutes before their first sight of the enemy reining his sweating horse in alongside the leading squadrons decurion he quickly sized up the sprawling mass of barbarians with a grim glance at his first spear still just as many of them as there were when we left them to it yesterday i see all we seem to have achieved is to have thinned them out a little and even that small gain cost us over ten per cent of our strength i suppose the best we can hope to achieve today is to harry them from their flanks and keep them from any shelter so that they keep running all day we need to herd them like a flock of particularly vicious cattle until they break from lack of food and shelter once they reach the river tuidius well see how well they cope with an impassable obstacle to their front and hostile spears to the rear pass my orders to each squadron as they join the chase no man is to go any closer to the barbarians than one hundred paces other than to clean up the stragglers as they fall behind well lose no more men unnecessarily today im going for a look at them close up he spurred his magnificent grey stallion forward flanked to either side by the men of his bodyguard and cantered up the length of the warband keeping a sensible distance between himself and any bowmen lurking in their ranks spotting a small hillock a short distance from the barbarians path he rode to its summit using the elevation to look down into the venicones licinius muttered quietly to himself as he watched the barbarians streaming past straining his eyes to make out the finer details that will be their king marching there i can see his men clustered around him he squinted intently a frown creasing his forehead as he caught sight of something that held his attention and whos that marching alongside him in such a fine purple cloak i wonder i seem to recall my good friend legatus equitius mentioning something similar in connection with another tribal leader of our recent acquaintance marcus and his small escort rode northeast in the wake of the rest of the squadron following their tracks in the grass until they found their colleagues taking their lunch on the open plain with lookouts posted to all sides marcus dismounted summoning doublepay silus with a quick gesture the cavalryman walked briskly over to him and saluted crisply his face expressionless and marcus took a deep breath before speaking my apologies doublepay ive been in a foul mood ever since my closest friend in all the world was killed yesterday and ive been taking it out on you we dont have to like each other but we do have to get along if this strange situation is going to work so lets forget this morning and see how the afternoon shapes up shall we silus nodded his face relaxing a fraction agreed centurion marcus pulled off his helmet scratching his head as he spoke and the doublepay took a bite of the piece of hard bread in his hand chewing vigorously as he listened the barbarian we captured back there was a man i knew from another fight in another place he told us everything hed seen in the last day and part of what he told us was that theres a large tribal group heading east in front of us theyre making for a fort on the road to the north silus looked hard at the centurion chewing on the bread for a moment before swallowing it thatd be alauna ive been there a few times its a big place built to house several cohorts so that if the votadini ever got stroppy with us we could use it as a base from which to put them back in their place more of a trading centre now though its got a decentsized vicus too the two men shared a knowing look which would make it the perfect place for them to find food and take their frustrations out on any civilians who havent already run for the hills id imagine that a quick attack might find the bluenoses distracted enough to let us get at them before they even realise were in the neighbourhood marcus nodded perhaps a careful scout forward would be the best idea the rest of the squadron could go north to find decurion felix and tell him what weve discovered and perhaps we should send a messenger party to warn the tribune shall we go scouting doublepay id imagine that your deputy can manage well enough in your absence silus smiled happily at the prospect yes sir perhaps you and i centurion and a few picked men having overtaken the straggling venicones tribune liciniuss men were a good deal more circumspect than theyd been the previous day even without their explicit orders to avoid a straight fight there wasnt a man in the entire cohort who hadnt witnessed the fate of those men who had been unwise enough to ride close enough to the tribes straggling mass and paid the price for doing so the cavalrymen had been horrified by the mutilated bodies of their fellow riders and the horses that the tribesmen had swiftly and crudely butchered for their meat and nobody was looking for the same fate either for himself or for the mount that was his closest companion they rode alongside the warband at an easy pace those men with bows loosing the occasional arrow in the hope of inflicting a wound that might cause the victim to fall out of the venicones punishing march north while the rest of the cavalrymen ranged up and down the huge body of men searching for any signs of weakness to exploit as the morning progressed and the ground started to slope upwards again a steady trickle of barbarians lost their painful struggle to keep up with the warbands main body no longer able to cope with the pace being set for them and were swiftly ridden down and speared their heads were unceremoniously hacked from their bodies and tied by their hair to the saddles of their killers as bloody trophies of the days running battle before the victorious riders spurred their mounts to rejoin the hunt driving the warband pitilessly before them as the morning wore on even the weak autumn suns heat became torture for men denied any water since the previous dawn and the number of tribesmen falling victim to their remorseless hunters grew steadily until most of the horsemen had at least a single head dangling by the hair to bump bloodily against their horses flanks marching alongside drust his throat so dry that his breath was coming out in harsh panting rasps calgus looked across at the grinning horsemen walking their horses less than a hundred paces away on either side of the venicones theres desperation in the air drust i can smell it and so can you id guess any ideas the venicone king ignored him keeping his gaze fixed on the ground rising before them as they tracked slowly up a broad dry valley your men need water drust theyre at the end of their tether for the lack of it another hour like this and youll have another five hundred dead and three times as many again before the sun sets and in the morning youll struggle even to get them back on their feet for lack of food drust turned a baleful eye on his captive one hand caressing the hilt of his sword perhaps i should offer to trade the romans your head for safe conduct calgus shrugged watching a party of horsemen under a snapping dragon banner canter up the length of the warband theres your chance then thatll be their tribune mounted on that grey horse with the rather fetching armour why dont you call out and see if hell bargain with you id imagine youll get a short reply though hes got you by the balls and im pretty sure hes only wondering whether he can manage to have your head tied to his saddle horns without another night in the field he ignored drusts tightly clamped jaw and continued see how there are twice as many horsemen to your left as to your right theres a reason for that drust and that reason is that since those bastards know this ground like the back of their hands they want to keep you away from something drust raised an eyebrow too weary to ask the question calgus grinned triumphantly knowing that he held an advantage over the venicone king water drust water and although they dont know it food too yes i thought that might get your atten his words were choked off as the venicone leader took him by the throat almost unable to draw breath past the pinching hold of drusts fingers on his windpipe food drust enough for every man still standing the other man pulled him close snarling into his face where calgus shook his head a feral grin showing his teeth despite the burning pain in his lungs fuck you kill me and you die too drust pushed him away drawing his hunting knife and putting the point to calguss throat his voice was level again the anger burned out by the truth of the other mans words what food calgus shook his head laughing despite the blades cold point pricking at the stubble lining his throat and the coughs racking his body put the sword away if you were going to kill me you would already have pinched my life out he hacked up a lump of phlegm spitting it on to the turf at the other mans feet and sucking in a great draught of air before speaking again his words acerbic in their newfound confidence im not quite the fool you take me for drust i knew that i might have to fall back to the north and so i concealed enough meat in a location close to here for ten thousand warriors to fill their bellies three times over whole oxen drust dozens of them butchered salted and wrapped in enough cloth to keep the worms out and that was less than ten days ago he paused looking at the expression on drusts face and so the question great king of the venicones is just what a belly full of meat for every man of your warband might be worth to you and while youre thinking about that just ponder what youd give for a good strong stone wall between you and those horsefucking bastards tonight drust stared at him without expression youve already given me enough to tell me that i should drive my men to the west and that im looking for a roman fort that youve already conquered what more do i need calgus smiled quietly concentrating on putting one leg in front of the other im sure youre right were only ten miles from the place ive got in mind so why dont you just blunder about the hills hoping to stumble across the exact spot eh ill tell you what why dont you just stop wasting time on me and get on with leading your men to the right place feel free to come back for another chat if the need arises he watched silently as the venicone warlord turned away drust cursed quietly looking about him at the cavalrymen walking their horses patiently on every side their spearheads glinting in the sunshine he shook his head then turned back to his prisoner very well what do you want calgus stop playing with me before i lose my patience calgus met his angry glare with a level stare what do i want in return for stone walls to allow your men to sleep without fear of sneak attacks that and a belly full of meat when your alternative is for those bastards to keep right on chopping your tribe up one man at a time today and tomorrow and for as long as it takes them to run your last men into the ground let me think he put a hand to his chin pretending to consider the question for a moment ill tell you what i want drust i want to be a guest of the venicones an honoured ally rather than a prisoner under threat of having my head handed to the romans that and your sworn oath that my place with your people is safe for as long as i like either you guarantee my safety and swear on something i can believe in or ill leave you to blunder round this country until youve all succumbed to your hunger and their spears those cavalrymen wont be going hungry tonight theyll already have riders out hunting down game and collecting water and their field supplies will be following close behind theyll sleep a few miles away where their camp fires wont be visible to you and in the morning theyll find you again and keep on killing every man that falls out of the march best you choose now drust while theres still time to make it to my refuge before darkness after the midday meal marcuss scouting party rode steadily away from the rest of the squadron heading east in the direction that lugos had indicated as the path taken by the tribal band from which hed managed to escape looking to his left from the height of his horses saddle marcus could see the distant figures of the rest of the squadron scouting away to the north less the message riders hed sent back to warn decurion felix of the warbands likely presence in alauna the halfdozen men trotted their mounts along with each man set to watch an arc of terrain to ensure continual vigilance in all directions and they rode in silence for the most part still conscious of the clash of wills between their officers earlier in the day after an hour or so doublepay silus whistled softly pointing at the ground before them with his spear tracks lots of boots marcus stopped his mount to look at the focus of his deputys attention the ground before them was thick with the imprints of the tribesmens rough leather boots every one pointed east any idea how long ago they passed silus shook his head with a faint smile could have been any time in the last few days this grounds been damp enough to hold a mark for weeks now arminius dropped his bulk from colossus squatting to poke an exploratory finger into one of the bootprints these prints are new less than a day old see the sharp edges id say these are the men were looking for they were in a hurry too the stride length tells me that they were running marcus looked about him before turning back to silus i think we should concentrate our attention on the front now how far from the fort are we do you think no more than five miles we could work our way round to the northeast theres a nice thick wood on a hill thatll hide us from anyone watching from the forts walls thats where i told decurion felix that we should regroup another hours careful approach brought them within sight of the fortress town its walls and gates apparently still intact leaving the rest of the party to wait in a thick copse of oaks marcus arminius and the doublepay slid quietly through the trees until they had a clear view of the settlement silus shook his head unhappily staring at the forts thick stone wall that loomed over the vicuss houses and shops clustered around its sturdy main gate if they realise were out here all theyve got to do is stay in there with the gates shut and well be reduced to starving them out marcus stared intently at the walls searching for any sign of life they might already have been and gone silus shook his head with the certainty of experience not likely thered be some movement in the vicus if theyd already pushed off even if it was only a few survivors as it is id imagine that theyre busy drinking themselves stupid and screwing the arse off anyone who was stupid enough not to have run while the going was good therell have been more than a few of those poor bastards that reckoned it was a better gamble to stay with their homes and businesses marcus looked up at the sky itll be dark before we can get the infantry here but we could at least make sure that tribune scaurus knows whats going on and work out what to do tomorrow you stay here and make sure that felix keeps his men out of sight when they turn up and ill head back down the road until i find the detachment come on arminius gods below what are they up to now tribune licinius watched with disquiet as the venicones veered from their steady march northwards the warriors at the warbands head turning their path almost to the west in the space of a few seconds the decurion alongside him shook his head in disgust theyre making for the bridge over the river tefi sir either theyve been biding their time or someone inside that bloody nest of rats has grown a brain licinius stared at the mass of warriors his mind racing yesterday i wondered if id seen calgus in their ranks and today a body of men that has to date acted without any sign of understanding the ground theyre stamping under their feet is suddenly making moves that look suspiciously as if they know where theyre going i wonder shaking his head decisively he turned to his first spear well were not just going to sit here and watch them dig their way out of this hole not after all the effort weve spent pushing them into it send three squadrons forward to gather firewood and prepare the bridge over the tefi for burning if they get within a mile of it id rather have to rebuild the bloody thing than watch them make their escape over it and then put it to the torch to stop us from following the decurion saluted and turned away to issue his tribunes orders and licinius glanced over his shoulder searching for the handful of men that were never far from his side waiting their turn to carry his words across the empty landscape messenger the warband seemed to be moving faster than had been the case during the long weary morning as if some fresh purpose were invigorating the warriors urging them to accelerate their pace across the rolling ground between them and the river they surged forward passing the burnedout wreck of yew tree fort and splashing through the stream that skirted its walls in their determination to reach the river the petrianas riders paralleled their path the leading decurions nervously calculating the distance between the leading tribesmen and the bridge for which they were driving until with less than a mile left for the warband to run to the crossing the lead squadrons trumpeter blew three notes long and hard the signal for the bridge to be fired a moment later the first smoke rose into the clear sky above the crossing quickly darkening into a black plume as the fire took a grip on the structures old timbers licinius watched intently muttering to himself as he waited for any sign that the venicones understood the renewed depth of their predicament so what will you do now eh you cant go north not with a river in the way and south would be suicide so its either east or west come on lets be he fell silent as the warband with a ragged cheer that was audible at a quarter of a mile distant turned north and drove towards the river seeming to slump into his saddle as he realised what had just happened shaking his head as he turned to the senior decurion sitting alongside him balls well that settles one thing theres no doubt in my mind that calgus has found some sort of home with the venicones first they make a lunge for the bridge and encourage us to burn the damned thing out and now theyre running for the river like fifteenyearolds on a promise the decurion nodded with a wry smile yesterdays disaster hasnt made the barbarian bastards any less sharp then perhaps we should start running for another crossing place i cant see them allowing us to use whatever handy little ford hes leading to them the tribune sent ten squadrons twothirds of his remaining strength away to the east to seek a point where they could ford the river and renew their pursuit of the venicones then led the remaining five in their close watch on the barbarians as they ran towards the point that had clearly been their objective since their initial change of direction earlier in the day eager to ford before the cavalry could get men across the river to resist their crossing the tribesmen had their heads up and were running hard the occasional man falling behind to be executed by the following cavalrymen but the remainder covering the short distance to the river in a matter of minutes licinius watched with disgust as the tribesmen made their way across the ford each man stopping to fill his water skin as the mass of barbarians made good their escape from the trap into which he had so carefully driven them something caught his eye and he sat back shaking his head in disgust and just to add insult to injury he pointed at the last few dozen men crossing the shallow river walking backwards and throwing glittering objects into the stream as they retreated towards the far bank it was too far for him to be sure what the venicones were scattering but even the threat of what he was watching was enough to change the game they were playing once more further tilting the balance of power back to the barbarians we have to assume that theyre seeding the rivers bed with tribuli or something equally unpleasant and theres no way i can risk losing dozens of horses to those sharp little teeth by trying to force a crossing this ford will be unusable until its been swept clean again and that wont be getting done any time soon his deputy nodded east or west licinius shook his head east ten miles to the nearest ford and ten miles back again plus whatever distance they can run in that time theyll be tucked up nice and snug in whatevers left of the three mountains fort by the time we get back on top of them he looks like the sort of man we need rapax turned to examine the man that excingus was indicating running critical eyes over the prisoners face and body the shackled legionary looked bored standing in the weak afternoon sun and waiting to be told what to do next his arms bulged with muscle and a long knife scar ran down one cheek beneath closecropped black hair the praetorian strolled across to his place in the line of half a dozen men tapping him on the shoulder with his vine stick what did you do and try not to make it sound like its supposed to be funny the disgraced soldier looked down his nose at the centurion rolling his head as if to loosen stiffness before answering i took a centurions vine stick and put it up his ar the praetorian struck with a speed that caught the prisoner completely unawares ramming the stick into his solar plexus so hard that the breath exploded from his body leaving him bent double and helpless you didnt try hard enough he turned to the centurion of the guard all right what did he do the centurion recently come on duty and only too aware from the briefing from his predecessor of the heavily wielded authority of the praetorians colleague answered without any of the bombast that might otherwise have been the case he stabbed another soldier to death in a bar fight the dead man said something that upset him apparently first offence well it was the first one where he got caught hes been a right pain in the arse to the men of his century forever pushing them around for their rations and just to show what a big man he is hes also suspected of having given his watch officer a beating a couple of nights ago but there wasnt any proof that it was actually him name the centurion of the guard shrugged without interest no idea i make sure theyre fed and watered and that they get a beating if they step out of line but none of that means i have to pretend to be their mother rapax put his stick under the prisoners chin lifting his face to reveal a grimace of pain name the soldier dragged in a breath before he answered maximus he held rapaxs eye as the praetorian stared grimly at him centurion i think ill just call you smartarse for the time being keep the manners and you may get out of here today why did you kill the other man he took the piss out of my century for getting cut to ribbons by the bluenoses when some idiot sent us south without any support then pulled a blade when i gave him a spanking so i took it off him and stuck it in his neck rapax nodded calculating and do you want to be freed or would you rather rot here until your legatus comes back to hear your story at which point hell almost certainly order whatever there is left of your tent party to beat you to death for your crime something theyll be happy enough to do if theyve seen battle while youve been tossing it off back here the prisoner was clearly unconvinced and in return i have to do what at least here im not risking a barbarian spear in my guts and in return legionary smartarse you have to join my party and do whatever i tell you to do whenever and wherever that may be as it happens were going north not south north of the wall to hunt for a fugitive from justice i hear tell the rebellion north of the wall is over so youll probably be safer out there than sat in here waiting for the brigantes to break in and make you their new girlfriend choose now he turned away looking at the rest of the prisoners maximus stared at his back for a moment before speaking all right all right what smartarse answer carefully or ill leave you here with the skin hanging off your back sorry centurion id like the chance to join your party good choice lets have smartarse here out of these irons centurion hes got some soldiering to do he turned away focusing on the next man in the line now what else do we have here the centurion of the guard nodded to his deputy who busied himself releasing the prisoner from his shackles then stepped forward and tapped each mans chest with his vine stick thief thief attempted murder not very successfully from the look of him rapist and my special favourite sleeping on guard rapax stopped at the rapist attempted murder doesnt look like he could pick a successful fight with my old mother never mind collar a traitor i dont like thieves and the only thing i like less than a thief is the sort of weakchinned fool that lets his mates down by falling asleep on duty eh sleepy your mates will make very short work of you when theyre given the chance and good luck to them he pointed at the rapist ill take this one though the centurion of the guard raised an eyebrow i suppose you know what youre doing but hes a nasty case put it to a woman old enough to be his grandmother by force and then killed her and nobody would have been any the wiser as to who the sick bastard that did it was if his goodluck amulet hadnt been found by the body even now he keeps denying it shut it having opened his mouth to contest the centurions story the rapist closed it again his face a picture of misery see all he does is piss and moan about how it wasnt him despite the fact that he left the evidence and has no alibi worth a toss youre sure you want him rapax smiled back at him imperturbably yes i think ill be able to find a use for him well have to call him granny fucker he beckoned one of his men forward indicating the two reprieved prisoners take smartarse and granny fucker to the stores and get them kitted up make sure they look like soldiers and not the raggedarsed jailbirds they so clearly are and if the stores officer gives you any trouble just give him the usual you really dont want to meet my centurion and his mate the corn officer speech meet me at the north gate in an hour and now varius excingus wed best go and see how our wounded are doing in the forts hospital they found a single doctor on duty a woman who seemed utterly untroubled by their combination of muscle and bluntly wielded power i cant release either of your wounded centurion because neither of them is in any condition to be released you can see them now if you like but theyll all need at least ten days rest if their wounds are to heal cleanly now if youll excuse me the two men exchanged glances excingus raised an eyebrow at the doctors departing back nudging his comrade in the ribs just the way you like em eh high spirited and ripe for breaking in the praetorian shook his head with a wry expression and waved a dismissive hand not that one thered be a dozen nearly recovered soldiers in our faces if i so much as laid a finger on her shed be more trouble than she could ever be worth his partner nodded sagely im sure youre right youd better go and have a few words with your men then hadnt you tell them well collect them on the way south once weve dealt with the aquila boy ill go and do some research on the quality of the wine in the officers mess rapax waved him away in mock disgust and strolled down the hospital buildings narrow corridor peering into each small ward in turn until he saw a face he recognised the guardsman in question smiled wanly at his centurion saluting despite the fact that he was sitting in bed with heavy bandages swathing his right thigh the centurion looked around the four beds finding two of them vacant and the last one inhabited by a heavyset bearded man who was fast asleep a thin line of drool staining his pillow rapax squatted by his soldiers bed keeping his voice low to avoid waking the sleeping man how are you then my lad got the arrow out in one piece did they the guardsman nodded holding up the iron arrowhead that had been buried deep in the muscle of his thigh earlier that day nice job she made of it gave me some sort of honey mixture and i hardly felt a thing hurts a lot now though he bent closer to the centurion beckoning with his hand to bring his officers head closer to his mouth whispering despite the lack of anyone else in the room to hear his words theres some right chatty lads in here with us tungrians wounded at some big fight in the hills a few days ago just starting to get their wits back about them and happy to talk the day away if a mans willing to listen rapax nodded silently having enough intelligence to know when to keep his mouth shut had been part of the reason he had recruited the wounded guardsman in the first place anyway it seems that the lady doctor is a very close friend of one of their centurions and has been all summer ever since he arrived from rome a centurion by the name of corvus rapax raised an eyebrow in appreciation of the news patting his man on the shoulder very good work ill make a point of coming back for you once weve found this corvus and put him where he belongs for now you just concentrate on getting that wound healed youre no use to me if youre not fit for battle the praetorian nodded proudly happy to have his officers favour i heard you were having a look at their prisoners found anyone worth recruiting the centurion shrugged i might have its too early to tell theres one big lad that might have the makings if i can be sure hell do what hes told hes quick enough with a blade from the sound of it and youll have fun finding out rapax met his mans knowing look with a slight smile dont i always marcus and arminius rode south at a brisk trot once they were out of sight of alaunas walls and able to use the road again after an hours riding they reached the spot where they had taken lunch and marcus reined his horse in struck by a sudden impulse lets ride over to the spot where we captured lugos arminius raised an eyebrow you have a soft spot for the man it seems i respect the mans courage the barbarian shrugged his agreement and the pair turned their horses off the road and cantered out to the copse where they had destroyed the desperate selgovae remnant earlier that day after fifteen minutes riding into the late afternoon suns glare marcus spotted the lone warrior and altered his horses direction slightly there he is he doesnt seem to have moved since we left him though lugos looked up as the riders cantered up to where he stood then returned his gaze to the rough grave he had dug for his brother in the intervening period marcus and arminius dismounted and stood facing him in silence both men unwilling to break the grieving warriors intent focus on his brothers last resting place was younger brother was five summers younger no family left now marcus watched in grim silence as a single tear ran down the barbarians cheek nothing left now death come soon arminius snorted shaking his head very true there are several thousand soldiers not far away over there he pointed at the setting sun any one of whom will be delighted to claim your head but thats only if you get lucky worse than that they might not kill you they might just take a big lad like you for a slave if you stay here youre likely to end up cutting down trees or digging for silver on starvation rations for the rest of your life marcus stepped round the graves earth mound and stood face to face with the grieving warrior hes right if you stay here you will end up in a work gang that or youll be transported so far from your homeland that this place will be no more than a distant memory for the rest of your days come with us we have other men like you serving with us men who have been betrayed by calgus we can find a place for you im sure of it lugos lifted his head and looked at the roman with disbelief fight for rome marcus shook his head no for yourself and for others like you we have one more job to do before the winter sets in we have to free the dinpaladyr from calguss men men like harn yes the barbarian was silent for a long moment and alauna tell you harn insult goddess you fight for alauna arminius laughed again a deep chuckle this time already hes bargaining with you i like this man marcus smiled wryly at the warrior raising an eyebrow i expect my tribune is going to want to deal with harn and his men before we march north although just how were going to get inside those walls is beyond me to his surprise lugos snorted derisively you forget lesson from carvetii fort get inside not the problem tribune licinius stood on the slopes of the hill overlooking the former roman fortress of three mountains his horse happily cropping the lush grass while he gazed down at the abandoned fort below the buildings have all been burned out all right but the walls still look stout enough i suppose calgus was in too much of a hurry to get south to do anything other than torch the place and keep moving which has played well enough for him now that hes forced to fall back on he stopped in midsentence pointing down at a huddle of men toiling at something outside the forts walls youve got better eyes than me what in hades do you think theyre doing the decurion at his side squinted down at the warriors on the flat ground five hundred feet below them it looks like theyre digging yes theyre definitely trying to unearth something there that group are dragging something up from their pit it looks like like like a sack full of salted meat perhaps liciniuss voice was rich with irony the decurion looked round at him uncertain of his meaning and there was me thinking that calgus had met his match that hed lost his edge in the face of our overwhelming force just one day later i discover that not only does he have enough wits left about him to guide a venicone warband clean out of the trap weve laid for them but he also had the foresight not very long ago to have food stored here just in case he was forced to retreat this way king drust had best be very careful that he hasnt got a snake by the tail rapax strolled up to the north gate to find his man waiting with the two released prisoners both men fully equipped with arms and armour and sporting pensive looks well well smartarse and granny fucker dont you both look pretty he nodded to the guardsman very good the stores didnt give you any problems then the guardsman grimaced shaking his head dismissively if youve met one storeman youve met them all a touch of the whip always has them running rapax smiled knowingly good well done right you two lets go for a little walk shall we he led the three men through the gate ignoring the surprised looks from the soldiers on guard at the sight of such a small party walking out on to what was for the time being tribal ground and opened out his stride once the wicket gate was closed behind them come along then the pair of you lets see how fit you are half an hour later marching to the east after the long climb from noisy valley to meet the military road that ran along the line of the wall and with both men panting horribly under the unaccustomed load of their weapons and armour he allowed their pace to fall back to a normal march enjoying the burning sensation in his calves after so long without proper exercise feeling a bit tired are we gentlemen perhaps we ought to take a breather follow me he led them away from the road and through the trees until he found a small clearing that would suit his purpose perfectly lets stop here for a little while shall we relax take the load off your feet theres no need for ceremony now youve shown that you can drive along at the forced march with a full load so just take it easy for a moment or two he watched the two soldiers out of the corner of his eye as they slumped to the ground both allowing their shields and helmets to lie on the grass while the guardsman stayed on his feet and with a hand on his spear knowing what was coming the rapist lay back on the ground dragging his breath in noisily with his eyes closed while the murderer sat with his back against a fallen tree and his eyes searching the clearing clearly equally exhausted but retaining enough awareness of his surroundings to have a curious eye on the centurion stood before him so soldiers a rude reintroduction to the military pace eh feeling nicely exercised are we ready for your next test the murderers eyes narrowed while his fellow convict lifted his head slightly to look up at the officer rapax smiled broadly enjoying himself for the first time in several days your next test gentlemen is very simple it is a test of your stamina your skill at arms but most of all it is a test of how well you listen and how well you respond to orders the instructions for the test are very simple but youre only going to hear them once so fucking listen the murderer tensed his body ready to jump to his feet while the rapist propped himself up on his elbows looking puzzled at the sudden change in rapaxs demeanour ive brought you both here for a reason you maggots for your next test there is only one instruction and that is that very soon one of you is going to be the last man standing while the other one is going to be a bleeding corpse go to it he stepped back from them watching the comprehension forming on the rapists face even as the murderer pulled the sword from his belt and threw himself full length across the clearing to punch the blade through his rivals armour and deep into his guts he smiled quietly with the doomed mans first scream of outraged agony watching as the victorious soldier ripped the blade free and thrust it into the rapists throat to finish him off a thick stream of blood bubbling in the dying mans windpipe the victor stood up and turned to face him his face fixed in the snarl that he had worn from the second that the meaning of rapaxs instructions had sunk into his brain the centurion stepped forward into swordreach without a hint of concern and took the bloody weapon out of his hands patting him on his bloodspattered cheek good boy maximus wasnt it i think youre going to be rather good at this calgus smiled quietly to himself as the first load of meat was carried in through the shattered forts empty gate arches drust was standing alongside him with a look on his face that combined irritation and relief well drust theres my end of the bargain satisfied i took the cavalry off your back for long enough to get into the shelter of these walls without any further attacks i led you to the one place for fifty miles where you can hold off an army never mind a few hundred tired horsemen and ive provided you with enough meat to put your men back on their feet ready to deal with anything those fools can throw at you tomorrow i trust i can now depend on you to keep to your word and that ill be safe with your tribe for as long as i seek shelter with you the venicone leader nodded his assent watching as his men lugged their heavy burdens into the fort and dropped them in front of the waiting warriors youll have a place with us for as long as you wish provided you keep yourself to yourself if i get any hint that youre making the slightest attempt to undermine me however ill have you nailed up for the romans to find when we leave this place do we have an understanding calgus nodded slowly yes drust i think we understand each other perfectly and when will we be leaving the venicone king looked about him as if taking stock of the forts stout stone walls you buried enough meat to feed every man here for days and the river will provide for our water needs so i see no need to break camp until the day after tomorrow at the earliest those cavalry fools can stand on that hill and stare down at us all they like theyll never dare to try forcing their way in here with so few men perhaps theyll get bored and leave us in peace he paused looking quizzically at calguss face what the other man shrugged nothing really i was just wondering if there might be some value in sending out a few of your sharper men after dark to have a quiet look at their encampment with a little bit of luck they might even take a captive drust nodded slowly raising his eyebrows in appreciation of the idea a roman prisoner information and sport for my men something to take their minds off their surroundings you might have something there the sun was well below the western horizon by the time marcus and his companions had found the detachments overnight camp and another hour passed while he made sure that his horse was fed and watered and sought out martos prince martos there is a man i would have you meet i found him wandering on the plain today and took him into my custody rather than leave him to his fate and in return he gave me news that i believe youll want to hear the votadini nodded his agreement and marcus waved a hand at arminius who was lurking near by with lugos and the german escorted the reluctant selgovae to marcuss side he nodded gravely to martos greetings prince martos i trust that two knives here has told you the story of our hunt today and how we ended up adopting this stray warrior to save him from sitting out on the plain until some undeserving soldier either took his head or sold him into slavery martos looked at marcus tipping his head to one side then looked up at the silent lugos taking stock of the massive warriors bloodstained clothing i have the feeling that there is more to this story than youve told me so far marcus took hold of the selgovaes right arm and turned it over to display his legion prisoner brand we came across a party of men this morning on the plain and rode them down all bar lugos here i recognised him at the last moment as a man i fought with some weeks ago while he was a captive of the sixth legion and put my spear up he tells me that he was forced into a warband by calguss men and that he managed to escape in the confusion last night the rest of the he stopped realising that martoss face had taken on a hostile cast this man is selgovae yes but the votadini prince bridled with anger putting a hand to his sword you bring a warrior from the sworn enemies of my tribe to me and expect him to be welcome at my fire when his fellow warriors are busy plundering my tribes home and destroying my life lugos took a step back and for a moment marcus tensed ready to unsheathe his own weapons but arminius put a heavy hand out and clamped it over the princes sword hand i suggest you listen to what the man has to say then judge how you should act martos stared into his eyes for a long moment before shrugging off his grip and placing both hands on his hips very well speak selgovae but do not expect to find me sympathetic to your tale your tribe has done more hurt to me and mine than a lifetime of retribution will put right lugos looked at marcus and then shrugged speaking in the language shared by the tribes i understand the selgovae tribe has done many wrongs in one short summer this man has every right to be angry for it is true calgus did murder his king he bowed to the bristling votadini prince prince martos i went to war the first time of my own choosing happy to fight the romans and force them to leave our land but i saw things in the first few days of our war that made me sad for my brothers death without reason and things that would make our goddess turn her head away now a selgovae warband has marched into alauna a holy place they can only bring more disgrace on the selgovae people and i want nothing to do with this more than that i will do whatever i must to rid the shrine of their defilement alauna martos closed his eyes in despair then opened them and turned to marcus with fire in his eyes alauna is a sacred place and long accustomed to the protection of your soldiers a warband of any size will rip into the inhabitants and find no resistance worthy of the name we must march on them tomorrow and put an end to whatever suffering they are inflicting on my people marcus nodded agreed but easier said than done the fort at alauna is intact and it appears that they are strong enough to mount an effective defence tribune scaurus will want the threat removed before he passes north but he wont be able to ignore the fact that the time he can give to doing so is limited lugos here however has an idea as to how we might be able to resolve this problem in a swift and suitably bloody manner if youre willing to play a part that might not come naturally to you and your men the detachments command conference was in full swing and tribune scauruss tent filled with officers by the time marcus managed to disengage himself from the discussion between martos arminius and lugos he stopped inside the doorway saluted and turned to leave intending to return at a quieter time to explain his proposal to his tribune but scaurus waved him into the gathering calling for a chair youve arrived at just the right time centurion corvus perhaps you can tell us whats happening on the other side of the hill taking the offered seat the weary centurion told the assembled officers the story of the days events with a swift economy watching the faces of the men around him as he outlined the likely fate of those of alaunas inhabitants who had failed to flee first spear canutius seemed unconcerned unlike frontinius and neuto who had both clearly served in the fort at some time or other to judge from the sick expressions both took on as the point of his story became clear unexpectedly the first man to speak was tribune laenas we should bypass this insignificant band and leave them to their own devices scaurus our duty is clearly to push on to the north and storm this dinpaladyr place any delay or detour might be construed as a failure to do that duty scaurus turned his head to look at his colleague realising with amazed anger that the man was serious any man that accused me of any shyness with regard to my duty would stand need of both a sword and the skill to use it tribune laenas ive got ten years of service on the frontier with germania and my scars are all on the front of my body the legion officer reddened and looked down at the floor after barely a seconds withering stare from his temporary superior his first spear smirked slightly and marcus found himself scowling at the centurion in disgust my ah apologies scaur tribune scaurus i sought in no way to impugn either your record or your willingness to do your duty scaurus waved the apology away looking slightly guilty at having browbeaten his colleague in the presence of their respective subordinates forget it colleague i know the spirit in which you spoke and i agree we cant afford to spend any time camped out round five hundred barbarians when theres a tribal capital were under orders to free but i will not simply pass by and leave the inhabitants of alauna to their fate nor can i leave five hundred selgovae warriors loose in our rear for that matter youve seen the fort centurion corvus was there anything that sprang to mind with regard to getting in without a long siege marcus shook his head no sir theres no quick way in without the legions artillery to bang a hole in the walls if the warband chooses to stand and fight it could take us days to get men on the walls and we already know that the selgovae will fight like cornered rats but somebody said something to me during the ride here thats making more sense every time i think the problem over perhaps getting in isnt the real problem an hour or so later with the last details of their plan for the following day agreed scaurus wearily dismissed the officers to their cohorts as hed half guessed would be the case laenas waited in his place while the others filed out a penitent expression on his face raising a hand to forestall any apology scaurus shook his head no colleague its me that should be apologising i was hasty and overbearing with you in front of our brother officers and i should have reacted differently i know you meant no harm by what you said although you might reflect on a better way to have made the point laenas nodded glumly i know i was wrong rutilius scaurus and truly its me that must make amends you had every right to be angry i all but accused you of cowardice being the son of a powerful and outspoken man doesnt make for the best training in diplomacy scaurus shrugged putting a hand on the younger mans shoulder well said and best we just both forget the whole thing our men will be looking to us to show a united command given the risks were going to be taking over the next few days lets try to give them what they need eh with the sun beneath the horizon and the warbands watch fires burning brightly at all corners of the forts walls half a dozen men slipped quietly through the forts north gate on the side facing away from the roman camp their faces were darkened with mud and their swords were strapped to their backs to leave both hands free without the risk of a scabbard catching on a rock or tree and betraying them with unexpected noise moving slowly and silently they eased around the forts walls until they reached the southwest corner pausing for a moment to get their bearings under the night skys diamondstrewn vault before loping away towards the nearest of the three massive hills that stood guard over the roman outpost calgus ran with them dragging the cold night air into his lungs with the delight of a man who had stood close to death only a day before drust had acceded to his suggestion that his local knowledge would be invaluable to the raiders with some reluctance but had seen little choice once he realised the importance to calguss tribe of the mountains towering over their refuge the hill closest to these walls was the selgovaes tribal capital drust before the romans ever set foot on this land and i know it as well as i know the lines on the back of my own hand allow me to guide the raiding party and i will take them around to the far side of the enemy camp where the cavalrymen will walk without fear of attack behind the wall of their spears i am your best hope of this night resulting in the capture of a suitable subject for our questions rather than the loss of half a dozen of your men to no effect the small party crossed the open space between the shattered fort and the hills ancient and deserted settlement at a steady pace every man alert to any sign of a roman patrol or for any hint that they might be the hunted rather than the hunters but they reached the slopes of the northernmost of the three hills without either incident or alarm calgus took the lead keeping their path close to the settlements rotting wooden palisade in order to make the best use of its looming moon shadow padding carefully through the darkness with one eye to the east where the petriana wings camp had been thrown up that afternoon the roman watch fires lit the camps earth walls perfectly when seen from the hills elevated perspective and calgus stopped the raiding party to point out in whispered tones the side from which he intended making their approach you see to their north they have men patrolling every fifty paces all watching the men to either side to attempt abduction there is to cut our own throats theyll have a hundred men on top of us in no time to the south though the venicone warriors gathered around him followed his pointing arm the camps southern face was far less well guarded with only the occasional patrolling soldier to be seen we circle round to the place where the shadows lie deepest and then we set up a lure and wait for a roman to take the bait that we offer i know these men and the way they think and i know how to bring one of them to us in complete silence for the sake of his own greed follow me centurion cyrus stood in the knot of men facing tribune licinius as the petrianas commander addressed them in the torchlit area in front of his command tent it may be time to face the facts gentlemen the venicones have wriggled out of the trap we set for them with the aid of that devious bugger calgus and now they sit pretty behind walls that used to be our stronghold with food and water enough to see them through tomorrow from the looks of it they could hold three mountains against a force three times our strength without breaking sweat and they may well be capable of outlasting us here so we can stay camped here and keep them bottled up in the fort until the time comes for them to drive for the north again or we can leave them to it and head south to join the rest of the army in putting down the brigantes i suspect that the latter choice might well be a good deal more satisfying than sitting here waiting for the buggers to do something he looked around the twenty or so decurions gathered about him spreading his hands in invitation any views gentlemen before i make the decision one of the more headstrong decurions spoke out quickly hardly waiting for the sound of his tribunes voice to die away theyve killed more than enough of our men i say we stay with the bastards to the end until they fall to their knees with hunger and pray for a quick death a few other members of the group nodded although licinius could see a larger number whose faces were creased in frowns he raised a hand to the most influential of them inviting him to speak titus the decurion in question a good ten years older than the first speaker stepped forward a pace and looked about his brother officers with a hard stare i say we leave these dunghill vermin to fester in their own shit they are too many for us to take unaided they mean nothing now that they seek only to run for the safety of their own land and we can only throw more men after those weve already lost if we seek to pursue them further to the south our own people may be in peril from the brigantes and my choice would be to ride to their aid rather than to sit here watching these tattooed animals thumb their noses at us he stepped back his face flushed red with the unaccustomed attention and a number of the older officers nodded and spoke quiet encouragement to him licinius opened his mouth to speak but the words died as a third officer raised his hand to speak waiting until his tribune had gestured for him to continue cyrus the man stepped forward pushing through the throng of his brother officers into the torchlight tribune i say we have a third choice yes we can ride to the south and war with the brigantes or stay here and ride herd on this rabble a while longer or we could should we choose to do so head to the northeast and provide support to our brothers who have ridden with the tungrians liciniuss eyes widened slightly with surprise unclear as to what motivation the officer speaking might possibly have after all theyve been sent north to liberate the votadini tribal capital with barely sufficient strength for the task and our speed and spears would doubtless be highly valued by their officers the men around him were clearly equally as surprised as their tribune and a moment of astonished silence hung over the group before licinius spoke again a faint smile gracing his face so gentlemen we could stay here and hope to catch the venicones in some error or we could go south to a fight we know is even now raging across the northern frontier and yes we could even ride to aid the tungrians in the liberation of the dinpaladyr since theres no clear opinion in the room to which we can all cleave i will consider the question overnight and tell you my opinion in the morning thank you and dismissed decurion cyrus a word if you will the tribune waited until the other officers had all left before speaking again walking across to stand close to cyrus his voice kept low to ensure that his words remained between them i would have found the words support our brothers the tungrians a little hard to swallow coming from almost any of my officers but to hear them coming from you was downright amazing have you been at the falernian or is there some other piece of information you might like to share with me the decurion kept his face imperturbable shaking his head in response to the question his answer was delivered in stiff formal tones his gaze locked on the tents canvas wall no sir im simply aware that theres a third of our strength out there to the northeast with the infantry and since were here anyway licinius held his questioning gaze for several seconds before turning away and youd be sure to tell me if there were anything you felt i needed to know his subordinate nodded firmly of course sir the tribune walked around him slowly his eyes fixed on the other man good its just that i still have the feeling that theres something im missing here some reason why youd want me to march the wing to join the tungrians and with your reputation for being a man of substance a man with an eye to the main chance he stopped in front of cyrus looking him up and down one last chance decurion and with no disrespect to your previous answers which i will happily overlook on this occasion should you choose to change your story you really have nothing more to tell me the decurion simply shook his head never meeting his superiors gaze very well off you go just bear in mind the way im likely to react if i discover that youve been keeping anything from me calgus led the venicone warriors silently round to the petriana camps southern side keeping to the darkest shadows and moving with a slow cautious stealth calculated to avoid their being detected by any listening patrols the romans might have out in the scrubland that surrounded their turf walls when he judged that they had reached the optimum spot for their purposes less than fifty paces from the patrolling sentry closest to them he halted the group wordlessly and indicated that they were to spread out a few paces and take cover taking a silver pendant from his neck he swiftly tied its leather cord to a tree branch and silently stripped away any vegetation that would obstruct its line of sight to the men patrolling the camps walls he outlined his plan to the venicones in a harsh whisper when one of them comes to take this trinket we will wait until he is in the act of removing it from the branch then hit him from all sides you he pointed to the warrior maon whose blow had flattened him during the roman attack on his camp you knock him senseless and put him over your shoulder and then you all follow me away from here we should be well away by the time they even notice that theres anyone missing and by then itll be far too late maon frowned what if more than one of them comes for your bait calgus simply shrugged tapping the hilt of his sword take whichever of them goes for the pendant and put anyone else to your iron we only need one he reached up and spun the silver disc on its cord until the leather had a dozen or more turns to unwind feeling the tension fighting his fingers ready the men around him all nodded somberly realising that they were about to lure a dangerous prey to them and calgus released the disc and allowed it to spin freely the polished metal flickering as the moons pale light reflected from its whirring surfaces sliding into the cover of a bush he stared through its foliage at the roman he could see standing guard on the camps western entry willing him to look up and see the discs silver twinkle in the darkness that surrounded them cyrus strode from the tent with his face set stone hard seething inwardly at the tribunes words and fearful of the potential consequences of his own failure to confess the prize that he still hoped would be his despite the urge to tell his superior officer the full story that fool octavius had no idea of what he was capable of doing or he would never have allowed him within a hundred miles of the deal whether he was short of ready coin or not ignoring the sentry standing solitary guard on the camps western gate he pulled off his helmet and its felt liner in order to allow the nights cold air to take the itch from his sweatsodden hair no he would find whatever idiot soldier was willing to sell the torc to the stores officer for a pittance and double the offer octavius had made him cutting the halfwit storeman out of the deal at a stroke there would be no intermediaries between the frontier and rome just a twoyear wait for his discharge and then a leisurely journey to the heart of the empire he would have plenty of time to find the right man to broker the sale of the venicone kings badge of authority to a wealthy collector on his behalf and his presence and the story that he was the man who had hacked the barbarian kings head from his shoulders would help to ensure that the price paid would be a steep one he could comfortably expect a hundred thousand from the sale he estimated enough money to he snapped out of his reverie as the flicker of something shiny in the bushes to his right caught his eye and turned back to the sentry ignoring the fact that the man looked half asleep stay here keep your mouth shut and keep your fucking eyes peeled theres something in the undergrowth and im going for a look pulling his helmet back on he strode towards the spot where hed seen the momentary flash of light drawing his sword and scanning the ground around him suspiciously before returning his gaze to whatever it was that was hanging from the tree now less than ten paces from where he paused to look around and sniff the air he could see it now a disc of metal hanging from a low branch must have snagged when the bastards came through or been left as a marker and got forgotten their loss the decurion sidled forward with his sword ready to strike and his other hand outstretched to take the object from its resting place his attention fixed on the trinket he didnt see the massive venicone warrior who rose silently from the ground to his rear an axe handle gripped in one huge fist or even suspect the trap until the last second with the rush of air as the staves heavy shaft swept round in a vicious arc that ended with a thunderous impact with his helmet smashing him to the ground despite the protection of its iron plate scrabbling disjointedly at the ground beneath him shakily attempting to get back to his feet in defiance of his reeling senses he felt another pulverising impact land on the helmet and then knew nothing more the next morning was bright and cold a harsh wind from the east making the selgovae tribesmen occupying the alauna fort huddle deeper into their thick woollen cloaks they had gorged themselves on the forts stores the previous evening and taken their pleasure of the vicuss remaining inhabitants in an orgy of alcohol and rape and many of the warriors were still the worse for wear by the middle of the next morning a handful of corpses were scattered across the forts cobbles like bloodied rags left where they had been butchered by drunken tribesmen and a faint echo of the stench of blood was carried by the biting wind the faint cries of distress from those of the vicuss inhabitants that still lived bore witness that not all of the tribesmen had yet drunk themselves to the point of insensibility the tribal bands leader sat in the detritus of the former commanders residence chewing on a piece of salted meat and basking in a quiet feeling of satisfaction after their escape from the destruction of calguss forest camp his men had run long and hard to evade the inevitable pursuit and to have found such ready shelter and food was little less than divine intervention his warriors could recoup their strength over the next day or two and the forts intact walls and gate would protect them from any roman units that happened across their hiding place as he sat grinding the nearindigestible meat between his teeth one of his men burst into the room his sword drawn and a wild look in his bloodshot eyes harn there are romans advancing from the south looks like a legion from the elevated vantage point offered by the forts walls harn could see a long column of infantry approaching from the south moving with a deliberate speed rather than hurrying to the attack as he would have expected straining his eyes he could see that the leading soldiers were indeed legionaries their detachment standard fluttering gaily in the wind the stylised representation of a bull immediately identifying them as belonging to the hated th legion he stared bleakly over the forts stone rampart looking across the empty landscape to the north and reckoning the odds it would be them at least theres no cavalry to be seen and none of their stone throwers either we could hold this place for weeks given the amount of food they left behind or we could make a run to the north without fear of being ridden down its a pity theres no way to know if theyll bottle us up in here or just pass by and head north as if in answer the advancing cohorts trumpets blew again and the column split into three one body of men deploying to the east and another to the west while the foremost cohort spread across the southern arc within minutes the whole southern horizon was lined with troops apparently awaiting the order to advance to encircle the fort harn frowned out at them looking again to the north looking to wrap us up are they if i could be sure there was no cavalry out there a horseman rode forward from the advancing column with a dozen soldiers trotting alongside him his armour and weapons shining in the morning light and reined in his horse at the edge of any possibility of bowshot from the forts walls a warrior close to harn put an arrow to his bow ready to chance his skill at the distant target but the selgovae leader tapped him on the arm and shook his head lets hear what the bastard has to say before you start trying to put an iron head into his guts signal him to approach the roman officer dismounted and approached the captured forts walls with an escort of six men with shields held ready to protect him at fifty paces from the wall he halted bellowing out his challenge loud enough for every man gathered on the walls to hear it clearly selgovae warriors i am scaurus the tribune commanding this detachment and the man with your fates held firmly in my hand you have been lucky enough to find a fort not yet burned out and now you line its walls wondering whether to wait us out behind them or run for the north i cannot make that decision for you but i can provide you with a small clue as to the treatment you can expect when we break in and put an end to your pathetic remnant i have with me a cohort from the imperial sixth legion and these are men who want little more than a chance to take their swords to you these soldiers are not the raw recruits that were shipped in from germania after the act of betrayal that destroyed six cohorts of their comrades these are men who actually witnessed what you did to their comrades at the battle of lost eagle and they are desperate to take prisoners rather than heads in this coming battle any of you that survive will find your last few hours more painful than anything you could ever have imagined anyone that lives through this day will be skinned crucified and left for the birds to feed on their raw flesh harn leaned forward over the forts wall shouting back his defiance why are you telling us this roman do you want us to run before you and save you the grief of having to come and fight for these walls the tribunes reply was swift and purposeful and sent a chill down the spine of any man listening with the learning to understand him no harn all i want is for my sworn oath to mithras for retribution on you and your tribe to be honoured and for that to come to pass i need you to stay right where you are and wait for us to break in and start killing you harn spoke out of the side of his mouth not taking his eyes off the roman shoot him the archer raised his bow pulling back the arrow until its iron head was level with the weapons wooden frame but before he could loose the missile at the roman officer and with a sudden scurry of movement a group of twenty or so warriors threw open the forts main gate directly below them while they ran down the vicuss main street heading for the road to the north one of the running men a big man at once strangely familiar and yet hard to place turned as he ran and shouted back at the men lining the forts walls run while you can the goddess is angry with us and she has called on these romans to deliver her justice harn stared at them in amazement for a moment before turning to look down into the street below him at the cluster of warriors gathering around the gate more than one of their staring faces was pale with fear and as he drew breath to put some iron in their backs with a swift series of barked orders one of them bolted through the gate and down the road in the wake of the running men an arrow from the waiting archer loosed at harns terse command left the man face down and writhing in the roads mud but the damage was already irretrievably done in the next few seconds half a dozen others followed hurdling their fallen comrade without a second glance and the trickle quickly turned into a flood as panic spread across the fort at the sight of more and more men running for their lives harn cursed loudly and bounded down the steps in pursuit of his fleeing warriors his shouts of rage lost in the chaos of the warbands flight scaurus watched and waited as the warriors streamed out of the fort letting the rearmost men clear the vicus before signalling the legionnaires forward at the double march to occupy the fort and secure it against any attempt by the selgovae to return to the sanctuary of its walls he watched for a moment longer waiting until the running warriors were well clear of the fort then turned to his trumpeter it seems that the barbarians ruse has succeeded give the signal the trumpeter blew his horn sending three long peals echoing across the empty landscape and on the hill to the left of the fleeing barbarians a long line of horsemen crested the ridge to stare down pitilessly at their prey their upright spears glittered in the morning suns cold light as decurion felix rode out in front of his command his normally urbane voice raised in a stern tone of command spears as one the riders swung their spears down from the vertical to point down at the straggling line of barbarians fleeing to the north along the roads long dark stripe five hundred paces down the hills slope felix looked up and down the line of his men while his mount hades snorted and twitched beneath him eager to run at the enemy warriors raising his voice to be sure he was heard along the lines length the decurion issued his last instructions no swordwork today gentlemen there are too many of them for us to stop and duel pick a target and whether you hit or miss ride through them and turn back for another go dont go spearing our barbarians theyre the ones at the front with the rags round their arms and their hands in the air and listen for the horn signal we need live prisoners as well as dead barbarians advance he turned hades through a prancing halfcircle and led the detachment down the gentle slope raising his good left hand in the command for the riders to keep pace with him while allowing hades to lengthen his stride to a canter controlling the stallion effortlessly with his knees as the hills slope eased towards level ground in the line of horsemen behind him marcus clung tightly to the big greys flanks with his thighs pulling at the reins to lift the beasts head physically holding him back from charging at the enemy prematurely looking to either side he saw arminius to his left clinging to his mount with a look that combined exhilaration and terror while to his right qadirs face was alive with the joy of the moment as the chestnut mare increased her pace to match the animals to either side the line of horsemen cantered steadily across the open space between hill and road quickly closing the gap between them and the barbarians who rooted by the horsemens thundering approach had drawn their weapons and were readying themselves to meet the attack when the horsemen were a hundred paces from the barbarians felix lowered his hand to point at the enemy his command delivered in an almost incoherent bellow charge petrianaaa ignoring the bits hard grip on his mouth marcuss mount responded to the command the way he had been trained putting his ears back and gathering himself for a split second before he sprang forward to rip across the turf in a furious gallop that took the pair out in front of the surging line of horsemen horse and rider seemed to float across the ground such was the animals speed and purpose and he barely had time to pick a target from among the mass of screaming warriors before they were upon the quavering barbarians putting his spear through the mans throat more by luck than judgement marcus dragged the blade free as the horse disdaining any show of fear at the warriors screams of pain and anger burst through the enemy line in a scatter of bodies he pulled the big grey back round for another pass through the enemy just in time to see disaster strike as arminiuss mount colossus crossed the roads slippery surface the animal lost balance sending barbarians flying as he slid into them in a flurry of skittering hoofs before crashing unceremoniously to the ground with the german trapped under his struggling mass the horse fought his way back on to his feet in an ungainly lunge and a stray hoof clipped his helpless riders head stunning arminius and sending him headlong across the roads hard surface the warriors around him momentarily scattered by the horses flailing limbs raised their weapons in anticipation of an easy kill ignoring the chaos around them marcus instinctively dropped his shield and pulled the grey up sharply releasing his mounts reins and lifting his left leg to slide over the horses side to the damp turf dropping momentarily to one knee before springing back to his feet two hundred paces to the north martos and his chosen warriors having managed to outpace the fleeing selgovae had slowed to a walk while they watched the roman cavalry tear into their sworn enemies lugos standing among them and yet still in no way accepted as one of them saw arminius fall unconscious to the ground and reacted swiftly drawing his long sword and sprinting back towards the embattled selgovae with a roar of challenge the leading selgovae warriors turned to meet him but were already too late one man falling with his stomach torn open while another reeled back with his nose spouting blood smashed by the giants massive fist running towards his friends prostrate and unmoving body marcus calculated fast as several barbarians moved in for an easy kill their swords poised to stab into the unconscious german drawing back his spear as he ran he slung the weapon at the man closest to arminius and missed by inches sending the weapons wickedly sharp blade clean through the huddle of warriors without drawing blood but scattering them in surprise and giving him the precious few seconds he needed to close the distance between them drawing his swords and screaming his rage at the warriors gathered around his friend he confronted the halfdozen men poised for the kill in the split second before the fight began as the warriors took stock of the lone soldier confronting them a rider clattered past the group expertly spearing one of the barbarians in the back dropping the man twitching across arminiuss body with that marcus was among them with his swords blurred arcs of polished iron hamstringing the closest man with his spatha he ducked under a wild swing to gut his attacker with the gladiuss short blade sending him tottering back with the stinking slippery rope of his torn guts hanging from his body another warrior stepped in quickly his powerful swordthrust skating along the romans hastily raised gladius and slicing open marcuss arm grimacing with the pain the roman arced his spatha through a full turn to hack the britons arm off at the elbow before he could pull back then reeled away from the fight as another of the warriors caught his helmet a glancing blow with his sword lucky in that the blade skidded across the iron plate rather than chopping through it and into his skull but still seeing stars from the blow as he staggered backwards momentarily unable to defend arminius from the men around him lugos burst into their midst having run the length of the stricken warband at risk of being taken for a selgovae and speared by the petrianas riders now roaming the battlefield at will swinging his long sword two handed he waded into the surprised warriors scattering them in disarray as the heavy iron blade hacked deep into first one mans spine toppling him limply to the roads cobbled surface then chopped into another mans skull sending him reeling out of the fight with his eyes rolling upwards to display only the whites shaking his head and blinking away the momentary confusion caused by the swords impact with his helmet marcus hefted his weapons and stepped forward to confront the two men who had followed him out of the fight a movement to his right catching his eye and making him back away again shouting a swift command at the embattled lugos lugos down in a thunder of hoofs a halfdozen riders bore down upon the selgovae and rode down the tribesmen one of the horsemen smashing his chosen target reeling to the ground with a crunching impact between his shields heavy brass boss and the hapless warriors face and marcus found himself standing alone surrounded by prostrate bodies a horn was blowing insistently somewhere across the field the signal for prisoners to be taken now that the fight was almost over and marcus stared about him marvelling at the destruction wrought by the petrianas men in the short time it had taken to avert the unconscious germans death he walked slowly on shaking legs to where lugos was sitting up after diving to the ground to avoid the cavalrymens questing spears straining to pull the big barbarian to his feet before wearily sitting down alongside the prone body of arminius by midmorning drusts torturer believed he had the key to the captured decurions continued silence under his knives he spoke quietly to his chieftain as he sharpened the tools of his trade one last time dragging their razoredged blades across the whetstone more for the effect that the rasping noise might have on the man strung up and waiting for the resumption of his attentions than to improve their already fearsome edge hes a hard man my lord a warrior you would have been proud to fight alongside had he been born to the tribe i have caused him great pain already but he has given me no more than the occasional grunt as my reward i can increase the level of pain he suffers of course i can sever the muscles that make his arms and legs work and leave him a cripple saw off his manhood and show it to him before i blind him if you like he looked back at the roman his eyes burning with defiance before speaking again but in all truth i doubt that this will break him and he would die from the blood loss very quickly and leave your men without the reward of hearing a roman scream for mercy drust grimaced not what wed hoped for you have a better idea i presume the other man raised an eyebrow at the tethered roman i would say that he seems to be motivated by the need to avoid alerting his comrades to his agony at all costs i would also guess that he is a proud man and that to cry out would be to turn his back on his pride to give in and show weakness at the end of his life i do not believe that the knives hold the key to his tongue but i think that he will speak readily enough if you can find a way to threaten him with the loss of his dignity you must put him under the threat of the most degrading end that you have at your disposal drust stared at him for a long moment before nodding his reluctant understanding and turning to face the naked prisoner looking him up and down to assess the damage already done to him by the torturers knives before speaking fetch water i need him wide awake a warrior stepped forward and emptied his water skin over the romans head and the cold liquid snapped his eyes open wrenching him from the moment of respite provided by his loss of consciousness drust walked forward until he was close enough to the captive to prod his bloodsmeared stomach well now roman my expert in the art of persuasion tells me that he believes you cannot be broken by the use of his blades he believes that you are too proud a man to allow yourself the slightest expression of pain or fear and to tell you the truth i am minded to believe him look at you no seriously take a proper look at what hes done to you the decurion stared back at him in silence with stonehard eyes their defiant conviction blazing back at the chieftain drust shook his head in mock sadness turning away from his prisoner and looking out across the hundreds of men gathered to watch his humiliation no youll keep your mouth shut no matter what i tell him to do to you even as we wreck your body beyond repair and at the end of that unhappy time all ill have for my mens bravery in taking you from under the noses of your sentries will be a mutilated carcass of a warrior your fellow soldiers will revere you for the bravery of your death and in time theyll erect an altar for you somewhere where thousands of them will see it to give them pride and fresh strength perhaps theyll name a new fort after you he turned back to the captive with a halfsmile all of which is hardly what was in my mind when i ordered my men to bring me a roman to make some sport with what i had in mind was some screaming something to put the fear of the gods into your comrades and not a glorious end for you so i think its time we tried something a little different we think that you are a proud man for whom any admission of weakness would be worse than death itself so what i find myself asking would your reaction be to being degraded in the face of your comrades in a manner so gross that they will be revolted by what you have become cyruss eyes narrowed slightly and drust smiled quietly back at him seeing the romans face suddenly alive with the emotion he had been seeking to inspire in his captive i thought that might get your attention you see there are men in every army who find the life away from women too much for them and who turn to their comrades for the pleasures of the flesh you however dont look like such a man you probably make jokes about them and use humorous names to make fun of the very idea even though you know that this happens more frequently than you would ever admit to anyone from outside of your military world and so what i wonder would your comrades think what would they do if we were to lash you up on the walls of this fortress and have a succession of my warriors bugger you in full view of your cohort i have thousands of men so im sure that a few of them will step forward when i offer the opportunity to fuck a roman officer in the arse before we let my man with the knives finish what hes started perhaps a dozen of them would be enough to take that pride of yours and tear it into pieces so small that a man would have to get on his hands and knees to find them and ill guarantee you that nobody ever set up an altar to a man who got captured and ended up dying after taking a dozen barbarians in his backside cyrus glowered at him his face twisted with repulsion and disgust nothing to say roman perhaps we could pull your teeth and allow two men to fuck you from both ends just to complete the picture for your friends over there go to war with the venicones theyll tell each other for years to come and if the barbarian bastards catch you theyll spitroast you how about that cyrus spat a bloody wad into the dirt at his feet staring down at the barbarian chief can i trust your word venicone drust raised an eyebrow at the growled response taken aback by the unexpectedness of the romans retort trust my word why would that matter to a man facing imminent death cyrus grunted his answer from between gritted teeth his voice pitched low to make the tribal chief lean closer because king of the venicones i have information that i will trade for a quick and honourable death i know where something is something that you have lost and which can still be retrieved if you know where to look for it if that is you have the balls to turn aside from your flight to the north drusts eyes widened and he stepped in close to the captive whispering into the romans ear tell me exactly what it is that youre talking about if this is a trick im going to make you scream for mercy before you die cyrus grinned back at him through his pain happy with the realisation that he had the venicone chief hanging on his next words youre missing something drust something important one of our soldiers found your golden torc in a tent on the battlefield of your camp the man you had entrusted to look after it was dead with an artillery bolt through his spine and so this soldier took your pretty piece of jewellery for himself he tried to sell it to an associate of mine who came to me for money to help him make the purchase and so i know where that soldier is heading at this very moment with your precious torc in his pack he spat another wad of bloody phlegm on to the ground at drusts feet before speaking again if you promise me on your honour to grant me a quick and honourable death then i will tell you who that soldier was and where hes marching and ill give you a clue to help you decide his cohort has orders to march to the north to a place close enough to this that you can be in battle with them inside two days all you have to do is guarantee me an honourable death and ill tell you where arminius awoke from his temporary stupor to find scarface sitting next to him under a clear blue sky both of their horses contentedly cropping the grass where they were tethered a few feet away he sat up with a gasp of pain putting an exploratory hand to the lump on the back of his head then looked about him surveying the customary human detritus of any combat hundreds of dead selgovae lying where they had fallen through painslitted eyes what the fuck i remember hanging on to that bloody horse for grim life but then scarface snorted a laugh but then your bloody horse took a header legs all over the bloody place jumped back up and booted you in the nut i might well have pissed myself laughing if i hadnt been so busy fighting off half a dozen of the hairy bastards having left my spear stuck in the seventh the german nodded touching his head again as if to prove the story i was lucky not to get carved up then you were lucky that a certain young gentleman decided to hop off his own horse and fight the bloody selgovae off you thats what you are mate arminius sank back on to the grass and closed his eyes i might have guessed how did he fare in the fight the centurion will be back soon enough he went to get his arm bandaged and make sure that prince martos is all right given that he managed to avoid being skewered by this shower of donkey wallopers he kept the longhaired fuckers off you long enough for these bowlegged bastards to get their shit in a pile and come to the rescue him and that big selgovae monster we spared yesterday he collected a scratch and a couple of dents doing it but i doubt its knocked any more sense into him arminius got to his feet his face taut with the pain in his head ill go and find him and see whos doing all that screaming he found marcus sitting in a queue of men with light wounds waiting for a harassed bandage carrier to attend to them and dropped to the turf next to him ignoring the indignant looks of the men behind him scarface told me id find you up here any nice scars in the making marcus lifted the bandage covering his wound revealing a footlong slice up his left forearm the blood that had welled from the open flesh already mostly clotted nice thatll be a good one to show off to the ladies once its healed scarface said you got dented he took the proffered helmet and examined the crease hammered into its surface impressive and a good thing that whatever did this didnt get through it a noisy commotion from the small group of warriors who had been taken prisoner held captive under the spears of the legion cohort made him wince mithras but i wish that shouting would stop what are they doing to the man marcus lifted an eyebrow we took nineteen prisoners including their leader harn and both of his sons id imagine the noise has something to do with what the votadini would like to do to them the german caught the slight bitterness in his tone and nodded his understanding martos and his volunteers waited all night in the vicus for their chance to encourage the selgovae to run for it i suppose they had plenty of time to listen to the inhabitants of alauna being raped and killed alauna being a votadini settlement youll have remembered he slapped the roman on the shoulder encouragingly ill go and have a look you stay here and get that scratch sewn up he stood rolling his head on his thick neck and then leaned back down to speak quietly in the centurions ear and thank you for standing over me when i was helpless i owe you a life he strode away towards the source of the noise in the middle of a circle of variously amused amazed and horrified cavalrymen martoss warriors had erected a hasty tripod formed from the trunks of saplings felled from the copse behind which the cavalry detachment had taken shelter from view the previous evening a group of his men had lashed a naked young selgovae tribesman to the frames apex by his bound wrists his feet tied together to prevent him from struggling and his feet barely touching the ground requiring him to stand on tiptoe when they stepped away having gagged him to stop his shouts of protest one man remained in place before the helpless prisoner a longbladed knife held in one hand scaurus and martos were watching the preparations with apparent interest while alongside them an older man was being restrained by a pair of burly legionaries catching sight of his master the german strode across the space around the prisoner and stood before scaurus with a slight bow the tribune greeted him with a wry smile returning the bow with a nod of his head youve recovered from your knock to the head then have you arminius he nodded gingerly apart from a headache that may be with me until the day i die yes tribune scaurus shrugged raising an eyebrow perhaps this is what will happen every time i order you on to horseback you managed to end up on your backside the last time as well since the young centurion can clearly handle himself well enough to save both his own skin and yours perhaps i should return you to your normal task of standing at my shoulder and glaring at anyone that comes near me the german bowed his head slightly i will of course accept any duty to which you choose to put me but i should point out that i now owe your centurion a life in which case youd best stay close to him a little longer i suppose i believe that your horse was unhurt in your accident so perhaps you should reclaim it and prepare for our next move and now if youll excuse me arminius bowed again watching as the tribune turned back to the barbarian being restrained by a pair of hefty soldiers beside him have you seen enough of this to be sure im serious harn i cant say that i would enjoy having that young man tortured all that much but then ive seen worse things done to my comrades over the years by men just like you so please dont imagine that it would trouble me in any way and lets not forget what we found when we searched the fort youd just left in such a hurry he looked at the fingernails of his left hand nibbling at a rough edge before speaking again you know what treatment that boy will receive if i ask my ally prince martos here to let his man off the leash in fact ill wager you know it better than most given your masters tolerance for his mens brutality towards romans soldiers and civilians alike your man there will have his skin removed one long strip at a time martos tells me that his man is an expert and can keep his subject alive for up to a day while slowly but surely reducing him to a gibbering idiot with the pain of the whole thing or of course i can have your man there cut down and returned to his fellow prisoners all that you have to do is swear to behave yourself and provide me with just one little bit of help should you choose not to do so i have quite a good supply of your men for these votadini to play with the same votadini whose king your master calgus murdered in cold blood you will recall and whose warriors were betrayed to us in order to remove the inconvenience they might have otherwise posed i doubt theyre going to get bored of hearing the screams of a dying selgovae any time soon so what will it be harn stared at his feet for a long moment before raising his gaze to stare into the tribunes eyes youll spare that man his life yes i will personally take my sword and cut him down from where hes hanging and youll keep these votadini dogs from torturing any of my men if you keep your side of the deal yes it wont be hard since they want what i want just as badly as i do but i think you ought to listen to what it is that i want before you agree too quickly your man there will keep while we discuss how youre going to help us liberate martoss people from yours its either that or well all spend an entertaining day watching him peel your young lad there down to a strip of raw meat and we have a plentiful supply of salt should simple skinning get too repetitive rapax and excingus swept into the hospital building in the middle of felicias rounds that morning brushing aside her assistants attempts to keep them from disturbing her excingus did the talking while the praetorian stood impatiently in the background tapping the floor with one foot in the manner of a man with a strong need to be elsewhere the corn officer was insistent despite the doctors protests that she had more than enough to keep her busy in the hospital i understand completely madam and i assure you that i wouldnt be asking you to leave your patients if this wasnt a matter of a mans life of course we can all go and see tribune paulus if thats whats needed but in the time that will take this centurions man will probably die he stood waiting while felicia stared at her feet for a moment he has a broken leg excingus nodded quickly he slipped jammed his foot into a gap between two rocks then fell sideways the sound it made was quite horrible we didnt dare to move him given that we were so close to the fort and your medical skills she nodded decisively turning to her orderly very well julius could you fetch my instruments please and my cloak bring your own too you might be required rapax stepped forward shaking his head no need lady well have all the men you need with us felicia raised an eyebrow at him and your men are trained hospital orderlies are they i might well need some combination of a mans strength and a medically trained mind to free your mans leg hes coming with me the praetorian nodded his grudging assent shooting a wry glance at his colleague as you wish lady the party were mounted and on the road within minutes the doctor and her orderly at the heart of a tight knot of riders who were waved through the forts north gate the purpose of their haste already made clear to the guards they rode up the steep hill towards the walls north road gate in silence and were waved through the opened gateway with equal lack of ceremony the party carried on up the road for another mile until rapax indicated a path that branched out into the open country hes about half a mile down here the party rode down the narrow track single file with excingus leading and rapax at the rear until they rounded a bend and saw the distinctive figure of a praetorian sprawled in the grass beside the path felicia jumped down from her horse with julius at her shoulder unaware that rapax was close behind them and had drawn his dagger from its sheath as the doctor moved in to take stock of the casualtys condition he took a grip of juliuss hair and pulled his head back savagely opening up the orderlys throat for a swift pass of the knifes blade felicia turned back from the unharmed soldier with a look of puzzled annoyance that changed in an instant to horror as her orderlys blood spurted across the grass his body held upright only by rapaxs powerful grip on his hair as his eyes rolled slowly upwards the praetorian pushed his tottering victim to the ground leaning down to wipe his blade on the dying mans cloak before resheathing the dagger folding his arms he stared back at the wideeyed woman with a defiant glare shaking his head slightly you would insist on bringing him with you felicias look of horror slowly transformed into understanding her face hardening as she realised how badly shed misread the two centurions intentions you want to use me to get to marcus excingus nodded brightly over his brother officers shoulder a faint smile wreathing his lips i told you she was clever enough to work it out on her own yes my dear were going to hunt down your fugitive boyfriend and youre going to provide us with the means of making sure he comes to justice quietly your marcus valerius aquila has been evading justice with his barbarian friends up here for long enough and with your invaluable help were going to put an end to his little game of hideandseek felicia shook her head defiantly her chin jutting with anger youll get no help from me marcus is innocent of any charge your masters might throw at his family to justify theft and murder and i wont be part of your evil the corn officer strolled forward until he was close enough to the whitefaced trembling woman to see the sheen of tears forming in her eyes when he spoke his voice was softer than before almost apologetic im sorry my dear but you most certainly will when the time comes youll beg for him to save you from the indignities youre being subjected to youll scream like a pig with a spear in its guts and youll provide us with all the distraction well need to do the job that should have been finished in rome tie her wrists and put her back on the horse were riding to the north so now we march north and free the dinpaladyr tribune scaurus nodded tersely watching as the young selgovae warrior was cut down from the hastily erected wooden frame from which he had been suspended yes martos those are my orders and now that youve terrified this selgovae remnant into obedience for me well strike as fast and hard as we can the votadini prince stared across at the captives now huddled under the spears of the legion cohort and watching with evident resentment as the two centuries of tungrians moved among their dead carrying out the grisly task to which the tribune had set them obedience from the selgovae i would rather trust a pack of wolves these men will watch and wait for their chance to fight back and restore their lost honour it would be better if we put them to the sword now scaurus shook his head firmly no with them i think we have a chance to get inside the gates of your tribal fortress without them we could be camped outside it for weeks while the men calgus sent to usurp you sit and laugh at us praying to their gods for the snows to come early this year and abusing your people to their hearts content the prisoners will live just as long as they serve us and your job martos is to watch them like a hawk and make sure that they do and besides i have another trick up my sleeve with regard to ensuring harns total obedience tribune licinius sat in the quiet of his tent the daily rations report from the cohorts quartermaster unnoticed on the table in front of him while his subconscious teased at the conundrum presented by the events of the previous night only minutes after their confrontation decurion cyrus had marched out into the darkness beyond the temporary camps walls and simply vanished into thin air logic told him that his officer must have been taken by barbarian scouts and yet the mans behaviour just before his disappearance had been sufficiently strange to justify licinius entertaining the possibility that he had chosen to disappear into the wilds for reasons that were as yet unclear a shout from outside the tent snapped him out of his reverie and another put him on his feet and out through the tents door a soldier dashed up to him saluting hastily and gasping out his message tribune the venicones have got decurion cyrus he hurried to the camps eastern gate pushing through the men gathered around the earth rampart to where a cluster of his officers stood watching the walls of the ruined three mountains fort in silence a mans body had been lashed to a wooden frame on the stone walls top surface and a cluster of barbarians were gathered around him staring out towards the roman camp as the tribune watched his eyes slitted with anger one of them cupped his hands to his mouth and bellowed something made unintelligible by the distance looking about him licinius saw that his bodyguard ever mindful of his safety had gathered around him he made a quick decision turning to the dozen or so officers staring at the scene playing out in front of them i need to see whats happening here gentlemen you and my bodyguard can accompany me to within bowshot of the walls any barbarian sufficiently brave to attempt an attack on such an ugly collection of specimens would have my utter respect so im guessing well be safe enough and besides i have the feeling that drust wants us to see whatever it is that hes arranged on that wall he strode forward out on to the open ground between the cohorts temporary camp and the forts blackened walls his officers and bodyguard fanning out around him and keeping their eyes open for any sign of either ruse or ambush until their tribune halted at a distance he calculated to be at the very edge of bowshot the men waiting on the stone walls fighting surface parted and drust stepped forward flanked by a pair of men with shields ready to deflect any attempt at missile attack putting his hands to his mouth he bellowed a greeting to the romans greetings romans i offer you a truce if youd like to come closer and watch the entertainment i have arranged for my men licinius looked at the commander of his bodyguard a leatherfaced doublepay with the pale lines of old sword wounds decorating his muscular arms and raised an eyebrow in question the veteran soldier stared at the barbarians lining the forts walls and then grimaced and shook his head slowly not if it were my choice tribune i cant guarantee to protect you if they have archers waiting behind the parapet we should stay here the tribune shook his head in turn patting the other mans shoulder thats one of my officers theyre about to butcher up there youll just have to do your best should this turn out to be a way to draw us in close enough for an attack he motioned the men around him forward with the flick of his hand his face set in dour lines as they drew close enough to the forts walls to see the pitiful state to which their brother officer had been reduced barely recognisable as the proud and powerful decurion he had been less than twelve hours before cyrus had clearly been severely tormented since his capture his body was a mass of cuts its skin slicked with his blood and his limbs were crisscrossed with the marks of a hot iron bar both of his eyes were closed behind swelling bruises from his initial beating giving the impression that he was resting after his ordeal gathering his strength for the last act in his gruelling drama licinius stopped barely twenty paces from the wall nodding to the barbarian king were taking you at your word king drust i would be failing in my duty to this man were i to refuse the opportunity to look into his eyes as he dies and besides the sight will help to strengthen my resolve to ensure that you end your days somewhere warmer and noisier with a cord around your neck and your people either enslaved or scattered in their hiding places across the hills of your miserable land the barbarian looked down from his place on the wall and smiled broadly nodding at the romans words your safety is assured at least until our business here is complete as to your pledge to gift me a trip to your imperial city for a chariot ride and an inglorious death ill respectfully decline youre going to need more than a few hundred horsemen to scatter my warriors and from what ive heard your army has other priorities at the moment he grinned wolfishly at licinius who in his turn kept his face blank of any emotion and gestured to the warlord to be about whatever it was he intended drust shrugged lifting his hands in mock greeting welcome romans it was good of you to come so far north with us while we make the journey back to our homelands tomorrow you may ride alongside us for a while longer if you wish north to the hills of my people and the ground my men know as well as the hilts of their swords and there i promise you we can make some real sport a proper hunt rather than this slow procession with every step taking you a little farther away from safety whether youll still be the ones doing the hunting is a different question of course he paused daring any of the men standing before the forts walls to defy him and licinius felt compelled to roar back the answer that sprang to his lips without any conscious thought it was our pleasure to make the journey alongside you drust we especially enjoyed riding down those of you who failed to manage your gentle pace and putting them out of their misery thats something we expect to be doing a lot more of in the next few days the venicone warlord threw his head back in a laugh his reply lightning fast aye licinius tribune of the petriana as we enjoyed picking the shreds of horseflesh from our teeth once wed finished our meal that first night although in truth we have so much meat now that your role of providing us with a convenient larder is really no longer necessary and we may stay here a few days longer if only to avoid our supplies going to waste licinius nodded warming to the game the two men were playing both of them ignoring cyruss battered body hanging motionless alongside the venicone king yes you were indeed fortunate to stumble over such a large cache of food you should thank your gods that you took calgus with you when you ran id say since such foresight has the mark of his cunning rather than any intelligence on your part how is that slippery specimen of selgovae duplicity if he hasnt managed to depose you yet itll not be for the want of trying a long moments silence hung in the bright morning air neither man willing to speak again until at length the venicone king spat on the walls parapet and gestured to the prisoner lashed up alongside him his arms and legs spread wide to render him helpless and changed the subject to that which the romans had been waiting for as you will see my men bumped into one of your officers in the darkness last night and so they brought him back to our camp to see if we could make a little sport of him before the time to meet his gods arrives he paused prodding the comatose body with one finger hes provided us with little enough entertainment but hes about to make up for that with the rather extravagant way that hes going to leave this life you see romans ive promised him an honourable death to die on my mens iron rather than in some depraved and degrading manner the hairs on the back of liciniuss neck stirred as if caressed by a cold breeze and why would you make such a promise drust when every other man youve taken alive in the last month has died long and hard with their honour flensed clean away by your mens blades drust smiled down at him mockingly because tribune he spoke nicely to me now be quiet and watch your man take his exit unless you want me to summon my archers to chase you away with their ironheads whistling past your ears he held his hand out holding liciniuss gaze with his own as one of his men put the shaft of a spear on to his palm then turned with sudden speed and drove the weapons blade deep into the helpless decurions thigh putting his weight on to the shaft to force the blade down through the limbs thick muscle and out of its underside until there was no need for him to hold the wooden shaft pointing back into the pale sky cyruss eyes snapped open and he strained at his bonds with knotted muscles the cords in his throat standing out like bowstrings as the pain hit him in waves of redhot agony but no sounds left his mouth a thin stream of blood ran from the wound its paucity a testament to the amount of punishment that the decurion had already absorbed licinius turned to find his first spear standing alongside him with a look that spoke volumes for his feelings about the man being tortured in front of them whatever else i might think of the man ive got to admit that hes got balls of brass agreed its just a pity he seems to have had much the same between his ears last night taking another spear drust repeated the act driving the weapon through cyruss other thigh and watching with satisfaction as the roman once more contorted silently at the agonising pain being inflicted upon him the men around licinius drew in sharp breaths or turned their heads away dumbstruck at the torture their comrade was enduring without making a sound taking a sword from another of his men drust leaned forward on the weapons point addressing the romans arrayed before him in an almost conversational tone i promised to make his death honourable i didnt mention anything about it being quick he pivoted and thrust the weapons blade into the helpless decurions guts ripping it free in a stinking shower of blood and entrails a deep groan of pain escaped the captives lips and his body twisted hideously in the ropes unforgiving grip licinius spoke into the charged silence raising his voice to a bark of command decurion cyrus the writhing body stiffened and cyruss attention snapped down on to his commanding officer his face distorted into a rictus of agony decurion cyrus you are dying with honour in the face of a brutal and remorseless enemy you deserve the highest praise for your fortitude and stoicism now before you die tell me what it is that youve given to this barbarian he glared fiercely at the dying man willing him to answer cyrus opened his lips to display his teeth clamped hard together against his suffering drawing a quick breath to reply tribune i told him about the tung drust turned ramming the sword into the romans throat and stopping him in midsentence with a horrible gurgle as what was left of his lifeblood ran down into his lungs and killed him in a few seconds of frenzied struggle for breath the venicone king turned back to stare down at the roman officers gathered beneath him his face flecked with cyruss blood and twisted in a snarl of frustration very clever tribune i either allowed him to tell you something best left between the two of us or put him out of his misery to close his mouth he shrugged a slow smile replacing the fury no matter i have his secret and it remains exactly that and you tribune all of you dogs have a count of one hundred to get yourself away from my walls on your way ten miles north of the site of that mornings skirmish the detachment turned off the route of their march north and built the customary temporary camp with the earth wall raised and the soldiers taking their evening meal scaurus had called his officers together for a cup of wine before darkness fell canutius had been delayed by a problem with one of his centuries but both of the tungrian senior centurions had attended with alacrity upon receiving the invitation and found tribune laenas already in attendance sitting outside tribune scauruss tent cup in hand first spear frontinius cast a jaundiced eye at the late afternoon sky and cocked an eyebrow at neuto shaking his head slowly rain before daylight id say his colleague nodded his head sagely yes we should get them tucked up in their bedrolls early tonight theyre going to have a heavy day of it tomorrow scaurus raised an eyebrow but made no comment allowing tribune laenas to fall into the veteran officers timeworn trap do you mean to say that you gentlemen can tell what the weather will be doing just by looking at the sky frontinius nodded readily his face a study in innocence yes tribune when youve served on the northern frontier for as many years as myself and my colleague here the weather no longer holds any mystery and now if youll excuse us he drank the last of his wine and stood to go and neuto reading his expression reached for his helmet and got to his feet yes youll have to excuse me too tribune ive got a cohort to chivvy into their beds and a storeman to relieve of a new pair of boots laenas raised his hands to halt their departure protesting at their apparent reluctance to further educate him gentlemen gentlemen not so fast you can tell that its going to rain from looking at that he pointed up at the sky the clouds edged with gold as the sun dipped towards the western horizon all i can see is the start of a sunset and a few clouds whats the secret the two first spears shared a glance waiting for a long moment before frontinius shrugged and turned back to face the legion officer well tell you tribune but you must promise to keep our secret between us we dont want just anyone learning the secrets of frontier weather prediction he stared at laenas with a raised eyebrow waiting until the roman nodded his agreement his face solemn your secret gentlemen is safe with me the centurions stepped in close beckoning the tribune from his chair and gathering round him in a conspiratorial huddle frontinius stared at him levelly as if taking a gauge of the man the secret of foretelling the weather in this harsh country is very simple and yet known only to a few men if we tell you this secret now we are admitting you to a closeknit brotherhood of men who have this knowledge do you promise to keep it between us laenas nodded eagerly his curiosity piqued beyond patience frontinius looked at his colleague and neuto nodded reluctantly i suppose we can trust a tribune of rome a gentleman with a sense of honour very well tribune the secret of predicting the weather here on the frontier and you guarantee to keep this between us senior centurions frontinius and neuto the phrase piss or get off the pot is springing to mind im sure you both have important duties to which you might be attending the tungrian officers nodded their understanding to a visibly irritated scaurus turning back to the tribune with pursed lips and raised eyebrows frontinius lowered his voice to a whisper shaking his head almost inperceptibly the tribune gets annoyed because we havent yet shared the secret with him scaurus spoke again without looking up from his scroll i heard that get on with it well then tribune the secret of predicting the weather is this laenas held his breath with the tension his eyebrows raised in expectation can you see that tree taken aback by the banality of the question laenas followed the first spears pointing hand to stare at a distant lone tree on the horizon yes yes i can see it and how far away would you say that the tree is half a mile excellent if you can see that tree or any other object at that distance then it isnt raining he stared at the roman with a straight face waiting for the other man to respond yes id be forced to agree with you excellent so if you can see the tree its not raining however he raised a finger to underline the point colleague neuto inclined his head gravely taking up the thread if you can see the tree and it isnt raining it soon will be the two centurions stood in solemn silence for a moment watching the tribune intently for his part they told their own officers later that evening he seemed to take it in good part so if i can see the tree if ive got this right it will soon be raining frontinius nodded happily youve got the measure of it use your new knowledge wisely though many men would cheerfully kill to have such insight we you both have soldiers you could be beasting round the camp if that is you wouldnt rather stay and regale my brother officer with further attempts at tentparty humour the two men took their tribunes hint and strode away into their respective parts of the camp with a comradely nod to each other scaurus cocked his head to one side ostentatiously clearly waiting for something and after a moment an outraged bellow of admonishment rang out as one of the pair spotted one of his men doing something outside the closely regulated activity prescribed for the soldier in question excellent normal service is resumed will you take another cup of wine with me tribune laenas the younger man paused for a second as if expecting some further attempt at humour then nodded his assent and sank back into his chair your officers it seems are little different to mine the first cohorts centurions are always looking at me in that sideways manner they use to indicate my lack of suitability for my role in their closed little world the bitterness in his voice caught scauruss attention and he dropped the scroll to give his subordinate his full attention laenas was staring out into the camp his eyes unfocused as he gazed fixedly at the horizon theyre so secure in their certainty as to how everything works and they give me so little help scaurus went into his tent and returned a moment later with a fresh flask of wine and two cups pouring them both a generous measure here this might help its the genuine falernian believe it or not and it seems to have survived the journey in a more or less tolerable condition he took a sip raising an eyebrow in mute appreciation you were saying laemas shifted uneasily in his seat taking a deep drink from his cup im not a crybaby you understand my father made sure that i got enough training as a boy that i would give a fair account of myself were i ever to see any fighting and yet these legion men have a way of reducing me to helpless frustration every time i try to impose my authority on them scaurus watched him over the rim of his cup taking stock of his officers state of mind as he spoke the battle to take the barbarian camp theres a good example i had orders to break in from the north with this very cohort a critical role legatus equitius called it and i was very clear with my officers that we were going to play our part to the full and yet when we got within spitting distance of the objective my first spear started prevaricating finding reasons why we werent ready to attack and delaying our deployment until licinius rode up and all but accused me of being afraid to advance into the enemy camp scaurus winced gaius manilius licinius does have a very special way of communicating his disappointment laemas nodded warming to his subject quite so but to make it worse first spear canutius promptly started making it pretty clear to manilius licinius that his desire to get into action was being frustrated by my delaying tactics nothing i could challenge without looking even more of a fool of course but licinius clearly went away with the impression that im not fit to command and so i find myself here under the command of a social inferior and probably doomed to this ignominy for the rest of your short career laenas winced at the words for all that scauruss voice had been perfectly level yes im sorry for my poor showing at our first meeting i really wasnt thinking very clearly too busy feeling sorry for myself i suppose he took another mouthful of the falernian forgive me colleague im making a mess of this career on so many fronts im not sure what to do for the best but i never meant to impugn either your office or your honour as a roman gentleman scaurus smiled back at him cheer up tribune your first spear clearly has a problem that we can easily remedy and youll have plenty of chances to prove that theres fire in your belly in the next few days as for first spears frontinius and neuto their humour is of a different kind to that you might be used to suffering you show them that youre fit to command and theyll soon enough come round to your side now will you take another cup that one seems to have emptied itself all too quickly well drink to long life and glorious victory and then i must spare some time for prince martos i promised that i would read him the letters he captured during the raid on calguss tent and its about time i made good on the offer later that evening with the evening meal taken and the three cohorts soldiers busy about their usual campaign routine of cleaning their equipment and improving the edges of their blades the detachments tribunes and senior centurions came together in scauruss command tent to discuss the next days march decurion felix was ordered to attend as the commander of the petrianas detached squadrons and he brought both doublepay silus and marcus with him despite the sour looks that the gesture earned him from first spear canutius scaurus opened the discussion pointing to a sketchy map of the ground that lay before them to the north well then gentlemen ive ridden this route to the dinpaladyr before so ive made a start at drawing a map of the ground well have to cross to make our approach martos has given me all the help he can but hes more of a warrior than a geographer so im afraid that our knowledge of the route is still a little sketchy tribune doublepay silus stepped forward with an em barrassed salute drawing inquisitive stares from the assembled officers doublepay begging your pardon tribune but ive been riding these hills since i was a lad the petriana used to mount security patrols in the rear of the northern wall when it was still manned we spent most of our effort in the west keeping the selgovae on their toes but we rode this ground as well when we could spare the time even after the pullback to the old wall we still got around a fair bit making sure the frontier tribes didnt mistake our retreat for weakness i could add some detail to that map if youd like me to scaurus nodded handing him a stick of charcoal the cavalryman stood over the parchment for a moment his eyes moving across its sparse detail then put the charcoal to the map drawing fresh lines with swift confident movements the river tuidius runs here and meets the sea here and it can be forded by infantry here but by cavalry here and here scauruss eyes narrowed taking in the additional detail and its implications so we can only cross the river in one place silus nodded yes tribune unless weve got the time to build a bridge the tribune shook his head with a grim smile neither the time nor the engineers im afraid so if the men that calgus sent to take control of the votadini have their wits about them theyll have scouts watching the ford and our element of surprise will be lost before we even cross the river silus shook his head not necessarily tribune as i said these two points can be crossed by horsemen the animals will have to swim but ive done it myself more than once how likely would it be for a body of horsemen to remain unobserved once they were on the far side silus nodded sagely a good question sir he drew on the map again sketching in a range of hills that ran to the northeast between the rivers course and the votadini capital the enemy scouts will most likely be waiting here he pointed to a spot on the range just to the north of the infantry ford but wed be crossing here ten miles to the west and well out of their view if we then went over the hills to the northern side we could make out approach without their ever suspecting we were there and if the selgovae think to put watchers on that ford silus pulled a wry face at the worst they could kill every man in that detachment before we ever got our feet out of the water tribune a handful of decent archers could pick us off without any trouble at all a silence hung in the air for a moment broken at length by the thud of scauruss finger hitting the map at the spot indicated by the doublepay very well doublepay youve just earned yourself a temporary field promotion to decurion and if you can take a party of men across the tuidius and win us back the element of surprise ill ask tribune licinius to let you keep the title silus stiffened his back and saluted crisply thank you sir ill get a party of volunteers together and make the preparations tonight we can be across the river and on the far bank drying out our kit by early morning the day after tomorrow and the road north will be clear by the middle of the day itll take you that long to get across the ford at the usual campaign pace scaurus nodded decisively then i suggest you get to it decurion and now colleagues lets see what shape our three cohorts are in after the days events outside the command tent both felix and marcus shook siluss hand in congratulation while the new decurion shook his head in bemusement all that time wondering if i could ever get the promotion and then an officer i hardly know drops it on me without any warning marcus smiled wryly clapping a hand on his shoulder tribune scaurus as you are learning isnt a man given to overconsidering an idea if he can see its potential besides which we havent actually got across the river and dealt with the watchers yet have we silus nodded briskly true enough and i need thirty men that can swim what about your men centurion there must be a few of them without the infantrymans usual hatred of water after all theres no soap involved arminius by now more or less recovered from the blow to the head that colossus had dealt him during the fight earlier in the day sat by the fire burning in the th centurys lines and stared into its embers freed from guard duty by scauruss edict that the men who had volunteered to form siluss cavalry squadron would need a full nights rest he had accompanied marcus qadir and scarface back to their century once their mounts were settled for the night now with most of the century already rolled up in their cloaks after the days exertions he found himself unable to sleep and so had joined the centurys standardbearer in the fires gentle glow morban was in an unusually reflective mood and the german more used to finding the burly soldier a source of unceasing banter and rough humour sat quietly and listened to his woes im forty years old next month and i joined the cohort at the age of sixteen that wont mean much to you i suppose you barbarians are usually all dead before reaching such an age id imagine arminius raised an eyebrow at the comment but kept quiet as the standardbearer ploughed on but for me it might as well be fifty i joined at the age of sixteen and so i reach my twentyfive years service next year oh they wont throw me out yet of course too many good men died in the last six months for there to be any danger of that but a standardbearer past his twentyfive well theres a blockage to another mans promotion and that wont do once the numbers are made up ill be politely taken to one side and invited to enjoy the fruits of my service which will boil down to being given my pension and told nicely mind you to piss off and give someone else a chance to wave my standard around arminius nodded his face an unreadable collection of lines and shadows in the firelight i can see the way of it other men will be ready to step into your shoes and you will have to step out of them sooner or later morban shook his head sadly and in truth german and strictly between us girls i wont miss the job as much as i would have done ten years ago too cold in the morning too hot by midday never a drink to be had for weeks at a time and feet stiff with dead skin and sores id swap it all for a nice little place in the hills vicus in an instant my own alehouse and a guaranteed supply of thirsty customers except he paused for a moment and the german saw his opportunity to lighten the discussions tone except youd drink it all yourself a spark of the morban that arminius had come to expect resurfaced in his blinking indignation no you cheeky bluenosed bastard except for the boy arminius nodded again having known full well the direction their discussion would take i had high hopes that my colleague antenoch would take lupus on when i retired teach him his letters and show him how to use a sword and shield i hoped hed make a better soldier out of the boy than ever i was with the right learning theres no saying what the lad might achieve but with antenoch dead thats all gone the german picked up a stick and poked the fire with it summoning fresh heat from the dying embers you think the boy might have the makings of a clerk i think not standardbearer i never met his father but i hear he was a warrior and that he died at your battle earlier in the year with great honour morbans face twisted into something between a memory of grief and one of regret a life wasted and my son torn from me if hed been a little less of a warrior and a little more of a soldier hed still be with us arminius shook his head slowly a gentle smile on his face and yet he carried your blood standardbearer he could no more have held himself back from the fight than cut off his own arm a warrior has to fight whether those of us left behind when they perish like it or not and your grandson is no clerk in the making not to my eye hell be the same man his father was inside a few years with the right training morban snorted training from whom two knives is too busy leading the century and trying to get himself killed and theres no one else i can trust with his welfare when i have to leave the service he fixed a level stare on the german daring him to disagree and arminius smiled grimly back at him dont try to be clever morban i know your game you seek to shame me into helping you and perhaps to absolve you from your responsibility for the boy hes your grandson and you cannot hand him off to another man so easily however he raised a hand to cut off the indignant standardbearers ire however i do have a bargain to offer you if youll listen morban cocked his head to one side and kept his mouth shut i owe your centurion a life he saved me from being butchered as i lay with my wits kicked out of me by that brainless mountain of horseflesh earlier today he leapt from his horse and took on half a dozen of the enemy with nothing more than a pair of swords he stood over me and saved me from the most shameful of deaths and for that i owe him many times over i do not take such a responsibility lightly standardbearer and i will discharge it at any cost to myself that might be necessary i have spoken with scaurus and for as long as my master is the commander of this cohort i shall serve this debt by watching over centurion corvus and keeping him from harm however like you i was not created immortal and in time i will age and my swordarm will weaken i will need a student to tutor in the skills of the warrior with and without weapons a young man who will grow to manhood and take over my duty of protecting the man sleeping in that tent your grandson will be my pupil and with my training he will more than match his father in his skill at arms morban opened his mouth to speak but closed it again as arminius rode over him your part in this will be a simple one but unavoidable you will provide him with an income sufficient to ensure that his equipment is of a standard to match his skills and to achieve that you will need to keep yourself from drinking and gambling away your pay as soon as it hits the table in front of you if you feel unable to keep this part of the bargain then you will have to resign yourself to his being every bit as brave as his father undoubtedly was but insufficiently trained to survive his first rush of blood to the head as i am forced to add also appears to have been the case with his father mithras grant him rest morban sat silently staring into the germans face his features unreadable when he replied his voice was taut with emotion youll take the boy on train him to fight and care for him until he can look after himself arminius nodded the cast of his face as solemn as that of the man before him for as long as scaurus is tasked to lead these men yes if he is ordered to leave you then the task will become one for someone else until that day your grandson will have the closest thing to a father i can manage in the darkness of the hospital the wounded guardsman woke with a start and spent a split second wondering what it was that had snapped him from his sleep so abruptly before a big hand closed around his windpipe pinching out his shout for help before it was anything more than an idea a dark figure leaned in close to him and whispered in his ear the words as harsh as the tone in which they were spoken youve got a big fucking mouth guardsman and its going to be the death of you the praetorian shook his head slightly incomprehension and panic already mastering him and he attempted to rise from the bed despite the lancing pain in his wounded thigh his unknown assailants other hand reached into his tunic and took a firm grip of his testicles exerting pressure strong enough to arch his back involuntarily a long moments silence followed the guardsman unable to speak while the other man waited patiently for him to start to asphyxiate as he began to feel light headed from the lack of air the big man spoke again the menace in his voice unmistakable i can burst these plums with a single squeeze guardsman keep still and ill let you breathe any attempt to call for help and ill watch you die blue faced and choking for breath the grip on his throat eased slightly enough to allow him to gulp down a breath of desperately needed air youd best keep still while i tell you about this problem ive got and how i expect you to help me deal with it you guardsman had a quiet little chat with your centurion earlier today you thought i was asleep but ive got sharp enough ears when scum like you are spreading gossip about things best kept private while i was lying there with my eyes shut and my ears open i heard someone else tell your officer that our lady doctor was ripe for breaking in which upset me more than a little given that shes to be married to my brother officer soon after that i heard you tell him that shes close to a centurion by the name of corvus and now here we are less than a day later and shes missing whereabouts unknown but im told she was last seen riding out of the north gate with your centurion rapax from which i can only assume that hes kidnapped her and intends to use her to get to centurion corvus the praetorian nodded his head slowly his eyes had adjusted to the shadow in which his assailant had placed himself and he found himself staring at the hard features of the auxiliary soldier from the bed opposite where will he take her if hed been brave enough the guardsman would have laughed in the tungrians face but he made do with a momentary smirk ive no idea theyll probably go north find some ground where they can take corvus off guard and then lure him in with the woman when he gets close enough rapax will most likely have one of his men fuck her get her to make some noise and bring the boy in angry and unprepared perhaps hell even enjoy her himself hes had a lot of practice in making the women scream recently the tungrian cut him off with a fierce look of disgust so whos this rapaxs colleague the praetorian couldnt hold back the smile any longer someone with more power than you could ever imagine hes a corn officer if you know what that means he can the tungrian sneered back down at him flexing his fingers around the guardsmans throat i know what it means and thats all i needed to know he closed his fingers around the guardsmans windpipe crushing his larynx flat and pushing him back on to the bed waiting while the dying man squirmed for breath and clawed at the hand that was killing him its a quicker death than you deserve and an easier exit than your centurion rapax will enjoy when i catch up with him tribune paulus was clearly unused to having his decisions challenged by the lower ranks and appeared utterly nonplussed to find an auxiliary centurion in front of his desk and making demands of him that he could only regard as extraordinary having said his piece the bearded officer standing at attention before him stared obdurately at the wall behind him and waited for paulus to respond the tribune spun out a long calculated pause before speaking wanting the silence to unnerve the other man enough to take the edge off his apparent arrogance so centurion dubnus tribune centurion dubnus of the first tungrian auxiliary cohort if ive understood you fully youd like me to detail a full century to join you in some wild journey north yes tribune in pursuit of centurions rapax and excingus who you claim have abducted the forts doctor and carried her away in the apparently mistaken belief that her husbandtobe is a fugitive from imperial justice yes tribune these two officers being i am forced to note a praetorian and a corn officer representatives of both the praetorian tribune and the emperor himself yes tribune paulus paused again his eyebrows raised in an incredulous stare are you fucking mad centurion i have five combateffective centuries with which to hold this fort against who knows how many brigantian rebels who might be gathering to attack us at this very moment ill remind you of what happened to the garrison of white strength less than a month ago and they had a good deal more men than we do what is it that makes you imagine that im going to give you a century of my soldiers to chase after two men with the power to have any one of us or all of us tortured and executed at the merest whiff of treason they have the doctor tribune and and if theyve chosen to take her theres really not all that much i can do to stop them given their absolute power to hunt down the states enemies is there centurion the centurion locked eyes with him and held that gaze as he replied no sir you cant but i can give me the men and ill make the pair of them vanish as if theyd never existed the tribune bristled fear and anger combined in his incredulous tone youll make the problem go away will you and what if you dont what if this lethal pairing eludes you and discovers what ive done why in hades would i take such a risk the centurions face stayed expressionless but his eyes burned into pauluss with renewed intensity as he leaned forward unconsciously accepting the senior officers challenge because tribune your legatus cohort tribune licinius and cohort tribune scaurus have all put their faith and trust in centurion corvus if these two socalled officers he spat the word into the air between them are allowed to do their dirty work then all three of those men will likely die alongside him in some way or another if you want to avoid that you have only to give me the soldiers and turn me loose paulus sat back and pondered the centurions point a legion legatus and two highly thoughtof tribunes would make powerful friends in the years to come his mind turned as it had many times since his interview with the praetorian and the corn officer to his oldest friend in the world north of the wall with the petriana and without any clue as to the doom bearing down on him lets imagine that i actually give you some legionaries youll take them north and hunt down these men how exactly the briton smiled down at him from his standing position his face almost feral with the intensity of his confidence i am a hunter tribune i learned to track and kill animals with my father and his people the same people who are currently hunting down any roman foolish enough to go into the countryside to the south of here without enough spears to make them think twice and i know who it is these particular animals are looking for i will hunt them i will find them and i will kill them both and my part in this matter can i trust you to keep your mouth shut the smile changed slightly some hint of the britons contempt creeping into his expression oh yes tribune ill be very sure not to mention your name you wouldnt want to be seen taking sides marcus snapped awake at the sound of a highpitched scream which put him on his feet before any conscious thought was fully formed ripping the eaglepommelled gladius from its scabbard he stepped out into the cold morning air in his bare feet ready to fight a dozen of the th centurys soldiers turned on hearing the scrape of his tunic on the tents rough canvas flap their surprise at the weapon in his hand turning to amusement as they realised the misapprehension he was under looking beyond their grins he saw the german arminius standing with a wooden practice sword the boy lupus facing him with his own halfsized practice weapon held ready to strike dont squeal at me when you attack boy shout at me like youve got a pair of big hairy balls and youre supposed to be carving my guts open not trying to tickle me put your weight behind the blade when you thrust marcus strolled across to the pair the watching soldiers parting to either side youre teaching lupus to fight the german inclined his head in a slight bow the closest he ever came to a salute i have agreed with morban that the boy needs to learn the arts of combat if he is to be a soldier one hour a day every day i will spend on his education with the sword someone else can teach him to ride though the romans lips twitched slightly at arminiuss attempt at humour its a good idea hell be able to serve in two or three years and he should have some preparation but what i wonder will become of my equipment theres little enough time spent on it as it is lupus turned and pointed to the tent in which he cared for marcuss war gear his highpitched childs voice clear and confident all cleaned and polished centurion boots and belts shining armour brushed sword and helmet polished arminius patted him on the back wait here he put out a hand silently requesting marcus to accompany him to the tent in question inside the centurion stood in silence for a moment on seeing the condition of his equipment not bad hell have worked half the night to get it this clean arminius nodded i sat with him and told him what to do but it was all his own work once the idea of daily training was mentioned i could have told him to lick the soles of your boots clean marcus turned to the german with a serious expression you know what youre letting yourself in for the boy lacks a father and morban isnt much better than nothing given his usual choice of pastimes arminius nodded with a wry smile of agreement i know ive promised your standardbearer that ill play the role for as long as scaurus leads your cohort as long as he donates a regular portion of his pay to see the boy well clothed and equipped marcus snorted and no doubt he promised that much and more in the wink of an eye just make sure youre standing next to him when he takes his turn at the pay chest or hell turn his coin into used beer a pair of tired whores and somebody elses winnings before lupus ever sees any of it but for all of that thank you the german bowed again a quiet smile on his face the boy needs a fathers guidance and perhaps it will also be good for you not to be the one centurion on parade whose boots look like the floor of a legion latrine felicia woke from a troubled sleep to find herself looking into the eyes of the thinfaced corn officer who had lain beside her staring intently until she awoke he leapt to his feet with a chuckle spreading his hands wide as if for applause you see i told you stare at a sleeping person for long enough and that person will wake up he turned back to his prisoner holding out a hand with which to help her to her feet come along my dear we have a big day today lots of riding to do and no time for lying about the doctor got up from the ground without touching his outstretched hand looking about her to find the small camp a flurry of activity as the guardsmen packed their bedrolls and equipment on to their horses few of them sparing her more than a glance as they worked the praetorian officer walked across to her with a rough slice of bread wrapped around a piece of dried meat his face creasing into a grin when she gestured her lack of desire for food he reached out and took her hand pushing the unappetizing food into her palm and wrapping the fingers around it eat it now or eat it later but youre going to want it some time today well eat again at nightfall but between then and now weve a long way to travel in search of your boyfriend throw it away if you like but therell be no more until then not unless youve something tasty hidden somewhere about your clothing one of the soldiers turned and grinned ferociously at the dismayed woman his hands still busy with a reluctant buckle the tunic beneath his padded arming jacket was a different colour from that of the men around him and his armour constructed of segmented bands of iron where theirs was made of hundreds of overlapping bronze scales ill search her centurion you just say the word and ill be up that little missys skirts so fast she wont rapax spun on the spot putting his hands on his hips and shaking his head sadly you can keep your hands and your thoughts well away from this one soldier maximus unless you want your end to come considerably sooner than id imagine youre planning he stared levelly at the soldier until the other man lowered his gaze respectfully than raised his voice to be sure he was heard by every man in the clearing i wont tell you wormbeaters this more than once so lets all be very clear about it this woman stays untouched until i say her time has come i want her screams of desperation when we get her boyfriend within earshot to be exactly that screams not the tired moans of a woman thats already been ridden half a dozen times by you whore mongers any man that doubts me in this only has to lay a finger on her and ill relieve him of the hand its attached to you cross me on this one at your peril gentlemen of course once marcus valerius aquilas cold on the turf next to her you can draw lots for her for all i care but until then you have been warned felicia shivered pulling the blanket in which she had slept closer about her and crushing the bread and meat between the fingers of her right hand as she remembered the casual ease with which rapax had murdered her orderly the previous day she felt the sheath of dubnuss knife hard against her thigh and silently vowed to use it on herself before submitting to the ordeal so casually promised by rapax after the cohorts had taken breakfast the cavalry squadrons mounted up and headed north fanning out across the route that the infantry cohorts would be following behind them as they ground their way up the road that paralleled the east coast all the way to the tuidiuss estuary doublepay silus and decurion felix had briefly discussed the days march for the formers squadron of volunteers and agreed that it would be best if they headed straight up the roads relatively smooth ribbon both for the sake of speed and to avoid the risk of the inexperienced riders among them coming to grief on the rough moorland that flanked the roads arrowstraight course on both sides arminius rode alongside marcus in the mornings pale sunlight his greeneyed stare alternately flicking across the horizon and then down at the roads cobbled surface its a good joke on someones part to have me riding this monster along the very surface on which the slipperyfooted bastard nearly managed to kill me yesterday he touched the rough bandage tied around his head with a wry grin but marcus sneaking a sideways glance saw that his right hand had a good handful of the horses mane along with the reins yesterday was pure accident youll be all right today especially if you just relax your posture a little and let the horse do the hard work the poor animal must think hes got a ceremonial statue on board the german snorted disparagingly but when he thought the roman was no longer watching him he experimentally loosened the firm grip of his thighs on colossuss flanks allowing himself to sink into a more relaxed seat tempted to praise the improvement caught out of the corner of his eye as he pretended to scan the horizon marcus took one sideways glance at the look on the germans face and kept his mouth firmly shut another mile up the road the german broke his reverie with a sudden question the order was for men who know how to swim to form this new detachment and so here we are that means theres a river to cross and after that the roman raised an eyebrow its a good thing for you that i was listening at the officers meeting this morning and not just admiring the unaccustomed shine of my boots martos thinks itll take two days to get the infantry close enough for an attack on day three as long as they keep bashing along at the thirtymileaday pace theyve got the easy job since all they have to do is slog it north until they get close enough to the votadini fortress to fight in the meantime weve got to make sure that their approach goes unnoticed and unreported back to the men that calgus sent to take control of the fortress of the spears so you wont have to worry too much about having these stones under your beasts feet for very much longer arminius rode on in silence for a moment his face creased in thought so we take their scouts or just kill them we make our way in close to the fortress under the cover of darkness or bad weather but even if we do manage to get all three cohorts in place outside their walls unannounced how do we break in without any of the usual artillery the legions use to knock down enemy walls even if we surround the place that only makes the bloody selgovae more likely to run wild and fuck every living thing left breathing inside the fortress to death which would seem to defeat the purpose of our trying to rescue them marcus gave him a sidelong glance a halfsmile on his lips and the german bridled at the thought of knowledge to which he was not privy you already know dont you marcus grinned leaning back in his saddle and yawning extravagantly if youd been in your usual place at the commanders conference standing guard at the door with one ear inside the tent rather than devoting your mornings to the martial education of undeserving children youd know too arminius leaned out of his saddle poking the roman in the shoulder and giving him a reproachful glare to think that i stood over that child until i could see a shine on those boots of yours only to be repaid with mocking laughter youre a hard man centurion corvus marcus looked about him ostentatiously as if seeking to avoid being overheard despite the fact that they had fallen thirty paces behind the riders ahead of them i probably shouldnt share this with anyone not invited to the briefing but since its you he beckoned the german to bring his head closer muttering his next words in the other mans ear all you need to do is find out what it was that the fifth and ninth centuries were doing yesterday while martos was persuading harn to cooperate with us when you know what it was they were collecting from the men we killed youll have a fair idea of the answer to your question now lets see how these beasts feel about having a bit of a trot or well fall so far behind the squadron that the leading tungrian century will overtake us and ive no desire to find myself subjected to the kind of humour that would inspire have you heard the songs they sing about the cavalry why the bloody hell arent the bastards moving tribune licinius turned to the speaker his first spear with a wry smile theyre not moving first spear because they know very well that we cant stay here and watch them for ever not enough food for one thing given the impoverished nature of the game in these parts and bigger fish to fry for another my orders are explicit to harry the venicones until weve destroyed them or theres just no point to it any more and then to ride south to join the campaign against the brigantes drust ought to know that i dont have the luxury of sitting and watching him for very much longer and if hes not bright enough to have worked it out im absolutely bloody sure that calgus will have made sure he knows which way the winds blowing the longer we sit here watching a bunch of savages whore out of the fight as far as this particular rebellion goes and as a consequence doing absolutely nothing of any value the itchier my feet are going to get his subordinate nodded his understanding so we head south then licinius stroked his beard for a moment yes sort of put the word out as we discussed its time for a little bit of subterfuge when the call went out for a volunteer to watch the barbarians from hiding once the cavalry wing was away over the hill and apparently headed south one soldier put his hand up without hesitation he stepped forward to face the man who ruled his world with quiet confidence sure that his longpractised skills would see him safe no matter how thorough the venicones might be in their inevitable search for spies licinius paced around him before taking him to one side and speaking quietly in measured tones as if sensing the inner calm that fuelled the mans selfbelief soldier caius isnt it well caius you know why i need a man to stay behind and watch this rabble while the rest of us are seen to ride south i dont have the luxury of waiting for the venicones to move so instead i must use deception to bring them out of their hole so tell me soldier caius how will you carry this trick off the bastard that leads that rabble will promise to reward the man who finds you beyond his dreams because he will know beyond a doubt that you will be lurking somewhere within sight of those walls waiting for them to make their move you know what they did to centurion cyrus caius nodded just a touch of obstinacy showing in his face at the attempt the tribune was making to talk him out of the reward hed been told was on offer if he survived the barbarian search and delivered news of their movements to the riders lurking far enough to the west to be undiscoverable you heard that he took a long time dying and left this life with his guts cooling in a wide pool of his own blood and youre still determined to take this risk caius nodded again with more pride than irritation this time so tell me just how do you plan to live through the hours after we leavathen and yet still keep your eyes on their camp caius looked him in the face before replying his own face set in an expression of utter confidence in his own abilities tribune before i was a soldier i was a cattle thief i was the man that watched the herds until the men paid by the farmers to keep us away from their animals were distracted i would watch for days at a time and never once did anyone catch sight of me im going to dig myself a hide and when its done i ask that you should walk away for fifty paces before turning back to look for me walk closer and every few paces look again until youre back where you started then decide if you believe i can perform this task for you i shall need my brother to help me with this he serves in the same tent party and with that he took up the sharpbladed spade hed carried with him from his tent and set to work quickly digging out a twofootdeep trench long enough to accept the length of his body lying flat while his brother went to find branches of the right thickness and cut them down to the necessary length dropping twenty of them at his feet and then standing back to watch him work his magic digging each one of the sticks into one side of the trench two inches below the holes lip and then forcing each ones other end laterally into the facing walls earth he inserted them at fingerlength intervals to form a slatted roof to the hide then arranged the waiting turf strips across them in exactly the order theyd been removed working with slow and painstaking care he made sure that the joins between each piece of turf were invisible packing small sticks between the roof slats and the turfs where the resulting effect looked unrealistic working until the hides roof appeared no different to the ground around it nodding to his brother he slid into the remaining gap with painstaking delicate care and then watched from below ground as the last turf was packed carefully into its place to complete the deception standing to one side and watching liciniuss face remained impassive but his eyes narrowed as the soldier wriggled into his hiding place and the last turf was eased into the deceptive layer of cover arranged over the trench with one final adjustment a gentle touch to slightly flatten the turf the remaining brother turned to face him and saluted gesturing with a hand for the tribune to conduct the test that had been requested of him licinius nodded to him and turned away walking a brisk fifty paces before turning back to scan the ground beneath which he knew the man was hiding while hed had no expectation of discerning any clue as to the hides location at that distance he was at first impressed and then bemused by the lack of any betrayal of its presence the closer he got to the spot where he assumed it to be after a moment more he was standing more or less where hed started looking about him with resigned amusement go on then show me where he is caiuss brother let out a piercing whistle clearly intended to be heard in the hide and to the tribunes astonishment the ground at his very feet erupted upwards making him step back involuntarily as the hidden soldier burst from his hide with a broad grin jupiters hairy balls i nearly died of bloody shock putting a hand to his chest and rolling his eyes licinius peered down into the freshly revealed hole i would never have believed it can you do this at night so that the bluenoses dont have the chance to see you digging yourself in yes tribune with enough moonlight to work by the result is no different the tribune turned to his first spear waiting impassively to one side very well then it seems that we have a scout detail a tent party a steady one mind you to take this man and his brother out tonight and dig him in somewhere with a good view of three mountains make sure its well away from anything that the bluenoses might be poking with their spears once weve ridden off tomorrow we dont want any of them falling through soldier caiuss turf roof do we and detail a party of message riders to wait for him at a safe distance ready to bring us the news once drust has his savages on the move i dont have a bloody clue where hell lead them but ill bet you a flask of falernian to a cup of warm piss that the one place he wont be taking them is straight back home dubnus surveyed the men the tribune had detailed to his command with a jaundiced eye turning back to the centurion who had guided him to their barrack and called them on to parade to meet their new officer what the fuck happened to this lot they look like they couldnt fight their way out of a whorehouse never mind take their iron to the bluenoses the legion officer looked down his nose at the remains of what had clearly been a century at some point that friend used to be our third century our genius of a tribune decided that it would be a good idea to send a century south to scout the road to sailors town he shook his head raising an eyebrow at his auxiliary colleague that encompassed the idiocy of senior officers across the empire eighty men sent marching south straight into a tribal revolt i wouldnt have fancied my chances of getting to sailors town with anything less than a full cohort they got about ten miles south before the local nutters decided that enough was enough and jumped them in strength their centurion a decent enough officer and a friend of mine as it happens seems to have realised that theyd bitten off far more than they could chew but that theyd all be chopped to ribbons if they ran so he rallied them and led the front rank into the fight with their shields up and their swords drawn it seems the rear rank werent quite so keen and this is the rear rank right in one bastards the last thing they saw as they ran for it or so their watch officer told tribune paulus was their centurions head being waved around this lot are good for nothing more than scraping the latrines out in my opinion so if youre relying on them to put up a fight for you once youre north of the wall well id be thinking very carefully before depending on any of them and look out for the watch officer hes a damage case he got knocked about by one of his men once they were back in camp and its not done him any good dubnus nodded his thanks watching the other man walk away until he turned the corner and disappeared from view turning back to face the ragged lines of soldiers few of whom were managing to meet his level gaze he folded his arms biceps bulging against his mail armour and looked up and down their ranks with a look of undisguised contempt so youre whats left of the third century are you youre the men that abandoned your mates in battle and legged it home with your tails between your legs or so the story goes anybody want to tell me otherwise he waited for a slow count of ten running his eyes slowly over each mans face in turn and looking for any sign of dissent no takers it seems so you really are the lowest of the low men that not only turned their backs on a fight but who left their officer chosen man and forty good men to the bluenoses he walked slowly deliberately across the open space to the first rank his face twisted with disgust if this were my cohort youd already have drawn lots to choose which four men would get beaten to death by the rest of you and then youd have been sent out again in the company of real soldiers in search of another fight the legions must be getting soft allowing men like you to fester in your barracks rather than set a nasty bastard of a centurion on to you with orders to clear out the rot he went face to face with the watch officer his nose less than six inches from the other mans bruised features well gentlemen and fortunately for the army i am that nasty bastard of a centurion lifes about to get interesting for you men and not in any sort of way youre going to enjoy turning away he held his vine stick up for every man to see now some of you will already be thinking that im not a legion centurion which means that i have no power over you and youd be right he waited for a precisely judged moment before continuing again and yet so horribly wrong turning back to face them he slapped the stick into his calloused palm with a smack that made more than one man twitch involuntarily you see its true im not a legion officer which gives me no formal power over you and yet since im not part of your legion i can do whatever i like to any or all of you tuniclifting cowards and get away with it anything i like so and heres where we see whos got any balls about them do any of you useless ration thieves want to take me on man to man if any man can put me down ill walk away and leave you to stew here in your filth come on there must be one man out there that fancies taking me on no all right then any two of you any two men that think they could put me on my back come on the century stood in silence some of the soldiers shivering under his angry gaze but not a man moved a muscle dubnus glared back at them his mask of anger fading slowly to a sneer no the offer stands gentlemen if any two of you can put me on my back ill leave you all in peace just one warning though in case one or two of the smarter among you wonder if it still counts if you try to hit me from behind the answer is yes it still counts but if you decide to try it make sure your first punch is a good one because if you dont put me out of the fight with that first punch ill break one or even both arms of every man involved depending what sort of mood im in and now gentlemen youve got a count of five hundred to fetch your marching gear and present yourselves in formation on the parade ground ready to march north full armour shields spears swords and your packs whoever looks after the centurys cart had better be quick because i want it loaded with your tents and ready to move inside another five hundred any man not on parade by the time ive strolled up to meet you will soon be getting used to the feel of my vine stick on his back move after the lunchtime meal the volunteer squadron turned east away from the roads course towards the east coast and down a long shallow valley that ran northwest for miles down to a river plain lost in the misty haze doublepay silus looked down the valleys long slope and smiled happily turning back to marcus and pointing to the palm of his right hand well centurion this is my ground now ive ridden these hills a dozen times or more over the years and i know it as well as i know this skin the road runs almost to the coast where the tuidius meets the sea but were going to ease down this nice little valley and leave the stone path to the mules he glanced quickly up at marcus but found his officers face set in a wry smile if you take my meaning theyll follow the road until it finishes close to the river late this afternoon given that theyre forcedmarching and camp out of sight of the ford tonight tomorrow morning theyll turn west to find the ford and theyll probably be crossing by midmorning ready to climb the hills on the far side of the valley all of which will allow plenty of time for anyone set to watch for their approach to get a warning back to the dinpaladyr after which any idea of taking them by surprise goes out of the window he raised an eyebrow to marcus his face alive with the prospect of a hunt and theres our opportunity anyone whos been set to watch for any sign of romans is going to watch the road since thats the way they know our infantry to make their approach we on the other hand can sneak quietly down this nice little valley as far as the edge of the rivers plain cross it unseen when its misty early tomorrow morning and then turn east and flush out any watchers in the hills on the far side before they even know were there and if we can deal with the watchers before they ever get sight of the infantry then they can make their approach to the fortress of the spears with the advantage of surprise and your improbable plan for getting inside without starting a massacre might just get a chance to work eh centurion by late afternoon the exhausted soldiers of dubnuss temporary command were marching on little more than willpower and the fear that whatever momentary relief might be gained from falling out of the line of march would be far outweighed by the punishment that their tormentor would bring down on them in the event that any man flagged the auxiliary centurion had marched alongside them without any sign of discomfort since the halfcentury had marched through the noisy valley gates despite the rumour that he had discharged himself from the fortresss hospital with a spear wound not yet completely healed its a right bastard this road dont you men think dubnuss voice rang out along the small column as steady as if he were standing at ease not marching along beside them at the standard pace ive never liked it the bloody thing goes up and down like a whores skirts so that one moment your calves are burning with the climb and then the front of your legs feel like theyre being caned with the pain of stopping them from running away with you in the dips whichever idiot engineer laid this one out straight needed his head examined he looked up and down the detachments length with a grim smile on the other hand it does provide you ladies with something a bit more testing than lazing around your barrack waiting for the tribune to decide what to do with a halfcentury of cowards a man in the file closest to him allowed a hint of a scowl to show on his face and the auxiliary centurion bore down on him putting his mouth six inches from the soldiers ear before speaking loudly enough for the entire detachment to hear him ah so at least one of you doesnt like being called a coward a pity that hes stuck with the rest of you then isnt it the unit was breasting yet another crest revealing the shape of a burnedout fort at the summit of the next hill dubnus turned and walked backwards pointing his left arm at the shattered ruin coming into view that soldiers is our home for the night fort habitus named after a legion centurion who served here soon after the wall was first built he turned back to the line of march and strode alongside the detachments front rank habitus was a proud old bastard by all accounts old enough that he should have retired but the locals werent all that happy when the wall went up and divided them from each other and they expressed that unhappiness by killing romans whenever and wherever they could given the chance anyway old habitus was ordered to take his century out on patrol one day not very far from here or so the story goes he probably thought that patrolling in such limited strength was a good way to get attacked but he was too much of a soldier to question orders and so off they went he spat on to the roads surface poor bastards they were ten miles or so from camp when the local bluenoses jumped them sounds familiar eh the barbarians were three hundred strong or thereabouts more than three of them for every man in the century old habitus had seen it all by that stage of his career of course and he knew that if he allowed his men to run theyd all be dead inside a count of five hundred and so he shouted at them to form a square to stop the tribesmen from getting round their flanks and to stand and fight he glanced across their ranks finding every mans face turned to his and their expressions taut with interest and fight they did retreating when they could with bluenoses surrounding them on all sides and the day wearing on into afternoon and still they fought a wounded man was a dead man that far from help and more than one dying soldier tried to take one or two of the savages with him by stepping out to fight man to man but for the most part they held their ranks and slowly hacked their way back along the route theyd come earlier in the day they left a trail of corpses behind them their own and those of the tribesmen attacking them but they held their nerve even when half of them had been killed and the remaining men were almost dead on their feet the trumpeter kept calling for help when he wasnt spearing bluenoses and eventually with evening drawing on they heard the sound of an answering trumpet there were roman soldiers close by and an end to their torment the barbarians well they knew that their chance to take a centurions head was slipping from their grasp so they mounted one last wild attack swarming around the detachments shields in a desperate charge but old habitus shouted for his men to hold on for just a little longer and his soldiers stood firm in a circle of men that shrank with every casualty until another three centuries came over the hill and chased off the barbarians there were thirty of them left standing and not many of them without a wound of some kind but they marched back into their camp with their heads up and their spears black with dried blood he paused for a moment before continuing the detachment was almost at the top of the hill and the forts burned and shattered timbers were looming on the skyline centurion habitus was killed before his century was relieved he stopped a spear in the back of his neck that dropped him like a sack of shit poor old bastard the men that survived said that theyd all have died in the first hour if it hadnt been for him bellowing at them to keep fighting and that all the way through the fight he had a little smile on his face as if he knew what was coming before the end they named the fort after him to act as an example to the rest of the army he raked a hard stare across their faces and to you if you have the guts to follow it right then off the road here and into the fort get yourselves fed and then settle down for the night one man from each tent party to stand guard with a twohourly relief and if i find any of you sleeping on guard therell be no need to draw lots for wholl be beating you to death because ill already have done the job with my bare hands later in the evening before darkness fell he called the watch officer to him with a request that raised the other mans eyebrows help me get out of this armour will you titus i cant bend enough to slide out of it the watch officer shrugged and called another soldier over the pair of them lifting the heavy mail armour from their new centurions shoulders while he squatted to allow them to pull it clear with the armour removed dubnus pulled off the padded arming jacket and tunic that he wore beneath it revealing his muscular upper body to the watching soldiers a long strip of linen was wound around his stomach several times to form a thick bandage and tied in place by its trailing ends and as they watched he stripped it away winding it up into a neat roll of cloth as the linen fell away from his stomach it revealed a vivid red scar an inch wide and titus grimaced at the sight his bruised face twisting in sympathy spear dubnus nodded curtly wondering whether he was taking too big a risk in letting the soldiers see his weakness yes two weeks ago at the battle of the waterfall the tattooed bastard put the bloody thing clean through my mail and skewered me from front to back its healing well enough but it still hurts like the blades still in there when i try to bend he watched as the realisation that their new officer was not as invulnerable as he seemed sank into the soldiers faces and laughed at them putting his hands on his hips with a smile any two of you fancy having a try at me now one by one they looked away until only the watch officer held his gaze youre not recovered from a spear wound and youve still got the apples to come north looking for a fight why dubnus smiled wryly stretching wearily ill tell you once were on the road tomorrow morning if that is im still alive tomorrow morning the volunteer squadron camped in the cover of the shallow valley that night within a few minutes ride of the river tuidius silus had calculated that any watchers would most likely be hiding farther to the east keeping watch on the ford that the cohort would use to cross the tuidius rather than the apparently unfordable stretch of river to its west but he was nevertheless loath to abandon the valleys cover they spent an uneventful night and awoke at dawn to find just as silus had predicted that the rivers plain was wreathed in a thick mist that restricted visibility to no better than a hundred paces the newly promoted decurion gathered his men about him his words made dull by the mists muffling curtains of vapour i was counting on a nice thick layer of river fog it always happens at this time of year once the nights get cold and it means that we can get across the river with no risk of anyone seeing us so theres no time for breakfast now we need to get swimming before it lifts get your kit packed but dont wear anything heavier than your tunics and your cloaks to keep you warm while we ride down to the river your armour and weapons will need to be strapped to your saddles so make sure you roll your mail up nice and tight the squadron followed his lead down to the rivers edge each man watching the horse in front of him intently as the mist gathered in thick curtains that curtailed visibility to a few feet in some places as they made their way across the rivers flat plain silus gathered them around him again at the waters edge and pointed to his own equipment already packed on to his horses back the batavians are supposed to have swum across rivers like this and even wider alongside their horses in full armour back in the days when the divine julius conquered the south of this island but im buggered if i can see how they managed it there are those that think they might have used their shields for buoyancy but theres no bloody way id risk slipping off my board and sinking like a stone in midriver were doing it my way today so go and have a look at my horse and see how ive got my armour laid across the saddle and with my sword on top look at the way ive secured them with my rope and used it to tie my spear and shield to the beasts side then take a length of rope and do the same yourselves and ill come round and see how good a job youve done and make sure your spear isnt going to stab your horse in the eye if the poor sod turns his head to find out what the fuck you think youre doing eh he strolled around the horses providing help to those men to whom the act of tying their equipment to their mount was proving difficult eventually expressing his satisfaction with their preparations pulling off his tunic he folded it neatly and slipped it under the rope holding his armour in place then did the same with his blanket and boots standing naked in the cold morning air he smiled wryly at the men around him well then lets have you stripped down to your skins and ready to swim and dont bother making the usual tired excuses about how cold it is the soldiers stripped with the usual bathhouse ribaldry albeit muted both by their circumstances and the admonishments of their decurion right here we go stand by your animals head and take a good firm grip of the reins walk the beast in and start swimming and they will follow you they might not enjoy it all that much but every horse here knows how to swim just keep your arms and legs well clear of theirs because theres only one of you that will win if you get tangled and it isnt going to be any of you girls when you get to the far side keep your fucking voices down and well have no squealing or shouting out how cold it is when you get in youll soon warm up with the effort of the swim on the far bank get your sword drawn before you worry about getting dry and keep a tight grip on your horse once youve got your feet back on dry land because some of them are going to be more than a bit pissed off at being made to do this now follow me he strode forward into the river walking into the chilly water without hesitation and sliding his body into the horizontal position almost noiselessly breaststroking out into the stream with his horse swimming alongside him happily enough marcus waded in behind him and was surprised to find the animals flanks shivering as he put his hoofs into the water the big grey tugged against his reins without any real force but strongly enough to indicate his discomfort pulling at the reins with a gentle insistence marcus led the animal into the deeper water breathing in sharply as the cold water reached his groin then pushed himself forward into the water and started swimming for the far bank still lost in the mist the horse surrendered to its riders unspoken command and started swimming surging up out of the water and then easing back into it alternately in a porpoising motion his eyes rolling and his teeth bared at the unfamiliar sensation finding that the horse was starting to outpace him marcus waited for one of the animals plunges back into the water and slipped a leg over his back thanking providence that he had tied his spear and shield to the other flank if the extra weight troubled the horse there was no sign and freed of the need to keep pace with his rider he forged through the water faster than before passing siluss mount in less than a minute the rivers northern bank loomed out of the fog more quickly than marcus had expected and getting a glimpse of dry land was enough to spur the animal to one last great effort horse and rider staggered ashore untidily and marcus slipped from his mounts back with his gladius drawn and ready to fight despite the shivers racking his body with reexposure to the cold air silus staggered ashore behind him his sword already drawn and his body blue his voice stuttered with the cold airs grip on his body his lungs panting for breath sssee nnnothing tto it another horseman wearily climbed the bank behind him and the decurion pointed to the left ten paces that way then dry off with your blanket and get your kit on i want you ready to fight qadir waded out of the water next the chestnut mare calm under his touch and silus raised a disgusted eyebrow theres no justice not only the best horseman ive met in this whole bloody country but his bloody manhoods still dragging in the water the hamian shook his head and hooked a thumb over his shoulder if you want to be truly scared take a look at that why do you think i was swimming so quickly both the officers looked past him to see the impressive shape of arminius as he waded out of the river silus shook his head slowly gods below the german smiled complacently as he walked past them and silus pointed out into the fog still wreathing the riverbank get your sword out bugger off into the mist and get that thing covered up the squadron came ashore in ones and twos until every man was accounted for and dry enough to put on their armour the mist persisted although it seemed to marcus that it was thinning slightly as the sun climbed away from the eastern horizon a slightly brighter spot in the grey silus cast a critical eye at the ascending spot of light nodding decisively this lot will have burned off in an hour or so so mount up and follow me i want to be safe on the far side of the hill before it clears and out of sight of anyone looking out for us they rode carefully across the grassy expanse at one point scattering a flock of sheep that was grazing in their path marcus looked around for any sign of their herder tightening a hand on the hilt of his sword even as he wondered whether he could kill an innocent to maintain the secrecy of their task but the running sheep were swallowed by the mist without any sign of their keeper hes probably still asleep he looked around to find qadir at his shoulder the chestnut trotting easily with the last of the rivers moisture steaming off her body its his lucky day then the hamian raised an eyebrow and you could have put an innocent sheep herder to the sword the roman shook his head indecisively i dont know but i suspect our new decurion could qadir nodded knowingly i think the word youre looking for is pragmatist and i suspect were all going to have to stretch our principles if were going to release the votadini from their new rulers excingus woke felicia with a gentle shake in the dawns first light wrinkling his nose and pointing at the stream by which the small detachment was camped you smell my dear like a polecat come on lets get you into the water and make you bearable for the rest of the day she shook her head painfully aware of the knife still tied to her thigh and certain to be discovered if she were forced to disrobe in front of the guardsmen if you think im going to take my clothes off in front of these men the legion soldier who felicia had caught staring at her several times the previous day stood up from his place by the fire and ran his eyes up and down her body the insolent smile playing across his lips in direct contradiction to his cold stare alongside him rapax looked up from his breakfast and shook his head with a snort of amusement steady maximus recall what i said to you and you might still be breathing by sunset as for you madam go and have a wash before i come over there and throw you into the water my colleague isnt going to give you any problems hes not that way inclined youve got more chance of persuading a sausage to stand up than you have of getting a twitch out of his wrinkle stick she glared at the praetorian for a moment before standing feeling the knifes hard length against her flesh and thinking quickly excingus led her up the riverbank away from the small camps bustle and into the trees that lined the streams banks until they reached a small pool he pointed impatiently at the water clearly not willing to walk any farther get your clothes off and wash here felicia submitted with a show of meekness pulling off her stola folding it up and putting it down on the grass then removed her boots and turned to the waiting corn officer centurion please could you give me a little privacy im un happy enough given my circumstances without having you stare at me like a slave in the market excingus shrugged spreading his hands wide didnt you hear my colleague i madam regard the prospect of your naked body with all the anticipation i would normally reserve for looking at that tree he sighed shaking his head slightly then turned away speaking to the foliage in front of him very well you have your modesty for now at least although you must realise that it will be cruelly torn away from you when the time comes rapax will protect you until then to keep you unsullied until the right moment but hell be quite merciless once your aquila boy is within earshot speaking of your boyfriend id be curious to know how the two of you ended up together werent you the wife of a senior officer felicia worked quickly as she replied keeping her voice level to avoid exciting his suspicions if you want to know about my former husband the storys quite simple he was a brutal man and no stranger to the idea of rape when he felt like it he used to say it was just spicing things up she unstrapped the knife from her thigh and dropped it into one of her boots before pulling off her tunic and stepping into the pool gasping at the waters cold he used to tell me he knew i enjoyed it once he had me helpless on my back or pinned face down across a table with a handful of my hair to keep me there he was a monster pure and simple she climbed out of the water and dressed quickly strapping the sheath back around her thigh beneath her tunics thick wool he didnt restrict his outrages to me to judge from the little i heard about his behaviour towards the men who served under him he was killed by one of them on the battlefield a few months ago and i expect it was no more than he deserved pulling on her stola as the centurion turned back to face her she smiled wanly and nodded her thanks the corn officers eyes narrowed thoughtfully as he digested the fact that her husband was dead was he a wealthy man felicia shrugged dismissively adjusting her clothes he had a modest estate in rome i believe and youre not interested in how you might benefit she shook her head her hands spreading in a dismissive gesture i have no entitlement you know that well enough and i dont want to touch anything of his ever again but the money i want nothing from him i have all i want for this life and when weve killed young aquila what will you have then surely youd be better off returning to rome and taking your husbands property than staying here in poverty i could help you for a consideration she turned hard eyes on him understanding for the first time the depth of his cynicism im sure you could you could strongarm my husbands family from their home or worse and then install me there as your creature forever on your hook as the woman that consorted with a traitor just a betrayal away from disgrace and even execution but youre forgetting one thing centurion in all your schemes of another mans money excingus smiled wryly back into her anger and that would be what exactly she straightened her back holding the stare with which she had him fixed you havent found marcus yet and you havent faced him with swords in his hands be careful what you wish for centurion because you might not like what happens when you get it dubnus stretched his stiff body cursing the suspicion that had driven him to pad his bedroll with clothes until it looked to the casual eye like a sleeping man preparation for a vigil that had stretched through the night with his sword drawn for the attack he felt would be inevitable now that the halfcentury had seen his wounds with his endurance stretched to the point of exhaustion and his body craving sleep more than at any time he could recall he had stayed ready to kill the first man through the tents flap if there were any sign that foul play was planned now with the dawns onset his eyelids were redrimmed slits in a face grey with fatigue hed heard the soldiers talking into the late evening until the authoritative tones of their watch officer had sent them to their blankets and silence had fallen and suspected that their talk had mainly been a discussion of just how vulnerable their new centurion suddenly seemed and yet no attack had materialised making his nightlong vigil seem an act of folly given the temptation to surrender to sleep he closed his eyes and saw marcuss face willing himself to be strong for his friend and the woman to whom he would soon be married and remembering why hed taken such a risk in coming north before his wound was fully healed the tent flap flicked open light flooding the small spaces interior and the dozing centurion snapped awake cursing his weakness even as he tried to work out how long he might have slept lifting the swords point to strike his stared bleary eyed at the doorway waiting for the first of them to come through and die on his blade a figure darkened the tents interior as it blocked out the light and dubnuss poised swordhand drew back six inches as the exhausted centurion prepared for the lunge that would put his gladius clean through the other mans guts and out of his back centurion the sword stopped a handspan from tituss defenceless stomach and dubnus closed his eyes and blew out a compressed breath at the thought of how close hed come to killing his subordinate the other man stepped into the tent brushing aside the weapon and staring wide eyed at him i came to invite you to speak with the men theyve been talking dubnus smiled weakly i heard them the watch officer shook his head in amazement and you assumed that since theyd seen your wound it would only be a matter of time before they decided to do away with you in the night so you sat up all night waiting for them with a drawn sword no disrespect centurion but you need to get your head straight my lads have spent half the night telling each other how big your balls are while youve been sat here sweating like a legionarys foreskin on payday i suggest that you take a moment to get into the right frame of mind to listen to what they have to say without taking your iron to the first man that opens his mouth sir come on ill help you get into your armour an abashed dubnus stepped out of his tent a few minutes later and walked slowly across to face the forty men standing waiting for him titus snapped out the order and the detachment stood to attention with a precision that raised his eyebrows he turned to the watch officer and gestured with an open hand for him to say his piece centurion the soldiers of this detachment have given consideration to the things that youve said to us since taking command we couldnt fail to notice that youve matched us stride for stride with a hole in your side barely healed over youve made us consider how we want to be regarded by our brother soldiers since youve left us in no doubt as to how were seen at the moment we dont consider ourselves to be cowards but we can see how our actions on the road to sailors town make us look like exactly that so the men have decided to take you at your word and to put everything we can into proving that we can fight like men and regain our reputation he shut his mouth and stood in silence waiting for the centurion to react to his mens declaration of intent but before dubnus could make any response a soldier in the front rank stepped smartly forward stamped to attention and then spoke out his face reddening as he plunged into what was evidently a rare public display we want to prove that we mean what the watch officers said to you centurion we can all see that youre a fighting man out in the field again and you with a wound not right yet and it makes us feel ashamed of what weve come to we want to take a detachment name something that means something to all of us and reminds us of our promise to do better every time you give us an order dubnus nodded resisting the temptation to smile at the mans blushing discomfort and that name would be habitus centurion wed like to use the old centurions name to make us strong again and to remind us what were promising you dubnus smiled gently but in respect of the sentiment rather than the manner of its delivery detachment habitus the old boy would probably be proud to have his name used for inspiration like that you realise that you risk tarnishing his honour if you go looking for a fight and then fail to stand firm when you find it wherever he is now you cant risk bringing shame to his name by doing this thing lightly he looked across the ranks with his eyes suddenly hard with conviction i wont accept any man running from battle if you go through with the idea in fact ill be behind you waiting to cut down any man that runs in the face of the enemy the soldier looked at titus and the watch officer stepped forward to speak again we understand that centurion you can kill any man that runs from a fight while we serve under centurion habituss name were all agreed on that dubnus shrugged turning away to his tent to hide the twitching of his mouth that was threatening to break into a smile very well in that case wed best be putting some more miles under our feet were not going to find you a fight sitting on our arses here get these tents struck and your boots on the road detachment habitus drust watched with satisfaction as the last of the cavalry cohort that had pursued his men north crested the ridge to the forts west and vanished from view a sensible decision by their tribune id say no point sitting here and watching us scratch our arses for the next few days eh calgus well wait here for a few hours just to be sure then head north and find this detachment the captive told us all about turning to discover the source of the selgovae chiefs silence he found the other mans face sombre whats the matter i would have thought youd be pleased to see the back of them you can strike out for your homelands now or stay with us if you will but either way their threat is lifted calgus pursed his lips shaking his head slightly its all a bit too easy drust too easy by a long way i know that tribune of old and hes not the type to turn his back and walk away that quickly therell be men left behind them you can be sure of that watching and waiting to signal to the rest of them that were on the move drust shook his head laughing softly at the other mans caution nobody could ever accuse you of underestimating your enemy calgus apart from allowing them to break into your camp and slaughter your army that is once burned forever cautious eh well just to make you happy ill send a scouting party out to make sure theyve really all left five hundred men ought to be able to clean the landscape of any watchers theyve left behind the volunteer squadron took a late breakfast once they had reached the southern face of the hills beyond the river tuidius each rider feeding his mount with oats from the sack tied to his saddle before sitting down to eat his own meal of dried meat and hard cheese leaving the horses to crop the grass where they were hobbled the hills to the north loomed above the group their screelittered upper slopes glittering with dew in the suns pale morning light silus ate on his feet staring hard to the east and chewing vigorously on a chunk of pork marcus stood and walked across to him what next decurion up and over the hills he waited patiently while the other man chewed hard for a moment and then swallowed with a grimace washing the tough wad of meat down with a slug of water from his water skin waving a hand at the hills to the north over that lot not likely theyre a death trap to cavalry littered with small stones that will break a horses leg or make it fall and throw the rider and the slopes are steeper than they look from here no i think well just take a gentle trot along the line of these foothills towards the coast in an extended line and see what we can scare out of the landscape not that i expect to find anyone this far from the ford well cross the hills in a few miles when theyre a bit less risky and aim to meet the road such as it is about five miles north of the ford if my guess is correct that will put us well to the north of any scouts hiding to watch the crossing and in the best possible position to intercept them when they make a run back to the fortress he turned to face the men sat eating on the hills gentle slope get your nosebag down you and get back on your feet weve a nice long ride ahead of us the praetorians were still eating their breakfast at the roadside when a pair of message riders clattered down the road from the north reining in their horses as rapax stepped on to the hard surface and flagged them down both men throwing crisp salutes to the centurion as they dismounted the battlescarred officer returned them with a swift gesture waving a hand at the fire im rapax centurion of the fourth cohort praetorian guard and these are my men were marching north in pursuit of a fugitive from imperial justice and hoping for news of events that might lead us to him come and join us for a short time and share what you know with us well do our best to repay you with whatever we have left over from our meal the pair nodded their thanks to the soldiers as they shuffled round to make a space for them to squat in the fires warmth one of them glancing with a horsemans interest at the mounts tied to trees around the clearing rapax handed them a piece of bread apiece warm from the fires edge you bear news from the north the more senior of the two nodded his mouth full of bread speaking in staccato sentences as he ate we defeated the rebels four days ago centurion broke into their camp and massacred the selgovae but the venicones got away thousands of them and weve been hunting them ever since they took refuge in three mountains the lack of comprehension on the centurions face took him aback for a moment ah its a large fortress about fifteen miles to the north abandoned and burned out when the barbarians came south they captured one of our officers and tortured something out of him we dont really know what but weve pulled back to get them to leave the fort our tribune thinks they might be moving to attack one of the auxiliary cohorts for some reason excingus glanced across the fire at him a look of mild curiosity on his face an auxiliary cohort ive got a cousin serving with one of the cohorts that defends the wall begins with a t from memory tungrians thats the cohort they seem to have gone after the corn officer wrinkled his forehead in apparent concentration tungrians no thats not it perhaps it was a v anyway youre riding south to take the news to the governor id imagine the doublepay man nodded sagely while his silent companion put a hand to his belt in an apparent search for some item or other yes well be at noisy valley before dark and briefing message riders to take the word to wherever the governor is eight thousand barbarian warriors at three mountains and expected to head north soon possibly heading to intercept the tungrian detachment sent to free the dinpaladyr his colleague shook his head in exasperation evidently unable to find whatever it was he was searching for and stood with an apologetic shrug at the man next to him itll be in my saddlebag wont be a moment excinguss eyes narrowed the dinpaladyr the seated horseman hurried to explain the term local tongue sir it translates as the fortress of a thousand spears or something close to it excingus raised an eyebrow its the capital of the votadini tribe centurion the tungrians and a few of our lads have been sent north to free it from the last of the selgovae though why the venicones should want to stick their nose in is beyond rapax rammed his dagger up through the cavalrymans throat springing up from his squatting position and reaching to his belt for another blade as the second rider ran the last few paces to his horse and leapt astride it jabbing his booted heels into its sides pulling his arm back and holding the thin sliver of iron by the side of his head for a split second he flicked the knife forward with a fluid jerk that sent it across the clearing in a splitsecond flash of polished metal to strike the fleeing horseman in the back of the neck he teetered for a moment stunned by the sudden intense pain but managed to keep his seat as his mount clattered away down the road lost to view in seconds rapax shook his head staring after the wounded man for a moment before turning back to his stunned soldiers you can bring her out now excingus stood the shock of the cavalrymans death starting to wear off but with his face furrowed with incomprehension one moment im having a perfectly civilised conversation with a man who clearly has no idea of our little secret and the next thing i know im watching you butcher the poor bastard and hurl the cutlery around as if youve got something to prove might i enquire quite whats got into you rapax pulled his dagger from the dead mans throat wiping the blade on the sleeve of his tunic your man here was clueless all right but his mate had worked out what was going on all that playacting about looking for something that just happened to be in his saddlebag that was just a pretext to let him get back to his horse without alarming us i only realised it when he took one last look at the horses and at one horse in particular hers he pointed to felicia as she emerged from the trees with a guardsman at her back i saw him do it as they walked to the fire and thought nothing of it just a horseman taking a natural interest in our animals but as he walked back to his horse he did it again he gave her horse a good hard stare and he wasnt walking like a man who was going to open his saddlebag and dig something out of it he was winding himself up to jump on the horse and leave his mate here to face the music excinguss face creased as he considered the situation if youre right then he must have recognised the doctors horse and put two and two together in which case we have a problem the praetorian shook his head dismissively not really i put that throwing knife clean through the back of his neck so id guess hell be dead from loss of blood before hes ridden five miles there isnt another unit on the road all the way back to noisy valley not with all the fun and games happening south of the wall no i think our secret will be safe enough once he bleeds out and dies by the side of the road and now given what weve just learned perhaps we should consider how to find this fortress of spears our dead friend here was so eager to tell us about excingus nodded its probably safe to assume that this road north will eventually lead us to the three mountains fortress perhaps once were there well find something to help us dubnus took the men of his detachment up the north road at the double march a pace calculated to get thirty miles under a soldiers boots in a marching day while driving him to but never beyond the point of exhaustion hed explained the need for more speed to them as they strapped on their equipment unburdening himself as to the purpose of their mission north of the wall a good friend of mine an officer falsely accused of treason is serving with my cohort somewhere out here theyre probably tracking down the last of the selgovae now that their warbands been scattered his woman was the doctor in the noisy valley hospital until a pair of roman centurions took her prisoner and carried her away north of the wall they plan to use her as bait to draw him in id imagine put him to the sword and then finish her off at their leisure and that since i owe my friend my crest and vine stick is not going to happen if i have anything to do with the matter the watch officer had spoken quietly to him while the detachment were forming ranks for the days march and putting their tents on to the ox cart that would follow along behind them a look of disbelief on his bruised face so you have no idea where these romans may have taken your fellow officers woman they could be anywhere within a hundred miles of here hed nodded grimly tightening his belt yes but youre missing something theyre from rome theyll have no more idea of where to look for my friend marcus than we do and all they can do is follow the road north and look for information as to his whereabouts and when they get that information so will we well march at the double today itll be good training for your lads and make sure that we lose as little ground to them as possible given that theyre riding and were using boot leather now get your boys moving weve a long way to go and no time to waste talking about it the previous days fifteen miles had hurt more than hed have cared to admit both from his lack of exercise over the previous weeks and the effects of prolonged double marching on the freshly healed wound which tugged and dragged with every step but dubnus knew that to show any sign of weakness would only undermine the new resolve that his men had displayed that morning driving them on through his example he pushed himself through first the discomfort and then as the pace started to sink its claws into his stomach and lungs the pain of the march sweat running down his back beneath his armour to soak his tunic over an hour into the march and reaching deep into his reserves of endurance waiting for the agony searing his chest to abate as his longdelayed second wind took effect he snapped his head up as a familiar sound reached his ears cover quickly and keep your wits about you the detachment scattered for the verge pulling on their helmets and throwing their pack poles into the trees as they readied themselves to fight their faces set in determination not to be found wanting a second time dubnus waited on the edge of the forest with his sword drawn grimacing at the realisation that the detachment were alone in the heartlands of an enemy who recently defeated or not could still leave his men dead and dying with only a fraction of the strength still available to them the sound of hoof beats strengthened over the space of a few moments until to his relief a single horseman trotted over the roads brow the riders cavalry uniform gave him an instant of satisfaction until he realised that the man was half out of his saddle and sagging precariously on the brink of falling to the roads hard surface he stepped into the road gesturing his men forward to intercept the slowing horse and ease the semiconscious cavalryman to the ground eyes slitted and breathing stertorously the rider was pulled carefully from his saddle his head lolling back to reveal a bloodcaked sliver of metal protruding from his throat the soldier helping him ease the riders weight to the ground goggled at the wound fuck me hes been shivved dubnus turned the semiconscious man on to his side pain forgotten as he assessed the magnitude of the wound inflicted by a thin knife buried in his neck from back to front its a throwing knife this man was running from something or someone when whoever it was put this into him with enough accuracy to very nearly kill him on the spot a fraction to the right and hed have dropped dead within a dozen paces and as it is he didnt finish the sentence eyes narrowing as the riders eyes opened and found his own the mans hand clutching convulsively at his arm with surprising strength he spoke his voice no more than a whisper praetorian killed us both dubnus bent close to his ear speaking quietly but clearly to the dying man a praetorian officer and a tent party of guardsmen the rider nodded with painful slowness the metal blade bisecting his neck making the effort horribly painful and a fresh rivulet of blood spilled down the curve of his throat saw her horse know it anywhere her horse the doctors horse the rider nodded again a little more weakly this time as more of his blood spilled on to the grass beneath him message for governor venicones going north licinius says to din dinpal dinpaladyr the certainty in dubnuss voice closed the dying mans eyes in what seemed a combination of relief and exhaustion a long slow breath draining out of him with no more power behind it than was sufficient to maintain the processes of his life with his eyes closed he spoke again his voice now softer than before as he grasped at the last of his bodys fastebbing strength on my belt purse for my woman dubnus bent close to the dying riders face a note of urgency coming into his voice as he sensed the mans spirit slipping between his fingers and ill pay the ferryman for you but which woman and where the words were so quiet as to be nearly inaudible the riders last breath easing them into the still morning air as little more than the noise made by his lips as he uttered them waterside clodia he lay still and dubnus bent close to listen for any more breath at length getting back on to his feet and shaking his head decisively hes gone dig that purse out and lets see if he has a small coin for the ferryman the rest goes into my pack and well go and find his woman when this is all over and done with and quickly now that wound will have killed him before hed ridden far from the scene of the attack which means that were closer to them than i could have hoped he stared up the roads long grey ribbon the earlier agony of the forced march forgotten as he calculated how far ahead of the detachment felicias abductors might be his voice when he turned to face his men was harsh with purpose form ranks for the march were going to catch up with this mans murderer and show him and his men what happens when they kidnap the wrong person the watch officer squinted at him from his place alongside the detachments ranks and if theyve already found your man and killed him what if this doctors already dead dubnus spat noisily on the verges damp grass well then watch officer titus well spend a suitable amount of time making every one of them that lives regret his part in the matter he turned north waving his hand forward in command any man that falls out of the line today gets left behind to live or die alone so well have no thoughts of slacking march the morning sun was less than halfway to its zenith when the selgovae watchers waiting in the hills to the north of the tuidiuss last fording point before the river reached the sea saw the first sign that the expected roman advance had arrived they had been waiting three days when the first of the roman cohorts that they had been set to watch for marched down to the rivers edge and both men were dirty and tired time for us to run right iudicael the chief scout a man chosen by the leader of the men occupying the dinpaladyr for his steadiness under any circumstances simply shook his head and kept watching as the leading cohort splashed into the rivers shallow water the soldiers driven forward by the inaudible shouts and curses of their officers as they hurried to form an initial defence of the fords northern bank these are romans they do everything according to their rules they wont be moving any farther north than they have to until theyve got every last man across the river he looked up at the sky ill wager you gold to horse shit theyll not be ready to move on until well after the middle of the day no theres no rush for us to run for the fortress besides how often is it that you get the chance to watch the idiots playing their soldier games his companion grunted a reluctant agreement settling back into the grass to watch the roman advance guard running to take up their defensive positions around the ford why do they take such precautions when theres no enemy to be seen for miles iudicael shook his head a wry smile on his face they have a way of doing everything that is agreed and written down and practised and nothing will tempt them to break these rules not even simple common sense not only will they form a defence on the northern bank for the rest of their men to cross behind but theyll defend the southern bank against attack from the rear too they are creatures of habit and for that we can be grateful the venicone warriors chosen to scour the ground around the three mountains fortress were more than a little reluctant to carry out such a menial task until drust announced a handsome sum in gold for any man that delivered a roman spy to him and double that sum if the captive were still capable of talking suddenly enthused to their task and persuaded by their king that the romans must have set at least one man to watch them for any sign of movement the tribesmen scattered in all directions across the hills surrounding the camp probing with their swords and spears into any vegetation or feature that looked capable of concealing even the most improbably small of romans but without any satisfactory result after several hours of increasingly dispirited searching the majority of them had given it up as a bad job and trudged back into the ruined forts walls with their dreams of fortune shattered king drust watched his men return from their fruitless hunt with a slight smile and there you are calgus it seems as if your caution praiseworthy though it was has overestimated our enemies on this occasion it seems that the romans have made a complete exit and surrendered the ground to us that silverhaired tribune was probably under orders to get his men south and start carving up the brigantes i must confess that i cannot avoid the humour in their having risen to the fight just a week too late to have been any use to your dreams of conquest his careless insult left the selgovae leader untroubled since in truth calgus was not listening to the words directed at him staring out to the west he was wondering exactly how the roman spies that he was sure would have been left to keep watch on the venicone warband had evaded discovery scaurus and laenas stood on the slope of a low hill and watched as the legionaries of the first cohort crossed the ford the distant sound of shouting reaching the two men as the cohorts centurions roared out their orders and chivvied their men to carry them out with more speed martos stood to one side just out of earshot his face set hard while he watched the detachments men crossing the tuidius laenas rubbed his chin staring down from their vantage point as his men fanned out to their defensive positions quickly building a wall of shields and spears against any potential attacker im somewhat surprised that theres no opposition rutilius scaurus given that you think theyll have a good idea that were coming wouldnt you think that the barbarians would have been better advised to attack us here while were split on two sides of the river scaurus shook his head waving a hand at the crossing if theyd been waiting for us it would be far more in keeping for them to have been actually lined up on the riverbank waving their spears and daring us to cross besides that i dont think there will be enough of them to mount a defence of the river not against our numbers whoevers leading them probably has no more than four to five hundred tribesmen with him and the votadini wont be cooperating with them not given the murder of their king the men calgus sent to take control were probably as nice as you like until they were inside the fortress but after that id imagine that things have been rather ugly for martoss people not to mention his family have you ever seen the dinpaladyr the other man shook his head shooting a surprised glance at his colleague ive not been north of the wall in all the time ive served here have you scaurus smiled taking a deep breath of the cool autumn air before replying oh yes ive been all over this ground i was tasked to scout the tribes to the north of the brigantes territory before this revolt ever started to have a good look at them and report back as to how they would react if calgus called for war against us he wasnt exactly an unknown threat despite the fact that the speed of his attack took the last governor somewhat by surprise you came this far north in the teeth of a civil war with how many men just one my bodyguard arminius was more than enough protection against the risk of an attempted robbery and two men on horseback have a far better chance of fading into the landscape than a squadron laenas looked at him with a new respect and your conclusions scaurus shrugged nothing that wasnt expected the selgovae were burning to go to war the carvetii would follow them on principle and it was a cointoss as to whether the votadini would be willing to abandon their favoured trading status with the empire and align themselves with calgus just how disastrous that decision turned out to be is borne out by their current predicament during my scouting i made a point of getting a look around their main fortress just in case we might find ourselves on the outside and in need of getting inside and its impressive enough built on a huge plug of rock that rises out of the ground like a sleeping dogs back almost sheer on one side and still sloping steeply enough on the other that even the only possible route of attack would be an uphill battle all the way the votadini have ringed the hilltop with a palisade of mature tree trunks thousands of them so that from a distance it looks like a fence of spears their name for it translates as the fortress of a thousand spear shafts and if its defended by men who know what theyre doing id say its pretty much impregnable unless an attacker can bring artillery to bear on it and even then could it be burned out with a big enough catapult to get a missile over a wall that high and with a good supply of oil to set light to the buildings behind it yes neither of which we have in our possession of course short of that the only way into that fortress is going to be something that weve never lacked as a people those roman strengths that the empire was built upon this is going to come down to a combination of oldfashioned guile and ruthlessness the scouts waited until the sun was almost at its zenith before moving on the rivers grassy plain below them the last roman troops were marching into the ford from the rivers southern bank and the soldiers on the northern bank were forming up for the remainder of the days march iudicael nodded decisively lets be away now theyll be moving soon enough keep flat until were over the top of the hill and the risk of being spotted is gone and then we ride for the fortress his comrade nodded and the two men squirmed away from their hiding place over the flat hills summit confident that their movement would go unnoticed given the organised chaos on the plain below once over the hilltop they stood hurrying down the slope to where their horses were tethered by a small lake momentarily relaxing with the release of pressure once they were out of sight of the cohorts camped on the hills far side they were brought up short by the sudden realisation that their horses were missing from the trees to which they had been tethered before either of them could react to the loss a man rose from the grass to their left and called a warning to them in their own language his accent rough but understandable i only need one of you alive and there are men all around you surrender to us now or one of you will die quickly the other slowly surrender to us now and i guarantee you your lives the older of the two froze looking about him for the speaker but the younger tribesman bolted without a second thought running hard towards the lake an arrow whistled through the warm air and dropped him into the hillsides long grass with his legs still kicking out his death throes and iudicael raised both hands watching with resignation as the hillsides long grass around him came alive with armed men the soldiers spread out quickly their weapons facing outwards in defence while three of them walked past his comrades stilltwitching body without breaking step their uniforms put paid to any last hope hed had of the ambush being a mistake and the small groups leader gave him a dismissive look tie his hands and put him on his horse i want this man in front of the tribune as quickly as possible he turned back to iudicael with a hardfaced stare and youd best make your mind up before we get there with your mate dead youre the only source of information weve got as to whats happening inside the fortress of spears and were going to squeeze everything you know out of you in the next few hours that can either happen in a nice quiet and calm way or it can take a lot of shouting and screaming most of it being done by you but the end results going to be just the same me id prefer it if we just had a nice chat and you told us what you know without any nastiness ive heard enough of your lot screaming their lungs out in agony for one year but only you can decide how its going to be and once we get into camp youre going to be asked a lot of difficult questions by some men who are in too much of a hurry to worry about hurting your feelings so start thinking the volunteer squadron rode down the shallow hill up which the legion detachment were leading the way and presented themselves to the command group riding at the cohorts rear silus jumped down from his horse with a smart salute to scaurus and gestured to the surviving selgovae scout with a flourish as promised tribune heres the last of the men sent to watch for our approach scaurus returned his salute and turned his horse from the line of march before climbing down and walking across to look closely at the captive well done decurion youve allowed us to steal a march on the men holding the votadini captive tribune licinius will have to confirm your promotion but i cant see him arguing with my decision given this success from this moment on youre a decurion well done silus saluted again then tipped his head to the prisoner thank you tribune what would you like me to do with this scaurus flicked an indifferent glance at iudicael who was sitting helplessly with his hands bound in front of him im not sure theres much point in trying to get any information out of him we know everything that we need to know about the dinpaladyr and anything he tells us about the votadini holding it will likely be false i think ill just give him to martos for entertainment when we camp tonight he never tires of the opportunity to send another selgovae to hades with his balls in his mouth silus nodded and saluted once more turning to take the horses reins and lead it away spare me lord and i will tell you everything i know i swear to tell you the truth i swear to my gods cocidius and maponus not to deceive you scaurus met the tribesmans imploring eyes with a cold stare raising an eyebrow and snorting derision you werent listening selgovae i already know everything i need to know about the dinpaladyr youre of more value to me as an offering to the votadini prince your master betrayed and left to die than for whatever stories you think you can fool me with the captive bent over his bound hands in supplication i can tell you much that you cannot know lord i can tell you who holds the fortress how many warriors he commands how much food they have he fell silent as scaurus stared hard into his eyes then nodded to silus well have the prisoner down from his horse if you please decurion and you whatever your name is the second i think youre lying to me ill have you hamstrung and left to die here im sure there are wolf packs roaming these hills that would appreciate the gift you can start with the name of the man calgus sent to take the fortress the venicones marched from the remains of the three mountains fort soon after noon with drust and calgus at their head the venicone king took a deep breath of the days cool air watching as his scouts loped forward up the road to the north its good to be able to move without the bloody romans dogging our steps well march to the north until were over these hills then turn east and head for the dinpaladyr lets hope that your men are still in command of it calgus marching alongside him in the chill morning air laughed tersely theyll still be there i sent one of my more energetic men to take a firm grip of the selgovae and if i know him half as well as i think i do hell be riding them harder than theyve experienced for many a year ive visited the fortress on more than one occasion and i can assure you that without a legions catapults these tungrians will still be camped out in front of those walls when we arrive scratching their heads as to how they might get inside once your warriors have rolled over them and taken revenge for us both ill gather my men from inside the fortress and take them west to our own hills the venicone king raised an eyebrow youll return to your land why would you risk going back to the very place that the romans will be busy putting back under their boots even as we speak if they catch you theyll drag your guts out while you watch and leave you for the crows your people will have a bitter winter ahead at the hands of the legions and they may not be happy to protect you given the size of your defeat why not come north with us and spend the winter in the safety of the hills beyond the river clut calgus walked in silence for a moment before replying it might be safer for me to take up your offer but we both know that the legions wont be off my peoples land any time soon their cohorts will return to the forts that stud the road north from their wall and their detachments will roam our hills as they wish my people will be forbidden to gather without hardfaced centurions watching their every move ready to set their dogs on us again at the first excuse my people will suffer under their yoke once more and if i desert them in such a time of need i will be unable to face any of the men that accompany me with any sense of honour he stretched still stiff from his nights sleep i must return to take up the fight for them or the slaughter of so many good men in our uprising will be without meaning and besides weve been subject to their whims since before my grandfather was born and weve always managed to make them pay a high price for the pleasure of treading our land both in men and gold theres an unfinished war waiting for me in the west so while i thank you for the offer of protection i cannot accept it and remain my own man drust shrugged his eyes bright with the pleasure of marching without the roman cavalrys constant threat the offer stands you may feel differently when this last fight is over on the hillside high above three mountains soldier caius waited until the tribesmen were well clear of the fort poking away a lump of turf from the front of his hide to afford himself a better view of the sunlit ground below him satisfied that the warband was on the march he bent his back and scattered the turf roof as he stood up in a shower of dirt brushing soil from his armour he turned away from the empty fort and started to run heading down the hills flank at an easy jog as he headed for the meeting point agreed the previous day after an hours run he trotted breathlessly up to the waiting cavalrymen taking a moment to get his breath and gulp from a water skin before climbing wearily on to his horse and turning south tribune licinius received his report with a curt nod turning to his first spear once caius had finished his brief account a note for the pay records first spear soldier caius to be credited five hundred denarii for his retirement pension as we agreed this morning messengers are to be sent south with a report for the governor and a full squadron is to be sent north immediately with orders to track the barbarians without being detected and report back three times a day well follow up at a respectable distance and wait to see what develops but there is to be no attempt to engage the venicones without my direct orders the next time drust sees our dragon banner i want it to be across a battlefield detachment habitus staggered on to the ruined forts parade ground on legs that seemed incapable of making another step half of dubnuss command were leaning on their spears rather than carrying them and even their centurion was grey with exhaustion after the days exertion bellowing a command that restored some semblance of military order he walked out in front of the soldiers with a tired but satisfied smile didnt think you could do that did you youve marched the best part of thirty miles today and youre still all on your feet and ready to fight he paused to share a moment of dark humour with those men whose heads were still up even if you do look like youve been beaten with hammers he turned away and spread his arms wide to direct their attention to the burnedout shell of a fort that stood before them this detachment habitus is yew tree fort earlier on today we passed the forts at roaring river and red river the soldiers had spared the first of the wrecked forts no more than a passing glance too deep in the effort of their forced march to care what they were passing although more than a few of them had given red rivers burnedout shell a longing stare as theyd ground past it in the early afternoon their hopes of camping there for the night dashed as their centurions pace had continued unchanged we are less than a days march from three mountains which is where i expect the men that murdered those cavalry messengers will be camping tonight you might all be dead on your feet but youve kept in touch with the men were hunting which is all that matters now get your tents up light the watch fires and feed yourselves then sort your feet out and get into your blankets we march for three mountains at first light and youre going to need your wits about you titus followed dubnus as he walked away from the organised chaos of tent erection and made his way to the stream that would eventually swell to become the red river centurion do you really believe that we can catch a party of men on horseback the men are shattered after todays march and well be lucky to get as much as twenty miles out of them tomorrow dubnus turned away from the swiftflowing stream and nodded his agreement youre right i made a calculated gamble today that something might slow down the men holding my friends woman and give us the chance to take them unawares id hoped that they might have delayed long enough at their camp last night for that to happen but my gamble failed the detachment had come upon the praetorians campfire less than an hour after resuming their march the embers still smoking gently and the other cavalrymans corpse face down in the bloody grass beside it felicias captors had clearly mounted up and headed north without wasting the time required to give the murdered man any dignity in death and neither had the detachment made anything but the briefest of stops to confirm that he was indeed dead from grim necessity they had left his corpse where he had fallen like that of the man who had ridden south from the scene of his comrades murder before succumbing to the knife wound in his throat untended other than for a coin hastily slipped into his mouth dubnus grimaced his distaste at the days compromises it didnt come any easier to me to leave those cavalrymen lying unburied than it did to you were soldiers and were taught from our first day never to leave a fallen comrade as carrion but the needs of the living are greater than those of the dead in this case and so tomorrow watch officer titus and despite the fact that all of our legs will be as stiff as spears we will climb from our sleep at dawn and head north again wont these praetorians just ride on again tomorrow and vanish into the hills dubnus turned to face him which would leave us in the middle of enemy territory forty men at the mercy of whoever comes by and with no idea of what to do next titus remained silent but dubnus could see from the set of his face that his estimation of the watch officers concerns was accurate he smiled gently more than likely and yet to gain the possibility of catching these bastards and freeing my friends woman from her likely rape and murder i would take that risk and many worse without a thought thats what it means to be a tungrian now go and get your men moving theyre shuffling around as if theyre already asleep and the quicker we put them into their blankets the better theyre going to feel when i root them out again at dawn and when youre done join me for a while before we turn in id like to hear the story of how you got those bruises he was sitting next to the centurys cooking fire in his tunic by the time titus had finished his rounds of the guards and looked on as the watch officer pulled off his helmet and rubbed at his sweatmoistened hair standing with his back to the fire luxuriating in its heat as the evenings air turned cool titus looked down at his new centurion with a face made taut by the anger he was clearly still feeling you asked how i got these marks the answers simple enough i got jumped in the dark soon after our fight with the brigantes on the road to sailors town my attacker hit me from behind without any warning and as a result he put me down with one punch while i was down on my knees he then kicked me in the head good and hard a few times just to be sure i wouldnt be able to get up and give him any sort of fight then when he knew that i wouldnt be getting up again and in the mistaken belief that i was already insensible he bent over and said a few choice words to me that was his mistake because i might have been flat out with my head spinning but i still had enough of my wits intact to recognise him it was a soldier from my own century a nasty piece of work called maximus who id had call to discipline more than once he took his chance to get some revenge that dark night and less than an hour later walked into a bar fight that went wrong and put him in the fortress cells with a murder charge on his head and that would have been fine with me except that the men were chasing up this road turned up and took him with them as a replacement for a man they lost on the road to noisy valley dubnus leaned back stretching his body to test the stillhealing spear wound i see so you have nearly as big an interest in catching these men as i do that would explain your encouragement of their change of heart titus nodded his face hard yes centurion i do and ill drive these lads along just as hard as you will to get my chance at a rematch the praetorians rode north from three mountains at daybreak the next morning following the trail that the venicones had stamped into the ground on either side of the rough trail that headed away from the ruined fortress to the north rapax sent a pair of riders north to scout ahead of them with orders to ride back if they spotted any sign of movement either roman or barbarian soon after midday the outriders rode back towards their fellows at a swift canter pointing back towards the north cavalry coming this way ours from the look of it half a dozen of them rapax sent felicia away into the forest with a guardsman and told his men to dismount and act in the manner of soldiers taking a brief rest from the saddle when the riders came down the road towards them it was immediately clear that these were not messengers but soldiers hunting for the enemy with their spears ready for use two barbarian warriors were roped to their horses half running and half staggering along in their wake their leader reined his mount in alongside the guardsmen surveying their unfamiliar uniforms with a jaundiced eye greetings whoever you are were a detachment from the petriana wing with orders to sweep the enemys trail for any stragglers and capture them to use as an example to the venicones before we fight them tomorrow have you seen any more of these scum in your days march rapax stepped forward his face set equally hard rapax centurion praetorian guard no weve seen none of these animals since we were ambushed on the road to noisy valley and lost two good men they eyed each other for a moment before the cavalry officer spoke again his voice a little less aggressive in the face of the praetorians truculence im under orders to sweep as far south as three mountains before turning back weve only seen these two all the way from the roads fork to north and east so youll be safe to push on even if there arent enough of you to put up a fight against any more than a dozen of them perhaps you should wait here and well escort you north when we come back this way the corn officer shook his head stepping to rapaxs side with a slight smile that wont be necessary thank you decurion my escort will be perfectly sufficient for the task given that you seem to have scoured the way ahead clean for us the decurions eyes narrowed as he took in excinguss white tunic and blue cloak yes well in that case well be away and the corn officer raised his hand to forestall their departure you mentioned a fork to the east how far would that be about five miles centurion and from there to the fortress of the spears the decurion shook his head grimly another thirty or so but id not recommend that you try to ride any farther east than the edge of the forest once you reach it youll still be a good twenty miles from the hillfort but theres a big angry warband sat between there and where youre trying to go youd be best setting up camp far enough into the trees that you cant be seen and waiting to see what happens when we bring them to battle tomorrow or more likely the day after either well clear them away or well lose in which case youll be better off heading back to the south excingus nodded his thanks and turned to rapax but turned back when the horseman spoke again centurion the corn officer raised an eyebrow waiting for the inevitable question might i ask whats so important that youre willing to risk the frontier zone with only a few soldiers to protect you if its none of my business you can tell me to keep my nose out but i excingus raised a hand to forestall the decurions apology no problem at all decurion indeed you might even be able to help us just like you were hunting for an enemy of rome the only difference between us is that youre hunting barbarians but our quarry is a roman we need to move faster titus every hour we march at this pace sees them another five miles ahead of us the watch officer met his centurions scowl with a nod of understanding but his face was set in a troubled frown his voice pitched equally low to avoid it carrying to the men marching a dozen paces behind them agreed but look at the state theyre in even you look fit to drop centurion and youre the hardest man here by some distance after yesterday some of these men are just managing to hang on at this pace push them to the double and well break them in short order i say we just keep them moving and aim to get to three mountains with the century still in ranks and marching the centurion nodded reluctantly i know but i can feel them slipping away from me he kept a brooding silence as the century struggled north and his mood was little improved by the sight of three mountains as the fortress came into view in the midafternoon the detachment staggered down the roads long slope towards the burnedout walls their pace increasing as they realised that the ruined defences represented a chance to end their interminable march the leading rank was still two hundred paces from the wrecked west gate when a flurry of activity caught dubnuss eye horsemen form square the legionaries were still struggling into formation around him when he realised that the approaching riders were friendly and he pushed through the detachments disordered ranks standing in place and waiting to greet the cavalrymens leader the decurion reined his horse in alongside the big centurion and nodded his greeting greeting centurion weve been watching you for a while now and my doublepay and i have been pondering what might bring a halfcentury of legionaries north under the command of an auxiliary centurion in fact weve got money riding on what it is youre doing out here so be a good man and enlighten us eh the detachments soldiers watched in exhausted silence as dubnus chatted with the cavalry officer who climbed down from his horse after a moments conversation clapping the big tungrian on the shoulder and then turned to another rider with his hand out squatting he took out his dagger and drew a quick map in the dirt then stood and clasped hands with dubnus remounted and led his men away to the north with a farewell salute the tungrian watched them go for a moment then turned and beckoned titus to join him i told you something would turn up to tell us where to look for them those cavalrymen met up with the men were hunting a while ago and stopped to talk they were heading north and then east riding for the dinpaladyr apparently and making no secret of their mission although felicia was presumably hidden in the forest while they talked their decurion said he was pretty sure that there was something not right with a small party of praetorians riding this far north hunting for a traitor or not never mind the fact that the other centurion in the party was so clearly a nasty piece of work when i told him their purpose and that theyve taken the doctor as a hostage he told me everything he could about them including the fact that your soldier maximus is still riding with them titus nodded his eyes cold with the anticipation of revenge so we keep marching the tungrian shook his head casting a sideways glance at the exhausted legionaries no we need them rested for tomorrows march besides they havent got any more than another few miles in them not without losing half of them by the wayside the decurion told me about a hunters path that cuts the corner on their ride to the north and then east another thirty miles will see us within spitting distance of the spot where he told them to camp for the night and tomorrow seems that theres a venicone warband camped between them and the dinpaladyr and hes advised them to wait it out rather than trying to get around the barbarians theyll be stopped in one place and with one last effort well be able to overtake them and then well see how brave they are if your boys can put away thirty miles tomorrow titus nodded slowly turning to survey his men with hard eyes theyll manage it every one of them they owe me that much ill drive them on until theyre hanging out of their own arseholes the detached cohorts turned from the line of march in the late afternoon of the next day guided by decurion felixs cavalry scouts to a location less than five miles from the votadini fortress as close as the experienced tungrian senior centurions deemed was safe until the sun was beneath the horizon the cohorts centurions were instructed to allow their men to rest and enjoy the unaccustomed luxury of not having to build the customary turfwalled marching camp for the nights stop first spear frontinius gathered his officers and issued a terse set of orders that made very clear what the night held were not stopping here long so tell your men to get their hard tack down their necks and be ready to move the baggage train will be staying here when we move forward so make sure theyve all got their cloaks handy for later on when were hanging about in the dark waiting for the fight to start he stamped off to tribune scauruss officers meeting arriving at the tents entrance at the same time as tribune laenas and his first spear made their way in from the legion cohorts lines to frontiniuss experienced eye well used to looking for the signs as to whether a soldier was more disposed to fight or run when the time came laenas looked nervous but steady enough and his gaze was resolute when the tungrian came to attention and snapped him a salute his subordinate canutius followed him into the tent without ever meeting frontiniuss eye and the latter paused for a moment with a thoughtful look on his face before following him in telling the guards to close the flap and withdraw a dozen paces ill be putting my head out to check on you at some point and if theres any suspicion that you bastards are trying to eavesdrop youll all be dancing to the tickle of the scourge before we go into action inside the tent he found the detachments senior officers assembled and ready every one of them looking serious as the reality of impending combat bore down on them scaurus waited for his signal that the entrance was secured before speaking looking about his officers in the lamps flickering light very well gentlemen lets get down to it now that were all here decurion felix all quiet tribune weve had to take a few hunters prisoner rather than risk them alerting the defenders but none of them resisted and most of them were keen to tell us everything they could about the men holding the fortress theyll stay here with the baggage carts under guard when we move forward and i anticipate no problems with any of them apart from that the ground between here and the objective is clear scaurus nodded approach routes just the one really a nice wide hunters path thatll get us to within two miles of the fortress undetected after that its wide open ground pretty much all the way to the gate so were going to need our deception plan after all first spear frontinius are your men ready frontinius nodded confidently hands on his hips yes tribune my fifth and ninth centuries will be going forward just before first light and attempting an entry to the fortress just as weve discussed before thank you i know i promised the next proper fight to the twentieth legion but given that we seem to be wholly dependent on a fiction that my auxiliaries seem far better experienced to carry off im going to have to put the first tungrians in the first wave im sorry tribune laenas i know how keen you were to take your turn at the sharp end if its any consolation youll have plenty of chance to spill blood for the emperor if tomorrow mornings ruse is a failure although much of it may be roman if were left outside the fortresss walls when its done laenas bowed to his commanders decision with a slight smile of regret but it wasnt the tribune that frontinius was watching so much as his first spear canutiuss face was a study in surprise and relief his cheeks slightly blown out while his eyes lifted to the tents ceiling thanking his gods from the look of it frontinius mused to himself and no kind of support to an uncertain young tribune the other man looked across the tent at him and frontinius nodded keeping his face straight he knows i keep my face expressionless and yet id swear he knows that i despise him probably because he despises himself just as deeply when martos heard that votadini prisoners had been taken by the cavalry scouts he hurried through the sprawling cohorts in search of his people marcus walking alongside him at his request theres no telling what will happen to them if someone doesnt point out that theyre not your enemies not since the his eyes narrowed as he caught sight of half a dozen disconsolatelooking men squatting on the ground at spearpoint fully twice their number of legionaries standing guard over them marcuss face hardened and he took martoss arm before the votadini prince could react restraining the bristling warriors urge to spring to his peoples aid leave this to me he stepped forward searching the guards ranks for whoever was in authority a squinteyed watch officer was the only candidate in sight and as marcus approached he vigorously chewed and swallowed whatever it was hed been eating wiping his mouth with the back of his hand ignoring the mans somewhat halfhearted salute he pointed at the prisoners and shook his head in a show of amazement so tell me why in the name of jupiter first and greatest would these men be under guard theyre our allies or hasnt anybody in the twentieth legion been paying attention for the last week the watch officer dithered in the face of the unknown officers wrath falling back on the timehonoured defence of his superior officer my optio sir he said i was to make sure they dont go anywhere and i thought or you didnt think these men are a valuable source of assistance and information and youve got them looking at the business end of your spears as if they were being kept for sale to the slave traders he caught the look on the mans face and seethed with fresh anger fuck me so thats the game is it fetch your optio here soldier now the young centurion stood tapping one foot impatiently while the watch officer scurried off to unload himself of the responsibility for this unwelcome development his face pale with barely suppressed rage and by the time the optio walked up with a decidedly uncertain look on his face he was very clearly fuming centurion i slaves you were going to slip these men into the slave take were you quietly ease them in alongside whoever we end up taking prisoner when the fortress falls make a nice little sum for the men involved and nobody any worse off unless you count these poor bastards sold into slavery alongside the men that have probably been working their way through the tribes women for the last few weeks you should all be ashamed of yourselves and if theres a centurion involved you can fetch the bastard out here now and ill tell him the same release these prisoners to me now or whoevers responsible will be paying a high price for his stupidity now the optio thought it over for a second or so before gesturing to his men to raise their spears marcus glared at him for a moment longer then gestured to the waiting votadini prince theyre yours martos i think wed better take them to join the rest of your men before anyone else takes a fancy to them as he turned away from the optio a final thought occurred to him and he turned back with a raised finger one last thing i expect to have their personal possessions returned to me before we move again or your tribune and mine will be discussing why these men cant return to the fortress tonight and the danger of giving away our presence when theyre missed weapons clothing boots jewellery the lot just one item short and youll find yourself in the ranks rather than pushing them around try me safe inside the tungrian ranks the tribesmen lost some of the hunted look they had worn all the way through the camp and when a selected handful of martoss warriors joined the group they relaxed into the pleasure of greeting men they knew and had feared were dead marcus nodded and walked away leaving martos to speak with his people in private in the time that remained before the cohort resumed its cautious advance towards the fortress squatting in the middle of the small group he gently but firmly questioned them as to the events of the previous weeks and the clearer their story became the darker his expression grew and they allow you to leave the fortress to hunt the man he was speaking to nodded dourly they take our kills and allow us a portion to feed our families once if were lucky i would have run for the north many days since if it werent for my children as for my woman martos put a hand on the hunters shoulder patting it gently i know and ill make them pay in blood for this but first i have to get in he stopped speaking as a pair of legionaries dumped a pile of the mens gear in front of them and walked away quickly looking about them at the tungrians as they left clearly less than comfortable in the presence of the auxiliaries the hunters combed through the clothing and weapons and were soon reunited with most of their possessions your friend the roman is a decent man it seems martos nodded in agreement with the hunters quietly expressed opinion ive not seen him that angry anywhere other than in the heat of battle theyre not all bastards now i have a trade to propose to you that cloak when marcus returned to rouse the century from their dozing an hour later with orders from first spear frontinius for the th to lead the cohort to the closest point that they could get to the dinpaladyr without being spotted by the inevitable watchers on the walls he found the hunters waiting quietly to be told what to do but no sign of martos whatsoever thats his cloak he told one of them so he must have yours right the votadini nodded with a quiet smile of pride the master of the dinpaladyr goes to war wearing my cloak to disguise him from the selgovae marcus shook his head and turned to arminius who had accompanied him back from the command tent and was standing beside him with a knowing look on his face hes lost it this time one man against five hundred hostile warriors what good can that do well be lucky to even find his corpse the suns first tentative light was painting the dinpaladyrs palisade wall in a delicate shade of pink by the time the tungrian assault party had crossed the wide open farmland that surrounded it on all sides and reached the base of the long slope that led to the votadini capitals main gate marcus had studied the fortress as he marched gauging the apparent impregnability of the city perched atop its massive hill as it loomed ever larger before the tungrians its very size at once daunting and challenging him gods below it must be five hundred feet high julius marching alongside him in a steady stream of curses at the distasteful nature of their disguise nodded grimly all of that and more one almost vertical face and the rest of it steep enough on all sides that any attempt to fight a way in would be a bloody fiasco against any decent sort of opposition well just have to hope that these stinking scalps deceive them long enough to get us inside i still feel naked without my helmet and a shield would probably come in handy some time about now he turned to look back at the two centuries of tungrians marching behind them all similarly attired with their armour and weapons hidden beneath rough blankets taken from the selgovae dead after the battle of alauna shields and helmets discarded in order to avoid their distinctive outlines betraying their bearers for what they were as a macabre finishing touch every man was wearing the scalp of a dead barbarian cut from the corpses after the battle the long hair disguising the soldiers cropped haircuts fuck me but you lot look the part even your own mothers would never guess the truth now before we get too close to the walls stop marching and start slouching youre not soldiers youre a rabble of barbarian sheep molesters youre tired and hungry and all you want is to get inside and get a drink and a warm so start looking pissed off and dragging your feet and keep your hands away from your weapons were all friends here nobody makes a move until i give the signal and then you lose the blankets and air your iron nothing fancy just get inside the fortress start killing the bastards and keep killing them until the rest of the cohort gets to us you can keep the hair on as long as you like if you think it makes you look better just as long as you can stand the smell the men of the th and th centuries smiled grimly they had been selected as the most experienced men available in the sort of noquarter fighting that would ensue from the second that they dropped their disguises and went at the tribesmen holding the fortress marcus gave julius a rueful grin his eyes alive with the prospect of combat and his nose wrinkled at the stink of the scalp he was wearing id hoped never to have to do this again after the last time scarface marching just behind him in a bloodstained blanket and peering through the purloined hair that threatened to obstruct his vision muttered morosely still owes me a scalp from the last time ten denarii i was offered for that and now every bastards got one ignoring the veteran soldier marcus looked up at the fortress again as the soldiers reached the foot of the hills slope and started the climb up to the gate that was the only feature in an otherwise unbroken wall of mature tree trunks circling the rock in the uncertain light of dusk the hill looked like a massive ship that had struck a rock and had listed heavily to one side one face almost vertical while the other sloped to meet the plain at an angle that was sufficiently shallow for the inhabitants to be able to build level platforms for their dwellings making the interior beyond the wall a sea of straw roofs that stepped up to the hills summit where a single large hall stood out above the buildings around it he tightened his grip on the arm of the man walking alongside him applying a subtle but insistent pressure to keep him moving towards the fortress just remember to make this convincing you know what will happen if were still stuck outside these walls in an hours time harn turned his head a snarl of frustration distorting his face i recall your tribunes words clearly then youll be very sure to play your part once we reach the gates we dont want to carry out the threat but i want you to be very sure that we will scaurus had spoken to harn in the moments before the raiding party had left the safety of the forest his face set hard against what marcus could only guess was his own discomfort with the role he was forced to play by the situation the votadini fortresss dark bulk had loomed on the horizon in the first light already massive despite the two miles that separated it from the forest very shortly now im going to send an assault party forward to the gates of that fortress harn soldiers disguised as your people the men calgus sent here to rule the votadini are going to line the walls trying to work out exactly who they are our only hope of getting in through those gates is you and just how convincing you can be when they call down to you and you face the obvious choice of either your own death or the betrayal of your own people so let me help you with that choice fetch them out a party of soldiers stepped into the ring of men surrounding the votadini captives and pulled out a pair of young warriors harns face went white with shock as he realised that his last secret was secret no longer scaurus nodded grimly yes your sons did you really think we wouldnt find out that you brought your boys with you when you went to war with us he walked around the young men one of them barely old enough to carry a sword then returned to put his face close to harns with a sneer of contempt one of thems no more than a child you fool what were you thinking did you imagine that this was going to be an easy victory and that we would just melt away when you charged out of the hills all youve done is provide me with a lever to use against you and sadly the situation leaves me with no choice but to do exactly that you brought me two boys harn and there are two very different ways for them to die if my men are not inside that fortress by daybreak tomorrow theres the roman way and then theres your way turning away hed looked at the young men for a moment and then shaken his head sadly which would be a shame they look like fine young men and likely to grow to powerful manhood if you give them the opportunity if you accompany my men out to the gates of the dinpaladyr and if you succeed in ensuring that those gates are opened to them and stay open long enough for the rest of us to arrive and secure the victory then ill be able to spare them and you too if you live through the fight but if not if were forced to camp out on that plain and i have to work out another way to get into the fortress then ill have both of your boys executed in full sight of the walls as an encouragement to your people to abandon their resistance not that itll do any good of course but ill have fulfilled my promise to you that the price of your failure will be their slow and painful deaths harn had stared at him aghast his mouth hanging open in horror no yes one of them will be lashed with a scourge just enough to open his back up like raw liver but not enough to kill him and then hell be crucified with his legs left unbroken they both look healthy enough so id imagine itll take a day or two for him to give up the fight and choke to death when his legs finally lose their strength and the other well itll be obvious enough to you that martos and his men still harbour a certain sense of resentment at having been betrayed by the selgovae by your people i dont think that hell be overly troubled at a request to make an example of your other son and provide the defenders with something to think about in fact id imagine that hell be happy enough to carry out my request but ill leave the fine details for him to decide just as long as im guaranteed plenty of agonised screaming to set the defenders teeth on edge harn had shaken his head in denial his eyes moist you cant you wont scaurus had looked into his eyes with a cold certainty that marcus had never seen before speaking quietly and without bombast yes i will im a tribune of rome with orders to fulfil and only one way to carry them out i may not like it but im not about to let my superior officers down by getting squeamish with a pair of barbarian children not given the number of innocents your people abused and murdered in alauna alone think about that while you make the walk across to the fortress because the time to choose is upon you the disguised soldiers were drawing close to the fortress and the first signs that they had been spotted became apparent as men began appearing on the walls of the palisade to either side of the massive ironstudded gates alongside marcus julius raked a hard stare across the defences twentyfive perhaps thirty less of them than id expected a harsh shout from the rampart interrupted him a voice used to speaking with authority and to being obeyed thats close enough i am haervui warrior of the selgovae tribe and the master of this fortress one of you can come forward to explain yourselves the rest of you stay where you are julius pushed harn forward with a hand in his back muttering into his ear off you go and dont forget what the tribune told you he watched as the tribesman walked forward into the brightly lit space before the gate his voice hard as his eyes swept the walls looming over them staying here works for me it keeps them from getting too close a look at us and whoever that is drawing his sword behind me i can hear the bloody thing rasping on your scabbards throat so put it away before i come back there and sheathe it where the sun doesnt shine these are supposed to be our mates so relax and concentrate on looking pissed off and shagged out that shouldnt be too hard for you lot marcus watched in silence as harn walked slowly forward guessing what might be going through his mind the voice from the wall above them spoke again the tone a little less hostile as the barbarian got close enough to the fortress wall to be recognised by his fellow selgovae harn harn is that you down there the tribal leader stared up at the walls his voice level despite his inner turmoil aye haervui it is he gestured back with his arm at the waiting tungrians and this is all thats left of my men the romans overran our camp and put most of us to the sword calgus is haervui spoke over him clearly unwilling to have such news broadcast to the warriors listening along the palisade wait there ill come down julius nudged marcus on the arm fuck get ready were only going to get one chance at this marcus tensed understanding his brother officers concern viewed from the palisade the tungrians resembled a footsore and hungry remnant of harns warband but it would be a different matter entirely were the selgovae leader to get close to them and a single shout of warning would see the fortress gates closed and their hopes of storming the dinpaladyr by surprise ruined in an instant a mansized door set in the righthand gate opened to allow the speaker to step outside the fortress and haervui strode across to harn his glance flicking across the men standing behind him weve got scouts out on the main road to the south im surprised they didnt report your approach harn shrugged giving no sign of betraying the romans waiting anxiously behind him we stuck to the hills brother i didnt trust the roads therell be romans hunting for us now that the warband is scattered the other man nodded staring past harn at the tungrians with appraising eyes so were all thats left my men and yours wed better get you inside then he barked a command at the gate and the muffled sound of wooden bars being removed from their housings told the waiting soldiers that the way into the fortress would be opened to them within seconds come on then get moving and get inside i dont want the gate open any longer than necessary there are romans he stopped in midsentence his attention caught by something unexpected and marcus realised that he was staring at their boots he allowed the blanket to fall from his shoulders as he started running drawing both swords from their scabbards and sprinting at the two barbarians knowing that there was no way he could cross the gap before the barbarian leader could shout the command to close the gates with a whistle of raggededged iron slicing the air arminiuss axe spun lazily over his shoulder missing harn by no more than a foot and slamming into the barbarian leaders head with a wet thud as he turned to bellow the alarm to the gatekeepers the selgovae leader dropped to the turf in an untidy heap of twitching limbs and marcus grasped his chance angling his run to charge straight at the fortresss gateway as the two centuries ran forward the gates began to open with a groan of timbers spurring marcus and arminius to greater speed as a fragile moment of opportunity opened before them the men on the wall realising what was happening started to shout the alarm to the gatekeepers while a couple of hastily aimed arrows hissed past the roman to bury their iron heads in the ground behind him marcus was the first man to the massive wooden gate by several paces at the precise moment when the gatemen responded to the alarmed shouts from the warriors on the walls above them and released the winches at which they were toiling to pull the gates apart in the split second before the gates started to close he squeezed through the thin gap between them and found himself in a courtyard occupied by half a dozen men caught in various states of surprise as they dithered in the face of the panicked shouts from the wall above one of them threw himself at the roman with a knife in his hand and ran straight on to the spathas point as marcus thrust it into his chest arminius had reached the gate but was unable either to squeeze through after marcus or even to stop the massive wooden doors ponderous but irresistible closure marcus realised that the gateposts were angled slightly inwards so as to make the gates fall back into the gateway and close upon themselves if the winches that opened them were released and that he was for the moment beyond any assistance from their other side he could hear the tribunes bodyguard shouting at the tungrians to help him as the gates fell shut with a heavy thump leaving his friend alone inside the fortress push you bastards before they get the door bars back in place marcus turned back to face the enemy realising that half a dozen men were running at the gates with heavy wedges and hammers seeking to secure the doors against the increasing press of soldiers straining at them from the other side kicking the dying man off his spathas blade he twisted away to evade another attacker who charged in swinging at him wildly with a heavy stave ducking in under the staffs reverse swing and stabbing the gladius down into the barbarians neck and deep into his chest he wrenched the short blade free in a shower of blood leaving the fatally wounded man to stagger away with his eyes rolling up to show their whites pausing for a split second to judge the distance to the nearest of the gatekeepers as the man bent to thrust his wedge between gate and ground he leapt forward and stabbed the eaglepommelled gladius through his neck pinning the hapless man to the gate with the short blade clean through his throat and buried in the gates timbers his blood spraying across the gateways roughly paved courtyard the gatekeepers hesitated for a second and then broke in the face of their comrades last frenzied struggles against the cold iron draining the life from his body running screaming from the gate into the gloom beyond the courtyard marcus made to kick away the wedge that the dying man had managed to force into the space where the gates met securing them both closed against the tungrian soldiers throwing their weight against them ignoring a poorly aimed stone that crashed to the crude flagstones a foot to his right but something made him glance to his left a long blade swept past his face close enough that he felt its passage through the air dancing back with the spatha held blade up and to his right in a cocked stance ready to either attack or defend he watched with a sinking heart as the warrior who had so very nearly put a sword into his face advanced slowly towards him another man behind him taking up the dying gatekeepers hammer to batter the wedge more firmly into place within seconds the gate would be irretrievably and firmly shut against the tungrians and his fate would be sealed either a quick death or the same protracted end that would be meted out to harns sons in the morning his mind racing he barely registered the arrow that flicked past his head close enough to graze his left ear inflicting a stinging cut on the lobe distantly he was aware of the horn blowing on the other side of the gate the signal for the remainder of the detachment to cross the plain and join the fight taking two shuffling steps forward he snapped the spatha downwards in a slanting cut to attack the barbarians lefthand side sending the other man skipping backwards with his sword flung wide to his left to deflect the attack fighting the swords momentum with wrists muscular from years of incessant practice marcus altered the swords course sweeping the blade straight down and evading the block then whipping it back up to his left shoulder before striking again with blinding speed at the swordsmans extended swordhand hacking it off at the elbow and dropping the severed limb to the ground with the long sword still gripped in its nerveless hand shouldering the horrified warrior aside he swung the blade back to his right shoulder and put every ounce of his power into a vicious horizontal cut that buried the long steel blade deep into the second mans body dropping him in agony to the courtyards flagstones with the blade lodged against his spine and blood fountaining from the horrific wound opened in his side his hammer falling to the flagstones with a dull clink feeling the spathas refusal to come free from the dying barbarians body marcus released the weapon and spun away to take a firm grip of the gladiuss hilt only to find it still stuck fast in the gates finegrained oak a memory flickered into his racing mind of an afternoon in the hills above rome on the day after his fourteenth birthday when he had walked out to meet his tutors in the arts of combat to find no sign of the practice weapons that usually awaited him the burly former gladiator who had until that day been his teacher with sword and shield had stood waiting for him with a long wooden staff held in one hand a gentle smile on his face while the taller leaner man who was teaching him to fight with his fists and feet sat to one side with a neutral expression both men had walked alongside him in his unaccustomed toga the previous day part of a full turnout of the villas household staff to escort the young man to the forum and witness the ceremonies and sacrifices that celebrated his accession to adulthood and both had been granted a place at the feast held to mark the occasion the previous evening festus bowed slightly the smile staying fixed on his face despite the show of deference fourteen years old then not master marcus any more but marcus valerius aquila a man youll wear that tunic from now on and your purple stripes will tell everyone that youre the son of a senator a man of influence a man of breeding and a target he lifted the staff tapping one of the tunics two crimson stripes where it ran up and over his right shoulder the dusty iron tip leaving a dirty mark on the garments white cloth this will make you a mark for every thief and bandit that comes across you and youll need to learn to defend yourself or risk having your dignity removed along with your purse hed shrugged not seeing the point that his tutor was trying to make and impatient to start the afternoons lessons so teach me where are my weapons the gladiator had shaken his head wryly tossing the ironshod staff and a helmet to his pupil before turning to pick up his own practice weapons not today marcus we have orders from your father that today your training is to change in recognition of your manhood until now weve concentrated on teaching you how to use a sword on the techniques of fighting and practising those disciplines until they have become automatic to you from today were going to teach you how to fight hed settled behind the shield staring over its rim at his bemused pupil this is where the classroom ends and the real schooling begins and heres your first lesson im a robber with my sword and shield and all you have to defend yourself with is that stick when i say the word fight youd better be ready to put me on my back with my ears ringing because thats what im going to do to you if you cant work out how to use the staff quickly enough a dozen heartbeats later marcus had found himself face down in the practice grounds sand his ribs aching and his nose bleeding turning over to find the gladiator standing over him with the same sad smile and a hand outstretched to help him back to his feet that wasnt easy for either of us you dont train a boy from the age of seven without gaining some fondness for the little bugger but youre not a boy any more not since you put the ceremonial dagger to that goats throat yesterday now that ive made the point lets go over that again and see what you can learn from it for a start youre holding the staff with your hands too wide apart shaking his head to clear his mind he stooped and plucked the staff discarded by the dying barbarian from the flagstones turning to face a trio of men charging at him from the right ducking low under the leading warriors swinging sword he hooked the staff behind the mans ankles and pulled it towards him sharply wrenching his feet out from under him and sending his attacker crashing heavily to the stone floor with a grunt of expelled breath the roman spun away planting the staffs flat end squarely between anothers warriors eyes with enough force to stun him for a moment finishing him off by slapping its other end across his throat with enough power to rupture his larynx with two men on their backs the first still struggling to get back to his feet after his heavy fall marcus focused on the last man left standing the barbarian hacked down with his sword cutting the raised staff into two halves and raising the weapon again in preparation for a killing stroke on the unarmed romans head marcus saw his opening and took it stepping in and ramming one of the cloven staffs two sharpedged halves up into the underside of the lunging warriors jaw burying the jagged wooden edge deep in his head before turning to smash the other half across the back of the remaining barbarians head as he struggled to his knees stooping to scoop up the hammer dropped by the man dying with the spatha buried in his side he spun to face another warrior as the man screamed incoherently and ran at him with a battleaxe swinging the heavy hammer up to clash with the axe blade as it swept towards him the weapons met in a shower of sparks and the combatants spun apart marcus crouching low and sliding the hammers handle through his hand to extend its swing smashing its heavy iron head into the axemans knee with a loud crack of breaking bones the barbarians leg folded beneath him sending him headlong with a shriek of agony as the roman spun another full circle smashing the hammers head into the wedge holding the gates closed and sending it flying across the courtyard with the weight of dozens of tungrians pressing hard at them the gates opened wide in seconds admitting a tidal wave of angry soldiers who fanned out into the courtyard looking for someone to fight leaving the halfdozen men killed or stunned by stones thrown down on to them from the palisade lying inert behind them julius shouted orders at the men around him sending them hurrying to break into the buildings surrounding the courtyard in a search for anything with the potential to act as part of a barricade intended to keep the inevitable barbarian counterattack away from the gate long enough for the rest of the detachment to arrive and turn the struggle into a onesided contest qadir stepped through the gates with an arrow nocked to his bow barking a command to his hamians as he chose his first mark and sent an iron head up under the ribs of one of the men on the palisade while marcus stalked over to retrieve his swords from their resting places the archers made short work of the men on the wall leaving half a dozen dead and dying men slumped against the timber and the remainder lifeless across the courtyards flagstones more barbarians lurked in the shadows to either side unwilling to advance for fear of the hamians arrows hearing his name shouted marcus turned away from the gate to find julius pointing his sword at the two narrow roads leading away up the fortresss steep slope from the gate bellowing an order at his brother officer therell be more of the bastards coming down from farther up the hill soon enough and we havent got our shields get your caltrops out and your men ready to defend the gate marcus nodded tersely looking about him for his watch officer cyclops where are the men with the caltrops the oneeyed veteran pointed out two men waiting to one side with large sacks held well away from them the steel points protruding through the rough material glinting in the torchlight marcus pointed at the scanty barricade that presented a flimsy barrier to any barbarian attack that might be mustering farther up the fortresss steep slope get them laid out on the far side of the barricade and quickly cyclops walked to the barricade behind his men watching as the first of them lifted his sack to pour the contents over the flimsy barrier and then froze his head cocked what is it the soldier turned back to him with a puzzled look sounds like men screaming marcus stood alongside him and listened hearing faint echoes of sound from the streets farther up the massive hill a mans voice was raised in a shout of rage and then a second later in a howl of pain and despair other voices were raised some higher in pitch angry shouts and screams of agony realisation hit him with a jolt of amazement and he turned to julius with an urgent wave to get his friends attention somethings happening higher up the hill something violent and theres no sign of any counterattack im going up there with a few men to find out what it is you hold the line here and wait for the rest of the cohort not waiting for juliuss reply he vaulted the barricade selecting arminius qadir and a pair of archers to accompany him and shaking his head in resigned amusement as scarface gave him a dirty look and followed them across the piledup furniture with his face set against any idea of his being sent back the small party advanced cautiously up the steep and narrow street their weapons held ready to fight if the expected threat materialised from the fortresss shadows in the buildings above them another scream rang out the lingering despairing sound of a man with cold iron in his guts and no hope of either rescue or release from his pain and before the sound had time to fade a sudden glow sprang to life in one of the side streets to their right accompanied by a noise that would stay with marcus for years to come haunting his dreams with its otherworldly echo of damnation a burning figure staggered out into the road a man blazing from head to foot with the bright yellow flame of a freshly lit lamp and howling at a pitch and volume that made the tungrians stop and stare in horror a womans figure followed the apparition from out of the buildings with a blazing torch her face demonic in the rippling firelight as she pointed the torch screaming incoherent abuse as the burning figure fell to his knees holding his hands out in front of him as if unable to believe what was happening to him in the light of his death throes half a dozen other fallen bodies became apparent previously hidden in the streets shadows mercy marcus turned to find qadir with an arrow nocked to his bow and drawn back ready to loose into the blazing mans body and release him from the torment that was racking him in convulsive shudders arminius put a hand over the arrows head and turned it aside shaking his head in a manner that seemed almost contemplative as he watched the tribesman burn these men have in all likelihood made their captives lives a misery over the last few weeks who are we to deny them their retribution the blazing figure fell slowly face first to the streets cobbles flames continuing to lick at his flesh even as their initial exuberance died away and the woman lowered her torch retreating back into the shadows as she caught sight of the romans advancing up the hill towards her the tungrians walked on carefully peeping warily down each side street before crossing to continue their climb until they stood over the blackened corpse with their scarves held across their faces against the stink of scorched flesh looking about him marcus realised that they were being watched from the houses on both sides the glinting of human eyes in the cracks between window frame and shutter betraying the presence of the fortresss inhabitants raising both hands from the hilts of his swords he turned a slow full circle to display his open hands we mean you no harm we have come to release you from the selgovae warriors who have been tormenting you looks like theyve done that for themselves to me ignoring the wideeyed scarface he opened his mouth to continue closing it again as a man stepped around the corner of the nearest building with an axe in one hand the other knotted in the long hair of a struggling prisoner the writhing barbarian was clutching at his groin trying to stem the flow of blood from a horrific wound that seemed recently inflicted to judge from the flow that was pulsing between his fingers his captors entire body was blasted with blood both fresh red arterial spray and older stains dried black with exposure to the air and one of his eyes was an empty socket with a deep cut in the cheek below it despite the mans evident exhaustion his stance as he contemptuously threw the mutilated man to the ground was unmistakable in its confidence and sheer muscular vitality martos as marcus walked disbelievingly towards him the votadini prince put the axes head down on the road in front of him and leaned wearily on its handle the roman stopped in front of his friend and stared in amazement at the thickly caked blood that painted him from head to foot how martos looked up his remaining good eye wide with the strain of whatever it was hed done since leaving the detachments camp when he spoke his voice was dull as if his usual vitality had been drained from his body i climbed the south wall marcus i climbed it a hundred times as a boy so i thought why not do it one more time eh it nearly killed me but i did it loose stones fucking birds but i made it holding up his right hand he showed his friend the remains of his fingernails a small price to have paid given what i found when i reached the top his face slowly split into a wide grin a triumphant smile that seemed to contain an edge of maniacal glee i knew youd be making a move on the gate around dawn so i hid myself until an hour ago and waited and listened remember i was born and brought up in this tiny little world and i know every hiding place there is i still fit a few of them too so i waited and listened and i heard what these scum were saying about my wife and children where they were keeping them and what they were doing to them and when i judged the time had come i left my hiding place and i went for the bastards at first i just cut their throats but when i found what was left of my family i realised that just killing them was too quick so i started doing that he pointed to the emasculated selgovae still writhing on the ground in front of him with both hands clutching his ruined crotch it seemed fitting how many have you killed the barbarian shrugged wearily twenty i didnt ever stop to count marcus looked about him at the ruined bodies of the fallen selgovae warriors and martos read his glance i stopped to free the warriors who were still here when the selgovae took control they were penned up in the great hall kept under control by the threat of death and torture for their families when i released them and told them that the selgovae were openly boasting about the number of women theyd violated it seemed to give them an extra interest in ridding the dinpaladyr of them any of them that are still alive wont be breathing for very long the women have been released and theyve got oil and flame to take their revenge with marcus frowned looking about him we expected there to be hundreds more of them wasnt calgus supposed to have sent five hundred men to occupy this fortress his friend smiled tiredly waving a hand at the scattered corpses we seem to have been lucky or perhaps the men that arent here were the ones with the luck their leader sent more than half of his force east the day before yesterday with orders to bring back supplies of food to stock the fortress in readiness for a siege theyre expected to return tomorrow im sure that my people can find a fitting way to greet their return given the way theyve been treated over the last few weeks by the time the cohorts had reached the fortress what little was left of the selgovae resistance had melted into a handful of terrified fugitives from the vengeful votadini warriors and their incensed womenfolk leaving the bulk of his command outside the palisade wall scaurus walked though the massive gates with tribune laenas alongside him a bodyguard of the th centurys hulking axemen surrounded the two officers as they looked about them noting the neat rows of barbarian corpses piled against the walls on either side marcus had escorted martos down to the gate to get medical attention for his gaping eye socket and the tribune winced as he caught sight of a bandage carrier cleaning out the cavity with a vinegarsoaked rag centurions corvus and julius my congratulations on your victory although id say the prince here seems to have been the spark that ignited his peoples reassertion of their will martos angled his head round to look at the tribune ignoring the soldiers efforts to remove what little tissue was left clinging to his eye socket and speaking through teeth clenched at the vinegars bite the removal of most of the blood from his face had revealed features bruised with exhaustion but his remaining eye still burned with suppressed rage once this mans finished making my eyehole feel as if id got a redhot dagger stuck through it ill walk you up the hill and introduce you to my tribes elders theyre going to want to know what you intend given that youve got enough soldiers camped outside their gates to level this fortress to the bare rock in a few days and i might have a few words for them too scaurus nodded reflectively the thought had crossed my mind you can be assured that the governor took a very dim view of your peoples decision to join the revolt and that was before you massacred one of our cohorts and left their corpses burning on stakes for us to discover come along that wound isnt going to get any prettier not even if my man here were to pack it with myrrh rather than slop sour wine into it here put this on youre making my men feel queasy he untied the scarf from around his neck passing the square of clean white linen to the barbarian and leaning close to whisper in his ear as it happens i do have a small jar of the stuff in my war chest cost me a bloody fortune i can spare you a dab or two once this is done its supposed to take away some of the pain and prevent wounds going bad as well he watched as martos tied the scarf across his empty eye socket nodding once the job was done thats better although its going to hurt a lot for the next few days id say come along then lets go and see what your elders have got to say for themselves the party started climbing the hills steep slope but scaurus stopped after fifty paces to look at the bodies of the dead selgovae almost every corpse had the same vicious wound inflicted in the groin area some of them with the severed genitalia pushed into their dead faces mouths the tribune shook his head soberly turning back to face martos whatever it was these men did id say theyre paying in the afterlife these mutilations were inflicted while they were alive i presume martos nodded impassively they were on the men that i killed scaurus turned to julius centurion id be grateful if you could arrange for these bodies to be collected and prepared for burning somewhere out of sight of the gate have each one searched for anything that might provide us with any intelligence and make sure that nobody gets soft and provides them with coin for the ferryman i know i can trust you with this delicate duty julius saluted him with a slightly sideways look and walked back down the hill shouting for soldiers to carry out the grisly duty of collecting up the corpses while scaurus turned to marcus with a slight smile forgive me for giving your friend a job that any one of my officers could have carried out but hes not famed for his diplomacy whats needed now is some calm reflection on the votadini tribes uncomfortable situation not hardfaced romans sticking their chins out and looking down their noses at whatever passes for tribal authority round here if anyones going to throw his weight around i rather believe it ought to be someone with a longerlasting authority over these people than i can exert he raised an eyebrow at martos who had watched the scene play out before him in silence then turned and walked briskly up the hill with no more attention to the litter of dead and dying warriors than he would have spared on beggars in the streets of rome at the hills summit martos led the party into a towering hall a full fifty feet high through massive wooden doors intricately carved with figures of warriors in battle inside the hall illumination was provided by a line of guttering torches down each wall and in the flickering light marcus saw a group of men at the far end of the space scaurus strode down the halls length to stand before them tribune laenas at his shoulder and a pair of tituss axemen flanking them one of the elders stepped forward to meet him bowing his head slightly in greeting and waiting in silence for the roman to speak greetings you are iudocus chief adviser to the king of the votadini if i am not mistaken scaurus spoke slowly and carefully allowing time for another of the elders to whisper a translation into the old mans ear after an initial startled glance at the use of his name by the roman and a moments muttered discussion between the elders iudocus turned to face scaurus with an expression of carefully composed neutrality he spoke and the translator spoke his words in latin after a moments pause greetings roman while your presence is welcome to us you can see that we have removed the selgovae usurpers from among us and dealt with them as is appropriate with the warriors of a hostile tribe we will provide you with the little hospitality we can given the rather damaging events of the last few weeks but i see no reason for you to trouble yourselves further on our behalf this fortress is scaurus raised a hand turning to martos and beckoning him forward he spoke to the prince in latin loudly enough to be heard by the watching elders prince martos iudocus here has obviously failed to recognise either me or the perilous situation that your tribe finds itself in perhaps you could help him to regain a secure footing in this discussion before he does his people some irreparable damage the translation things a bit overdone too martos nodded and stepped out in front of his tribes remaining leadership and it was immediately apparent that something was making them nervous marcuss eyes narrowed as he watched them fight to keep their expressions neutral and wondered whether it was their princes bloodblasted aspect that was troubling them or something less obvious clearing his throat martos addressed his words directly to iudocus speaking in latin rather than his own language the tribune has requested that i speak directly to you you all know me i am martos prince of this tribe and its rightful king with the murder of king brennus i went to war against the romans alongside our king with your agreement i fought alongside calgus and the selgovae as he directed and i was betrayed to the romans at the same time that he died at the hands of the selgovae the elders looked at each other with disquiet and iudocus turned to the translator only to find martoss brokennailed finger in his face his lips twisted in anger you may not like me iudocus you sourfaced longtoothed pedlar of halftruths and outright deceits but you will listen to me or else ill do to you what i did to the selgovae i found in the dark beyond this hall once id finished climbing the south wall youre not too old to have your cock carved off and stuffed into your mouth just like them you old bastard and since it was your idea that we went to war with calgus you can be sure i wont hesitate to push you out there to share their fate at the hands of the women if you give me any more cause and you can forget the pretence that you dont speak the tribunes language hes been here before he folded his arms and stepped aside with a dark stare that left the elders under no illusions as to the depth of his anger while iudocus looked at scaurus with narrowed eyes the ghost of a smile touching his lips when he spoke his voice was clear and strong with only a hint of the tremors of old age in his almost unaccented latin you were here in the winter i remember you now a quiet visitor content to watch and listen looking for signs that we would go to war with your people scaurus smiled with equal insincerity cold eyes boring into the older mans not really elder i knew the votadini would join calgus in his doomed rebellion as soon as i laid eyes on you and heard you speaking with your king it was clear to me from the start that the lord of the northern tribes had you in his pocket and that you in turn had sufficient influence with your king to seal his fate no iudocus i was here to make an assessment of your people and how likely it was that they could field an effective force after fifty years of peaceful trading with rome i didnt rate those chances very highly but then i didnt have much of a chance to take the measure of prince martos here until we met on the battlefield where he was taken prisoner rather than face his end in battle i believe martos bunched his fists but stayed silent with his face set granite hard where he lost in point of fact as the result of being betrayed by calgus which was a part of his plans of which im sure youre perfectly aware martos and his warriors were abandoned in the path of two angry legions with the expectation that they would be slaughtered to the last man i should imagine luckily for your people he survived luckily for most of them that is not so lucky for you though iudocus the prince here joined with us in the hope of gaining revenge for his kings death and id say hes within an armspan of dealing out a goodsized piece of that retribution at this very moment martos the warrior stalked forward again turning his face so that his remaining eyes cold stare played on the elders he pulled an ornately engraved hunting knife from his belt turning the blade to send reflected flecks of light from the torches across the halls lofty roof beams this elders of my tribe is an honourable weapon which i have sworn only to unsheathe when the blood of my betrayers is within reach i have already used it to take the life of one of the men responsible for my kings death a man called aed he was a man very much like you old and clever an adviser to his king and responsible for much of the needless destruction done by calgus since this war began i found a way into the selgovae camp after our betrayal and the slaughter of most of my warriors and i put him at the point of this blade when we were discovered i took his life with it i sliced open his belly and allowed his guts out but i took something else besides his life aed had a box full of his masters documents which when the romans read them to me made sense of much that had puzzled me before he turned away speaking into the halls dark shadows one letter in particular made me realise what fools we all were to believe that calgus was at war simply to expel the romans from our lands he turned back to face iudocus his face white with anger it was from you iudocus telling aed that brennus was an old man and past his prime with no reliable successor telling him that you could ensure the support of the elders and therefore the people of this tribe for a change of leadership should this prove necessary he walked deliberately towards the elders who to a man were slowly but surely inching away from their whitefaced leader you condemned your king to death iudocus and thousands of our warriors with him did you hope to take control of the tribe yourself and find some innocent to be king while you pulled his strings from behind the throne some child father recently dead in battle and whose mother was expected to pose no problem except my wife wasnt taken in was she she saw through you in an instant the way i should have done before we ever marched away to war and sealed both their fates so you had her and my daughter tossed to the selgovae dogs for their sport and my son thrown to his death from the south rampart iudocus put his hands out as if to defend himself his face pale with terror it was the selgovae they a sheathed knife landed on the stone floor before him with a quiet clang a small weapon more suited to a childs hand than a mans before i started the climb up the south wall yesterday i found his body on the rocks near its foot broken by the fall and picked clean by carrion birds i knew it was him this was still on the belt he was wearing i gave it to him for his last birthday he walked slowly to where the childsized weapon lay scooping it up and ripping off the rainstained scabbard you had my son thrown from the palisade and you gave his mother and sister to the selgovae as playthings shes dead the women tell me by her own hand rather than face any more of their torment she killed my daughter first a mercy killing you could say he tossed the childs blade at iudocuss feet and turned away to stare into the halls shadows wiping a tear from his cheek before turning back to face the elders youre all guilty of this you all nodded at this goatfuckers suggestions and you all turned a blind eye when he murdered my son and condemned my woman and child to a slow death at the hands of dozens of selgovae warriors by rights i should kill you all here in this den of your evil scaurus stepped to his side his face creased with anger and his hand raised to point a finger at iudocuss white face and we wont raise a hand to stop the prince if thats his choice in fact id put good money down that centurion corvus here would take his swords to you alongside martos given the chance he understands more than you can imagine about this sort of crime martos nodded his thanks to the tribune before turning back to the terrified elders i should kill you all but to do that would leave the tribe without leadership i cant take the throne i was as much to blame for the kings death in my pride as you were in your deception and plotting and with my son dead i have no heir to follow me nor the appetite to take another woman for the purpose of breeding a successor so i shall be the kingmaker rather than the king and my word will be law unless you all want to suffer a death as undignified as that of those you betrayed and for your daughters and granddaughters to be whores for the legions my sisters son will be king and you will guide him in the years that remain until he is old enough to rule alone one of the elders opened his mouth to speak but martos raised a hand to forestall him the new kings first act will be to sign a new friendship treaty with rome and this will include routine and frequent inspection visits to ensure that you fools are keeping your end of this distasteful bargain this tribe will be an ally of rome once more and you will all work to ensure that friendship or you will find this tribune or one very much like him calling you all to account the elders exchanged glances hardly daring to speak for fear of upsetting the delicate balance in martoss words iudocus stepped forward and nodded solemnly spreading his arms as if to welcome the princes words most regal my lord you have shown as us all he stopped abruptly looking down in confusion at the torrent of blood and bile pouring from his ruined belly martos had lunged forward with his hunting knife concealed behind his back throughout his judgement on the elders and ripped him open from hip to hip he stepped back with a satisfied smile watching as the stricken iudocus fell to his knees and stared at him imploringly a wavering moan of distress escaping from his lips as his blood puddled on the halls stone floor the prince stared down at him contemptuously i said i was a realist iudocus i didnt say i was stupid besides these sheep needed a reminder to take away with them of just how ruthless ill be if they ever stray from this agreement he raised his voice i was careful not to open him up too widely or to spill too much of his blood this ruthless old bastard dies here unaided and without any succour and any man that touches him will die alongside him in equal agony and when youre dead iudocus therell be no coin for the ferryman im going to behead you and throw your headless body from the south rampart where it can lie on the rocks to make a meal for the crows your head comes with me as my guarantee that youll forever be caught between this world and the next and as for you all he pointed the knife at the horrified men standing around the elders spasming body this is the last and best warning that youll get cross me in any of what ive just commanded and i will make sure you die just as slowly and with just as little honour try me back at the fortresss main gate marcus found a scene of orderly chaos as the tungrians carried the last of the selgovae dead through the wide archway and down the steep approach towards a rapidly growing pyre of wood that the other two cohorts were gathering from the nearby forest julius was standing in the gates shadow barking orders at the tired soldiers and when he saw his fellow officer approaching down the fortresss slope he waved a hand out over the plain below them indicating the toiling soldiers crossing to and from the forest with bundles of firewood once again the twentieth legion seems to have found its true role you should have seen their first spears face when i told him and that tribune of theirs that the fight was already over he looked like it was his birthday and a shout from the wall above him interrupted his musing horsemen to the west both centurions hurried up the ladder that led to the palisades rampart turning to stare in the direction indicated by the sentry at the limit of their vision perhaps five miles to the west marcus could just make out a flicker of movement a small band of riders with a long white banner trailing above them was riding for the fortress the standards forked tail flickering in the wind of their passing julius shook his head with a disgusted look its the bloody petriana id know that dragon standard anywhere i stood and watched the bloody thing fluttering in the breeze while they sat and watched us fighting and dying at lost eagle and wherever that thing twists its tail youll usually find that wily old bastard licinius you he shouted down to scarface who was standing at the bottom of the ladder stop following your centurion around like some lovestruck goat herder go and find tribune scaurus and tell him that tribune licinius will be at the gate by the time he gets down here go scaurus joined his two officers in time to watch the last mile of the horsemens approach to the fortress he stared out at the approaching cavalry squadron without any visible sign of surprise ive sent martos to get some sleep he was almost beside himself with fatigue so what have we here just when i thought life was finally about to turn dull for the rest of the year my colleague and his men arent riding like men whove decided to come by and see how weve done for the want of anything better to do the petrianas tribune dismounted a dozen paces short of the gate and stalked up to the palisade wall with a grim smile squinting up at scaurus and his officers and then glancing back at the men building the pyre on the plain below the fortress he called up to them shielding his eyes with a raised hand well now colleague i see youve accomplished your orders with the usual efficiency perhaps you ought to come down here and join me though ive something to tell you that will give you some pause for thought scaurus climbed down from the wall after instructing julius to keep the men inside the dinpaladyr at their tasks youd better come with me centurion corvus i suspect im going to need someone to take notes of whatever it is my brother tribune has to tell me i may well be too busy banging my head on the palisade in frustration the two tribunes clasped hands and licinius waved a hand at the fortress with an appreciative nod well done rutilius scaurus how long did this take it looks as if your men are only just digging out your marching camp scaurus nodded happily jerking a thumb at marcus we got lucky or rather centurion corvus here got lucky on our behalf that and a little intervention from prince martos he talked his colleague through the story of marcuss fight for the gate and their subsequent discovery of the havoc wrought by martos and the released votadini warriors and the young roman found himself on the receiving end of a long stare from the veteran cavalryman outstanding work young man perhaps you should have chosen a more heroic name to hide behind since it seems that you positively refuse to blend into the landscape and be forgotten which reminds me there are imperial agents loose in the border area hunting for you its hardly a surprise but it seems that the praetorian tribune discovered that youve taken refuge with this cohort through a piece of battlefield gossip that eventually reached the wrong ears apparently that knowledge has already cost more than one innocent life in rome and the report ive received tells me that perennis believes the combination of a praetorian and a corn officer will be strong enough to ensure that youre brought to justice although i have to admit to being somewhat baffled as to whats to stop a ruthless senior officer from simply putting them both in the ground and nobody any the wiser scaurus frowned while i thank you for that warning i cant see you having ridden this far north to deliver that unwelcome news in person licinius nodded his head grim faced youre right my other intelligence for you is of a rather more pressing nature and concerns a venicone king that seems to have a hardon for your cohort scaurus gathered his senior officers in the dinpaladyrs great hall its stone floor still wet where the blood that had poured from the dying elder as he had bled out under martoss unforgiving stare had been scrubbed away tribune licinius took a cup of wine with scaurus laenas and their senior centurions lifting it in salute as the small group drank to their success in capturing the fortress but thats not all were here to do is it tribune first spear frontinius had greeted the arrival of the petrianas commander with an instinctive reserve and now he asked the question that was on every lip in a respectful but questioning tone scaurus nodded in recognition of his senior centurions question tipping his wine back and placing the cup on the table beside him no first spear indeed it isnt tribune licinius the cavalry officer stepped forward looking around the small group to take their measure before speaking gentlemen for what its worth i dont think that drust has any intention of attempting to take this fortress he has neither the time to spare in his march north nor the equipment for any sort of siege but if it isnt territory thats on his mind something else must be dragging him so far out of his way home something that matters to him more than anything else think back gentlemen to that morning that we broke into calguss camp in the forest the day that we broke this rebellion into splinters and scattered it to the wind it was your men that were detailed to search the venicone section of the camp if i have it right frontinius and neuto nodded with a grim glance at each other both seeing where the cavalry commanders reasoning was taking him and nothing of any great importance came to light or at least nothing that was surrendered by your men i thought so my guess gentlemen is that one of your men found something of the utmost importance to king drust and that he promptly stuffed it into his armour and kept quiet as to the discovery something small enough to conceal perhaps a piece of tribal jewellery a crown or perhaps a torc something worth enough money to make an entire tent party join the finder in his crime i also think he tried to sell it to someone known for such dealing even though i wont be able to prove it until i get back south of the wall and catch up with a certain stores officer im pretty sure that he in turn recruited one of my centurions to help him with the coin needed to buy this trinket a centurion who was then captured and tortured to death by drusts men during which agony id be surprised if he didnt buy a quick death with news of drusts lost treasure all of which means if im right that your command is about to receive the undivided attention of eight thousand angry barbarians all bent on recovering whatever it is that their king mislaid tribune laenas frowned for a moment before asking the obvious question so why cant we just march everyone into this fortress shut the gates and wait for these barbarians to get tired of camping outside and resume their journey north scaurus shook his head that was my first reaction too but the rainwater cisterns are almost empty and we dont have time to refill them the selgovae havent allowed anyone out to fetch water for weeks and the rain hasnt been anything like enough to do the job for them add to that the fact that theyve just about stripped the place bare of food and theres no way i can order almost three thousand men to take refuge here if we camp inside this fortress well end up having to feed the population as well as ourselves and our water will be exhausted within a day or two unless drust were to take one look and then turn around and head for home wed be bottled up in a trap of our own making no gentlemen im afraid that were going to have to fight drust and his warband either that or we run for our lives and abandon the votadini to their fate not much of a choice is it the tribal elders reacted to the news of the approaching warband with the smug equanimity of men well accustomed to the idea of their fortresss invulnerability it was only when the romans had explained to them the parlous state of their supplies that they realised their predicament and if you think the selgovae were bad then youll find the venicones a revelation they need food and since you dont have anything to offer them id predict that theyll leave this hill a smoking ruin populated only by your corpses perhaps theyll spare your children for a life of slavery but the rest of you will die in ways that will make you beg for your ends licinius stepped to scauruss side his face set equally hard you may live beyond the edge of the empire but youve become accustomed to life in the shadow of what those of us on the southern side like to consider the civilised way of life you trade your cattle and grain with us in return for luxuries and many of you speak our language the venicones on the other hand despise us and in consequence they also despise you youd be well advised to do everything in your power to ensure that they never come within sight of your walls or you may find your entire tribe erased from existence he stared hard at the dismayed elders if you dont believe me just sit back and wait for a while if on the other hand youd rather take a hand in ensuring your survival youll have every ablebodied person that can wield an axe or a spade gather at the gates as quickly as possible ive an idea that just might get us all through this but it wont work without enough labour to put it simply your people can either dig or die the romans turned away to leave the tribal council to their deliberations and scaurus raised an eyebrow at his colleague got somewhere in mind have you the older man smiled grimly and nodded we passed it during the ride here we can make it ready in an afternoon and drusts men are too far out to reach it before dusk all it needs is a few hundred feet of earthworks a few hundred carefully felled trees and then some anklebreakers and lilies and itll be perfect and now if youre amenable i suggest that we go and find whatever it is thats drawing drust towards us like a runaway bull got any ideas scaurus nodded tersely just the one the tungrian cohorts mustered as ordered watched by the ths bemused legionaries scaurus stepped out in front of his command his eyes sweeping across the ranks of his men he nodded to first spears frontinius and neuto and at their command the cohorts centurions barked the order that brought their men to attention an uneasy silence settled across the ranks disturbed only by the gathering number of men and women mustering at the fortresss gate with spades and axes the tribune raised his voice to be heard across the mass of men standing before him raking them with flinthard eyes soldiers you doubtless think ive paraded you in order to congratulate you for taking the fortress and i have well done to you all you will no doubt be fondly imagining that your fighting for the year is finally over and looking forward to the march south and some longoverdue time in barracks perhaps you are wondering if you will be returning to your own forts all of which is quite understandable except for the fact that your fighting isnt over yet one tent party here a few men among fifteen hundred have presented us all with a problem they are hiding a secret from the rest of us these men are in possession of something that doesnt belong to them it used to belong to the king of the venicones and it now belongs to the emperor by rights one of you discovered it while we were searching the enemy camp most likely and tucked it away to sell later we suspect that the man in question probably tried to complete the transaction that same day once darkness had fallen but for some reason the deal fell through and he was left holding his prize he allowed that possibility to sink in for a few seconds before continuing watching the cohort closely in the th centurys ranks soldier manius stiffened the awful possibility that his centurion might recall their encounter in the torchlit darkness that night sending a physical shiver up his spine the problem that the rest of us have got is that the venicone king seems to have worked out that we have it and he wants it back so badly that hes coming in our direction with his entire warband eight thousand warriors in just a few hours soldiers whether we like it or not well be fighting for our lives against the venicones again and in case any of you have forgotten that it was us who stopped them at the red river ford and left them stuck on the eastern bank with a bloody nose let me assure you that they will know exactly who we are they will be looking for blood in vengeance for their losses that day and they will know that if they can find us outside of this fortress then they have their chance to slaughter us to the last man and this time we have no river to hide behind he turned away for a moment allowing time for his blunt words to sink in maniuss eyes were locked on to centurion othos back and he forced himself to look away and feign bored indifference as the officer turned to search his centurys ranks with a stony face and so soldiers you will understand that im feeling somewhat let down by these few men that have put us all at mortal risk in point of fact im angry enough to have them all beaten to death by their century once i find out who they are and trust me in this i will discover them within the next hour if i have to ill have you all remove your armour for searching by your officers and if the men holding this precious object make me waste that much time time we should be using to dig defences ill make their deaths appropriately brutal but in the interests of getting this thing over with quickly im offering a limited amnesty to these men if they surrender themselves to justice promptly otho was moving now walking swiftly along his centurys front rank and making the turn at the point they met with the th coming back along the rear of the soldiers line manius could sense his approach for all the fact that his gaze stayed locked on the tribune right up until the moment that the centurion pulled him backwards out of the line ripping off his helmet with an impatience that tipped the soldiers head back hard and left his chin pointing into thin air just as the first punch landed scaurus fell silent at the sudden commotion watching impassively as the enraged centurion battered the defenceless soldier tearing off his weapons and armour in between blows at some point in the onesided struggle the object of his search must have revealed itself for he seized the other man by the ear and dragged him out of the centurys ranks with his knees buckling from the savage beating a shining piece of gold held aloft for the tribune to see from behind him he heard first spear frontiniuss snort of barely restrained laughter its a good thing we dont need the idiot to tell us the story i expect hell be eating nothing but gruel for the next few weeks late afternoon was turning to early evening when the two tribunes rode into sight of the venicone camp halting outside of what they judged was the most optimistic of bowshots they waited while the word was carried back to the warbands leader that there were three enemy horsemen waiting outside the camp in the suns fading warmth having estimated that drust was bright enough to recognise an opportunity to talk the romans were nevertheless relieved when a party of three warriors strode out of the smoke drifting from the barbarian campfires drust walked out towards the waiting horsemen until he was close enough to shout a challenge his hammer carried over one shoulder and a wry smile on his face have you come to discuss the terms of your surrender roman licinius leant forward muttering quietly to his colleague leave this to me he already knows who i am but youre a different matter lets allow him a little uncertainty eh he raised his voice to a paradeground bellow far from it barbarian my colleague and i have come to have a good look at your ragged warband my colleague here is keen to get some measure of how many of them well have to kill tomorrow before the rest of you turn tail and run for home he lowered his voice a fraction speaking to the venicone king rather than simply shouting at him perhaps youd like to come a little closer and avoid the need for all this shouting i owe you one safe passage if you recall drust nodded and led his companions closer until the romans could see the grey hairs in his red beard licinius dismounted with an easy grace that belied his years and beckoned for the other two to follow his example if he wants to try cracking my head with that hammer id rather be on my feet than stuck up there on a dithering horse he waited until the two parties were lined up facing each other before speaking again you amaze me drust to have marched your men all this way for the sake of a simple gold trinket surely you could have had another one crafted for far less trouble than the likely price of attempting to recover this he pulled the torc from inside his cloak holding it up to the evening suns golden light in a hoop of liquid gold drust started in surprise and the warrior standing to his right put one hand to the hilt of his sword licinius smiled his quiet chuckle of amusement creasing the venicone kings face into a frown id restrain your man there if i were you do you imagine i would be waving the bloody thing around this close to you without some assurance of my safety he gestured to marcus standing alongside him with both hands on the hilts of his weapons your tribes have both suffered at the hands of this young officer before you drust failed to cross the red river because of the large numbers of your men that his soldiers left face down in the water as the price of their attempts to cross and as for you calgus he smirked at the selgovae leaders surprised expression before continuing yes i know you that purple cloak that and your pigugly face were both described to me in detail by the last roman officer to speak with you at such close range you had a little chat with him before the battle that weve taken to calling lost eagle if you recall and if he were here im sure legatus equitius would want me to thank you for your quite spectacular stupidity in sending your men up that hill to die on his mens spears in such an unimaginative fashion he was given the command of a legion as a result of his victory over you you know you lost a battle you already had in your grasp that day for all that you captured an eagle but i digress its a common fault of the elderly he smiled without humour at calgus but if hed expected the selgovae leader to be discomforted by the revelation he was disappointed after a moment of stonefaced thought calguss face lit up with malicious glee so youre the one i read the legatuss private papers that we captured during the battle and i was intrigued to discover that he had a son whose identity was hidden from the world i still have his head hidden away you know preserved in a jar of marcus tensed but licinius waved a hand dismissively enough i came to speak with drust not bandy gossip with yesterdays man your tribe is scattered to the four winds and your time on earth is limited so hold your tongue and leave those men at the table who still have stakes to play with to talk you can take the matter up with the centurion in the morning when he has you at the point of his sword licinius fixed drust with a level stare ignoring calguss scowl king drust its still not too late for us both to avoid yet more bloodshed ill happily return this bauble to you if youll turn your warbands path to the north and return to your lands in peace drust shook his head slowly holding liciniuss stare and pursing his lips i think not roman it would be a shame to have come all this way and left without a decent tithe of heads for being put to the trouble the cavalryman shrugged expressively as you wish you know how the battle will go tomorrow as well as i do youll charge our line and find yourselves on the wrong side of a turf wall that will expose your men to our spears as they try to get over it it will all come down to a bloody slogging match and that could last hours and leave thousands of men dead and i should warn you we have more than enough strength to hold you off for as long as you choose to batter your heads against our defences drust shrugged ill take that trinket from your dead body and your head besides it will remind me of the victory and when were done with you well march on to the dinpaladyr and see how pleased calguss men are that weve lifted your siege tribune licinius smirked and tossed the torc on to the grass at his horses feet in that case youd better have this it will help my men to pick you out as you run before us and since the reward ive put on you both is doubled if youre taken alive id guess theyll be grateful for that and with that colleagues i think weve wasted enough time on these gentlemen he turned away from the barbarians with one last calculating glance at drust whose attention was fixed on the torc lying before him in the grasss tangle and then turned back to face them again although it would probably only be fair of me to temper your expectations as to the votadini fortress should you by some strange chance manage to overcome our defence tomorrow you might find the dinpaladyr a little less receptive to your triumphant entry than you clearly expect would be the case calgus narrowed his eyes and his head shook in disbelief never try to deceive a master of deception tribune my man haervui will have had that fortress buttoned up tighter than a ducks backside the second he saw you coming over the horizon there are no secret approaches to the dinpaladyr and hell have had scouts his voice trailed off as he saw the smile on liciniuss face broaden to a grin scouts yes we found them and took them prisoner that theres no secret approach to the fortress well again yes i can agree with that but darkness calgus covers up all kinds of sins as im sure youd be the first man to agree so when two hundred beaten barbarian scum turned up at the fortress gates at dawn led by a very persuasive selgovae chieftain well known to all inside who then proceeded to talk the defenders into opening the gates well weve all heard of stronger defences than the dinpaladyr that have fallen to deception havent we calgus bristled no man of my tribe would submit to being part of such treachery licinius shrugged turning back to his horse and spoke his final words back over his shoulder you know your men better than i do calgus so im sure youre right your kinsman harn would never play a part in such a scheme not even with his sons at the point of a roman spear so the dinpaladyr must still be in your hands mustnt it the romans rode away leaving their barbarian counterparts staring quizzically at their receding backs tribune scaurus leaned out of his saddle to mutter in his colleagues ear his tone bemused so youve told them that we have the fortress youve told them that were going to be fighting them in the usual way in the morning and youve given that redfaced barbarian sheepfucker his pretty gold neckpiece back did i miss something licinius winked across scaurus at an openly curious marcus before replying a sardonic smile wreathing his face firstly respected colleague i want them no i want calgus to fester in his own juices this night at the thought that his brother warrior might have betrayed his cause secondly yes he now knows exactly how well be meeting their attack tomorrow in precisely the same way we always do in a nice straight line with spears swords and shields and thats just the way i like it and lastly with regard to that redfaced barbarian sheepfuckers pretty gold neckpiece please believe me when i tell you that i meant every word i want my headhunters to be looking for that tidy little fortune when they chase those horseeating bastards back into the hills they came from id rather have him in one piece for shipment to rome but ill settle for his head and whoever brings me his head will only get their reward if the torcs still attached as far as im concerned its only on loan later that evening as the tungrians prepared for sleep in rather different circumstances to usual licinius walked into the th centurys lines with a thoughtful look on his face directed to where marcus lay stretched out on his rough woollen cloak he left his bodyguard waiting at a discreet distance and stood over the young officer with his helmet in both hands opening his eyes the younger man saluted and started getting to his feet but licinius waved him back with a gloomy smile that was barely visible in the twilight i thought i might find you here it seems i owe you an apology young man and ive been too busy to come and see you until now bit of a first for me yknow to be apologising for not saying something usually its because i cant keep my bloody mouth shut may i sit the younger man gestured to the ground alongside him and licinius lowered himself on to it with a grateful sigh so that rascal calgus has let the cat out of the bag and i have no choice but to acknowledge the truth if not the helpfulness of the bastards words yes legatus sollemnis was your birth father he got your mother pregnant while he was serving in hispania your adoptive father was serving alongside him and was already married and so he and your mother agreed to take you as their own rather than see their friends child farmed out to some peasant family or worse and he was after all a senator his house was not a bad place for an infant to find himself he paused rubbing his face wearily sollemnis told me all this when i discovered that the senator had arranged for you to be spirited to britannia rather than share his fate in rome he enlisted me in the plot to keep you alive and he also swore me and everyone else that knew the secret to keep it that way until the rebellion was over and he had the chance to tell you the story in his own time rather than in some snatched conversation with no chance to explain his actions and then of course he was betrayed to the selgovae by praetorian prefect perenniss arsehole of a son and murdered on the battlefield at lost eagle and yes i could have told you the truth after his death but i decided that youd had enough mourning for one year my mistake he looked up to find marcus staring at him with a level gaze with no hint of the emotions he was feeling on his face enough mourning for one year thats true enough tribune more than true enough my father because hell always be my father and all my family and then the best friend i have left in the world and now the man i discover to have been my birth father all of them dead in less than six months i would mourn for the legatus if i had another tear in my body but i cant dont apologise to me for keeping this from me because believe me i would much rather never have known and if calgus thinks hes left a wound on me with his words hell do well to make very sure that he avoids me on the battlefield tomorrow if he wants to live to enjoy the memory of my face this afternoon given the misery that mans heaped on me in the last few months taking his head would be a good way to pay him back eventually the venicone scouts slid noiselessly through the nights silence slipping along the forests edge until they came within sight of the roman camp going to ground in the trees they watched their enemies in the full moons light for long enough to be sure they understood the precautions the soldiers were taking before making their next step a dozen watch fires lit the camps interior and patrolling soldiers paced along the length of the earth wall staring out into the nights shadows at length one man removed his boots and detached himself from the scouting party slipping into the forest and moving silently through the trees at a stealthy pace feeling forward with his bare feet for any potential source of noise as he took each step his progress was painstakingly slow but without any disturbance of the surrounding foliage or any noise to betray his presence an hours quiet stalk brought him within sight of the camps rear wall and he sank into the shadow of a tree to listen intently to the forest for one hundred patient breaths before moving again eventually satisfied that he was alone in the night and that the apparent lack of any patrol on this face of the roman defences was as it seemed he slithered over the waisthigh barrier and into the heart of his enemys stronghold a tent loomed before him and he snuggled into its shadow to wait for any sign that he might have been detected but none came the camp was quiet eerily so and with a faint frown he put his ear to the tents leather wall and listened carefully for a moment no sound could be heard from within no snores no conversation and his frown of uncertainty deepened taking a small blade from his belt he sliced into the thick leather with a smooth slow stroke then put an eye to the hole thus created the tent was empty eyes narrowed with suspicion he crawled forward and around the corner his hands outstretched to feel for anything that might betray his presence and as he reached the tents doorway they encountered a hole in the ground covered with slender branches cut from the forest behind him parting the leaves he reached cautiously down into the pit his fingertips searching for and exploring the traps contents with delicate care grim faced he looked out across the camp shaking his head at the utter and complete lack of movement watch fires burned untended amid a sea of empty tents their faint hissing and popping of burning sap the only disturbance in an otherwise silent scene nodding to himself he turned back to the wall a slight smile creasing his face drust would reward them well for the knowledge that the enemy camp was an empty shell a trap set for the unwary to blunder into and provide a hidden enemy with the perfect opportunity to strike at them from the rear going back over the camps wall he allowed himself to relax slightly confident that there was nobody to see him roll across the earth barrier and cross the gap into the silent trees as his feet touched the ground he jolted back against the wall a sudden searing pain in his chest rooting him where he stood sudden torture tearing at his lungs as he fought for each agonised panting breath looking down he saw the shaft of an arrow protruding from his rough shirt and even as his shocked wits fought to make sense of its presence another arced out of the trees and slammed into his body ripping a hole in his heart that killed him in seconds his glazed eyes stared vacantly out across the forest as the hidden archers broke from their cover and moved with hunters caution to stand over him not bad but not good enough qadir nodded at his fellow hamians whispered verdict on the dead mans abilities leaning close to speak quietly into his ear good enough to have got past anyone but us id say youd better go and tell the tribune about this while i keep watch for any others and be careful therell be more of them between us and the cohort his fellow archer jerked his head in silent amusement and vanished into the forest without a sound qadir turned and slid back through the trees settling back into a hiding place within bowshot of the dead scouts cooling corpse to wait for the dawn silently mouthing a prayer for his victims spirit as he nocked another arrow to his bow and froze into perfect immobility drust roused his warriors before dawn the next morning and gathered their family leaders around him in the grey light of the suns waking beneath the horizon the previous night had been the time to fire his men up with tales of the riches they would win once the romans were swept away walking from one campfire to the next to show them his confident wolfish grin he stood in the middle of his warband in the heart of a gathering of the fifty or so men who provided their leadership thousands of warriors beyond them straining to hear his words one cohort and a few miserable horse boys arent going to hold us up for long but i want to do this the true venicone way in a storm of iron and blood their blood ive run from them for long enough to crave battle to swing my hammer into their shield wall and see men shrink away in terror he stared about him his heart swelling with a savage pride in the host of warriors gathered about him and raised the hammer over his head in one hand as he turned in a full circle to stare his chieftains in their eyes not one of those roman bastards is to survive to tell the tale of how we tore them limb from limb let it be as if they simply marched into the autumn fog and never came out again as if the very hills wearied of their presence and rose up crushing them flat without leaving any trace let there be no word of their deaths for their families not even the bitter comfort of knowing that their men are dead and not enslaved for the rest of their short lives no more running my brothers let the romans know what it feels like to run at least for as long as it takes for us to catch every last one of them and put them to the sword when the cheers had died away he gathered his chieftains about him speaking softly to avoid being heard beyond their tight ranks once we move we move quickly tell your men that any one of them that falls out of the march will be left to face his shame alone well meet the scouts i sent out last night on the road and they will guide us into the enemy camp we must mob the romans my brothers like wolves bringing down a stag when we find them there can be no hesitation we must run straight into the fight and overcome their defence with simple weight of numbers if we respect their shield wall they will hold us at spears length all morning bleeding us from behind its shelter in their usual cowardly way run to the fight like wolves my brothers sink your teeth into their throats and bring them down in the way that we fight best spill blood for me my brothers the warband ran to the east in the dawns growing light in silence their passage marked only by the jingle and clatter of their weapons with the king and his twentyman bodyguard running at their head three miles out from their camp the scouts sent out by drust the previous night rose from the vegetation at the side of the track that headed east to the dinpaladyr and drust raised his hand to stop the warbands forward progress his men panted their steaming breath into the cold morning air while he walked to meet his men only three of you one of my men went closer to the enemy camp my lord but he did not return we heard nothing but they must have found him and either killed or captured him drust nodded unhappily telling himself that the mans loss would inform the romans of nothing more than they already knew but nevertheless cursing the lost opportunity to learn more about his enemys disposition go on then tell me what you know we found the roman camp by the light of their watch fires my lord and stayed within sight of them until dawn to better see what awaits us they have camped in a gap in the forest my lord with the ground to either side made impassable by trees they have felled with the tops facing outwards but the ground before their earth walls is clear and flat drust scowled his face contorted with the ache in his chest from the effort of the run so they may be alerted but no more so than would have been the case anyway you can lead us to them the scout nodded pointing down the track with a dirtynailed finger simple enough my lord if we run another thousand paces we will come upon the break in the forest on your right five hundred paces deep and the same wide the enemy camp occupies the last third of the open space with flat ground all the way from the track to their earth wall drust nodded thinking fast how high is their wall the other man tapped his leg where the thigh joined with his groin this high my lord a running man could be over it in one jump if it were not defended you read my mind and when you left it to meet up here was it defended no my lord there was noise inside the camp but no sign of any shields at the wall good now walk with me and give me a warning when we are within one hundred paces of the gap in the forest we will make a quiet march from here and only run again at the very last moment the warband paced forward in silence the lead scout walking alongside drust as they crept down the track towards the roman camp with no more than fifty paces left before the point where he judged they should start the attack the scout stiffened and grasped his masters arm pointing at a handful of men who had marched out of the mist to their front each of them carrying a pair of leather buckets the groups leader bore the marks of a man who had recently taken a beating and he carried himself gingerly as if every movement were painful romans and barbarians alike goggled at each other in a moment of indecision before the soldiers reacted tossing aside their buckets and turning to flee screaming out warnings as they ran too late drust told himself gleefully much too late he sprang forward bellowing the only command required to unleash his men attack the men of his bodyguard ran with him the faster of his warriors passing him within a dozen paces as they sprinted in pursuit of the fleeing romans rounding the edge of the forest gap within which the enemy camp had been constructed the venicones stormed down the slight slope towards their objective every man howling a battle cry as they swept towards the camps unmanned defences looking beyond the fleeing soldiers drust saw a sea of tents across the breadth of the roman encampment with smoke rising from dozens of cooking fires while the few isolated sentries patrolling outside the earth walls took one look and bolted for the illusory safety of the camps interior the warbands onrushing tide reached the slowest of the soldiers fleeing before them and the man went down with a spear in the back of his neck his gurgling scream driving his comrades forward in their headlong flight from the howling warriors behind them the desperate soldiers reached their walls running through the doglegged gap left open to allow unobstructed entry and exit one of them falling on the mudslicked grass and crashing to the ground he was overrun in a second dying in a flurry of blades as the leading venicone warriors hurdled the earth wall to either side of the entry with ease and charged on into the roman camp drust slowed a little as he reached the camps walls his eyes narrowing in calculation there was no anklebreaker the squarebottomed trench that the romans usually dug alongside their earth walls to fell the unwary attacker with broken foot or ankle bones driven forward by the sheer mass of his men he climbed on to the wall to stare across the leather tents that filled the camp resisting the press of his warriors to keep his balance as they poured over the wall to either side and charged forward into the heart of the enemy position cunning bastards there behind the camps far wall there they were a wall of round shields faced the venicones across the empty camp the cooking fires the few patrolling sentries and even the apparently surprised water carriers all a ruse to make him believe the romans were unprepared for his onslaught and a part of his mind wondered what trick might yet wait for them even as he pointed at the defenders and screamed the only possible command under the circumstances kill them all theyve bitten off the bait and swallowed it whole the three tribunes lay flat among the trees looking down the long slope that ran down to the empty camp so painstakingly prepared the previous day while the two tungrian cohorts pioneer centuries had laboured with their axes to build an impassable abattis of fallen trees to either side of the earth walls making an assault through the camp towards its rear wall the only way to reach its defenders the soldiers and tribesmen had painstakingly prepared the ground inside the walls for an influx of unsuspecting venicone warriors licinius nodded in response to his colleagues comment just a little longer let them get properly mired before we show our hand the barbarians stormed over the camps outer wall and charged through the cohorts tents towards the real defence at its rear a wall fully four feet tall and defended by a thicket of sharpened stakes set to rip the throat out of an unwary attacker there you go what a delightful sound higher notes were piercing the berserk roar of the venicone onslaught screams of agony rising as the warriors charging across the empty camp found the other defences readied to greet them scauruss grimace when the older man had first outlined his plan for the battle had brought a smile to liciniuss face and blank incomprehension to laenass lilies thats a bit classical colleague licinius had smiled grimly holding the fireblackened stake up for his brother officers to examine more closely you like the idea then scaurus had nodded taking the sharp sliver of wood and testing the point on the ball of his thumb before handing it to laenas very much so if it was good enough for the divine julius in his conquest of the gauls its more than good enough for us to use on these animals judging that the volume of agonised screaming had risen to the level they were waiting for he raised an eyebrow at licinius who nodded his agreement raising his voice for the centurions waiting behind them to hear very well gentlemen lets go and show these tattooed bastards what it means to push rome too hard all three men climbed to their feet and behind them the wood that overlooked the decoy camp came alive with the shouting of centurions and the rattle of equipment as three cohorts stirred from their long wait and came to battle still standing on the false camps front wall drust watched in dismay as his warriors blundered into the trap waiting for them as they charged through the sea of tents intent on bringing the defenders to battle dozens of men lurched and fell within a few seconds their screams merging with the war cries of their uninjured comrades in a cacophony of rage pain and terror the warriors following them turned to the left and right seeking a way round the sudden chaos of fallen bodies twisting in the agony of their wounds and blundered into more of the hidden traps each hastily dug pit containing several stakes arranged to point in different directions like the petals of a flower lilies nobody could ever accuse the bastards of failing to learn from their mistakes drust turned to find calgus standing alongside him atop the low turf wall the selgovae leader shook his head slowly watching as drusts warriors gingerly felt their way across the field of traps laid out in front of the rear walls entire length even advancing with caution their progress suddenly reduced to a slow walk the occasional man still found his foot vanishing into the apparently solid ground and impaled on the firehardened wooden stakes concealed in their wellcamouflaged pits both men watched as the first warriors reached the defended rear wall snaking around the long stakes protruding from the earth walls defence to attack the men waiting for them behind their shields calgus shook his head slowly ive seen this before this year theyll hide behind that wall and slaughter your men with their spears as they try to climb it youve been fooled drust theyll hold us off all morning so well kill them all by the afternoon theyre still stuck there behind that wall and all i have to do is send a force around to their rear and well have them bottled up like rats in a barrel drust turned to look at calgus who was staring at the defenders with an uncertain look in his eye what the selgovae kings frown deepened theres something wrong here the tungrians have oval shields drust turned to look again with fresh focus youre right theyre round like those fucking horsemen he spun and looked back up the slope his jaw dropping at the sight of armed and armoured men pouring from the trees to their rear turning back he pointed at the member of his bodyguard who carried the signal horn used to gain the warbands attention in battle blow as the horns echoes rang across the field and the venicones paused in their struggles to reach the camps defended rear wall drust raised his hammer high over his head then pivoted to point the weapons heavy iron head up the slope at the trap closing around the warband warriors there is our enemy attack the detachments first centuries broke from the trees at a dead run their centurions bellowing encouragement as hundreds of men hurled themselves from their hiding places and sprinted for the line that licinius had indicated to scaurus and laenas the previous afternoon the three men had walked across the long shallow slope as the late afternoons shadows slowly lengthened discussing the course that they expected the next mornings fight to take assuming that drust displays his usual bullheaded behaviour and attacks quickly rather than standing back to consider what might be wrong with this scene licinius paused and waved a hand at the soldiers labouring to construct the marching camp that he hoped would lure the venicones into their trap then there will come a moment when he knows hes been fooled and at that moment he will turn his men round and theyll come charging back up here like the hounds of hades and if they get here he pointed at the ground they were standing on before we can get a decent line established to stop them then theyll overrun us in no time scaurus had looked back at the trees behind them then turned to stare down the slope gauging the distance with a practised eye he shook his head unhappily hiding three cohorts in that wood is all very well but the men will be packed in like spectators at the circus games itll take longer to get them out and into line than well have we might be better just meeting them on open ground laenas put a hand on his arm what if the two tribunes turned to look at him scaurus raising an inquisitorial eyebrow and licinius frowning slightly his voice when he spoke was impatient with the younger mans interruption and scaurus saw his subordinate flinch almost imperceptibly at the tone yes well i was thinking licinius put his hands on his hips and narrowed his eyes with frustration tribune laenas we are colleague the older man looked at scaurus in slight surprise taken aback at the studiedly neutral tone of his brother officers voice rutilius scaurus if our colleague has an idea then id like to hear it hed raised an eyebrow at the younger man opening his hands in encouragement and laenas had stolen a nervous glance at licinius before speaking again his voice riven with uncertainty i was just thinking that if our problem is the time well have to get our soldiers out of the trees and into line then well have to find a way to slow the venicones down as they come back up this way a way they wont notice on their way down the slope both men had stared at him curiously their interest piqued as he kept talking his voice strengthening as the idea took shape liciniuss sceptical expression had transformed into a slow smile by the time he turned to call to the nearest officer decurion silus had hurried across to the trio saluting briskly tribune i need you to take a party of twenty men back to the dinpaladyr theres something the votadini will have plenty of that we need and as much of it as you can find the venicones massed at the decoy forts wall turned at their kings command and surged back up the slope yelling out their fury and frustration a clear trumpet note rang out across the battlefield and as if by some arcane magic the horde of charging tribesmen were suddenly reduced to a chaos of struggling bodies hundreds of them sprawling over previously unseen obstacles while the men behind them were felled in their turn by the chaotic sprawl of bodies in seconds the onrushing warbands attack was reduced to a crawl those men still on their feet having to pick their way around those still recovering their balance hacking furiously at the ropes which had tripped them raised from the thumbswidth trenches in which they had been run across the hillside the previous day each one snapped up and tied fast by men hidden in the woods to either side the venicones were quickly able to remove the unexpected impediment but as drust looked over his mens heads at the scurrying roman troops he shook his head and spat on the ground with disgust the cohorts had formed a rough line by the time their enemies had resumed their progress up the slope tungrians and legionaries intermingled by the speed of their rush from the trees and kept that way by a decision made by the three tribunes the previous afternoon licinius had watched the th legions men going about their preparations for the following days battle and turned to the other two senior officers with a questioning look for laenas tribune have your men actually seen any fighting this year i believe your cohort was shipped in from germania after the disaster at lost eagle and you were too late into the battle to destroy the rebellion to see any proper fighting laenas had slowly nodded his reluctant agreement in that case they are an unknown quantity whereas our tungrian cohorts have fought in two battles this year already we know that they will cope when the barbarians first attack breaks on their shields but we cannot know how your men will react i suggest that we deliberately mix some of your legionaries in with the tungrians and let them work out their ranking when they get to the line of defence that way the experienced men will help the new boys cope with what theyre about to experience the rest of you can form our reserve after all no good commander ever put everything in the shop window did he marcuss th century were among the first men to the point where licinius had decreed the defensive line would be held in the company of the first men of the legion cohort out of the trees scarface pushed himself into his accustomed place in the front rank hefting his spear and looking to either side at the legionaries beside him grinning at their expressions as they watched the barbarians regain their momentum to charge up the slope at them nice shields ladies best get ready to use them the tattoo boys will be here in a moment get your spears ready to throw thank you soldier ill be the one that decides what were to do if thats all right with you marcus standing to the lines rear with his gladius drawn kept his rebuke level enough and his eyes fixed on the oncoming venicones juliuss th century had taken their place in the line next to his men as equally mingled with the legion cohorts men as were his own and the big centurion was stalking along the line of his men and barking his last instructions over the din of the approaching barbarians theres no river to stop them this time only your shields and your desire not to end up with your head on the point of a bluenose spear marcus winced with the involuntary memory of his first glimpse of rufiuss head held aloft at the battle of forest camp as his brother officer raised his voice to bark an order at his men both ranks spears ready all along the straggling roman line the soldiers that had reached their places gripped their spears more tightly readying themselves for the next command as the tungrian and legion centurions waited for the right moment julius gauging that the venicones were as close as he wanted them without starting the fight bellowed an order that rang across the battlefield front rank spears throw legionaries and auxiliaries alike ran forward the few short paces needed to give them the momentum to throw their weapons hurling their spears and javelins into the onrushing venicones and dropping to one knee in order to provide the rear rank with a clear throw second rank throw the rearrankers threw their spears in flatter arcs their targets fewer than a dozen paces distant the auxiliaries broadbladed spears and the legionaries arrowheaded javelins dropping hundreds of the enemy warriors to the slopes turf in screaming writhing agony the soldiers quickly reformed their line and braced for the barbarian charges impact as the stricken warriors were shrugged aside or trampled underfoot by the warbands charging mass scarface grimaced at the sight of a dying warrior a spear spitted clean through him being propelled forward on faltering legs by the mass of men behind him and set himself a little lower behind his shield as he waited for the warbands impact muttering as much to himself as to the men around him he raised his gladius until the swords point was held level with his shields brass boss ready to strike steady boys steady we get this wrong and were all fucked the venicone charge broke on the defenders shields with an impact that rocked the roman line back half a dozen paces the warbands wildeyed warriors hammering at the wall of shields that confronted them with a rabid intensity a wild desperation born of their realisation that they were trapped inside their enemys line the romans gave ground grudgingly forced back one pace at a time by the barbarian onslaught and fighting back from behind their shields with welltimed sword thrusts aiming for the barbarians vulnerable thighs guts and throats their stabbing thrusts ripped open the warriors unprotected skin in hot sprays of blood killing or disabling several of the enemy for every legionary or soldier who fell to a barbarian weapon the soldier scarface his tunic already wet with blood running down his neck from a shallow spear wound to his chin from the initial barbarian attack pushed his shield forward as the spearman stepped forward and struck at him again watching as the weapons long blade punched through the boards layered wood and stuck firm wrenching the shield back to pull the weapon from its wielders hands and drag the barbarian forward an involuntary pace he stepped forward to meet the momentarily unbalanced warrior with a snarl of triumph stabbing his gladius deep into the other mans thigh he twisted the blade savagely to open the blood vessel running beneath the ruined flesh wrenching it free and punching the stricken spearman back into the mass of men behind him with his shields heavy boss behind the battling soldiers centurions spaced down the length of the line watched hawk eyed for casualties bawling at the men of the rear rank to pull any casualty who failed to stagger clear of the fight out of the line by his arms and throw him clear quickly pushing a replacement in where the majority fought back in silence save for their grunts of exertion a few of the romans those close to being unhinged by the horror unfolding around them and those for whom these few precious minutes of combat were the potent elixir of their lives screamed in desperation and wideeyed defiance at the barbarian warriors railing at their shields as they fought drust climbed the slope behind his men with a speed born of his sense of urgency calgus close behind him as he pushed through the warband to reach the roman line with his bodyguard gathered close about him looking between the heads of his warriors he saw the roman line holding firm the determined soldiers fighting hard to hold off his mens attack and the evidence before him told its own story many more warriors than soldiers lay dead and wounded in the trampled mud between the two lines and the sour stink of their blood and the contents of their guts was already strong enough to make his gorge rise stepping back a few paces he looked grimly around the men of his bodyguard nodding slowly at them as the knowledge of what would be required to escape from the roman trap became clear on their faces he spoke over the battles din looking each man in the eye in turn as he told them what he needed warriors of my household you above all other men of the tribe are as brothers to me after all these years together and now my brothers i must ask a difficult thing of you unless we break this roman line and quickly our own dead will form a wall over which we must climb to make our escape making such a thing nigh on impossible we few must do what another five hundred champions might struggle to achieve hamstrung by their very numbers we must throw ourselves into the romans without regard for our lives and kill enough men in one place to allow our warriors to exploit the gap we carve in their line and break it asunder when their line breaks i will lead the warband through the gap and fall on them from the rear victory will be ours but to break their line will need a mighty sacrifice my brothers i will lead you in this but you must be willing to attack the romans with desperate speed and raging fury if we are to make this happen can you do that for me my brothers knowing that many of you will be drinking with your ancestors tonight he looked around his men again seeing the resolution harden in their faces as they met his gaze some nodding their assent while others simply stared back with the expressions of men who knew full well that their time had come brushing away tears of pride he opened his arms and beckoned them into a huddle of bodies smelling the tang of their sweat as he spoke the words he knew would unleash their full fury on their enemy brothers you have been to me but no longer will i call you so from now you are not brothers to me but sons those of you that fall will be venerated as my children those of you that live respected as members of my family we shall be remembered far beyond our lifetimes my sons for what we are about to do for we go to bite out our enemys throat and tear his body to pieces with me my sons the huddle broke as the king stepped forward to face the romans swinging his hammer in an overhead stroke to bring it sweeping down on the head of a legionary the heavy iron head smashing the roman to the ground with his helmet staved in and while the men to either side goggled at their comrades inert body he swung the hammer low breaking the ankles of one man and upending another with a vicious hook and pull that used the last of the weapons momentum as the lines rearrankers stepped in to take their places peering from behind their shields at the fallen soldiers his bodyguard surged forward with snarls of defiance taking their iron to the men to either side of the breach in order to stop any attempt to reinforce the endangered section of the line their reckless attacks broke on the obdurate roman defence in sprays of their own blood but their sacrifice as drust had predicted gave him a precious moment of time in which the soldiers to either side of the terrified rearrankers were preoccupied with their own defence and could give no thought to reinforcing the point of his attack turning back to face his warriors drust raised his hammer high and bellowed the only command his men would require forward my brothers forward to victory turning back to the romans he sprang forward and swung the hammer up and then straight down punching the pointed end of the weapons head down into a soldiers helmet breaking through the iron shell and felling its wearer instantly blood flowing from the fallen mans ears as he pitched full length atop the turf the warband surged forward with a roar of triumph pouncing on the weakened section of the roman line in a welter of blood and iron killing half a dozen soldiers and smashing its way through what was left of the defence in an unstoppable stream of men first spear neuto ran from his place behind his cohorts line towards the break in the defence shouting a request to his colleague frontinius as he drew his sword and plunged into the fight quickly send me your rearrankers julius and marcus the nearest of the st tungrian cohorts officers to the break in their sister units line had already reacted exactly as neuto had requested ordering their rearrank men to leave the fight and follow them towards the slowly but inexorably expanding hole in the roman defences they ran head on into the venicones who had fought their way past the soldiers struggling to contain the breakthrough dozens of wildeyed warriors spilling out into the open space behind the line whose next act unless they were contained would be to fall on the rear of the men still struggling to hold back the barbarian wave marcus drew his spatha and pointed it at the warriors urging his men forward alongside those led by julius their few dozen soldiers advancing into the teeth of the barbarian attack and momentarily shoring up the righthand side of the lines breach facing fresh opposition where they had thought to find nobody to oppose them some of the barbarians turned to fight while others pushed up the slope towards the legion cohort waiting under the forests edge seeking to outflank the newcomers reinforced by the increasing numbers of men running to reestablish the lines integrity even as more warriors pushed and fought their way through the slowly widening gap forcing the defenders back pace by anguished pace the nd cohort stood their ground and fought back despite their precarious position stubborn determination and the knowledge that to break under the pressure being applied to them could result only in their deaths fuelled their desperate resistance but the two centurions shared a knowing glance both realising that the defence was hanging by a thread that must snap at any moment with the venicones simple but irresistible weight of numbers marcus looked in puzzlement up the slope to the reinforcements standing in front of the forest before turning to shout a question to julius above the cacophony of battle what are they waiting for tribune laenas stood in front of the detachments reserve five centuries of his legionaries waiting one hundred paces to the rear of the roman line and watched with growing unease as drusts hammer rose and fell above the defenders heads he had been every bit as unhappy as scaurus had predicted would be the case when he was detailed to stand ready with the reserve centuries one hundred paces behind the main line of defence tribune scaurus i must scauruss response had been terse his patience stretched thin by the young aristocrats pressing desire to put his cohort in the coming battles front line follow your orders tribune that would be wise the young roman had recoiled at the harsh tone in his superiors voice seeing something unexpected in scauruss face as the older man had turned to face him in the previous evenings gloom i only scaurus had shaken his head uncompromisingly putting a finger firmly on his subordinates breastplate no i understand laenas but youre just going to have to do as i tell you this is going to be a world away from anything you or your men have ever experienced before i need battlehardened soldiers in the line when the venicones realise that theyre the rats in this particular trap because theyre going to fight like wild animals to escape my auxiliaries have faced down barbarians exactly like these more than once this summer which means that they know they can beat drusts men given the right circumstances if some of your legionaries can get into the line alongside them then so much the better for all concerned but my men need officers that they can trust standing behind them your first spear is going to be of questionable value in a fight from what little ive seen of him and youve never experienced this scale of bloodletting at close quarters for all your unquestionable willingness to fight hed smiled tightly at the younger man shaking his head slightly and when he spoke again his tone had been gentler id be content to stand as our reserve if i were you tribune laenas and let your first experience of this vicious way of fighting be an easier introduction than my tungrians had at lost eagle and while youre standing there you should pray to all of your gods that theres no need for your men to unsheathe their swords because if there is then the barbarians will have broken through and you and your five centuries will be all that stands between my command and bloody disaster and in such circumstances colleague your chance for death or glory will be upon you quicker than you can appreciate with a sudden sick lurch of his guts laenas realised that the line was breaking before his eyes as he watched the tiny breach in the detachments defences began to widen as the inexorable force being exerted by the mass of barbarians pressing upon it forced apart the soldiers fighting to hold them back and despite the reinforcements running from the lines rear on both sides of the breach realising that he had only seconds in which to react the young tribune ripped his sword from its scabbard and turned to canutius come on then first spear it seems that were needed after all his subordinate was staring across the narrow space between the reserve centuries and the milling barbarians his eyes pinned wide and his face red with fear laenas stared at him for a moment both horrified at the mans apparent loss of control in the face of battle and uncertain of how he should react as the moment of decision hung in the balance a shout rang across the battlefield scauruss voice cutting through the fights rising din tribune laenas your time for glory is here he nodded decisively and turned away from canutius with a slight smile suddenly calm in the realisation that there was only one possible course of action raising the weapon above his head he summoned the strength to steady his wavering voice first cohort ready spears the legionaries pulled their javelins from the damp earth into which they had been pushed butt spike first moments before and hefted their shields from their resting places in a dry rustle of wood and iron laenas turned back to the barbarians forcing their way through the rupture in the romans line their numbers already doubled in those scant seconds and fixed his gaze on the redhaired giant who had smashed his way through the detachments line with such brutal ease for the first time in months it seemed he felt his heart lift with the moments simplicity felt liberated from the need to worry about the slow bleeding away of his reputation at the hands of his subordinate fighting back a sudden wild urge to laugh aloud in the first spears terrified face he pointed his sword down the slope at the venicones first cohort follow me stepping off down the slope without looking behind him to see whether his men were following he locked eyes with the venicone king watching the man with an almost detached interest as the warlord lifted his massive war hammer and strode forward to meet the reinforcements his bellowed challenge lost in the fights tumult the two men stalked closer to each other with their eyes locked together neither willing to look away in the last seconds before they met above the roar of the fight laenas thought he heard his name being called again but ignored the distraction as the barbarian warrior broke into a run covering the last few paces between them in seconds with his hammer swinging high the weapon slashed down in a humming diagonal attack its spike intended to crack the tribunes breastplate and smash his ribs but he sidestepped and ducked beneath the blow slashing at his opponent with the his swords blade and drawing a bloody line across the mans thigh drust staggered and snarled reversing the hammer and thrusting the heavy iron counterweight at the base of its handle into the romans face sending him reeling backwards while laenas was off balance blood spurting from his shattered nose a tribesman leapt forward and rammed his sword deep into the tribunes armpit before dying on the shaft of a thrown javelin as the st cohorts centuries hurled their weapons in a devastating lowslung volley that withered the ranks of the attacking venicones with a roar of anger the legionaries drew their swords and charged at the stunned barbarians stabbing viciously at their enemy in their fury at seeing their officer fall drust and what remained of his bodyguard fought in a tight knot briefly holding the legionaries at bay in a circle around them until maon standing back to back with his master was spitted by a javelin thrust staggering forward on to his enemys blades with blood frothing on his lips falling under a hail of hacking blows another legionary stepped in and drove his spear through the venicone kings back heaving and twisting on the weapons wooden shaft to force its barbed iron head deeper into the stricken barbarians body drusts spine arched with the cold irons first agonising thrust into his kidneys and he stared down in disbelief as the spears head ripped through his stomach wall dropping to his knees in agony he allowed the hammers handle to slip from his grasp as he reached down to grasp the javelins iron head with both hands his teeth bared in a silent scream of pain scaurus ran the few paces from his place at the rear of the tungrian line a dozen of the th centurys axemen around him hacking a path into the remaining barbarians before them he pointed his sword at the breach in the line hurling an order at the legionaries over the fights hubbub sixth legion advance close this gap at the shouted command the cohorts front rank marched onwards down the slope their implacable attack scattering the remaining barbarians to either side in panicked attempts to escape before the line was reestablished behind the marching centuries another soldier raised his gladius and chopped down at the fallen kings exposed neck the blow sufficiently strong only to halfsever drusts head from his body but enough to put him face down and unmoving in the grass the sword rose and fell again and its bearer lifted drusts severed head by its mane of red hair with a bellow of triumph while the owner of the javelin buried in his corpses back tore its barbediron head free from the headless body the kings gold torc fell from his severed neck into the hillsides long grass and the spearman bent to retrieve it goggling at the fortune in gold in his hands ill take that and the torc the legionaries turned to find first spear canutius striding towards them his panic of barely a moment before wiped away by his mens success those both belong to the emperor ill make sure they reach the governor rather than have you thieving bastards the legionary who had decapitated the venicone king looked about him quickly getting a quick nod from his mate who had raised his spear as if to examine its bloody blade with a critical eye he allowed the dead kings head to dangle at his side and replied to the officers challenge with a curled lip fixing canutius with a disparaging glance not this time centurion youre too shy when the fights on for my liking canutius raised his vine stick his face hard with fury only to stagger as the legionary behind him lunged forward ramming the javelins vicious point through his armour and deep into his body the man holding drusts head bent close as the officer stiffened jerking spasmodically as the spears barbediron head tore into his heart thats what youve been terrified of all this time pushing us forward to keep your skin intact not so bad now is it he nodded to the spearman who deftly withdrew his weapons pointed head through the hole it had punched in canutiuss armour and lowered the dying officer to the ground alongside the spot where laenas lay his open eyes staring blankly at the clouds above them thats vengeance for you id say young tribune you fought well enough for a lad when you finally got the chance he reached out to close laenass eyes and then spotting a minute movement of the fallen officers chest bent closer to examine the fallen tribune with a critical eye young gentlemans not dead not yet anyway bandage carrier while the battle raged on fifty paces down the hills slope scaurus and licinius hurried to the rear of the attacking legionaries surrounded by their escort of tungrian axemen heading for the spot where they had seen tribune laenas go down under drusts attack and finding a huddled knot of men gathered around the bodies of several men licinius scattered them with a barked command pushing one man out of his path stand aside the legionaries cleared a path through to the stricken laenas and scaurus noting the body of canutius alongside that of the young tribune hung back behind his colleague with his eyes roaming across the scene the bandage carrier shook his head unhappily looking up at licinius with a look of certainty nothing i can do for him tribune the wounds too deep inside he should be dead already by rights scaurus found what hed been looking for a pair of legionaries sidling towards the edge of the group with neutral expressions on their faces you two stop where you are the rest of you get back in line and fight this battle has a while to run yet the two soldiers snapped to attention eyeing the hardfaced tribune as he stalked towards them licinius put a toe under canutiuss shoulder turning the dead mans body over he was speared in the back from the look of it scaurus reached out and took the spear from the taller man examining its point with a critical eye theres blood on this weapon legionary the soldier shook his head dourly barbarian blood sir i did for their king the tribune shook his head in turn then handed the weapon back and turned away bending to kneel alongside the dying tribune well now popillius laenas youll be in the company of your ancestors soon enough hold your head up high when they greet you for youve won this fight for us see he lifted the venicone kings head for the dying man to see this was their king without him to lead them theyll give it up soon enough and youre the man that took the fight to him and sealed his fate ill make sure your family know you died with a soldiers honour he bent closer to the prostrate tribune speaking quietly into his ear but now i need you to tell me one more thing brother you see your first spear lies dead alongside you murdered by one of your own men in all likelihood its common enough when an officer is hated by his soldiers of course but we cant allow it to stand unpunished so tell me tribune did you see it happen laenas moved his head with painful slowness to stare at the two soldiers standing behind the kneeling tribune a faint smile ghosting across his face and his lips moved in speech so quiet that scaurus had to put his ear to the dying mans mouth to hear them saw nothing scaurus stared into his eyes for a moment watching as the life left them he patted the dead mans shoulder and then rose turning back to the waiting legionaries with a flat stare today legionaries is your lucky day or so it seems rejoin your century glancing at each other with scarcely concealed relief the two men turned back to the fight freezing into immobility at the sound of the harsh metallic scrape of scauruss sword leaving its scabbard of course i could still have the pair of you lashed to death or simply execute you both myself here and now so i suggest you surrender that pretty gold neckpiece before i decide which of the two would be preferable the spearman turned back white faced pulling the massive gold collar from inside his armour and putting it into the tribunes hand dismissing the men with a flick of his hand scaurus turned back to his colleague who stared back at him with raised eyebrows if laenas was willing to condone their murder of canutius then who am i to deny him that last pleasure given the number of times the man was the cause of his humiliation licinius nodded taking the torc from his colleagues outstretched hand and looking over his shoulder at the battle still raging on the slope below them agreed now lets go and finish what drust was so keen to start we have a chance to bring peace to the north for a generation to come ill see every last one of these bastards dead or a slave before night falls with the gap in their line closed and reinforced by the five legion centuries that had pinched off the venicones desperate attack and killed their king the romans began the process of inexorably grinding the resistance out of the tribesmen trapped between their shields and the forest advancing down the slope behind their shields spears and swords stabbing out to kill and maim those barbarians still willing to face them they herded the beaten tribesmen into an ever smaller space until their only alternatives were surrender or death increasing numbers of men threw down their weapons and knelt under the detachments spears cursed and spat on by those of their comrades still willing to fight on in defiance of the odds facing them as more and more men fell under the romans unrelenting assault or gave up the struggle its a hard choice in their place i chose to fight but marcus raised an eyebrow at the tone in arminiuss voice both men watching as another sullen tribesman was dragged through the tungrians line at spear point his hands swiftly bound before he was pushed into a group of his beaten comrades under the swords of a pair of lightly wounded soldiers but what youd have missed this life of adventure if hed just beaten your brains out can you really say that youd he raised his sword and pointed at one of the wounded guards you keep your distance from the prisoners and stop waving your iron at them unless you want me to come over there and do the same to you the soldier saluted gingerly with his wounded arm and stepped back from the tribesmen lowering the sword whose blade hed been passing inches from their downcast faces where was i yes can you really say that youd exchange a quick death and an unmarked grave for he looked up as a squadron of riders rode up to his place in the line their leader reining his horse to a halt alongside him with another mount led alongside him centurion would you like to be a cavalryman one last time there are venicones who escaped when your line was broken to be hunted down and tribune licinius has ordered me to take the best men available in their pursuit leave this hairy gentleman to watch the fun and join us in the hunt the roman looked up at the rider shielding his eyes from the suns glare is that bonehead youve brought for me to ride eh decurion felix perhaps this is really just one more chance to get my neck broken the decurion grinned back gesturing to the horse with his free hand nobody else can ride him not now youve encouraged the unruly bugger to have his own way whenever he fancies it come on now the bluenoses will be gone without trace at this rate and your tribune gave me a message for you he said to tell you that calgus ran qadir the chosen man turned from his place at the lines rear where he was supervising the capture of the continual flow of barbarian prisoners ive a score to settle the century is yours until i get back felix watched as marcus plucked a spear from the nearest rearranker and jumped into the saddle alongside him yes he said that would have the spring back in your step the two men rode hard up the slope with the remainder of felixs squadron following close behind in an extended line they quickly overtook the hindmost of the barbarians who had fought their way free as the legion centuries had closed the door on their route to freedom a tall skinny warrior limping painfully away from the battlefield as fast as his damaged body would carry him the decurion lowered his spear and rode the straggler down expertly thrusting the weapons long blade through his neck and tearing it free in a shower of blood not bothering to look back as his victim sank to his knees and then pitched headlong to the turf theres more of them form skirmish line the horsemen rode down several groups of barbarians initially wounded men unable to flee fast enough to have any chance of escape but soon they began catching the unharmed warriors who had taken their chance to run for their lives those that prostrated themselves were spared and a rider detailed to guard the survivors of each group while those that continued running or turned to fight were killed without compunction by the fastriding cavalrymen there felix pointed his bloodslathered spear at a small group of warriors running hard for the shelter of a forest still a mile distant and marcuss face hardened at the sight hed been waiting for its calgus cut them off but nobody touches the man in the purple cloak brought to bay too far from the trees for there to be any chance of escape the barbarians threw down their weapons and pushed the selgovae king forward towards the horsemen calgus shrugged off their hands stepping forward to meet the point of marcuss spear with his head held high advancing until the point of the weapons iron blade rested firmly on his chest very well son of two dead fathers take my life if you have no interest in what your real father wrote about you in all those letters he never sent put that spear through me and take your revenge stabbing the weapon into the turf marcus dismounted and stepped up to the barbarian leader with one hand on the hilt of his gladius and his face dark with anger calgus smirked back at him as i told you yesterday the legatus was quite a writer it seems i captured a writing chest full of his correspondence and among it was a sheaf of scrolls that he wrote to you over the years it was quite touching really full of his hopes for you and talking about the few times he managed to see you by visiting your father when you were younger he no the barbarian blinked in surprise and then opened his mouth to speak again but found himself looking down the length of marcuss gladius no for all i know youre spinning me a tale from your own desperation you want me to escort you back to my tribune who will send you back to rome for the triumph that you assume must follow this victory there you presume you might live another year or more and there have always been those barbarian leaders who are spared when they get the chance to work their wiles on the emperor whats to say that you cant pull the same trick calgus grinned wryly youll never know then will you youll have to he staggered back as marcus punched him hard in the face a straight jab that sent him reeling dazed to the ground before the barbarian leader could respond marcus stepped forward with the eaglepommelled gladius raised spearing the blades point down into the barbarian leaders left calf with careful precision before pulling it loose through his achilles tendon calgus raised his head and screamed in agony jerking again as marcus repeated the process with the other leg he pulled a knife from calguss belt ripping the purple cloak away from the prostrate chieftain and cutting two long strips from it before stepping back and tossing them to the wounded man his eyes pitiless as the barbarian leader twisted in pain thats your death sentence calgus use these to bind your wounds and youre not likely to die from them but youll never walk unaided again you can stay out here and take as long to die as you like of course the wolves will find you soon enough once theres nobody else here to frighten them away and if they dont im sure the votadini will be happy enough to provide you with a protracted death if they get to you first you could kill yourself of course if you have enough will power to open your wrists with your teeth but i suspect youll hang on to the very last moment hoping against hope for some improbable rescue not much of a choice i suppose but its a good deal more than you gave my birth father he turned away and remounted the big grey without a backward glance meeting felixs raised eyebrows with a steady expressionless gaze that will be the last of them id say anyone that reached the forest deserves to live shall we take the survivors back to join their fellow slaves the small detachment rode back down the slope an hour later the heads of the tribesmen they had overtaken dangling from their saddle horns and their prisoners staggering exhaustedly before them marcus trotted his mount over to the tribunes with felix following him and dismounted wearily saluting the two senior officers before holding out what was left of calguss cloak to scaurus the tribune took the garment and passed it in turn to licinius the senior officer nodded solemnly tossing the prize to one of his bodyguard you took revenge for your father then i crippled him and left him for the animals licinius grimaced casting a wry smile to scaurus remind me never to get on the wrong side of this young man still with both calgus and drust dead well have no more problems from the tribes any time soon at least not until the current crop of barbarian children reaches maturity and decides to come looking for revenge by which time itll be somebody elses problem to handle who knows perhaps well even be able to reman the northern wall with this many of the tattooed bastards either dead or on their way to new homes marcus looked out across the battlefield from the vantage point of his mount surveying the aftermath of the venicones disastrous attack a mound of enemy dead was being stacked unceremoniously where the fighting had been the heaviest at the point where the line had momentarily broken other soldiers were carefully collecting the detachments dead and stacking their corpses in neat lines each body stripped of its armour and weapons in preparation for the funeral pyre for which the two tungrian pioneer centuries were cutting wood at the forests edge in another corner of the clearing a large group of tribesmen were huddling under the legion cohorts spears while soldiers pulled them one at a time from the mass of their comrades to be searched before they were roped into lines of downcast men ready for the long march south into slavery how many of them did we kill sir the petrianas commander followed his gaze about five thousand of them at a guess it was a bit of a bloodbath if the truth be told the killing was almost impossible to stop once we had them pinned against the forest especially given the casualties our men took holding their first charge he caught marcuss frown and smiled grimly weve lost over four hundred men mainly in the struggle to close the line after drust had battered his way through it apart from tribune laenas and that worthless fool canutius weve lost first spear neuto and three other centurions holding them back while the sixth legion decided whether to join in or not if canutius hadnt been speared by his own men id probably have done the job myself i suppose a couple of thousand slaves will make a decent contribution to the burial fund and see the widows and children right even if the sheer number of them drives their price down and now that youve restored some measure of the sixth legions honour by dealing with the maniac that started the whole bloody mess off id suggest that you he paused as a trumpet sounded marcus turned and looked over the heads of the labouring soldiers from his vantage point on the horses back theres a rider coming in from the west an officer from the look of it licinius frowned with bemusement for a few seconds then nodded slowly of course theyll have followed the venicones tracks i should have expected this youd better come with me gentlemen because if im guessing correctly this concerns all of us marcus and felix dismounted leading their horses behind them and followed tribunes licinius and scaurus across the slope none of them noticing that martos had detached himself from the body of his warriors and was following them at a discreet distance the small party waited at the battlefields edge until the lone rider reached them equipped as a centurion he was tall and thin with a sardonic twist to his mouth greetings centurion the newcomer looked down at them curiously making no attempt either to dismount or salute greetings gentlemen you sir must be tribune licinius if my estimate is correct and as to these other three gentlemen id guess that youre gaius rutilius scaurus recently promoted from prefect to tribune your colleague tribune paulus at noisy valley gave me an excellent description of you and i would have recognised the youngest of you without any such help since he bears a distinct resemblance to the physical description ive been given for marcus valerius aquila son of an executed senator and therefore a fugitive from imperial justice he stared at felix for a moment before shaking his head with a wry smile and you decurion are perhaps the most unexpected of all you are amulius cornelius felix i presume tribune paulus told me how you got that scar on your chin sparring with him as a boy your presence is a very welcome bonus since your friend paulus also told me only after the application of quite significant personal duress i should add that you hold the key to a question that praetorian prefect perennis is most keen to have answered the corn officer looked down at the three men in silence for a moment before speaking again his expression one of utter confidence i dont suppose for one moment that youre actually wondering who i am since im sure that bad news always travels faster than good but just for the formality of the thing my name is tiberius varius excingus ive come a very long way to meet the four of you all the way from the camp of the strangers in rome in fact but it seems that ive arrived at a most propitious time doesnt it a battle won barbarians routed everything as it should be with the exceptions standing before me eh gentlemen one murdering traitor the two most senior officers guilty of harbouring him for these last six months and the one man who will eventually provide me with the proof of your collusion to protect the fugitive and enable me to identify just who it is thats been writing such unpleasant letters to the prefect on the subject of his sons death and all in one place which makes matters so much simpler he sat back on the horse with a smile waiting for one of the men facing him to speak scaurus put a hand on the hilt of his sword stepping forward and glaring up at the corn officer you do realise that youre surrounded by soldiers who were fighting for their lives less than an hour ago men with their comrades blood still drying on their armour and who have killed so many times today that one more death would make as little difference to them as swatting a fly and youre a long way from the camp of the strangers centurion doesnt that make you feel a little vulnerable excingus snorted shaking his head in amusement i was told that you would be the pugnacious one rutilius scaurus and to answer your question i feel as safe here talking to you as if i were walking through the forum in rome for one thing im sure that neither you nor your colleague tribune licinius will want to jeopardise the lives of those you hold dear in rome by any intemperate action you might have been away from home for too long to know just how far the praetorian prefect has risen in the estimation of the throne but suffice it to say that hes been permitted to grant certain members of the guard quite extraordinary powers more than that hes provided them with sufficient latitude with regard to their personal conduct that theyre more than adequately motivated to carry out whatever orders he passes down to them let me stress that gentlemen whatever he orders no matter how bloody or distasteful given that i knew exactly who you were do you doubt that i have already provided my associates with sufficient information to point these men of dubious honour at the very people you hold most dear a long silence hung in the air between the four men before excingus spoke again in addition should any further explanation of the threat my presence here poses both to you personally and to your loved ones at home be required i should also point out that my approach to the scene of your triumph here is being witnessed with great care by the two horsemen that youll see waiting for me some distance away should any violence be done to my person here they will ensure that the truth of it is known to both the governor and the emperor in which case ulpius marcellus would have no choice other than to have us put to death immediately exactly tribune licinius both succinct and correct which would leave your family here in the province somewhat at the mercy of anyone minded to make them pay for your treason wouldnt you say licinius stared up at the corn officer with murder in his eyes and then shook his head in slow angry resignation his eyes burning with hate as he spread his hands in a gesture of surrender very well centurion you have us all by the balls what do you want excingus nodded gravely very pragmatic sir and just as i expected what i want is very simple tribune and without either choice or alternative put simply both decurion felix and centurion aquila to use his former name will divest themselves of both weapons and armour and then ride with me and my escort to a place not very far from here where aquila will be executed for his treason by my praetorian colleague this will be carried out quickly and cleanly for we take no special pleasure in this duty and when sentence has been carried out then felicia clodia drusilla will be released and indeed escorted to join you here scaurus raised a hand to restrain marcus as he tensed to leap at the corn officer no unless you want her dead or worse you must restrain yourself explain yourself centurion excingus leaned forward on his saddle horn and smiled down at the hostile faces gathered around him theres not really all that much to explain tribune scaurus having gathered that the centurion here has something of a reputation as a fighting man we thought it best to have an additional means of subduing him for our short ride to justice if i fail to return within a specified time period then the lady will find herself on the receiving end of some rather degrading behaviour on the part of my praetorian escort its just a precaution of course im sure therell be no need for any unpleasantness now given that time is passing shall we proceed or would you rather keep the centurion here and allow all the consequences of noncooperation that weve discussed to come to pass marcus shook his head fumbling with the buckle of his belt theres no choice ill go with this reptile and face the justice thats been stalking me ever since the throne decided my fathers estate would make a nice contribution to the treasury he met excinguss eyes with a contemptuous stare but the corn officers shrug was eloquent in its indifference i dont judge the men on whom im ordered to exercise the imperial will valerius aquila im simply an instrument of my master if prefect perennis says that you have to die thats simply the way that it is shall we you too decurion felix although obviously youll be staying with us for a while longer i have so many questions to ask you marcus tossed his belt and swords aside and tried to lift the heavy mail shirt over his head but was frustrated both by the armours weight and his own sudden exhaustion in the face of his impending death let me help you centurion martos stepped forward with a look at scaurus and took a firm grip of the heavy mail coats shoulders lifting the armour over the romans head as he did so scaurus stepped forward with renewed anger putting a hand on his swords hilt and sliding the weapon halfway from the scabbard before licinius caught his arm and stopped the movement excingus momentarily startled resumed his confident pose as he watched the two tribunes momentary battle of wills grinning smugly as the older man tightened his grip on scauruss arm and clamped his other hand on to his incensed colleagues sword hand shaking his head firmly licinius pushed the blade home into its scabbard ignoring the rage in his colleagues eyes and speaking to him calmly in a tone akin to that used by a father to a recalcitrant son i dont know about you rutilius scaurus but id like to keep my family out of this mess if you draw that sword hell have his praetorian animals rip apart the lives of everyone we care about think about it scaurus stood stock still for a moment his body shaking with repressed anger and then turned away putting a hand to his eyes excingus smiled wryly at the sight shaking his head you really do need to learn to take this sort of thing with a touch more equanimity tribune if this is the worst thing that ever happens to you then youll have had a fortunate life by comparison with most of us marcus stepped past his tribune with a reassuring pat on the other mans arm staring up at the mounted man with a look of disgust very well centurion if youre ready excingus gestured wearily to the horse alongside his own climb aboard valerius aquila and lets get this over and done with you decurion can ride your own beast a finelooking animal you really are a very privileged young man the three men turned and rode away from the knot of officers and soldiers watching them while scaurus licinius and martos stood and watched them disappear over the ridge licinius raised an eyebrow at his colleague his tone reflective that went about as well as we could have expected the rest is up to the pair of them martos walked away from the tribunes briskly as soon as the corn officer turned his horse away knowing that arminius wouldnt be far from his master at such a moment he found the german waiting a dozen paces distant his arms folded with disapproval we should have fought allowing them to take our friend away without any resistance shames us all the votadini prince shook his head they have his woman and that bastard was very clear that he will tear through the tribunes families if he even suspects them of attempting to rescue the boy they shared a dour glance before arminius spoke all of these things will happen whether we resist or not those animals are strangers to any idea of honour so you think we should follow them the german nodded theyll be looking behind them for horsemen but they wont see a pair of dirty barbarians trailing them along the forest edge if we stay far enough back martos snorted with laughter if we stay far enough back with them on horses and us on foot staying far enough back isnt going to be much of a problem come on then he turned for the treeline only to find lugos standing behind them towering over both men martos raked him with a hostile stare what do you want selgovae the warrior flexed his shoulders great ropes of muscle moving beneath his scarred skin and hefted the war hammer that he had liberated from the growing pile of captured barbarian weapons similar to drusts heavily decorated weapon the hammer hanging nonchalantly from his hand was if anything heavier its iron beak sharpened to a point and the handles counterweight formed from a disc of iron which had been patiently worked to produce a ragged edged and a viciously hooked halfmoon blade roman spared my life now i pay back debt and you not call me selgovae i have no tribe the prince grimaced at arminius tightening his sword belt a notch in readiness for their run to the east its up to you does he run with us the german nodded tossing aside his round wooden shield yes since you and i are also both dispossessed of our tribes it seems we have no option but to accept a fellow exile now run marcus managed to hold to his initial resolve to treat the corn officer with a frosty silence as they rode to meet the praetorians waiting on them for no more than a minute felix kept silent as his friends indignant anger boiled over stroking hades neck gently as if savouring the feeling one last time so this all means nothing to you youre happy to carry out your masters instructions without giving any thought to the innocent lives youre destroying excinguss response to the question was a look of nearincredulity and what would you have me do valerius aquila tell the secondmost powerful man in the empire that im sorry but the man youve sent me to kill isnt really guilty of anything other than being born into the wrong family at the wrong time should i tell him that his son far from being the innocent victim of a fugitive from justice was in reality a traitor who betrayed his legion and caused the loss of their eagle one of the worst possible military reverses possible because believe me ive heard all those stories before over the space of the last couple of months and doubtless most of them are true marcus snorted his derision most of them excingus laughed shaking his head very well all of them if that helps you to feel better and more besides no doubt the fact remains young man that i am an imperial enforcer and having reached the dizzy rank of centurion in the camp of the foreigners therefore without any real choice in this matter gentlemen i am an urbane version of the men that collect their tribute from the businesses of the subura district but no less of a hired sword for all that and i am as subject to the praetorian prefects will as if he were riding alongside us were i sufficiently weak minded to yield to the justice in your words and release you to run again what do you think would happen to me eh i would be dead before the sun kissed the western horizon of course and dead i should add at the hand of the very man with whom prefect perennis has paired me for the task of finding you and erasing you from this pathetic existence that youve chosen as being preferable to a quick death i have neither illusions nor any choice in this matter valerius aquila and neither do you but to play your part and die with as much dignity as can be managed under the circumstances a long silence held for a few moments before marcus spoke again and the decurion here what has he done to merit whatever torture you plan to subject him to excingus raised an eybrow at the cavalry officer do you want to tell him no very well cornelius felix is here because on the day of the battle in which the sixth legion lost their eagle he watched you take part in the violent death of the man who had betrayed the legion to the barbarians since that man was prefect perenniss son our pursuit of you has been invested with more than a little of his personal interest but that wasnt the end of it the decurion here told a friend of his a legion tribune called paulus what youd done as you walked past them one night in camp and that friend got drunk and told his colleague quirinius the legions senior tribune quirinius was then sent back to rome fell on hard times and imagined that he could bargain with prefect perennis he sought to trade the identity of his sons killer for some favour or other fool he shook his head sadly he had a beautiful wife and a sweet child and i had no choice but to turn my colleague the praetorian and his thugs loose on them as part of the routine cleaning up after such murders anyway he told perennis who it was that had told him about your hiding place here on the edge of the world the prefect being rather unhappy about a series of letters hes received from britannia threatening him that the truth about his son might easily become public knowledge gave us a second mission more important to him than the quest to find you and put you down believe it or not he ordered us to find the letter writer and to silence him for good and that trail leads from quirinius to paulus and from paulus to felix here after that ill wager theres only one more link the letter writer himself im pretty sure that the final link in the chain is your tribune in fact id put good money on it but ill need to be quite sure before unleashing the hounds on him and his family which means that your questioning is likely to be somewhat enthusiastic he tipped his head to the two riders set to watch his approach to the tungrians who had left the shade of the trees and were cantering their horses towards the three horsemen and so that centurion is why your friend felix is accompanying us back to our camp and now i suggest you might want to keep your complaints about the injustice that youre about to suffer to yourself for a while i like to pride myself on having a good deal more understanding of the contradictions inherent in the role that my kind and i play than my companions but i think youll find these particular gentlemen a little less informed than me that and a lot more willing to take out their frustrations on an unarmed prisoner so unless you really want your woman to suffer at their hands as a means of teaching you to keep your mouth shut he raised an eyebrow waiting until marcus had wearily conceded the point with a dispirited nod before looking away speaking out into the empty landscape as if talking to himself good lad i knew youd see the sense of it theyre here centurion excingus has them both rapax nodded at the man hed set to watch for his colleagues return getting up from the fallen tree on which hed been sitting good once this felix tells us who witnessed the death of perenniss son well be able to finish the job and get out of this shithole of a province and back to some sunshine come along my lovely lets you and i get ourselves out of sight before your boyfriend gets here you two come with me the rest of you can provide the centurion with a suitably warm welcome once ive got his woman squawking he pulled felicia into the trees retreating far enough into their cover that he could see out into the clearing without being visible the remaining soldiers spread out in a halfcircle to receive the riders who rode into their midst and stopped at the corn officers command the two praetorians who had escorted them in peeling away to either side rapax dragged felicia deeper into the forests cover his hand clamped over her mouth to prevent her from calling out to marcus all in good time hell hear you screaming for me to stop soon enough but lets not spoil the surprise eh he turned to the guardsmen following him you two stop gawking and stand guard i dont want anyone creeping up on me while im otherwise occupied now then doctor lets get down to in the moment of his distraction felicia knowing that she could wait no longer reached under her skirts and pulled the razorsharp blade free from its scabbard as rapax turned back to her and before the watching soldiers could shout a warning she struck with all the speed and strength she had plunging the knife up into the soft skin beneath his jaw until only the bone handle protruded the praetorian staggered backwards his eyes flickering as the weapon stabbed up through his tongue and palate ran with blood that streamed down the bone handle and on to his boots he reeled back another step with his eyes rolling up to show only their whites and then straightened gripping the knife and tearing it free from his jaw with a terrible groan slack jawed at the sight of their officers wound the guardsmen failed to notice that their prisoner had turned and run deeper into the trees wrenching their attention back to the fleeing woman only when the stricken centurion pointed after her ged er turning away from their officer as he swayed and staggered blood running down the front of his armour in rivulets the praetorians did as they were bidden rapaxs plight quickly forgotten as they chased the running woman into the forest with the smiles of men who intended to fully enjoy the fruits of their hunt when they ran her to ground marcus looked about him at the praetorians gathered in a halfcircle around the three horsemen shaking his head wearily eight of you to kill one tired soldier excingus shrugged gesturing for his prisoner to dismount my colleague rapax is a thorough man and your reputation with a sword goes before you now do get down and meet your fate with a little composure the decurion and i will provide an audience for your commendable stoicism marcus frowned and spread his empty hands before him if i had a sword i could understand your colleagues caution but then if i had a sword youd already be face down with your guts hanging out and this scum would be in the fight of their lives rather than putting an unarmed man to death one of the praetorians stepped forward resheathing his gladius with a slow metallic scrape well then sonny why dont you come down here and show us how tough you are without a weapon in your hand but keep your ears pricked for the sound of your woman squealing her lovely little lungs out our centurion should be putting it to her any time now beating you to death with our bare hands will give you more time to appreciate the thought that well all be taking a turn at her once hes done marcus climbed slowly down from his horse and turned to face the men gathered in a loose halfcircle around him his face white with anger both at the guardsmans words and the look of satisfaction on his face taking up a loose stance with his hands hanging by his side he looked the praetorian up and down shaking his head slowly and sighing loudly very well then come and put me out of my misery he watched through eyes slitted in concentration as the guardsman turned to his mates with a confident smile hold off boys ill take first turn at him it isnt every day that i get the chance to knock an officer about he stalked towards his wouldbe victim clenching his impressive fists in readiness to fight you see centurion the advantage ive got over you is that i fought my way up from the gutter to where i am today ive beaten hundreds of men into the dirt in my time and youre going to be just the same as all of them once youre on your back seeing stars im going to he leaped forward in midsentence clearly intending for his words to have distracted marcus sufficiently for the sudden attack to take him by surprise throwing a fast punch at the romans face with the intention of putting his opponent on the defensive swaying back to evade the blow by the width of a finger marcus hooked the guardsmans forward leg with a swinging boot and dumped him on to his back the breath audibly knocked from the praetorians body as he hit the ground reaching into the neck of his tunic following the thin leather cord that ran down across his chest he grasped the handle of the hunting knife that martos had slipped over his head during the act of removing his armour and ripped it from its hiding place then dropping to one knee he thrust the knifes blade up under the praetorians jaw and ripped his jugular open in a spray of blood pulling the dying mans sword from his scabbard and jumping back to his feet the remaining guardsmen gaped for a moment before one of them drew his sword prompting the others to reach for their own weapons his knifehand red with blood marcus turned to face them speaking to the wideeyed corn officer without turning to face him if i were you reptile id run while you still can excingus backed his horse away from the knot of men shaking his head in amazement as his erstwhile prisoner stepped forward to meet the armed soldiers raising the bloody knife for them all to see and nodding at the dead guardsmans corpse you can all either run now and save yourselves or you can add your blood to his one of the soldiers shook his head raising his sword to fight you cant fight all of us not if we come at you together marcus smiled shaking his head at the man whod spoken and pointing the sword at him well volunteered you can be first in that case felix stepped hades sideways the coalblack horse responding easily to the familiar pressure of a knee in his ribs then nudged the animals flanks with his boots telling him wordlessly to advance a few steps while he made a show of pulling back on the beasts reins as he goaded him forward with his feet as the closest of the guardsmen turned to face the big horse raising his sword to threaten mount and rider hades responded exactly as hed been trained rearing up and kicking out with a powerful forefoot which sent the soldier flying backwards in a spray of his own blood his face smashed by the sharp edge of the animals hoof stepping down from the saddle felix slapped hades rump sending the horse cantering away from the vengeful swords of the two guardsmen who had turned to face him and stooped to retrieve the dying soldiers gladius id suggest you men get on with it and finish these two off before they kill any more of you the remaining soldiers advanced in response to excinguss goading spreading out into a semicircle around the two men one of the older guardsmen looked marcus in the eyes speaking to his comrades as he balanced on the balls of his feet ready to attack when i give the word we rush them nothing fancy just mob the pair of them and get your iron into them on my command ready as the praetorians readied themselves to storm their victims each of the soldiers looking to his comrades for the signal to attack a oneeyed barbarian warrior covered in sweat and panting as if from a long run broke from the trees behind the two prisoners his sword was held ready to fight and he weighed up the situation as the praetorians gathered around the two officers stared at him in surprise panting out a question to marcus youve not killed them all yet then the roman shook his head a slow smile spreading across his face and another warrior burst out of the forest to stand alongside the first his chest heaving with the effort of their pursuit he glanced around the men encircling marcus and felix a wheezy chuckle fighting its way past his efforts to drag air into his lungs you made me run all this way to fight these children martos he could have managed this many on his own the last man to emerge from the trees topped the first two by a head but he was barely breathing heavily despite the effort of the run a massive war hammer was held loosely across his torso its heavy iron head still smeared with blood and hair hefting the huge weapon on to one shoulder he clenched his other fist and stepped forward into the ring of praetorians his face a mask of snarling hatred as he gazed about him and spat out a challenge in his own language at last romans i can fight while the praetorians were still staring at the newcomers with growing uncertainty lugos swung the brutal weapon in a wide singlehanded arc his massive strength making light of its dead weight and smashing the hammers wicked beak against a hapless soldiers chest dropping the man writhing to the grass with his ribcage smashed lifting the pole arm high over his head he roared in triumph and smashed it down through the crippled mans helmet to break his skull with a sickening crunch of iron and bone the other two warriors exchanged a look and stepped forward alongside him raising their swords to fight but as they did so the praetorians broke and ran for their lives despite their weight of numbers lugos went after them with a bellow of rage running down the closest man in half a dozen strides and snagging his shoulder with the hammers hooked counterweight blade dropping the praetorian to the ground in a flurry of arms and legs and leaving the downed man to his fellow warriors as he chased after another panicstricken soldier excingus took one look at the fleeing guardsmen and turned his horse away spurring it away from the clearing and on to the road south marcus sprang forward running down the slowest of the soldiers and tripping him kicking away his sword and dropping his own gladius before pouncing on him to grip his throat in one hand raising the bloody hunting knife to tear out his windpipe his voice was a feral growl snarled through bared teeth and the helpless guardsman went rigid with the threat of impending death the woman where did your officer take the woman the soldier pointed into the forest with a trembling hand th that way the roman jumped to his feet dropping the bloodied knife and picking up both swords stay down and they might let you live he ran for the trees with a speed born of desperation hurdling a fallen trunk and tearing through the undergrowth to find himself in a small clearing propped up against a massive oak on the open spaces far side was a man in the armour of a praetorian centurion his chest covered in the blood that was still running from the small but deep wound under his jaw marcus stepped forward raising both swords ready to fight in case the wounded officer were part of some trap but there was no movement in the tiny glade other than the slow dripping of the other mans blood struggling to focus the wounded praetorian shook his head and laughed painfully the movement causing the flow of blood to accelerate for a moment his voice was almost inaudible and marcus had to lean close to hear the words made almost impossible to understand by the praetorians horrific wound young aquila is it the things you see when you dont have a sword in your hand marcus stepped forward and put the blade of one of his swords to the centurions throat watching as the blood streaming from under his jaw ran across the polished metal wheres my woman rapax studied him from beneath drooping eyelids for a moment before speaking his eyes fighting to stay open from shock and blood loss no idea bitch stuck me with a knife and then made a run for it sent my men after her the wheezy laugh came again and with it a hardening of the dying praetorians face one little girl alone in the forest with two big soldiers i doubt shes enjoying that very much marcus locked eyes with rapax for a moment then ran the gladius up into the wound in his throat pushing the blade upwards until it stopped against the back of the praetorians skull ripping the blade free he ignored rapaxs slumping corpse and turned away stepping silently into the trees felicia ran blindly through the trees hearing the sounds of pursuit behind her as the two praetorians burst through the undergrowth in her wake remorselessly closing the gap she had opened on them with her initial burst of speed from the clearing she ducked into the shelter of a towering oak at the edge of a small glade pulling her stola tight to her legs in the few seconds she had before the soldiers charged past a few feet to either side of the tree the sounds of their pursuit died away and she stared into the forest for a long moment torn between staying out of sight and putting more distance between herself and her pursuers the sound of their voices reached her faintly and she realised that they must have stopped chasing her and started thinking through where she could have given them the slip their words were becoming clearer and to her horror she realised that not only were they coming back towards her but that they clearly had a good idea of where she was a voice called out into the forests quiet and she had no difficulty seeing the face behind it in her minds eye the legionary whose stare had so disturbed her over the previous days maximus you cant run from us woman were going to find you soon enough and make you sorry for what you did to the centurion a new voice broke in oh yes were going to spend hours making you sorry were going to maximus kept speaking ignoring his colleagues attempts to intimidate her into leaving her hiding place im good with women you see ive got a way with them he paced around the small clearing and felicia could feel his eyes raking the vegetation looking for her place of concealment want to hear something funny the same night i was jailed for killing a man in the noisy valley alehouse another soldier from my tent party was brought in for the rape and murder of an old woman disgusting they called him and animal they knew hed done it because his amulet was found by the body they reckoned she must have torn it off his wrist while he was raping her the other soldiers would have done for him there and then but he was locked up separately and the only people that got to have a go at him were the duty centurions when they were in the mood i used to watch him in his cell his face a picture of desperation pleading that he hadnt done it but nobody was having any of it not for a moment the only person that believed he was innocent was me because i knew he hadnt been near her have you guessed how i knew that little missy ill bet you have he stopped talking for a moment allowing the suspense to build until it was all felicia could do not to scream the answer to his question at him thats right i knew he was innocent because it was me that killed her what a night that was i jumped my watch officer and gave him a good kicking then i followed the old girl back to her hovel and saw to her as well id slipped into another tent partys barrack and lifted his goodluck charm from his kit before i went out you see so i snapped the cord and left it by her body and that was all it took to see him in prison it almost made up for getting pissed and killing that idiot from the fourth century when he tried to take his knife to me and when i find you little missy im going to do all the things to you that i did to her he darted into the vegetation on the other side of the clearing with a rustle of leaves thinking that he had her hiding place located in the moment of his distraction felicia was on her feet and running almost before the decision to do so was fully formed she would stay low run to one side of the returning praetorians as quickly and quietly as she could and hope to get far enough away that she could hide again shouts in the forest behind her told her that she had failed in her hopes of escaping unnoticed and she abandoned any pretence of stealth and ran as fast as she could knowing that she could never expect to outrun the soldiers so intent on escaping from the pursuing praetorians that she failed to see the soldier waiting in her path until she was only a few paces from him the startled woman tripped over a tree root and fell to the ground at his feet smiling at the look on her face he thrust his spears butt spike into the earth and held out a hand towards her as she shrank away from him holding the knife out in hopeless defiance hello my lovely weve been looking for you he shouted back over his shoulder ive found her the first of the pursuing praetorians came into sight and drew his sword on seeing the legionary walking slowly forward with a cruel gleam in his eye whoever you are you can fuck off this ones ours he frowned in recognition as he stalked forwards then snorted with laughter as he realised that he knew the other man fuck me things must be getting desperate if theyve put the third century back into the field run away from any good fights recently have you old son now fuck off double quick theres a good boy and ill spare you the indignity of being put on your back leave that to little missy here he grinned broadly at the legionary who to his surprise shook his head grimly and pulled his spear loose from the forests hardpacked earth raising the blade to point at his face not this time maximus youve missed a few important things since you ran away with your new boyfriends habitus while the guardsman was still taking in his former comrades unexpected show of bravado another legionary came crashing through the undergrowth his spear held ready to throw fuck me theres another one is that you decimus dont say youve grown a set of balls as well both legionaries pointed their spears at his chest stepping forward either side of felicia and facing off against the baffled maximus you can run for it now mate or you can stay and find out what roman iron feels like when its deep in your guts watch officer titus broke through the wall of greenery and stopped recognising his former tormentor in an instant his face hardening well now the big wheel turns in its own good time look what the gods have rewarded me with ill have this bastards balls off and poke them up his backside before hes stopped breathing century to me habitus maximus took one look at his onetime superiors face and turned running for the shelter of the forest titus shook his head in disgust he always was too quick on his feet he offered the bemused felicia his hand helping her to her feet and you madam have a friend looking for you a scream of agony sounded from the trees into which the two praetorians had made their retreat the sound cut off after only a second as whoever had struck the first blow finished the job the soldiers stepped forward with their spears raised only to shuffle backwards as a ragged figure in tunic leggings and infantry boots stepped out before them his clothes and swords dark with the blood of whichever of the praetorians he had killed moments before marcus felicia ran across the clearing and fell upon the bloodied figure in sudden tears after a long moment during which the number of soldiers gathered around them had swollen to nearly twenty he prised her loose and looked into her tearfilled eyes with concern are you she nodded tearfully wiping at her wet face with a sleeve ignoring the knife she still held in the other hand all right yes my love we both are a frown creased marcuss face you both are cocidius help me for the son of an intelligent man youre really quite stupid when it comes to anything but butchering everyone that gets in your way the frown became a gape of amazement as the young centurion realised that dubnus was lurking behind the gawping soldiers his friend strode out to meet him putting an arm round his shoulder and speaking quietly into his ear if you dont know what a pregnant woman smells like then its time you took a good deep breath and found out and its also time for you to make an honest woman of her id say he stamped on the blade of his spear twice first bending it and then breaking it clean off the shaft before handing it to the amazed marcus here you go thatll do for the ceremonial hairstyle you lot are supposed to favour in your women on the big day its not been stuck in a gladiator for luck yet but i did one of the bastards that carried her away with it just now if that counts tribunes licinius and scaurus welcome back to civilisation gentlemen if we can characterise the neverending din of noisy valley so generously governor marcellus advanced around his desk his normally sombre face wreathed in a beaming smile and clasped hands with his officers behind him legatus equitius commander of the imperial sixth legion and former prefect of the st tungrian cohort shot them a wry smile raising amused eyebrows at his superiors unaccustomed bonhomie ive asked legatus equitius to join me in greeting you both given his previous connection with your tungrians equitius inclined his head as the governor continued his greeting my congratulations to you both you have brought great honour upon your cohorts and extinguished a threat to romes frontiers for years to come licinius saluted handing king drusts heavy gold torc to the older man governor this belonged to the king of the venicones we took many more items of jewellery from their dead but i thought you might want to take personal charge of this particular item marcellus raised the torc and admired its workmanship for a moment indeed tribune an item of such value will make a fitting accompaniment for the news of this victory when it reaches the emperor and now gentlemen you must take a cup of wine with us and explain how you achieved this unexpected triumph when the story of the previous few days events was told he sat back in his chair with a contented smile nodding his head slowly in satisfaction excellent work gentlemen simply excellent any threat the venicones might have presented to the frontier is broken and the votadini are free to rebuild their kingdom without any external interference from either north or west all of which means that we can focus our attentions to the south of the wall and on putting these brigantes scum back in their place they still control most of the country between here and the legion forts to the south and i fear that the campaign to root them out will be a bitter struggle theyre not coming to battle as the northern tribes did but seem happy to fight us with a dirty little war of raids and ambushes which means that your cavalrymen manilius licinius will have their hands full scouring the country for them you are to ride for waterside fort today and join with the second legion and the western wall cohorts in hunting down and eradicating these savages wherever you find them licinius nodded his understanding and marcellus turned to scaurus with a gentle smile and as for you rutilius scaurus i must presume upon your cohorts willingness to endure hardship once again i had originally intended sending you west with your colleagues horsemen to strengthen the second legions forces but i have received a request for assistance from my colleague in gallia belgica in the last few days assistance i feel well suited to your particular blend of skills and experience not to mention your cohorts original recruiting base he turned to the desk behind him and picked up a scroll handing it to the young tribune and raising his voice to issue his formal orders rutilius scaurus you are hereby ordered to march your men to the port of arab town at the eastern end of the wall and there to take ship for the mainland once landed you will make your way with all possible speed to the fortress town of tungrorum once there you are to establish a secure camp and then to carry out whatever operations you see fit to disperse and destroy the various bands of bandits both large and small who are plaguing the region he shot scaurus a glance of course you will be wondering exactly why your men should be needed when there are three perfectly good legions only a few days march away in their fortresses along the river rhenus any one of which might comfortably cope with any local problem as it happens not only have the german legions been somewhat depleted by the need to reinforce our losses of earlier this year but they have also been stretched too thin by a series of barbarian incursions in the last few months things are not so bad that the barbarians could attack across the river in strength but bad enough for the area around tungrorum to have fallen prey to the worst kind of scum deserters and brigands who are making life intolerable from the accounts ive received theyve tried to deal with the problem of course indeed three detachments of increasing strength from their auxiliary cohorts have been sent into the area they were either defeated by force of arms or as seems to have been the case with the last force that was sent to the area a full cohort of infantrymen mind you theyve chosen to desert to the enemy he took another sip of wine before continuing there are three reasons why ive chosen to send you and your men to deal with this situation tribune first the legatus here tells me that your men are the best we have for hunting down and destroying these brigands scaurus shot a glance at his cohorts former commander who could only shrug apologetically second your command is two cohorts strong which ought to be sufficient to deal with the deserters who i suspect will be your main problem and third your men are more likely to want to protect their original settlement than the local auxiliaries who are after all drawn from lands thousands of miles distant he fixed the tribune with a level stare tapping the order scroll in his hand to underline the significance of its contents in dealing with these matters you are to cooperate as fully as possible with the local authorities but you are also to consider your command as independent from civilian control and make any necessary decisions required to remove the threat to civil order represented by these criminal scum he smiled thinly at scaurus everybody rutilius scaurus is going to want you to achieve everything at once which is why ive deliberately written these orders to allow you to set your operational priorities as you see fit in the meantime it will take at least ten days to gather enough ships to carry your command across the german sea so i suggest that you march your men back to their home fort and allow them time to say their goodbyes and that tribunes concludes my orders may the gods smile upon you both the governor nodded and turned back to his desk and the two men saluted and began to leave only to stop at the offices door as he spoke again frowning at a tablet hed picked up from the desks highly polished wooden surface ah but there was one more thing trivial perhaps given the events of the last few weeks but potentially serious for all that both men turned back to face him sharing a quick glance it seems that a pair of imperial investigators rode through here a few days ago tribune paulus reported the fact to legatus equitius when we arrived here apparently they were seeking some fugitive from justice who has managed to upset the praetorian prefect in some way or other scaurus kept his face neutral thanking the foresight that had made licinius send a rider south in advance of the legion taking the news to paulus that rapax and excinguss mission had failed with the death of one man and the complete disappearance of the other anyway gentlemen it seems that these two officers and their escort have been lost without trace as an essential formality i must ask you both if you made any contact with them after they left this fortress both men answered the question with blank stares and when licinius spoke his voice was hard with suppressed anger none of my men have reported any such encounter governor although i lost two message riders around that time left to rot where they fell by unknown assailants when we found them one was lying unburied beside a roadside campfire and the other was face down in a ditch five miles to the south he had a throwing knife stuck through his neck a knife that my armourers tell me was roman in design the presence of imperial spies might go some way to explaining their deaths marcellus frowned in his turn i see well theres probably little to be gained from any official comment on the matter and since these men seem to have been operating independently of my office i intend to leave the matter where it lies in any case theyre certainly dead only a fool would have ridden this far north into the heart of a tribal uprising with such a flimsy escort never mind crossing the wall with the northern tribes still in ferment he shook his head and dropped the tablet on to the desk dismissed gentlemen lets get on with this war and leave the mystery of their disappearance to a quieter time stepping out of the principia into the supply forts usual bustle the two tribunes exchanged a glace and scaurus breathed a slow sigh of relief before speaking it seems that young paulus decided that he was better off having a legatus and two tribunes beholden to him than to spill the beans to the governor his colleague nodded slowly yes but id still be happier knowing exactly what happened to that odious creature excingus and that last praetorian for that matter scaurus nodded thoughtfully as he stared down the fortresss main street to the opened gates watching as the guard century supervised the arrival of the first supply convoy to reach noisy valley from the legion fortress far to the south since the start of the brigantian rebellion his men had buried the praetorian dead after hunting them down through the forest but no sign had been found of either the corn officer or the soldier who had hunted felicia through the trees after her escape dead or enslaved id guess they had a long stretch of road to cover just to reach the wall and the tribes wont be in a forgiving mood and now if youll excuse me i have a cohort to get on the road west if they miss any more of the time they have left at the hill than necessary they wont be all that forgiving either given where im about to take them he turned away to head for the infantry barracks then stopped and turned back colleague given that im detached to go hunting bandits id be grateful for the continued loan of your horses until we return a squadron of cavalry could make all the difference when were chasing around the forests after shadows licinius gave him a jaundiced look youve got sticky fingers young man every soldier that comes into contact with your cohort seems to end up as part of it hamian archers borrowed cavalrymen ill even wager you that the halfcentury of legionnaires dubnus borrowed from the sixth will end up in your establishment and yes you can extend the loan if you think itll do you any good and you can keep that decurion you promoted to command them but there is a price youll have to pay for the privilege scaurus raised an eyebrow waiting in silence for the older man to make himself clear given that young aquila seems to have put the cart before the horse by getting our lady doctor with child im assuming that theyll be quietly marrying each other some time in the next few days and dont try to fend me off with all that nonsense about it being illegal for soldiers to tie their hands together because we both know it happens so if you want to hang on to my horses a while longer youd better make sure that im there when it happens shell need someone there thats known her for more then a couple of days to stand in for her father youre sure that you want to go through with this mdear we both know that its illegal for a soldier to marry are you sure you want your centurion to take that sort of risk just to felicias stare silenced liciniuss playful words her voice pitched low to avoid the words carrying to the priest waiting at the other end of the main hall of the hills principia the holy man had been escorted in from noisy valley by two centuries of tungrians and had eyed the hostile hills and forests along the route with unashamed fear making his low opinion of such risktaking very clear to all who would listen just to give his child a father tribune yes id say its worth the risk given the sentence of death hanging over all of us the cavalryman smiled gently forgive me madam its just the rough humour of an old soldier who should know better i only meant to say that while i can see that youve become attached to the man marrying him is a bolder step altogether i was a good friend of your father and while i have every respect for your husbandtobe i would be remiss in my duty were i not to make sure that you understand the risk youre taking by joining your life to his felicia smiled back at licinius taking his hand in hers gaius youre such a sweet man beneath all that ridiculous military bluster you mustnt worry about me though id rather spend a year with marcus than a lifetime regretting that i didnt take this chance and besides she lifted a hand to indicate the knot of centurions gathered at the far end of the hall have you ever seen a more forbidding collection of physical specimens to have between a lady and anyone that would do her harm they wouldnt even let me out of the gate to pick flowers for my headband without a tent party of soldiers to keep me from harm legatus equitius has agreed to tribune scauruss request for me to provide medical services to his command now that his replacement doctors have managed to reach the legion and i cant see very much happening to me once im part of this cohort can you licinius raised a knowing eyebrow muttering under his breath and drawing a sharp glance from the doctor sticky fingers again no nothing madam just my little joke with my colleague im sure youll be as safe with these housetrained barbarians as if you were sitting comfortably in your fathers villa in rome and in any case the principias double door opened and marcus stepped into the room with a smile for felicia the extent of his wedding finery a clean tunic and leggings and a belt decorated with highly polished brass openwork he saluted first spear frontinius and nodded to his colleagues before crossing the room to stand before her with a broad smile you look lovely felicia smiled back at him tolerantly lowering her veil so do you and youre not supposed to see my face until after were married tribune licinius laughed uproariously drawing another aggrieved glare from the priest in point of fact young lady youre also supposed to have a matron of honour to supervise the proceedings instead of which youve got a first spear who couldnt crack a smile if his life depended on it nor do we have anyone to read the auspices much less a sacrificial animal from whose liver they might be read and for that matter we have each other tribune and thats all i need today the cavalryman acknowledged the finality of her tone with a slight bow indeed you do madam and long may it remain that way perhaps this mission to germania will provide you with some respite from the fear of discovery and since none of us are getting any younger perhaps we should proceed he held out an arm to her come along mdear i think we ought to go and stand in front of that particularly disgruntledlooking priest weve got our ten witnesses so lets get your hands wrapped together and the sacred wheat cake eaten shall we later with the ceremony complete the happy couple exited the principia beneath an arch of first the officers swords and then those of the th century and ran the gauntlet of dozens more soldiers happily throwing nuts into the air to cascade down on them in the timehonoured fashion as they sat down to a celebration meal in the praetorium with plentiful wine on the table the conversation inevitably turned to dubnuss charge north to rescue felicia julius for several years the younger mans centurion during his time as a chosen man waved a chicken leg at his former subordinate his cheeks flushed and his voice a little louder than usual only you dubnus only you could have shamed a gang of disgraced road menders into following you into the teeth of a rebellion with barely enough strength to put a tent up not only that but with a scar on your guts only three weeks old a scar you earned as i recall by jumping into a losing fight with those tattooed head jobs he raised his cup to the younger man colleague i salute the size of your stones but one of these days youll end up face down unless you learn to think before you jump where a younger dubnus would have bridled at the implication of rashness the centurion simply nodded slowly raising his own cup and taking a sip of his wine felicia who had allowed much of the discussion to wash over her as she enjoyed the sensation of having marcus beside her watched her rescuer intently you may be right perhaps i do need to think a little more before i act but i can tell you this i will never stand idle while any friend of mine is in danger i would have gone north alone if necessary healed or not to find and rescue this lady and to hades with the consequences he locked stares with his sparring partner a faint smile of challenge on his face the older man nodded solemnly raising his cup again looking about the table to be sure he had his colleagues full attention gentlemen a toast ill drink to the man that made sure our brother had a bride to marry today to my friend and brother dubnus the man with the biggest balls in all the cohort when the officers were seated again felicia recognising that the time had come for the officers to celebrate the event in their own exuberant manner stood up and begged the partys forgiveness for her inevitable fatigue a request greeted by a chorus of understanding and concern marcus took her arm and led her from the room with a grateful nod to tribune scaurus for his hospitality leaving the centurions grinning knowingly at each other otho raised his cup a broad grin splitting his battered face well it is their wedding night and young marcus needs to get as much sack time in as possible before the ladys too far gone for riding dubnus leaned over and clipped him playfully around the head ducking away from the return blow and raising his own cup in challenge a song come on knuckles you punchdrunk old bastard start us off otho glared at him in mock annoyance then threw his head back and bellowed the first lines of an old favourite at the ceiling when im on patrol the farmers hide their chickens and their eggs and watch their daughters just in case i sneak between their legs but they forget that i will take my pleasure where i can the other centurions joined in for the verses last line their voices raised to a roar that put a wry smile on scauruss face so i shag the sheep and the billy goat too cause im a tungrian as the other centurions joined in julius went to fill up dubnuss cup only to find the younger mans hand covering it he raised an eyebrow bending close to shout in the younger mans ear whats wrong with you losing your taste for the wine already dubnus shook his head pointing at the cup just half a cup and ill water it ive got to march east tomorrow with half a dozen disgraced road menders who insist on coming along for the walk julius raised his eyebrows in question but dubnus shook his head disparagingly its no big thing just an errand i promised to run for a man i met on the north road otho threw his head back again bellowing out the next verse while his brother officers raised their cups to him and drained them outside in the forts torchlit road with the boisterous singing audible over the winds moan as it pulled at the forts exposed roofs felicia stopped walking down the steep slope to marcuss quarters at the end of the th centurys barrack and turned to her new husband with a gentle smile go back in marcus go and join them just for a while im too tired to do anything but fall asleep the moment i get into bed so you might as well enjoy the company of your friends theyve taken you into their family so you should go and be part of it when you have the chance the young centurion walked back into the praetoriums dining room to a chorus of ribald abuse centred on the obvious fact that he had clearly been unable to satisfy his woman smiling resignedly as he took the brimming cup offered to him by julius well if youve come back to join the party two knives youd better sing the next verse egged on by the raucous centurions he stepped forward and took a gulp of wine then roared out the lines hed sung so often with his century on the march im back from bloody battle ive got money on my belt and im full enough of spunk to make an armoured codpiece melt outside standing close to the rooms window felicia heard his voice raised in song and smiled to herself putting a hand to her gently bulging belly and moving off down the roads slope to their quarters a lifetime or a year my love well make every moment precious the wind from the sea was bitingly cold by the time clodia had finished her work at the waterside forts official guest house her legs aching from a day spent on her feet cleaning and cooking for the houses guests she stepped out into the torchlit street shaking her head in disgust as a pair of soldiers paused in their staggering progress from the vicus alehouse back to their barracks to leer drunkenly at her but her discouragement only seemed to encourage the pair to push harder at her misery one of them stayed rooted to the spot too drunk to participate in the fun but the other man a heavyset watch officer who had long expressed an interest in her persisted with a staggering walk that put him firmly in her path swaying and pointing a finger at her with a knowing leer come on clodia you know hes dead and gone give us a kiss and ill show you what youve been missing all these months and ive got a bigger without warning an big bearded infantry centurion loomed out of the vicus shadows and stepped in front of her putting one massive hand on the cavalrymans chest with the other clenched behind his back visible to the harassed woman but not to her assailant the lady doesnt want your pissedup attentions soldier take it away to your bed and come back for another try when youre sober the drunk staggered backwards then bridled and went on the offensive jabbing a finger at the newcomer fuck you you mule bastard you and your mates ill do the lot of you clodia looked around and found that half a dozen hardfaced infantrymen were backing up their centurion the senior man nodded respectfully to her speaking quietly in a moment of silence while the drunken cavalryman swayed and smiled to himself with pride at his defiance dont mind us maam the centurion will put this idiot to sleep soon enough and then we can all go back to what we were doing another pair of petriana men exited the beer shop to find out what the shouting was all about stopping in the doorway when they saw the auxiliary soldiers waiting for them ill fucking do the lot of you you sheepshagging bastards the drunkard swung a fist at the officer who leaned back far enough to allow it clear passage then stepped forward and pushed at the other mans chest sending him back half a dozen steps if you try that again ill be forced to put you on your back the cavalryman charged forward spreading both arms in a clear attempt to grapple with his assailant but the centurion rather than stepping back to avoid the attack took a pace forward his first punch was a jab stopping the drunk in his tracks with a sickening pop of broken cartilage his second and last blow a leisurely right hook that dropped his assailant senseless to the streets mud he looked around at the meagre audience spreading his hands in question while the unconscious cavalrymans drinking partner goggled at him in drunken bemusement and the other two men scowled their anger from a safe distance and thats why youre on your back now does anybody else think they want a go ive not had a proper fight in months so i could do with the practice nobody you two you look like you fancy trying your luck the men watching from the beer shops entrance blanched and walked quickly away drawing amused looks from the soldiers behind their officer who shook his head with something approaching genuine regret as he called after them good choice now bugger off and mind your own business he turned back to the woman bowed and offered him her hand madam my apologies for that unfortunate scene he took a deep breath steeling himself for the task at hand and the woman stared up at him with mute distress i cannot pretend that im here with good news but i do bring something that will soften the blow im sure youre expecting my name is dubnus and i was the last person to speak with your man before he departed this life perhaps you could take us to somewhere we can speak privately in the privacy of her tiny room with the other men of his century waiting outside he told her how she had been at the heart of the dying mans last thoughts he died in battle fighting to the last but we were the only men to see it happen he was carrying a message for the petrianas tribune and he fought to the death to defend it your man was twice the soldier those drunken fools will ever be and his last wish was that we should bring this to you nodding her tearful thanks the woman looked wanly at the purse it was somewhat heavier than had originally been the case the product of the rd centurys vigorous fundraising throughout their cohort upon their return to noisy valley their newfound reputation built on the back of a wild charge north to rescue the fortresss doctor with an apparently insane auxiliary centurion at their head had paid dividends and reduced the number of their fellows willing to accuse them of cowardice to a foolhardy few who had swiftly found the rd century in their faces and ready to fight for their reputation clodia opened the purse and peeked inside her face brightening slightly at the amount of gold it contained it cant replace your man but it can make life easier for you for a while it can give you time to well sensing the centurions embarrassment she took his hands in hers silencing his stuttering flow of words thank you centurion youre all very kind ive known hes dead for weeks now when the wing came home without him but it helps to know the truth will you be here for very long you and your men id like to show my gratitude in some way if only with enough money to buy you all a drink dubnus stood looking down at the woman with a gentle shake of his head thank you maam but we must march east in the morning these men will have a new centurion waiting for them and my own cohort is ordered to cross the sea before the winter comes were to strengthen the defences in germania or so it seems and i darent risk my friends taking ship without me he bowed and withdrew from the tiny room gathering his men by eye and leading them back to the transit barracks hed been in his centurions quarters for no more time than was required to light the rooms single lamp and shed his armour when his watch officer stepped through the door a leather flask in one hand and another lamp in the other if youll forgive me centurion i thought a drink might be appropriate dubnus waved a hand at the rooms only chair lowering his massive body carefully on to the bed and accepting a cup of wine with a nod of gratitude the two men drank then shared a moment of silence before titus raised his cup in salute to you centurion pigheaded singleminded and the making of the third century you may have been a bastard but you were just what we needed dubnus raised his cup drinking again before he spoke cocidius knows i hate to admit it but ill miss your miserable shower of fightshy soapdodgers too he leaned back on the bed with a broad smile waiting for the watch officer to reply titus nodded wryly offering his own cup up and well miss you being part of a legion cohort is going to be dull as ditchwater without your inventive turn of phrase and compulsive need to fight anything and everything that moves dubnus snorted derisively you poor fools must have led quiet and boring lives ive a colleague by the name of otho wholl put a soldier to sleep the hard way if the man as much as looks at him sideways it was one of his boys that carried good old king drusts torc all the way to the fortress of the spears and when dear old knuckles found out he beat the poor bastard half to death in less time than it takes to tell the story a long silence fell both men looking into their cups at their remaining wine take us with you dubnus started from his reverie his eyebrows shooting up at tituss sudden plea and his voice acerbic with barely restrained humour oh yes ill just have it away with fortythree legionaries to germania nobody will miss you for a few weeks he met the watch officers eyes and saw the certainty in them his voice softening with something between surprise and respect bugger me titus youre serious arent you the other man said nothing his face hot with embarrassment youre actually serious you want to walk away from a place with your legion seventy denarii more per man a year than our lads earn an extra five years to serve and getting the shitty end of the stick every bloody time theres a choice between getting the legions hands dirty or sending in the secondclass soldiers are you fucking mad the watch officer shifted uncomfortably we understand all that but the last few weeks have made us feel part of something different we all feel like real soldiers for the first time in a long while he stopped talking aware that the centurion was staring at him with something close to amazement dubnus shook his head slowly staring hard at the other man in astonishment ive genuinely seen it all now you want to turn your nose up at the best job a man can have in the army and pitch your luck in with a bunch of rougharsed country boys and its not as if your officers are just going to say very well tribune scaurus off you go with half a century of our men even your legatus decent bloke though he is will be hard pushed to justify that to your new first spear not to mention that complete prick of a camp prefect no youll just have to he stopped speaking tipping his head to one side did you hear that the sounds of raised voices reached them and dubnus grinned happily draining his cup and heaving his body off the bed making for the door with titus just behind him in the gap between the two transit barracks a dozen or more angry men were gathered some of them armed with staves and practice swords and their leader stepped forward when he saw dubnus in the barracks doorway raising a wooden sword to point at the tungrian you you broke one of my mens jaw and youre going to fucking pay double for that dubnus stretched his massive frame rolling his head and flexing both arms biceps to their full girth before stepping out into the confined space and you might well make me pay for teaching your idiot some manners but if youre stupid enough to come at me with weapons ill have half of you in the hospital for a month or more before you put me down if youre ready to pay that price lets get on with it titus stepped out beside him muttering out of the side of his mouth if we fight these bastards off you me and the boys youll take us with you dubnus held up a hand to the cavalrymen his voice harsh with authority one moment gentlemen my watch officer wants to ask me a question the infuriated cavalrymen seethed but none of them was yet brave enough to be the first man to rush the intimidating centurion and so they contented themselves with indignant looks while he turned to the watch officer with a raised eyebrow his voice softened so as not to cross the gap to them youre telling me that you want to fight for your place with the cohort titus nodded slowly theres fifteen of them and seven of us if we send them away with a spanking and the cohorts honour intact you agree to get us on to your boat for germania dubnus nodded slowly very well you cheeky bastard youre on i have no idea how but if we send these donkey wallopers home to mummy with their arses kicked ill find a way for you to be tungrians and may cocidius forgive me titus smiled happily back at him putting two fingers to his mouth and blowing a piercing note after a moments pause the barrack door behind them burst open and the five other men who had accompanied dubnus to waterside fort crowded through it led by the grizzled soldier who had made the impassioned plea on their behalf at fort habitus their watch officer flicked his wrist allowing a heavy leatherlined cosh to fall from his sleeve pointed at the cavalrymen and bellowed a single word lifting the weapon and stepping forward to find his first victim habitus
