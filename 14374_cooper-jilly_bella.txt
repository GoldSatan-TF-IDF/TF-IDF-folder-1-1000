jilly cooper bella to laura with love authors note i have always wanted to write a novel about an actress and i started writing bella in however at that time i wrote it as a novella called it collision and it was serialized in only now am i able to fulfil my original wish and present the story as a fulllength novel bella chapter one bella read faster and faster until she came to the final page then giving a howl of irritation hurled the book across the room narrowly missing a row of bottles it fell with a crash into the wastepaper basket best place for it she said furiously how corny can you get she escaped completely into every book she read identifying closely with the characters this time she was incensed because the heroine had slunk dutifully home to her boring husband instead of following her dashing lover up the amazon she shivered and toyed with the idea of letting the water out and running more hot in but she had done this four times already her hands were wrinkled and red from the dye of the book and the sky that filled the bathroom window had deepened since shed been in the bath from pale wedgwood to deep indigo so she knew it must be late she splashed cold water over her body heaved herself out of the bath and stood feeling dizzy on the bathmat the bath was ringed with black like a football sweater but the char would fix that in the morning taking her wireless she stepped over the debris of her clothes picked up the second post which was lying in the hall and wandered into the bedroom she turned up the music danced and sang a few bars then caught sight of herself in the mirror hair hidden in a mauve bathcap body glowing red as a lobster the great british public would have a shock if they could see me now she thought wryly she pulled off her bathcap and examined herself more carefully she was a big girl with a magnificent body and endless legs her mouth was wide and her large sleepy yellow eyes rocketed up at the corners a mane of reddishblonde hair spilled over her shoulders the overall impression was of a sleek and beautiful racehorse at the peak of its condition she opened her letters one was from a journalist who wanted to interview her another an exboyfriend trying to come back and several forwarded by the bbc from fans dear miss parkinson wrote one in loopy handwriting i hope you dont mind my writing i know you must lead such a busy glamorous life i think its marvellous the way theres never any breath of scandal attached to your name could you possibly send me a signed fulllength photograph and some biographical details oh god thought bella feeling slightly sick if only they all knew the last letter was practical it was headed the britannia theatre and was from the director roger field who had written dear bella if youre late again i shall sack you cant you see how it unnerves the rest of the cast stop being so bloody selfish love roger roger bella knew would be as good as his word she looked at the alarm clock by the bed and gave another howl of rage it was twenty past six and the curtain went up at seventhirty dressing with fantastic speed not even bothering to dry herself properly she tore out of the flat and was fortunate to find a taxi almost at once the britannia theatre company was one of the great theatrical successes of the decade it specialized in shakespeare and more modern classics and generally had three plays running on alternate nights and three in rehearsal bella had joined the company a year ago and had risen from walkon parts to a small speaking part in the merchant of venice she had recently had her first real break playing desdemona in othello the critics had raved about her performance and the play had been running to capacity audiences for three nights a week lying back gazing out of the taxi window at the trees of hyde park fanning out against a rustcoloured sky bella tried to keep calm from now until her first entrance she would be in a nervous sweat stage fright gripping her by the throat like an animal she deliberately always cut it fine because it meant that she would be in such a hurry dressing and makingup she wouldnt have time to panic and yet ironically the only time when she felt really secure was when she was on stage getting inside someone elses personality the taxi reached the theatre at five past seven evening tom said bella nervously scuttling past the man at the door he put down his evening paper and glanced at his watch just made it miss parkinson heres a letter for you and therere some more flowers in your room not bothering to glance at her letter bella bounded upstairs two steps at a time and fell into the dressingroom she shared with her best friend rosie hassell who played bianca late again said rosie who was putting on eye makeup rogers been in once already gnashing his teeth bella turned pale oh god i couldnt get a taxi she lied throwing her fur coat on a chair and slipping into an overall i think freddie dixons after me said rosie you think that about everyone said bella slapping greasepaint on her face i dont and anyway im usually right i know i am about freddie freddie dixon was the handsome actor playing cassio both bella and rosie had fancied him and been slightly piqued because hed shown no interest in either of them you know the clinch we have in the fourth act said rosie pinning on snakey black ringlets to the back of her hair well last night he absolutely crushed me to death and all through the scene he couldnt keep his hands off me hes not meant to keep them off said bella i expect roger told him to act more sexily rosie looked smug thats all you know look youve got more flowers from master henriques she added pointing to a huge bunch of lilies of the valley arranged in a jam jar on bellas dressing table oh how lovely cried bella noticing them for the first time i wonder what hes on about tonight arent you going to read his letter said rosie bella pencilled in her eyebrow you can since youre so nosey she said rosie took the card out of its blue envelope dear bella she read thats a bit familiar it was dear miss parkinson last time good luck for tonight i shall be watching you yours rupert henriques he must be crazy about you thats the eighth time hes seen the play isnt it ninth said bella must be getting sick of it by now said rosie perhaps hes doing it for o levels do you think hes that young expect so or a dirty old man nobody decent ever runs after actresses theyve usually got plenty of girls of their own bella fished a fly out of her bottle of foundation and had another look at the card hes got nice writing though she said and chichester terrace is quite an ok address there was a knock on the door it was queenie their dresser come to help them on with their costumes a dyedinthewool cockney with orange hair and a cigarette permanently drooping from her scarlet lips she chattered all the time about the great actresses shed dressed in the past bella who was sick with nerves by this stage was quite happy to let her ramble on five minutes please five minutes please it was the plaintive echoing voice of the callboy bella looked at herself in the mirror her smooth young face belying the torrent of nerves bubbling inside her then she sat down on the faded velvet sofa with the broken leg in the corner of the room and waited clasping her hands in her lap to stop them shaking beginners please beginners please the sad echoing voice passed her door again rosie who didnt come on until later was doing the crossword bella took one more look round the dressingroom even with its bare floor and blackedout windows it seemed friendly and familiar compared with the strange brightly lit world she was about to enter good luck said rosie as she went out of the door give freddie a big kiss they stood waiting by the open door under a faded orange bulb brabantio cassio and herself wesley barrington who was playing othello stood by himself a huge handsome black man six and a half feet tall as nervous as a cat pacing up and down murmuring his lines like an imprecation the three of them left her help me to make it she prayed othello was speaking now in his beautiful measured voice most potent grave and reverend signiors in a moment she would be on iago came to collect her come on beauty he whispered keep your chin up it had begun she was on looking round the stage beautiful gentle a little shy i do perceive here a divided duty she said slowly she was off then on again flirting a little with cassio and then othello was on again here where she found life a thousand times more real than in the real world she had words to express her emotions but all too soon it was over the appalling murder scene was ended and the play had spent its brief but all too vivid life and as she took her curtain calls she had nearly reached the limits of her endurance three times othello and iago led her forward and the tears poured down her cheeks as the roars of applause increased well done said wesley barrington in his deep voice bella smiled at him she fancied him so much when they were acting but now he was wesley again living in ealing with a wife and three children bella would now go out for a cheap dinner with rosie and in the morning she would lie sluttishly in bed until lunchtime she avoided the busy glamorous world that her fans imagined she lived in it was a question of conserving her energy for what was important in their dressingroom however she found rosie in a fever of excitement freddies asked me out i expect he wants to discuss the way youve been upstaging him said bella she collapsed on to a chair and felt depression descending on her like dust on a polished table not that she wanted freddie to ask her out shed long ago decided his curly hair and neon smile werent for her but if he started up a serious affair with rosie thered be no more cosy little dinners no more rosie and bella united and gossiping together against the rest of the cast still it was nice for rosie wheres he taking you somewhere cheap hes amazingly mean do you think one earring looks sexy no silly as though youd lost the other one there was a knock on the door it was tom the doorman theres a mr henriques downstairs miss parkinson wonders if he could come up and see you oh said bella suddenly excited whats he like looks orl right said tom fingering a five pound note in his pocket not a schoolboy tom shook his head nor a dirty old man no quite a reasonable sort of bloke bit of a nob really pluminthemarf voice and wearing a monkey suit oh go on bella said rosie he might be super all right said bella i can always tell him to go if hes ghastly great said rosie ill finish off my face in the loo no yelped bella suddenly nervous you cant leave me at that moment queenie the dresser appeared at the door youd better get out of that dress before you spill makeup all over it she said to bella bella looked at herself in the mirror against the lowcut white nightgown her tawny skin glowed like old ivory lets knock mr henriques for six she thought can i keep it on for a bit queenie she asked and im supposed to hang about until youve finished said queenie sourly come on you old harridan said rosie grabbing her arm and frogmarching her out of the room you can have a swig of freddies whisky to cheer you up bella sprayed on some scent then sprayed more round the room arranged her breasts to advantage in the white dress and sitting down began to brush her hair there was a knock on the door come in she said huskily in her best tallulah bankhead voice as she turned smiling her mouth dropped in amazement for the man lounging in the doorway was absurdly romantic looking with very pale delicate features hollowed cheeks dark burning eyes and hair as black and shining as a ravens wing he was thin and very elegant and over his dinner jacket was slung a magnificent honeycoloured fur coat they stared at each other for a moment then smiling gently he said may i come in i hope its not a nuisance for you he had an attractive voice soft and drawling my names rupert henriques he added as an afterthought oh please come in bella stood up flustered and found that her eyes were almost on a level with his youre tall he said in surprise you look so small on the stage beside othello embarrassed bella tipped a pile of clothes off the red velvet sofa sit down have a drink she got out a bottle of whisky and a couple of glasses she was furious that her hand shook so much she rattled the bottle against the glass and poured out far too large a drink hey steady he said im not much of a drinker he filled the glass up to the top with water from the washbasin do you mind if i smoke she shook her head and was pleased to see his hand was shaking as much as hers when he lit his cigarette he wasnt as cool as he looked as she sat down she knocked a jar of cold cream on to the floor they both dived to retrieve it and nearly bumped their heads he looked at her and burst out laughing i believe youre as nervous as i am he said arent you used to entertaining strange men backstage every night bella shook her head im always frightened they might be disappointed when they meet me in the flesh disappointed he looked her over incredulously you must be joking bella was suddenly conscious of how low her dress was cut the flowers are heavenly she said blushing how on earth did you manage to get such beautiful ones in winter rifling my mothers conservatory doesnt she mind doesnt know shes in india he smiled maliciously im hoping an obliging tiger might gobble her up bella giggled dont you like her not a lot do you get on with your parents theyre dead said bella flatly and waited for the conventional expressions of sympathy they didnt come lucky you said rupert henriques i wish i were an orphan all fun and no fear he had a droll way of rattling off these remarks which made them quite inoffensive all the same she thought hes a spoilt little boy he could be quite relentless if he chose he picked up his drink you were even better than usual tonight dont you get bored seeing the same play night after night he grinned im glad its not a whitehall farce youre the only reason ive been so many times there was a knock on the door hell he said do we have to answer it it was queenie i wont be a minute bella said to her im sorry she added to rupert i shall have to change he drained his glass got up and moved towards the door i was wondering if youd have dinner with me one evening next week he said its monday now thought bella he cant be that keen if he can wait at least a week to see me im very tied up she said untruthfully tuesday he said im working that night wednesday then she paused just long enough to get him worried then smiled all right id like to i dont suppose you like opera i adore it lied bella determined to keep her end up great theres a first night of siegfried next wednesday ill try and get tickets as he left he said im sorry i had to make your acquaintance in this rather gauche fashion but i didnt know anyone who knew you who could have introduced us and the only other alternative would have been to have bought the theatre it was only later that she discovered he was only halfjoking the henriques family could have bought every theatre in london without batting an eyelid chapter two promptly at sixthirty on wednesday he picked her up you look gorgeous he said walking round her you dont look so bad yourself she said he was wearing a very dark green suit with a red silk shirt you like it he said pleased my tailor only finished it on monday thats why i couldnt ask you out last week an aston martin was waiting outside music blasted out of the slot stereo the heat was turned up overpoweringly bella wound down her window surreptitiously as they drove off she didnt want to be scarlet in the face before she started as they stopped at the traffic lights rupert turned and smiled at her you shouldnt have made me wait so long to see you he said ive been in such a state of anticipation ive been unbearable to everyone even in the thick of a firstnight audience with the diamonds glittering like hoar frost everyone turned to stare at them rupert seemed to know lots of people but he merely nodded and didnt stop to chat the curtain hadnt been up for five minutes before bella decided that wagner wasnt really her all those vast men and women screaming their guts out she glanced at her programme and was appalled to see she was expected to sit through three acts of it somehow she managed to endure the first act it seemed so strange to be on the other side of the curtain is it all right are you enjoying yourself asked rupert as he fought his way back to her side with drinks during the interval oh its great she lied enthusiastically rupert looked dubious well i dont know they make a frightful row say as soon as youre bored and well leave two earnestlooking women with plaits round their heads turned to look at him in horror during the second act rupert became increasingly restless but cheered up when brünhilde made her appearance she looks just like my mother he whispered loudly to bella who gave a snort of laughter a fat woman in front turned round and shushed angrily ruperts shoulders shook bella gazed firmly in front of her but found she couldnt stop giggling i say said rupert a minute later shall we go we cant said bella horrified not in the middle of an act will you be quiet hissed the fat woman my wife feels faint rupert said to her and grabbing bella by the hand he dragged her along the row tripping over everyones feet outside the theatre they looked at each other and burst into peals of laughter wasnt it awful he said i wanted to impress you taking you to a first night but this really was the end as they picked their way through covent gardens debris of cabbage leaves and rotten apples he took her hand well have a nice dinner to make up for it they dined in soho very expensively bella decided crimson velvet menus with gold tassels and rose petals floating in the finger bowls they sat side by side on a red velvet banquette rather like being in the back row of the cinema what do you want to eat rupert asked her anything except herrings he laughed why not herrings bella shivered my mother forced me to eat them when i was young i was locked in the diningroom for twelve hours once rupert looked appalled but ive never had to eat anything i didnt like this is a nice place said bella its a haunt of my fathers said rupert he says its the one place in london one never sees anyone one knows rupert darling a beautiful woman with wideset violet eyes was standing by their table lavinia he stood up and kissed her how was jamaica lovely i cant think why i came home have you met bella parkinson no i havent how do you do she looked bella over carefully ive read all about your play of course macbeth isnt it i must come and see you she turned back to rupert and said a little too casually hows lazlo in buenos aires she looked relieved thats why he hasnt rung whens he coming back next week sometime well give him my love and tell him to ring me before my suntan fades she drifted off to join her escort at the other end of the room shes beautiful sighed bella admiring her beautifully shod feet who is she some bird of lazlos whos he my cousin he lowered his voice evidently lazlo complained her bed was too small so she went out to harrods and bought one three times the size shes mad about him is he attractive women think so i know him too well we work together what at banking weve got a bank in the city but most of our business is tied up in south america my fathers chairman but lazlo really runs it you look a bit latin yourself my fathers south american my mother alas is pure english shes coming home next friday worse luck im hoping someone will hijack her plane she keeps sending me postcards telling me not to forget to water the guides bella giggled who one of her interests along with the blind the deaf the undernourished and any other charity she can poke her nose into alas theres no charity in her heart her life is spent sitting on committees and my father he looked at bella what were your parents like bellas palms went damp my father was a librarian she said quickly but he died when i was a baby so my mother had to take a job as a schoolmistress to support me we were always terribly poor poor but respectable shed told the same lies so often that shed almost come to believe them their first course arrived mediterranean prawns and a great bowl of yellow mayonnaise bella gave a little moan of greed later when she was halfway through her duck she suddenly looked up and saw that rupert was staring at her his food untouched bella yes will you have dinner with me tomorrow of course she said she didnt even stop to consider it the one thing that could have spoilt her evening was the sense of being a failure that hed get to know her a little and then decide she was a bore later they went back to her flat for a drink and bella drew back the curtains in the drawingroom to show rupert the view half london glittered in front of them isnt it gorgeous said bella ecstatically not a patch on you and youve got the most beautiful hair in the world he picked up a strand just like rapunzel whos she the princess in the tower who let down her hair and the handsome prince climbed up and rescued her you must have read it as a child bella looked bleak my mother didnt approve of fairy stories rupert frowned and pulled her into his arms the more i hear of your childhood the less i like it he said then he kissed her very hard after a minute he pulled her down on to the sofa and began fiddling with her zip no she said stiffening why not he muttered into her hair christ bella i want you so much bella took a deep breath and burst into tears one of her greatest acting accomplishments was that she could cry at will she had only to think of the poor unclaimed dogs at battersea dogs home waiting and waiting for a master that never came and tears would course down her cheeks oh please dont she sobbed rupert was on his knees beside her darling oh im sorry please dont cry i shouldnt have rushed things ive behaved like a pig she looked at him through her tears you wont stop seeing me because i wont he shook his head wryly i couldnt if i tried now im in too deep after hed gone she looked at herself in the mirror youre a rotten bitch bella god youre in a muddle she said slowly she wanted men to want her but once they tried to get involved she ran away frightened theyd find out the truth chapter three rupert arrived next evening his arms loaded with presents ive decided you missed out on a proper childhood so were going to start now he said in the parcels were a huge teddy bear a dutch doll a kaleidoscope a solitaire board filled with coloured marbles a complete set of beatrix potter and the wind in the willows bella felt a great lump in her throat oh darling you shouldnt spend all your money on me rupert took her face in his hands sweetheart listen theres one thing you must get into your head there are a hell of a lot of disadvantages about being a henriques but being short of bread isnt one of them he held out his hands weve got buckets of it my fathers worth a fortune and since lazlo put a bomb under the bank were all worth a lot more ive got a private income of well over bellas jaw dropped thats whats so lovely about you bella anyone else would know about the henriques millions ive never worried about money in my life and when i was twentyone last month i inherited twentyone said bella quickly you said you were twentyseven he looked shamefaced i did didnt i i knew you wouldnt be interested in me if you knew how young i was but im twentythree wailed bella im cradlesnatching no youre not he snuggled against her anyway im crazy about older women from then on they were inseparable seeing each other every night touring the smart restaurants and getting themselves talked about as spring came turning the parks gold and purple with crocuses bella found herself growing more and more fond of him he was very easy to like with his languid grace sullen pentup beauty and his appalling flashes of malice that were never directed at her but he could be moody this little boy who had always had everything he wanted in life his thin face would darken and she could feel his longing for her like a volcano below the surface the eternal late nights were taking their toll on his health too he had lost pounds and there were huge violet shadows beneath his eyes one may evening they were sitting on the sofa in her flat when he said dont you mind that i never take you to parties and things she shook her head the only parties i like are for two people rupert turned her hand over and stared at the palm for a minute then said why dont we get married panic swept over bella no she said nervously at least not yet why not we come from different backgrounds ive always been a havenot youve always been a have your family would loathe me i havent any background she gave a slightly shaky laugh when i talk about the past i mean yesterday rubbish rupert said angrily dont be such a snob i love you and thats all that matters i love you too bella pleated the folds of her skirt youre making things impossible for me said rupert sulkily you wont marry me you wont sleep with me im going out of my mind he got up and strode up and down the room he looked so ruffled and pink in the face bella suddenly had an hysterical desire to laugh theres someone else he said suddenly stopping in front of her how could there be ive seen noone but you for the last six months and before that casual affairs he caught her wrist so hard that she winced with pain how casual i dont believe you youre as passionate as hell beneath the surface bella one only has to see you playing desdemona to realize that bella had gone white she snatched her hand away from rupert and went over to the window all right there was someone when i was eighteen he seduced me and i loved him and he walked out on me the night my mother died rupert was unimpressed but darling one loves the most ghastly people when ones eighteen you wouldnt be able to see what you saw in him if you met him now finally bella agreed to go and meet his family on her birthday the following thursday she lay in bed dreaming about rupert the monday morning before her birthday i cant have been very easy these past weeks she thought ruefully living on a permanent knifeedge wondering whether or not to tell him the truth about my past i love you and thats all that matters hed said perhaps she would tell him but could she bear to see the incredulity and contempt in his face and if she didnt tell him would he ever find out noone else had she realized that for the first time in years she was beginning to feel secure and happy she idly wondered what to wear when she met his parents she hoped she wouldnt be too intimidated by them she ought to buy a new dress but too many bills were flooding in she picked up the paper glanced at the gossip page to see if she or rupert were mentioned then turned to the personal column villas in the south of france ranch minks hardly worn costing if i marry rupert she thought theyd be within my grasp and then she saw the advertisement in bold type edged with black and went cold with horror mabel where are you ive looked for you everywhere ill be waiting at the bar of the hilton at seven oclock steve suddenly her heart was pounding her hands clammy it must be a mistake lots of people communicated through the personal column gangs of criminals lost friends it was a fluke it couldnt concern her but all day long she couldnt get the thought of it out of her mind next day when she picked up the paper she tried not to turn immediately to the personal column but there was another advertisement burning a hole in the page mabel where are you why did you leave nalesworth please come to the hilton bar at seven oclock tonight steve oh god thought bella giving a whimper of horror a feeling of nausea overwhelmed her on wednesday after a sleepless night she found another message waiting for her mabel where are you i waited on monday perhaps you cant get to london cable me at the hilton i shall wait for you steve she was sweating with fear after all these years steve was in london had come back to claim her the one man in the world who could rock the boat and bring down the precarious fabrication of lies and falsehoods that was bella parkinson chapter four on the morning of her birthday bella was woken by the sun streaming through the window for a moment she stretched luxuriously then the sick feeling of menace overwhelmed her as she remembered steve was trying to get in touch with her she jumped violently when the doorbell rang but it was only the postman with a pile of letters and a registered parcel to be signed for the newspaper was lying on the doormat willing herself not to look at it bella opened the parcel and gave a shriek of excitement a pearl necklace was glittering inside she put it on and rushed to the mirror even against a setting of mascara smudged eyes and tousled hair it looked beautiful there is nothing to say except i love you rupert had written in the accompanying letter bella gave a sigh of happiness it was as if someone had pulled her in out of the cold and wrapped her in a mink coat there were cards from the rest of the cast and more bills there were far too many of those crowding in lately the telephone rang it was barney her agent happy birthday darling do you feel frightfully old yes said bella ill buy you lunch next week we cant go on not meeting like this said barney bella laughed barney always cheered her up harry backhaus is in london casting for anna karenina he said in his nasal cockney drawl he saw you on the box last week and wants to audition you this evening but i cant wailed bella not tonight im meeting ruperts family i know sweetheart as if youd let me forget it ive arranged for you to see harry beforehand at six hes staying at the hyde park ask for his suite at the desk he likes birds so be yourself you know sexy but refined and dont be late bella was elated shed worshipped harry backhaus for years she rifled through her wardrobe for something to wear but found nothing sexy enough shed have to go out and buy yet another dress afterwards she would come back and change into the discreet but ludicrously expensive black midi dress shed bought for meeting ruperts parents the telephone rang again this time it was rupert wishing her a happy birthday she thanked him ecstatically for the necklace then told him about the audition i dont know who im more frightened of harry backhaus or your parents it wont be just them said rupert gay my sister will be there with teddy her fiancé whats he like hes in the brigade if you take away his long umbrella he falls over his chin goes straight down into his stiff collar gay used to be an ally now all she can talk about is curtain material i say youll never guess what shes pregnant my god when did she find out well she only told me yesterday so shell have to carry a very big bouquet was your mother livid doesnt know my father was very good he walked once round the drawingroom then said never mind you always get a few shots fired before the th of august bella giggled and as well as my pregnant sister rupert went on youre finally going to meet my glamorous cousin lazlo and youre to promise not to fall for him and his sister chrissies coming too shes sweet so therell be some young people as my mother calls them for you to play with darling dear rupert thought bella fondly as she put down the receiver he loved her so much steve really couldnt hurt her any more casually she picked up the paper she must have been imagining things before but there it was the first advertisement that caught her eyes when she turned to the personal column mabel where are you why didnt you turn up at the hilton i shall wait again tonight steve she felt a lurch of fear as a huge black cloud moved over the sun of her happiness she spent the rest of the day in a frenzy of activity shopping and at the hairdresser anything not to think about steve she squandered a fortune on new makeup a pair of impossibly tight blue jeans and a white frilly blouse that plunged to the waist she also had her hair set in a wildly dishevelled style that made her look as though shed just crawled out of bed she arrived twenty minutes late for the audition harry backhaus turned out to be a lean dyspeptic american who sucked peppermints all the time he had been ruined he said by lunch at what was supposed to be the best restaurant in london so you wanna play anna eh he said id like to know the book adore it ive read it over and over again so youve got all kinds of preconceived notions how the part should be played i could be talked out of them i picture anna as dark youd have to dye your hair youd have to diet too and the boy weve got lined up for vronsky is a good three inches shorter than you finally he said well be in touch thanks for coming along a beautiful tiny brunette was waiting to go in as she came out harry darling its been too long bella heard her say as she shut the door behind her bella looked at her watch it was twenty to seven enough time to go home and change before dinner but she didnt go home across the park she could see the hilton gleaming like a liner at sea her flat was in the opposite direction but as though mesmerized she began walking towards the hotel youre mad she kept telling herself youre walking straight into a torture chamber in five minutes youll undo all the good of the last five years just go and have a quick drink said another voice inside her see if it really is steve and come away once youve seen him itll break the spell outside the hotel to gain time she bought some flowers for ruperts mother her heart was thudding like a tomtom her hands were clammy as she went through the swing doors of the hotel the bar was very crowded people turned to stare at her why couldnt she stop trembling a tall fair man who looked like a pig was giving her the glad eye surely he couldnt be steve hullo darling said a soft voice with an american accent in her ear she jumped like a startled horse and swung round her mouth was dry the bottom seemed to fall out of her stomach as she looked into the bluest most wicked eyes in the world oh baby he said taking her hands its so good to see you hullo steve she croaked you made it you really showed up i cant believe it come and sit down bella felt the years melt away she was eighteen again we ought to celebrate by drinking that filthy sparkling hock which i always pretended to you was champagne id like some whisky said bella stiffly two double scotches steve told the waiter he got out a packet of cigarettes and as he lit hers their fingers touched oh honey he said youve grown so beautiful look at me properly with a great effort she raised her eyes to his how insane shed been to think hed have gone off if anything he was better looking more seasoned hed lost his peachy open goldenboy look there were lines now fanning out at the corners of his eyes and his hair was brushed forward in a thick blond fringe to cover lines that might have developed on his forehead she lowered her eyes ive looked for you everywhere he went on as their drinks arrived i wrote to nalesworth over and over again but they sent my letters back saying youd gone away like a fox i even went there to see if anyone had any news of you advertising in the personal columns was my last hope what are you doing now modelling im an actress she couldnt keep the pride out of her voice as she told him how well shed done steve whistled you have gone places and ive just had an audition with harry backhaus for the lead in his new film lay it on thick she thought damn you steve i can get along without you darling youre a star i must come and see the play what name do you act under surely not mabel figge no said bella in a strangled voice i i changed my name to bella parkinson she noticed that he was wearing a very wellcut suit and heavy gold cufflinks youve made good too steve he grinned cant complain ive got a couple of clubs in buenos aires one of the reasons im over here apart from finding you of course is to find a site for a disco in london he signalled to the waiter lets have another drink not for me she said i cant stay but she didnt move and when the drinks came he raised his glass to her to us baby there isnt going to be any us she snapped ive got someone else did have you mean who is he again the temptation to brag was too much you wont know him hes called rupert henriques steve raised his eyebrows not the banking family bella nodded defiantly oh sweetheart you are piling yourself up riches on earth you know him ive run across his cousin lazlo in buenos aires everyone seems to know him rupert adores him whats he like ruthless rather sinister a strange mixture half jewish his mother is some austrian opera singer the city dont know what to make of him they dont approve of his long hair and all that scent he wears but they have to admit he pulls off deals with a panache noone else can equal hes got the kind of steel nerves that buys when the markets down and he owns some pretty good horses why isnt he married doesnt believe in it i think he got very badly burnt over some married woman several years ago always has the most fantastic birds though there was a pause then steve went on but its rupert youre keen on yes i am said bella quickly then why did you come here today i wanted to lay a ghost steve i must go how idiotic those monosyllables sounded she had to go home change and go out to dinner with the henriques but she couldnt move darling steve said softly i know i behaved like a heel walking out on you when you most needed me but i owed bread everywhere id have been arrested if id stayed in nalesworth any longer and what about all those other girls every night impossible to keep the shrill hostility out of her voice i was too young to be tied down ive grown up since then i wouldnt cheat on you now if thats what youre thinking but she was only conscious of his big sexy body lounging beside her and the fact that she wanted him as shed never wanted anyone else youre no good for me steve i want to marry someone nice and stable and im just nice sighed steve one has to specialize so young these days he sat back and let one of his knees rub against hers she jumped as though shed touched a live wire my but youre edgy he said she laughed nervously when did you develop that laugh what laugh he imitated it and bella laughed again out of nervousness yeah like that you havent changed a bit she stormed you always enjoyed sending me up your voice has changed too he said stage school certainly ironed out all the yorkshire accent as she leapt to her feet he grabbed her let go of my hand she choked come on honey dont be mad at me let me go her voice rose keep your voice down everyones looking at us oh come on he pulled her down beside him dont you understand ive come thousands of miles to get you back im the one who knows all about you darling i bet you havent told baby henriques about life in the slums and your jailbird father have you shut up spat bella turning white and thats only the beginning as you well know now finish up your drink like a good girl and ill drop you off wherever you want to go but from tomorrow the heats on im not going to let the henriques get their hands on you you dont want to get mixed up with them darling youre batting out of your league as the taxi drove towards chichester terrace bella frantically combed her hair and redid her face stop fussing said steve but im so unsuitably dressed wailed bella i had this lovely little black dress youre an actress the henriques would be terribly disappointed if you turned up looking straight just tell them harry backhaus kept you for hours and only just let you go they were driving along the old brompton road now the cherry trees dazzling white against the darkening sky its spring said steve taking her in his arms cant you feel the sap rising for a moment she kissed him back aware only of the appalling rightness of being in his arms dont go he whispered no steve for gods sake she pushed him violently away and sat back trembling unable to speak until the taxi swung into chichester terrace he wrote her telephone number down on a cigarette packet dont lose it she was furious to find herself saying im exdirectory oh god youve sat on ruperts mothers flowers chapter five as she stood in the road watching the taxi carry him away she was overwhelmed by desolation she ran past the big white houses set back from the road their gardens filled with early roses and azaleas then she came to the whitest and biggest of all two stone lions with sneering faces reared up on either side of the gate a maid answered the door but before she could take bellas coat rupert rushed into the hall his face white and drawn how ridiculously young and unfledged he looks beside steve she thought darling what happened its after nine oclock bella was not an actress for nothing suddenly she was the picture of distress and contrition im so sorry harry backhaus kept me waiting for ages and then took hours over the audition and then he made the most frightful pass at me her eyes filled with tears i wanted to phone really i did but it got so late it seemed more sensible to come straight here i didnt even have time to change please forgive me any moment a thunderbolt will strike me down she thought wryly but rupert at least was convinced poor darling he said seizing her hands of course it doesnt matter come in and meet everyone they went into a huge unwelcoming room a cross between a museum and a jungle full of gilded furniture and elegant uncomfortable chairs on the wall appallingly badly lit hung huge paintings with heavy gold frames potted plants were everywhere poor bellas had a terrible time rupert announced the damned directors only just let her go im so sorry bella said giving them her most captivating smile he kept me waiting for hours and then we heard you saying so outside said a large woman coldly this is my mother said rupert constance henriques was tall but not thin enough her face with its large turneddown mouth and bulging glacial eyes resembled a cod on a slab her voice would have carried across any parade ground its nice to meet you said bella deciding it wasnt i thought you told miss parkinson we always dress for dinner constance said to rupert bella had had too many whiskies and ive undressed she said looking down at her unbuttoned shirt and almost unconsciously slipping into a mocking upper class accent added im most frightfully sorry there was a frozen pause then someone laughed this is my father said rupert grinning charles henriques must once have been very handsome but had long since gone to seed there was a network of purple veins over his face and great bags under his merry little dark eyes which ran over bellas décolleté like a pair of black beetles how do you he said holding her hand far longer than necessary rupert has talked about noone else for weeks but even he didnt do you justice he handed bella a vast drink ruperts sister gay and her fiancé teddy were a typical deb and a typical guards officer they hardly broke off their conversation when bella was introduced to them bella couldnt resist staring at gays stomach she didnt look at all pregnant nor did teddy look capable of fathering a mouse i told you they were totally selfobsessed didnt i rupert said squeezing her hand and finally i want you to meet my cousin chrissie lazlos sister shes my good angel shed be divine too if she were happier thought bella but chrissie looked thoroughly out of condition her dark eyes were puffy a spot glowed on her cheek and she must have put on a lot of weight recently because the dress she was wearing was far too tight over her heavy bust and hips how do you do chrissie said she had a soft husky voice with a slight foreign inflection how foul having an audition they must be beastly things i always get into a state said bella but some people sail through them chrissie started to talk about a friend who wanted to go on the stage but although her mouth smiled her eyes looked at bella with hatred bella gulped her drink and looked round the room that was certainly a matisse over the fireplace and a renoir by the door between the curtains there was a lighter square on the rosecoloured wallpaper the gainsborough usually hangs there said constance following bellas gaze but weve lent it to the royal academy what can lazlo be talking about all this time she added irritably to charles the telephone bills that boy runs up hes talking to some arabs said rupert hes been trying to get through all day how exciting to have a wedding so soon bella said brightly they all looked at her id better shut up she thought my girlish approach is going down like a lead balloon its your birthday isnt it how old are you said constance henriques her mouth full of potato crisps twentyfour replied bella twentyfour but ruperts only twentyone id no idea you were so much older than him and youve just turned fiftyfour my dear said charles henriques mildly so i think the less said about age the better bella giggled which was obviously the wrong thing to do for constance henriques had turned the colour of a turkey cock fortunately there was the click of a telephone thatll be lazlo finished said constance we can eat at least its too much to expect the young to be punctual these days but i do hate keeping the servants waiting bella flushed ruperts mother was a cow thank god lazlo was going to join them now of all the henriques family he was the one she felt she was going to get on with she imagined a gay laughing handsome more dissipated version of rupert with the same slenderness and delicate features but as usual in such cases she couldnt have been more wrong in her assessment for the man who came through the door was tall and as powerfully built as steve with his sallow complexion hooked nose thick black curling hair and drooping eyelids it was difficult to tell if he looked more south american or more jewish in his appearance but there was certainly nothing of the jewish fleshiness about his face nor the melting softness of the latin about his eyes which were as hard and black as tarmac he looked dangerous and incredibly tough rupert bounded forward lazlo bellas arrived come and meet her wincing slightly at the pride in ruperts voice bella gave lazlo her most seductive smile ive heard so much about you she said i feel i know you very well already for a second there was a flicker of surprise in his eyes he certainly took his time to look her over then with a smile that wasnt entirely friendly he said i can assure you you dont how do you do then he turned to constance sorry i took so long this deals reached a really delicate stage if we pull it off though charlesll make enough bread to pay for gays wedding constance didnt look in the least mollified but at that moment a maid announced dinner was ready until then bella had drunk enough whisky to sail through any situation but as they went into the diningroom she was overwhelmed with a fear so violent that she had to clutch on to the table to stop herself fainting what was that terrible sickly smell then she realized it was the lilies a huge clump was massed on a grecian pillar at the far end of the room and another great bowl filled the centre of the table bella stared at them horrified remembering the wreaths of lilies that had filled the house before her mothers funeral just after steve had walked out on her and how closely at the time the white waxy petals had resembled the translucence of her mothers skin as she lay dead upstairs she felt the sweat rising on her forehead she was trembling all over looking up she saw lazlo watching her immediately on the defensive she glared back then cursed herself as he looked away it would have been so much more politic to smile they sat down at a table that could easily have accommodated a couple of dozen people bella was between charles and teddy rupert was hidden from her by the centrepiece of lilies a maid began handing round a great bucket of caviar constance and gay discussed the wedding its amazing how people cough up said gay the most unlikely relations have sent vast cheques when i was married said constance taking a far bigger helping than anyone else all the west wing was cordoned off to accommodate the presents id forgotten how much there is to do im quite exhausted ive been tied up with the bishop all afternoon how very uncomfortable for you both said lazlo gravely constance ignored this the bishop was most impressed by our work for the blind she went on particularly with the number of new guide dogs weve provided lazlo held up his wine so that it gleamed like a pool of gold you should start a society of guide people for blind dogs he said do you know baby ifield charles shouted to bella down six feet of polished mahogany she shook her head should have seen her in her heyday my word she was a smasher used to go backstage and see her often took her to the four hundred constances lips tightened i simply cant bear to discuss the mess this government is making she said and proceeded to do so for half an hour listening to her bella found herself becoming more and more critical and as her critical spirit waxed her tact and caution waned constance switched to the subject of northern ireland if only theyd bring back hanging why should they said bella her trained actresss voice carrying down the table constance looked at her as though one of the potatoes had spoken itd soon stop them planting bombs so casually said constance no way said bella theres nothing the irish like better than feeling martyred hanging would only make them step up the campaign constance was revving up for a really crushing reply when lazlo said hows jonathan a case in point said constance sourly young people today are allowed far too much freedom his housemaster wrote to me only this morning saying jonathan painted death to apartheid in red all over the chapel wall lazlo and charles grinned rupert started to laugh but thats great said bella whose glass had been filled for the fourth time hes doing something positive constance stared at bella her cold eyes baleful have you ever been to south africa no admitted bella i thought not people who havent firsthand knowledge of a country always make sweeping generalizations but one has only to read the papers bella was thoroughly roused by now i bought that chestnut filly i told you about charles once more lazlo had interrupted her in midsentence suddenly the table came to life horses were obviously a complete obsession where the henriques were concerned the candles threw sharp daggers of light on to the table chrissie was talking to rupert bella watched the rapt expression on the girls face so thats the way the wind blows she thought no wonder she hates me constance was rabbiting on about the game reserves lazlo was picking his teeth i was a fool to come thought bella miserably steve was right about these people she felt both exhausted and depressed when they left the men to their port and cigars chrissie sat down at the grand piano and played beethoven extremely well she looks beautiful now thought bella looking at her softened face the lamplight on the black hair constance and gay talked more about the wedding constance sewing a piece of tapestry of a victorian lady with a hare lip rupert joined them first and came straight over to bella his face drawn all right darling fine snapped bella give me a cigarette she was irritated that he hadnt stuck up for her at dinner sorry we took so long he said my father and lazlo were having rather a heated discussion about devaluation but lazlo didnt look heated as he came through the door a moment later smoking a large cigar and laughing at some joke of charless his saturnine face lit up by the glitter of dark eyes and the flash of very white teeth he ought to laugh more thought bella as he went over to the piano all right love lazlo picked up a loose hair from chrissies shoulder of course she said brightly good he smiled down at her then crossed the room and sat down beside bella hes a womanizer thought bella maybe ill try and vamp him she leaned forward to show him more of her cleavage i met a friend of yours the other day he said oh who said bella giving him a long hot lingering glance which was immediately wiped off her face when he said angora fairfax she said you were at drama school together bella had always loathed angora fairfax she had been the spoilt darling of immensely rich parents always at parties and complaining how exhausted she was next morning all her fellow students except bella had been pixillated by her angora in her turn had been jealous of bellas talent i knew her slightly said bella whats she up to now a television series i think she talked a lot about you im sure said bella coldly shes extremely attractive said lazlo examining his whisky can she act bella nodded she wasnt going to fall into the trap of being bitchy i hear you had an audition tonight lazlo went on bellas early warning system wasnt working very well yes i did and the director made a pass at you how distressing for you sarcastic cat thought bella who was he harry backhaus harry his eyebrows shot up unlike him hes only just got married again were lunching tomorrow ill give him a bollocking bella felt herself going hot then cold with horror oh no please dont she said far too quickly i expect he got carried away lazlos smile was bland still theres no excuse for that sort of thing at half past eleven bella got up to go ill drive you home said rupert ill take her said lazlo i go straight past her door but its not that way said rupert mutinously id like you to wait for another call from sordid arabia said lazlo you know the background wow thought bella hes really pulling rank and she willed rupert to stand up to him but rupert opened his mouth shut it again and sulkily agreed as she left charles kissed her on both cheeks well see you at the wedding next month if not before he said everyone stiffened have you sent bella an invitation yet constance he added weve run out said constance coldly nonsense there are at least a dozen left in your desk we need a bit of glamour on our side of the church when they were nearing bellas flat lazlo said i want to talk to you shall we go to your flat or mine im very tired snapped bella cant we talk here no he said its important all right wed better use mine her flat was in chaos clothes all over the drawingroom unwashed breakfast things lying around bella kicked a bra under the sofa and went into the bedroom to take off her coat in the mirror her eyes glittered with drink really that blouse was too indecent for words perhaps lazlo was going to make a pass at her when she came back she found him sprawled in an armchair playing with the solitaire board hes got the face of a riverboat gambler she thought tough cool measuring up all the options did rupert give you this he said bella nodded hes a nice boy said lazlo i think so said bella do you want a drink lazlo shook his head rupert hasnt had an easy life he went on lots of spoiling but not much love constance has always been too tied up with her charities charles much too preoccupied with old masters and young mistresses ruperts pretty unstable as a result he needs someone who cant only handle him but who also loves him very much my said bella with a nervous laugh i didnt know you were that romantic lazlo didnt smile back im not i just hate waste bella took a deep breath you dont want me to marry him do you no i dont because i dont come out of the top drawer i dont care if you come out of the coalhole i just want rupert to land up with someone who loves him like your sister chrissie i suppose then youd keep all your millions in the family leave chrissie out of it why should i what makes you think she loves rupert more than i do she wouldnt have arrived an hour late to meet her future motherinlaw i told you i couldnt get away i was stuck at the audition and not bothered to dress i didnt have time to change or arrived three parts cut i was not americans just pour very strong drinks or been rude to aunt constance on every possible occasion she was insufferable said bella in a choked voice i agree he said evenly shes an uphill battleaxe but if you loved rupert youd have put up with it whats it got to do with you anyway bella said furiously he had only a few marbles left now in the centre of the solitaire board she watched his long fingers mesmerized all im saying he said softly is that if you loved rupert youd have arrived on time sober properly dressed instead of swilling whisky in the hilton bar with one of your lovers bella turned green w what are you talking about she whispered i was having an audition maybe you were earlier in the evening baby but when i saw you you were so engrossed with your handsome desperado you didnt even notice i was sitting only a few tables away confusion and horror swept over her lazlo had seen her with steve how much had he heard of their conversation hes an actor sheliedquicklywe er we were discussing a play were doing together next week rehearsing all the love scenes said lazlo dryly if you gazed at rupert with a tenth of that slavish adoration id be only too happy for you to marry him he was left with one dark green marble now he looked at it for a moment then putting the board down took out his cheque book now he said in a businesslike tone how much do you want if i give you oh five grand will you leave rupert alone bella laughed in spite of herself i never realized people really said things like that no i wont because you adore rupert and cant live without him he said acidly i never said anything about love she said its you who keeps banging on about it but since you want things spelled out i dont intend to break it off ten grand said lazlo there was a pause bella looked out of the window wow the things i could do with ten thousand pounds she thought i wonder if it would be tax free then aloud she said i dont want your rotten money youll have to think of something else lazlo put away his cheque book and got to his feet the sheer size of him made her step back well if you wont be sensible about it i shall have to try other methods you cant stop me marrying rupert i cant he said softly you obviously cant be familiar with our family motto scratch a henriques and you draw your own blood the long scar showed white on his swarthy skin a shiver ran down bellas spine hes like the devil she thought my familys got a lot of influence he went on we can make things very difficult for you if you dont play ball youre threatening me she said yes and id warn you i fight very dirty are you sure you dont want that cheque bella lost her temper get out get out she screamed and picking up a blue glass bowl she hurled it at him but he ducked and it smashed on the wall behind him he laughed and left bella couldnt stop shaking after hed gone oh no she wailed why did i blow my top loathsome horrible bully hes only bluffing he wouldnt do anything really and yet and yet with all that money and power behind him she shivered with fear perhaps she ought to take the money and clear out with steve but steve was unreliable not to be trusted and then of course there was poor rupert to be considered suddenly the doorbell rang making her jump out of her skin lazlo again steve her heart was cracking her ribs whoever it was was leaning on the bell who is it she sobbed in terror its me rupert she opened the door and as he followed her inside she burst into a storm of weeping darling hush sweetheart it went all right he pulled her down beside him on the sofa stroking her hair theyre always bloody at first you should have seen them with teddy wasnt lazlo nice to you she shook her head she hadnt meant to tell rupert but she couldnt control herself any more he hates me she sobbed more than any of them he said he doesnt want me to marry you he doesnt probably fancies you thats why hes so rude anyway my fathers crazy about you how good it was to be held in his arms and comforted im so rotten to you she muttered arriving late and cheeking your mother i dont know why you put up with me and you dont know the half of it she thought miserably theres nothing to put up with rupert said i love you ten times more than i did this morning id kill anyone who hurt you she moved away and looked at him harlequins face sad pale with great blue rings under his eyes bella darling please lets get married and whether it was to spite lazlo or to escape from steve or because she was drunk or because rupert wanted her so much she never knew but the next moment she was saying yes chapter six bella woke next morning with a series of flashbulbs exploding in her head scenes from last nights débâcle restaged themselves with relentless accuracy the disastrous audition with harry backhaus the meeting with steve the catastrophic dinner party at the henriques she was just wincing her way through that appalling moment when shed hurled a glass bowl at lazlo when she sat bolt upright and gave a groan jesus shed let herself get engaged to rupert but she didnt love rupert she loved steve and that snake lazlo henriques knew it too and would pull out every stop to make her break it off with rupert oh god she wailed pulling the bedclothes over her head what a terrible mess the events of the next weeks left her breathless rupert insisted on looking at dozens of houses taking her on a triumphal round of his relations and showering her with presents including a huge plastic pink heartshaped engagement ring because he knew it would irritate his mother bella had expected lazlo to come round breathing fire but he did nothing obviously biding his time what really crucified her was that even though steve must have read about her engagement every paper splashed pictures of the millionaire and the showgirl he made no attempt to get in touch with her the sex side with rupert hadnt been going well either now she was engaged she could hardly refuse to sleep with him rupert fobbed off for so long wanted to spend every free moment in bed then afterwards was desperate for reassurance was it all right darling are you sure it was all right for you yes yes she would say pulling him down on to her breast until he fell asleep and she would gaze unseeingly at the ceiling her body twitching with unsatisfied desire and longing for steve a week later after a performance at the theatre she slumped down in front of her dressingroom mirror cheers echoing in her ears she had acted superbly now she was all in rupert had gone to a dinner in the city and wasnt meeting her until later it gave her a breathing space convincing him how blissfully happy she was to be marrying him put more of a strain on her than anything else dully she reached for a pot of cleansing cream to take off her makeup there was a knock on the door come in she said listlessly then her heart gave a sickening lurch steve stood in the doorway lazy smiling impossibly blond and handsome how did you get in here she gasped the doormans a mate of mine he shut the door and leaned against it well he added softly well what i thought i told you not to get tangled up with rupert henriques its nothing to do with you there was a sob in her voice a lot you care you havent even rung me i thought id leave you on slow burn for a week or two he said he walked towards her and put a hand on her bare shoulder funny how rupert could maul her for hours and nothing happened but just a touch from steve sent a thousand volts through her the warm hand crept slowly up her shoulder round to the back of her neck then he laughed you were fantastic as desdemona honey id no idea you were that good happiness flooded through her oh did you really think so yes absolutely bowled me over he said bending his head and kissing her bella was kissing him back his hand was edging down the front of her dress and everything was getting quite out of control when suddenly to her horror she heard the door burst open and a voice saying this must be bellas room colour flooding her face she leapt away from steve but it was too late standing in the doorway was lazlo henriques and bellas old enemy from drama school angora fairfax bella you are frightful said angora with a giggle youve only just got engaged to rupert and here you are being unfaithful already with this stunning man she raised her huge blue eyes to steve i think you should call him out she added to lazlo rupert can fight his own battles said lazlo looking amused hello bella how are you bella was speechless it was steve who came to the rescue id better introduce myself my names steve benedict he said grinning and im angora fairfax and this foxy individual here is lazlo henriques said angora she was as pretty as a kitten incredibly slim with tiny wrists and ankles cloudy dark hair purplyblue eyes and pouting red lips which didnt quite meet over her slightly protruding teeth angora said one of her stage school colleagues was the sort of girl who could get away with asking a man if he could possibly carry this frightfully heavy match box bella darling she said do stop looking so pink in the face it was a lovely performance you were so good though they shouldnt have given you that terrible set in the last act i mean you were hopping all over the place like the grand national lazlo was awful he went to sleep in the second and third acts but hes had a rough day gold bullions gone down a halfpenny or something have you anything for us to drink yes of course said bella grinding her teeth shed forgotten angoras ability to make her feel a complete idiot theres a bottle of whisky in the cupboard perhaps youd do the honours steve when steve had poured out four very large drinks lazlo raised his glass to bella to you and rupert he said with a nasty glint in his eye yes to the lovebirds said angora you must be in a daze of happiness bella such a relief to be settled and know one wont end up a terrible old maid keeping cats in a garret she looked at lazlo under long sooty black lashes dont fish angora he said she giggled im sorry but im a bit overexcited harry backhaus has signed me up for the lead in his new film thats great said steve flashing her his devastating smile how did you pull that off strings really darling lazlo took me and harry out to a long drunken lunch today i gather you went after the part too bella darling but as they start shooting in a fortnight i knew you wouldnt want to be parted from rupert so soon of course i wouldnt said bella and she smiled at lazlo her heart black with hatred what about you then angora said to steve where did bella dig up something as lovely as you from buenos aires said steve he turned to lazlo actually weve met i own the amontillado club youve been in once or twice one of my favourite haunts said lazlo its so dark i can never remember who ive come in with is it nice out there asked angora its nice anywhere said steve and laughing he refilled lazlos glass bella suddenly felt twitchy if lazlo learned from steve the real truth about her past heaven knows what use hed make of it angora was rabbiting on and on about acting steve and lazlo had moved on to business money money money said angora finally i can see you two are going to be very bad for each other bella felt a stab of jealousy in a quarter of an hour theyd accepted steve as theyd never accept her he was talking to angora now turning on his homme fatal act dropping his voice several semitones flashing his teeth all over the place finally angora stretched lazlo darling if i dont eat i shall fall over lets go then said lazlo stubbing out his cigar why dont you come too he added to steve wont i be de trop said steve not at all said angora lazlo will melt into a telephone box and magic up some amazing looking girl for you then well go on the town thanks for drinks bella see you at gays wedding lazlo had some crazy scheme for us all to go down to the country the next day then we can go to goodwood if you like horses she added to steve youd better come too and they drifted out hardly bothering to say goodbye leaving bella jibbering with misery and impotent rage lazlos nasty grin stayed with her like the cheshire cat long after hed gone she had even more cause to be angry with him in the next few days two television plays and a commercial shed considered certainties suddenly fell through her bank manager wrote a vitriolic letter complaining about her overdraft she was also due to play nina in the britannias production of the seagull which was going into rehearsal next week suddenly roger field the director sent for her and told her he wanted her to play masha the frumpy frustrated schoolmistress instead bella lost her temper lazlo henriques is behind this she stormed whos he said roger unconvincingly i make the decisions round here i feel youd be better as masha chapter seven as usual bella left buying something to wear to gays wedding to the last minute she knew she shouldnt buy anything at all there were stacks of hardly worn dresses in her wardrobe and with the present intransigence of her bank manager he was bound to bounce the cheque anyway but for the last week shed been spending money as though it was going out of fashion almost as though she was determining her own destiny forcing herself into such financial straits that the only way out would be to marry rupert anyway she had to have a new dress she knew that steve had been asked to the wedding and that hed been seeing a lot of angora and that she must knock him for six by looking even more glamorous the shopping expedition was a disaster half the shops seemed to have sales on everything she tried on looked perfectly frightful and shed no idea how the weather was going to turn out it was one of those grey dull days that might easily get hot later puce is going to be very big in the autumn said a sales girl forcing her into a wool dress and holding great folds of material in at the back to give it the appearance of fitting bella winced at her washed out reflection i look like something the cat brought in or up she said i need a new face not a new dress by two oclock when she was getting desperate she found a dress in willow green sleeveless low cut and clinging with a wrapover skirt it was the only remotely sexy thing she had tried on do you think its all right for a wedding she said desperately oh yes said the sales girl raking a midge bite with long red nails people wear anything for anything these days by the time shed found a floppy coral pink picture hat and shoes to match she was really running out of time but when she tried them all on later in daylight in her flat she realized the coral looked terrible with her tawny hair she had an hour and a half before she had to be at the church her hairdresser was closed that afternoon the only answer was to wash her hair and put a red rinse on it but in her haste she forgot to read the instructions about not using it on dyed hair the result was not a gentle titian but a bright orange going on heinz tomato and impossibly fluffy with it she soon realized too that half a ton of eyeliners blushers shaders and all her skill at makingup wasnt going to do her any good it simply wasnt an onday her skin looked dead her eyes small and tired and no amount of pancake could conceal the bags under them it was also getting colder a sharp east wind was flattening the leaves of the plane trees in the square outside all her coats were too short to wear over her new dress in the end she slung basil her red fox fur round her neck i need a few allies to face that mob she thought a large crowd had gathered outside the church to watch people arrive bella hopelessly late rolled up at the same time as the bridal car and fell up the steps in her haste to get in first drunk already said a wag in the crowd lazlo helped her to her feet with a flash of irritation she realized that he looked very good and that the austere black and white formality of morning dress suited his sallow skin and irregular features extremely well he looked at her hair and said oh dear oh dear and then at her bare arms and added in amusement youre going to be bloody cold in church she wanted to slip unnoticed into a pew at the back but grabbing her arm like a vice lazlo led her right up to the second row from the front youre a member of the family now he said rupert looking glamorous and almost as pale as the white carnation in his button hole tried to sit next to her but lazlo stopped him uhuh he said youve got to sit in the front and look after constance and sat down very firmly on the edge of the row next to bella bella moved quickly away from him slap into a very lecherouslooking old man with long grey sideboards on her other side you havent met uncle willy yet have you bella said lazlo beyond rupert sat a scruffy but nicelooking boy with a pudding basin hair cut that must be ruperts brother jonathan let off from school across the aisle sat teddy and his best man teddys pink and white cheeks were stained with colour as he alternately tugged at his collar and smoothed his newly cut hair i comforted my mother said rupert that she wasnt losing a daughter just gaining a cretin bella giggled people were turning round and talking to each other and saying hello havent seen you for years the organ was playing the same bach cantata for the third time bella sneaking a surreptitious look round realized that as usual she was quite wrongly dressed everyone was in silk dresses or beautifully cut suits and the competition was absolutely stupendous lazlo was right it was icy in church every goose pimple was standing out on her bare arms uncle willy next door was gazing openly at her breasts irritably to obscure his view bella shoved the foxs mask down the front of her dress gone to earth said lazlo bella gazed stonily ahead at the huge constance spry flower arrangement suddenly she realized that her wrapover dress which looked so respectable when she was standing up had fallen open revealing a large expanse of thigh and the pants with abandon hope all ye who enter here printed on them which rosie had given her for her birthday hastily she covered herself up but not before both lazlo and uncle willy had had a good look ill kill him fumed bella ill kill him and afterwards ill kick his teeth in another old relation sleeping peacefully behind them suddenly woke up and said come on buck up lets get cracking in a loud voice there was a rustle of interest as constance swept up the aisle looking like a doubledecker bus in a dust sheet waving graciously to friends and relations she claims shes just discovered the tent dress rupert whispered to bella but she needs a couple of marquees to cover her finally when bella was about to turn into a pillar of ice the organ launched into here comes the bride and everyone rose to their feet here was charles a fatuous smile on his face wafting brandy fumes as he went on his arm hung gay looking pale but well in control and carrying a huge bouquet to conceal any evidence of pregnancy her progress was slow for every few seconds she nearly had her head jerked off as one of the little bridesmaids trod on her veil chrissie brought up the rear wearing pink a coronet of pink roses on her gleaming dark hair shed obviously had a professional makeup she looked lovely but suicidal she halted just beside lazlo rupert turned round and pulled a face at her trying to make her laugh dearly beloved intoned the bishop bella had to share a prayer book with lazlo rigid with loathing she looked down at his long fingers and beautifully manicured nails and tried not to breathe in the subtle musk and lavender overtones of the aftershave he was wearing first said the bishop it was ordained for the procreation of children you can say that again muttered rupert with a grin second as a remedy against sin for such people as have not the gift of continence i do hope youre taking all this in said lazlo out of the corner of his mouth bella was not listening she was having a daydream of standing in gays place with long white satin arms and hair drawn back to show a delicately blushing face with an impossibly slender waist from a prewedding crash diet with steve beside her devastatingly handsome smiling proudly down at her and putting a gold ring on her finger to have and to hold for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death us do part repeated teddy in his strangulated hernia voice after the bishop but would steve ever stay with her was he capable of loving and cherishing anyone for very long would she herself ever be able to love and cherish rupert the way chrissie would looking past lazlo she saw chrissie staring fixedly in front of her the tears pouring down her face oh what a stupid muddle it all is thought bella i feel sick said one of the little bridesmaids immortal invisible god only wise sang the congregation lazlo next to her sang the bass part loudly hes just the sort of person who would embarrass his children singing parts too loudly in church she thought savagely they all sat down for the sermon the bishop was getting warmed up about fidelity and the need for steadfastness in the modern world when so many marriages crumbled uncle willy was rubbing his thigh against bellas she couldnt move away or she would have been jammed against lazlo she gazed furiously in front of her really she was getting to know that flower arrangement extremely well suddenly with the spontaneity that was so much part of his charm rupert turned round took her hand and squeezed it she was conscious of both lazlo and chrissie watching them a deep blush spread over her face and down her shoulders constance was crying unashamedly as they all went off into the vestry its not because shes losing gay said lazlo dryly but the thought of all the money this is costing her a reedy tenor began to sing sheep may safely graze the wait was interminable youd think they were consummating the marriage wouldnt you said rupert i wish we could smoke back came the procession teddy crimson with embarrassment gay looking relieved grinning slightly as she caught the eyes of various relations hear youre an actress said uncle willy to bella ever bin in crossroads he pronounced it crawse never miss it mself bloody good programme for several minutes they were penned up at the top of the church while the photographers took pictures as soon as he came out of his pew rupert squeezed bellas arm christ what a performance hullo aunt vera im not going through a bloody circus like this when we get married darling hullo uncle bertie its going to be in and out of chelsea register office and straight off to london airport to somewhere warm immediately afterwards bella put her hand lovingly over ruperts i agree she said looking straight at lazlo and as soon as possible too ive suddenly gone off long engagements the reception was a nightmare it was held in three huge marquees in the henriques garden and bella had never felt more lonely or out of things in her life there was a strange assortment of people there teddys grand dowdy relations in their silk shirtwaisters and pullon felts were almost indistinguishable from constances fellow committee workers who included several chief guiders in uniform who brayed to one another and drank orange juice in one corner two busloads of tenants from teddys fathers estate sat with their legs apart looking embarrassed but by far the largest group of people there bella suspected were charless and lazlos friends members of the international set at their richest and most international even though some of them had turned up in jeans they had that kind of bland selfassurance the giltedged security that enabled them to be accepted anywhere everywhere you looked ravishingly pretty women had emerged from their winter furs like butterflies and stood jamming cigarettes into their scarlet lips knocking back champagne refusing asparagus rolls and smoked salmon for the sake of their figures and chattering wittily to the suave handsome expensivelooking men who surrounded them bella had never seen so many people who seemed to know each other or even if they didnt would discover a host of friends they had in common rupert did his best to look after her but he was constantly being grabbed by constance or charles or particularly by lazlo to go and look after someone else or see to something she tried to scintillate and be amusing but because she was nervous and unsure of herself her voice came out far more artificial and affected than it would normally putting up a front to cover up her desperate insecurity she knew she was appearing phoney and as hard as nails rupert kept introducing her into a group of people but it was like feeding a screw into the hoover five minutes later theyd spew her out again god they were noisy too half the conversations were being carried on in foreign languages full of laughter and exclamation marks like the talking bits in fidelio she couldnt even get drunk because she had a performance that evening in her misery she ate five éclairs then felt sick suddenly as though someone had stamped a branding iron on her back she was aware of chrissie standing behind her her eyes glittering with misery and loathing pink really suits you bella said nervously and youve lost so much weight you really look ravishing but not quite ravishing enough snapped chrissie and turning on her heel she disappeared into the crowd even talking to uncle willy would have been preferable to standing by herself but he was hemmed in by some aunts in a corner where on earth were steve and angora bella wondered it was almost impossible to find them in this crowd she couldnt stay leaning against a pillar for ever like a small boat launching itself on a rough sea she began fighting her way across the marquee again and suddenly there like something on the big screen was angora wearing a navy blue straw hat which framed her cloudy dark hair and a parma violet suit which emphasized her huge purplyblue eyes she was surrounded by men but lounging by her side was steve in a grey morning suit cracking jokes deflecting any competition very much master of the situation admire her but keep your distance he seemed to be saying they made a sensational pair angora was laughing at something he said throwing back her head to show her lovely white throat when in midlaugh suddenly she saw bella belladonna come here at once as there was nowhere else to go bella went up to them darling youve gone orange how brave of you is it for a new part or are you doing a soup commercial the men around angora looked at bella without interest youve all met ruperts fiancée havent you said angora you know steve of course bella and this is timmie and this is patrick and this is oh god i cant remember your name bella was looking at steve her heart was pounding yes i know steve she said or i thought i did how are you fantastic said steve giving her that curiously opaque shuttersdown look she knew of old wheres rupert getting some aunt out of mothballs im glad youve brought foxy said angora patting bellas fox fur he looks as though he needs an outing why dont you give him some bob martins everyone laughed bella blushed why cant i think of some witty crack to make back she thought miserably rescue however was at hand in the not very steady shape of charles bella darling he said kissing her on both cheeks ive been looking all over for you they ought to page people at this party i wonder if youd be terribly kind and give a word of advice to a young niece of mine shes awfully keen to go on the stage and i thought being such a star you were the person to talk to bella got a slight satisfaction in seeing a look of annoyance flicker across angoras face she obviously felt she was the one who ought to be consulted id love to said bella and without even saying goodbye to steve she followed charles back into the crowd the stagestruck niece had a horse face and half chelsea flower show on her head it must be amazing to be acting at the britannia she said i suppose you pulled strings no said bella not even a tiny thread but i had a lucky break have you had much experience no i played juliet in the school play everyone said i was awfully good oh god bella groaned inwardly have you tried to get into any of the drama schools she said no perhaps you could give me a list of names and perhaps you could introduce me to your director i gather hes very charming very said bella her mind started to wander the horsefaced niece droned on and on incredible fantastic amazing said bella at suitable intervals then she said how marvellous the horsefaced girl looked at her in surprise how marvellous said bella again i said mummy was in harrods when the bomb went off last week said the girl oh god im sorry said bella i misheard you theres such a din going on next moment one of horsefaces friends came up and they started shrieking at each other bella escaped but not before she heard horseface saying thats ruperts fiancée i dont think shes quite all there bella retreated to a pillar again and ate three more éclairs malevolently surveying the rest of the crowd dont look so horrified said a voice you chose to marry into this lot she jumped nervously it was lazlo theyre a load of junk she snapped they should be driven over a cliff with pitch forks lazlo laughed im glad youre enjoying yourself a waitress came by with a tray have an ice he said children are supposed to like them arent they i hate ices her voice rose shrilly more than anything else in the world except you at that moment teddy came up looking distraught hullo bella he said i say lazlo i thought pregnant women only threw up in the morning gays puking her guts out upstairs im sure constance is going to smell a rat she wants us to cut the cake now shes terrified everyone is going to drink too much poor old teddy said lazlo but you did go into this with your flies open i certainly did sighed teddy its hell being a bridegroom noone talks to you because they all think you ought to be talking to someone else he wandered off looking miserable and they were immediately joined by a smooth looking man with auburn hair and heavylidded eyes lazlo henri my dear how are things pretty rough ive had to sell half my horses and ive had to sell off the land but at least theyve let me keep the shooting hope youll come and stay for the twelfth he held out his glass to be filled by a passing waiter i say he went on wheres this chorus girl ruperts got himself mixed up with one hears such conflicting views charles is evidently rather smitten but he always liked scrubbers the rest of the family seem to think shes absolute hell bella went white judge for yourself said lazlo this is bella oh god said the redheaded man looking not at all embarrassed trust me to put both feet in it he gave bella a horsefleshjudging onceover then said i must say im inclined to agree with charles youre bound to get opposition if you marry into this lot theyre so bloody cliquey itll be your turn next lazlo one of those pretty girls you run around with will finally get her claws into you hardly said lazlo just because i enjoy a good gallop it doesnt necessarily mean i want to buy the horse the redheaded man laughed coldblooded sod arent you i must say youve got a pretty smart crowd here today arent those a couple of royals i see through the smoke my aunt constance said lazlo would get blue blood out of a stone i suppose id better go and organize someone or well be here till midnight gay looking peagreen but fairly composed reappeared to cut the cake rupert fought his way over to bellas side god what a hassle the most terrible things are happening uncle willys just exposed himself to one of teddys female tenants has lazlo been taking care of you im sure hed like me taken care of said bella someone rapped the table the speeches were mercifully short lazlo stood up first to propose gays and teddys health he was the sort of person who could quieten a room just by clearing his throat im sorry he said in his husky slightly foreign voice that so many of you have had to miss goodwood we all appreciate the sacrifice he then proceeded to read out the goodwood results god that laid them in the aisles they were all in stitches bloody funny said rupert in a corner uncle willy was so drunk he was trying to light an asparagus roll lazlo then told a couple of jokes bella had to admire his timing before raising his glass to gay and teddy everyone round her drained empty glasses the drink due to constances parsimony was running short teddy got up his heart was in his mouth he said and as his old nanny had told him never to talk with his mouth full hed better shut up god they fell about at that too i wish i played to audiences like that thought bella he just wanted to thank constance and charles he added and toast the jolly pretty bridesmaids the best man replied briefly and the room became a great twittering aviary again children were beginning to get overexcited and run through peoples legs grandmothers retired to the sidelines to rest their swelling ankles suddenly there was a loud bang on the table and bella turned hearing charless voice i wont keep you a moment he said his voice slurring his eyes glazed pissed as a newt as usual said someone behind bella i wont keep you a minute he said again but i just wanted everyone to know how absolutely delighted constance and i are that our son rupert has just announced his engagement to a very talented and beautiful girl charles thundered constance magenta with rage pissed as a newt said the voice again i want you to drink to bella and rupert said charles i know shell be an asset to us all half the marquee had started mumbling bella and rupert when chrissie suddenly said very loudly its not true shes not an asset shes horrible horrible shes the biggest bitch that ever lived there was a dreadful embarrassed silence shut up chrissie snarled rupert whats that whats that everyone was saying lazlo had crossed the room in a flash come on baby thats enough upstairs with you you dont understand noone understands anything said chrissie and wrenching her arms away from lazlo she fled out of the marquee bella had also had enough she fought her way out into the street and immediately found a taxi just as she had got in and was telling the driver to take her to the theatre rupert appeared at the window bella darling please wait no i will not she hissed ive had enough of you and your bloody family for one afternoon im not going to stand around getting insulted any more go on she said to the driver get going darling pleaded rupert for christs sake let me explain as the taxi moved off he reached in to grab her arm but caught hold of the foxs tail instead which promptly came off in his hand bella leaned out of the car and ill report you to the rspca for cruelty to foxes she screamed back at him chapter eight she couldnt wait to get to the theatre to pour out all her miseries to rosie hassell when she arrived she discovered rosie was off with flu and an understudy was taking her place the poor girl was absolutely sick with nerves and needed all the boosting bella could give her here i am at twentyfour a real trouper with a manx fox thought bella and she started to giggle helplessly all the same she gave a terrible performance she couldnt concentrate and she kept drying up and fluffing her lines rupert rang her in the interval it took all his powers of persuasion to get her to come out that evening chrissie was tight he said shes been on a diet hasnt eaten properly for days and shes got this sort of crush on me she passed out when she got upstairs shell be absolutely mortified in the morning shes not coming out with us tonight i dont think so just angora steve lazlo and one of his birds the heavy brigade said bella but she couldnt resist another chance to get at steve she made a real hash of the last act wesley barrington had to carry her the whole way there was a great deal of applause at the end both for him and the understudy rogers out front said wesley out of the corner of his mouth as bowing and smiling they took the last curtain call oh god said bella id better make myself scarce roger however came backstage immediately well done he said to the understudy his square freckled face breaking into a smile of approval that was a lovely performance now clear out and get changed somewhere else when she had gone he shut the door and leant against it that was a cockup wasnt it he said grimly i suppose you got tight at the wedding bella shook her head not enough that was the trouble hell was it hell would seem like a day at the seaside compared with that little bunfight the henriques really dont like outsiders do they trespassers are very much persecuted she lit a cigarette with a trembling hand putting the heat on are they are you sure youre doing the right thing marrying this boy oh not you too groaned bella i thought you were my friend i am and one of your greatest fans too i know you can make it really big but not if you go on giving lousy performances like this evening youre in bad shape angel if i touched you youd twang and you look frightful too noone looking at you could see any reason why othello should have the hots for you thanks a lot said bella and started to laugh thats better now youve got three days off havent you for gods sake get some sleep what are you going to do spend the weekend at the henriques country hot seat youll enjoy that its very plushy hot and cold servants in every bedroom and the country is absolutely magical if thats supposed to cheer me up said bella its an experience i would gladly forgo you know how i hate the country it was only when she got out of her costume that she realized shed brought nothing to wear she hated the willow green dress as she hated hell pains the only alternative was a tshirt with a picture of clark gable on the front and a crumpled pair of black knickerbockers which had been at the bottom of her cupboard for weeks and smelt of old mushrooms oh well she thought tugging them on ive got the top batting average for wearing the wrong clothes why spoil the record it was four oclock in the morning and the night had fallen to pieces around her they had gone from disco to disco and ended up in one of ruperts haunts where the musicians played cool jazz chrissie had cried off pleading a headache she cant stand seeing me and rupert together bella thought wryly and lazlo had brought a ravishing spanish girl with him with a long black plait trailing down her beautiful brown back steve had ignored bella all evening it was as though a sheet of glass had risen between them not once did he ask her to dance she was dead with exhaustion but some masochistic streak wouldnt allow her to go home they were all dancing now steve still laughing with angora rupert his cheeks flushed his hair tousled over his face like some bacchante was pressing his body against bellas muttering endearments into her ear lazlo was kissing his beautiful spaniard his hands slowly caressing her brown back which was arched towards him in ecstatic submission the two of them exuding so much whitehot sexuality it rubbed off on everyone else i cant stand it thought bella in agony and wrenching herself away from rupert she fled into the loo and burst into a storm of weeping after a few minutes she managed to pull herself together and looked at her face in the mirror it was pale grey she rubbed some lipstick on to her cheeks the effect was horrible and you can stop grinning too she snarled silently at clark gable who was baring his teeth across her bosom rupert was dancing with the spanish girl when she got back to the table lazlo was smoking a cigar bella sat down as far away from him as possible and gazed into her drink you wont find the truth in the bottom of a shot of johnnie walker he said the light from an opening door suddenly lit up the long scar down the side of his face curious in spite of herself bella asked where did you get that scar in buenos aires a man called miguel rodriguez pulled a knife on me what for he thought i was having it off with his wife what did you do i killed him bella shivered but why hed have killed me otherwise and i was er quite fond of his wife there must have been a frightful scandal frightful but there have been worse since people soon forget she started to laugh scornfully but somehow the laugh got out of hand and went on and on this isnt doing you any good is it he said im all right she snapped he picked up her hand and examined it maybe but bitten nails do not denote serenity the woods are deep and dark and full of tigers youd be very wise to pack rupert in over my dead body she hissed snatching her hand away from him then the inevitable happened steve and angora were no longer there lazlo gave rupert and bella a lift the top of the car was down the night all warm and bella looked up at the endless stars trying to convince herself her life wasnt over rupert put his arm round her dont maul me she yelled suddenly at breaking point there was a shocked silence rupert went white take it easy darling he said gently im sorry love said bella a moment later taking his hand but in the driving mirror she saw a glint of satisfaction in lazlos eyes chapter nine as a result of hangovers none of them had gone down to the country until late on the day after gays wedding they all felt jaded the only answer seemed to start drinking again it was angora probably at lazlos instigation who suggested they play tableturning everyone except bella agreed with alacrity a polished table and a glass were found the lights were dimmed at first the glass produced no messages for anyone then chided by chrissie that the spirits would not work unless they stopped fooling about they started to concentrate the glass hovered a bit then spelt out that lazlo was going on a journey which impressed everyone because he was flying to zurich tomorrow night and it told angora she was due for measles then it spelt mabel we dont know anyone called mabel said angora yes we do said steve bella of course bella said rupert in surprise but shes isabella no shes not ive known her longer than you and her names not bella she was born mabel figge to be exact bella blushed scarlet angora gave a crow of joy youre never called mabel figge and she went off into peals of laughter chrissie grinned delightedly shut up angora snapped rupert lets go on with the message for bella they all put their fingers on the glass go home it spelt out slowly then suddenly taking on a life of its own it veered round the table spelling out two timing gold digger there was a long pause then bella screamed someones pushing that glass darling rupert protested its only a game and you can shut up she shouted at him and jumping to her feet she caught her bag on the edge of the table everything cascaded on to the floor her mirror breaking and i hope it brings you all seven hundred years bad luck she screamed she gave a sob and fled upstairs locking herself in her bedroom and lying on her bed crying just loudly enough for people to hear later rupert came upstairs and banged on her door until she let him in youre overreacting he said theyre only teasing throwing darts into a maddened bull more likely she stormed he started kissing her then followed the inevitable row because he wanted to make love to her suddenly the fight went out of her oh well go on if you must i dont care she said listlessly rupert stared at her for a minute thanks he said coldly but i never accept charity and walked out of the room slamming the door behind him it was early dawn when she finally fell asleep and late dawn when she woke up head splitting gravel behind her eyes desperate for aspirins she got up and wandered down the passage to the bathroom she shared with angora there were no pills in the cupboard only bath salts and cologne she weighed herself on the scales god she was putting on weight she must stop all this misery eating she got off the scales and turned them up seven pounds that would screw up angora and her flaming slimming diets on the way back she paused outside angoras bedroom the door was ajar she peered in uneasily breathing in the smell of french cigarettes nailpolish and expensive scent then her nails bit into her palms as she realized there was noone sleeping in the bed angora must be with steve until now bella had nurtured a faint hope he was just chasing angora to goad her into breaking it off with rupert now she imagined his suntanned hands caressing angoras body her cloudy black hair on the pillow her little gasps of excitement her head threshing back and forth as steve drove her to the extremes of pleasure that bella knew of old he was capable of then later the low laughter the private jokes the exchanged cigarettes the sleeping in each others arms she sat on her bed for a few minutes whimpering it was impossibly hot already she got up and opened the shutters and stepped out on to the balcony the fields were white with dew a heavy mist hung over the lake at the bottom of the lawn the white climbing roses on their tall arches were touched with pink on the tennis court birds were chasing worms in the distance a train chugged the beauty of the view only intensified her misery a light breeze caressed her bare legs and lifted her hair off her shoulders suddenly she heard a scrunch of wheels and leaning over the balcony she saw the ivy green mercedes draw up in front of the house lazlo got out he was wearing a red and white striped shirt and dark grey trousers and carrying his jacket and tie bella stepped out of his line of vision but through a crack in the shutter she watched him yawn and stretch breathing in the morning air then whistling he set off across the dewsoaked lawn towards the stables the next moment she heard a door shut quietly and saw angora wearing a white silk dressing gown steal across the drive and then the lawn after him then she called his name he turned round smiled and walked back towards her there was a quivering expectancy about angora as though she was longing for him to take her in his arms for a minute they talked in low voices with bella nearly falling off the balcony in her efforts to hear then lazlo picked up a loose strand of hair which had fallen over angoras forehead and smoothed it behind her ear she seemed to be arguing now then he patted her cheek and nodded towards the direction of the house reluctantly she came running back across the grass and disappeared through the front door bella opened her door slightly but angora didnt come back to her room had she gone to steves bedroom or lazlos chapter ten a beautiful blazing day soared out of the mist bella lay by the swimming pool trying to learn her lines it was midmorning out in the park the sun touched the pale green shoulders of the elm trees cattle grazed contentedly in the lush grass beside the lake and lazlos two golden retrievers frolicked on the lawn it was impossible to imagine a view more serene yet bella felt sick with terror anxious to avoid rupert she had got up early and gone to buy some aspirins at the local shop she knew one of the fleet of servants would have provided them but she wanted an excuse to get out of the house just as she was leaving a window box crashed from one of the balconies missing her by inches the gardener of course was profuse in his apologies but twice later as she wandered along the narrow country lanes a large blue car roared past her driving so close that she would have been run over if she hadnt leapt on to the verge lazlos behind this she thought hes capable of getting rid of miguel rodriguez because hed got in his way why not me too she tried to concentrate on learning her lines for the seagull she was playing masha the plain and ageing spinster loved by the schoolmaster but in her turn hopelessly in love with the son of the house every line she read seemed to parallel her own setup i am in mourning for my life i am unhappy it isnt money that matters a poor man may be happy oh nonsense your love touches me but i cannot return it help me help me or i shall do something silly i shall make a mockery of my life and ruin it i cant go on i am miserable no one knows how miserable i am i love konstantin she might have been speaking about her situation with rupert and steve i shall make a mockery of my life and ruin it she repeated a shadow fell across her book she jumped violently then realized it was steve it was the first time shed been alone with him since that evening in the theatre even in the blazing sunshine he looked brown he was wearing navy blue bathing trunks and a pair of dark glasses so she couldnt read the expression in his eyes as he looked down at her as always she felt her stomach go liquid with desire hi stranger he said softly may i talk with you he sat down beside her i dont know what game youre playing she blurted out what game honey you tell me telling me one moment you wanted me to break it off with rupert because you were so crazy about me then ignoring me the next sending me up telling the others my real name blatantly chatting up angora just to hurt me ive been doing a little more than chatting up he said pinching one of her cigarettes do you love her i dont understand words like love theyre not in my vocabulary but shes extremely attractive lets say we enjoy each other maybe you do said bella steadily but not enough to stop her slipping out at dawn to have a private confab with lazlo just for a second steve paused how do you know i couldnt sleep i opened my shutters lazlo came home about six no doubt from shacking up with some of the local talent within ten seconds angora was out of the house shed obviously been waiting for him they had some kind of hassle then he persuaded her to come back into the house steve shrugged his shoulders shes entitled to a commercial break if she wants one the programme was good enough but dont you see bella went on desperately theyre in cahoots together angoras simply being manipulated by lazlo hes pulled off a marvellous film deal for her shes very ambitious hes probably been knocking her off as well and in return shes agreed to lure you away from me shes pretty formidable when she pulls out the stops i defy anyone even you to resist her and lazlo knows what i feel about you that seeing you and angora together is driving me round the twist that its the one thing thatll make me break it off with rupert steve yawned so hard he nearly dislocated his jaw you always had too much imagination he said and keep your trap shut the others are coming hi chrissie hi rupe the midges are terrible youd better come up and see my itchings sometime bella flopped down on her lilo in despair rupert sat down beside her even on the hottest day of the year he still had the look of a hothouse plant exposed to a killing draught he was wearing a black shirt with the collar turned up as if against some imagined storm and looked at bella with bruised troubled eyes and eyelids swollen from lack of sleep how hed changed from the cool bitchy selfconfident little boy shed met six months ago she put out her hand to stroke his face he imprisoned it and held it against his cheek oh darling we must stop fighting i cant stand another night like last night i cant go on torturing him much longer she thought unhappily i must break it off with him but not yet im not going to give lazlo the satisfaction of thinking he directly engineered it chrissie very white and too fat for her scarlet bikini sat down under an umbrella and started the daily mail crossword steve dived into the pool his muscular arms coming out of the bright turquoise water as he did a leisurely crawl to the other side its lovely once you get in he called to chrissie and eventually after a lot of badinage he persuaded her to join him in the water where he chased her round the pool tickling her diving for her ankles making her shriek with laughter and fear rupert edged away as a particularly violent piece of splashing soaked his shirt i detest horseplay he said and i dont feel much more kindly towards mr benedict giggling frantically chrissie clambered out of the pool and ran along the edge to take refuge under the umbrella steve picked up a towel and catching up began to dry her laughing down at her his eyelashes stuck together with water his blue eyes rivalling the drained sapphire of the sky gradually in his arms she calmed down and stopped giggling im going to oil you he said and youre going to lie in the sun and stop hiding your very considerable lights under a bushel ill oil her said rupert sharply getting to his feet and almost snatching the bottle of ambre solaire from steve bella felt a stab of guilt as she saw the ecstasy in chrissies face as rupert rubbed it into her back she returned to her lines little red spots leaping in front of her eyes oh nonsense she whispered your love touches me but i cannot return it whats the largest organ in the body five letters said chrissie penis said angora drifting towards them in her white silk dressing gown carrying a photograph album a cigarette dangling from her scarlet lips chrissie giggled it cant be did you sleep well i didnt do much sleeping thank you darling but i had a lovely night you made a bloody awful din said rupert steve likes to hear the sound of his own vice said angora dropping a kiss on steves shoulder steves eyes met bellas see his triumphant expression seemed to be saying angora lay down on a lilo stretching out her scarlet painted toes admiring her sleek brown legs her almost japanese slenderness always made bella feel like a carthorse hullo belladonna she said you look a bit peaky darling shouldnt go to bed so early what you need is a few late nights bella ignored her i cant go on she repeated in a whisper im miserable noone knows how miserable i love konstantin who said angora oh i see youre learning lines you are virtuous i havent had a script from harry backhaus yet and we start shooting next week sometime i gather the costumes are heaven i do hope im not expected to take mine off the set always gets so crowded god shes hell thought bella how can chrissie look at her with such admiration dont you get tired of people asking you to be sexy all the time said chrissie they dont have to ask said steve lobbing a pebble on to angoras back well its not something i mind said angora like being bitten by midges steve darling do light another fag and drive them away now i want you all to gather round and look at this photograph album is it yours said chrissie no yours but guess who keeps cropping up in it she flicked a few pages theres rupert wasnt he an adorable baby and theres chrissie on a pony and gay at her first teenage party it was the hunterblakes firework party and look whos over there my god its you said steve wasnt i awful only fourteen then and still a virgin look who couldnt wait for it steve examined the photograph more closely you werent that bad i wish id been around at the time id have

bullingdon point to point not a virgin any more look a lot happier dont i i was wearing falsies although you wouldnt know it under all that heathermixture tweed and theres the guy who did it jamie milbank hes married with three children now jamie milbank said chrissie but hes so respectable i was his final fling and there i am again at gays comingout dance isnt it amazing how one crops up in other peoples photograph albums i never do thought bella wistfully once more she felt miserably conscious of being out of it theres lazlo again said angora looking much more glamorous now and there he is with a bird and theres rupert making a duck in the eton and harrow match you look disgustingly pleased rupe darling i suppose you were dying to get back to the bar theres lazlo with yet another bird whats so extraordinary is he and i never met until this year steve looked at the photograph and whistled some chick how does he manage to get all those broads angora giggled well im only going by hearsay darling but they tell me hes the fastest tongue in the west everyone howled with laughter until a dry voice behind them said you talk too much angora it was lazlo wearing dark glasses and black bathing trunks he was carrying the morning papers and a large drink what are you drinking said chrissie it says whisky on the bottle at this hour said angora in mock horror it says so all the time said lazlo youll ruin your looks that way said angora very probably said lazlo and sitting down on the edge of the pool he turned to the racing pages bella had to admit reluctantly that he was in extremely good shape she was pouring with sweat she longed to swim but it would make her hair even more fluffy than ever and she was damned if she was going to ask chrissie or angora if she could borrow their rollers how many horses have you got running this afternoon said steve two said lazlo the times seems to think one of thems going to win you know isidore who fixes everyones divorces said angora hes sold all his horses hes so terrified of the wealth tax any minute now said lazlo the man in the streets going to go into the betting shop and find there arent any horses to bet on it was too hot to hell with her hair she got up and walked to the edge of the pool conscious suddenly of the highly charged atmosphere she tried to dive in gracefully but promptly did a belly flop as she swam up and down she was aware of lazlos sardonic appraising eyes watching her looking for chinks in her armour presumably wondering like the chief torturer in the spanish inquisition what refinement to try next ill end up with my feet in cement at the bottom of this pool if i stay here much longer she thought she got out and dried herself and looked round for her script lazlo was reading it your love touches me but i cant reciprocate it help me or i shall do something silly he read softly so only she could hear can i have it back please snapped bella of course do you realize now how much better youll play masha than nina bellas yellow eyes narrowed so you were behind that little chess move she said naturally he said why dont you admit youve had enough i bloody well wont thats a nice ring he said admiring the gold band studded with seed pearls on her little finger where did you get it from rupert gave it to me she said i might have known it he sighed its the only jewellery in remotely decent taste ive ever seen you wear although his eyes travelled over her body i must confess in a bikini you look more chic than ive ever seen you angora who disliked anyones attention to be off her for very long started reading out the horoscopes in the paper what are you lazlo she said scorpio said chrissie oh very passionate said angora ruled by the privates everyone laughed it says youre going to have a tricky weekend so play things close to the chest whats bella taurus said rupert um angoras eyes ran down the page people around you just arent too cooperative but be prepared to stick to your guns and argue things out bella looked up met lazlos eyes flushed and looked away again and now rupert whats he aquarius said chrissie promptly she knew at once thought bella and i havent a clue oh dear sighed angora what a pity youve decided to marry bella taurus and aquarius are terrible together youve got an awfully stormy marriage ahead darling youd better think twice about it so you keep telling us angora said rupert angrily would you bloody well mind getting off our backs go and get ready angora said lazlo i know youre governed by double summer time but unless you get moving well be two hours late for the first race he got up and dived into the water bella experienced the same surprise that she would have felt seeing a big cat allowing itself to get wet chapter eleven bella was not on any sort of terms with chrissie or angora to ask them what was worn at goodwood it was far too hot to wear stockings and her legs werent brown enough to go without but it seemed stupid to waste the sun so she put on a pair of dungarees in dark blue denim superbly cut to show off her long legs she wore nothing else on top the straps and bib made a pretty good job of covering her breasts if she didnt leap about too much of course she was the last out they were all standing beside the mercedes like some magnificent five chrissie and angora both in pretty flowery dresses rupert and steve in lightweight suits lazlo however in an impeccably cut pinstripe suit with a dark red carnation in the buttonhole made everyone else look sloppy by comparison he laughed when he saw bella have you come to mend the boiler he said steve and angora sat in the front beside lazlo to make more room steve sat slightly sideways his arm along the back of the seat his elbow resting against angoras hair his hand lay just in front of bella and she had to resist a constant temptation to touch it angora adjusted her hat in the driving mirror do you think i ought to cut my hair lazlo she said no said lazlo i hate short hair life is just a bowl of cherries bella sighed until you break your teeth on the stones she was turned on by the whole ambience of the racecourse the heavy smell of hot horse leather and dung the shrill neighing from the stables she was surprised how done up everyone was the women very upper class displaying thoroughbred ankles the men were even better looking the members enclosure was crammed with yock yocks in light checked suits with the kind of curly brimmed hats you put in rollers every night bella found she got some pretty odd glances and some wolf whistles too it gave her considerable satisfaction that people were gazing at her more than angora and that two people came up and asked her for her autograph we saw you on television the other day we thought you were so good that annoyed angora too in the paddock the horses were circling for the first race bella admired their scarlet nostrils rolling eyes and impossibly fragile legs and realized how exactly right the artists had drawn them in those old sporting prints thats lazlos horse chaperone over there said rupert pointing to a chestnut gleaming like a furniture polish advertisement she looks well doesnt she beautiful sighed bella as the filly walked by nuzzling at her groom proudly flaunting the green and black rug with the initials lch on the corner shes the only one whos walking out said steve approvingly who with wondered bella out came the jockeys how tiny they looked with their shrill voices and jack russell jauntiness lazlo went into the paddock trainers owners and jockeys stood in isolated islands discussing last minute tactics the trainers telling jokes and making reassuring noises to the jockeys like the brides father before the trip up the aisle will the jockeys mount please said the loudspeaker chaperone was led in she dropped her head on lazlos shoulder in a friendly fashion leaving a large smear of green froth on his suit i must go and wish him luck said angora about to duck under the rails i wouldnt said rupert hes busy racings the only thing he takes really seriously apart from getting rid of me thought bella thats lazlos jockey charlie lamas getting up now rupert went on lazlo brought him over from south america bella watched the little man with a leathery face and mournful dark eyes being hoisted up on to chaperones back he swore at her as she gave two lighthearted bucks and sent her clattering down the tarmac after the other horses just time to place our bets said rupert taking bellas arm they all backed chaperone except bella who out of sheer cussedness backed an outsider heras pride from the members stand they could see the heat haze shimmering on the rails as the horses cantered down to the start down below them rumour and speculation seethed cauldronlike round the bookies with their knowing magenta faces the tictac men gesticulated frantically a minute before the start lazlo joined the party looking louche and piratical and chewing on his cigar good luck said angora theyre under starters orders said rupert raising his binoculars theyre orf said the loudspeaker bella found herself watching lazlo rather than the race she had to admire his sangfroid as the field rocketed up the centre of the course like mercury up a thermometer plunged into boiling water his hands clenched slightly on his binoculars he puffed slightly faster on his cigar as he watched the filly flare promisingly into the lead for an instant then slip to the back of the field as they streamed past the post there were no histrionics no effing and blinding he just moved away from the cries of sympathy that showered down on him unable to speak for a minute from disappointment who won asked bella a minute later heras pride said steve i cant imagine anyone backing it i did said bella to my mind she was the only one who was walking out and laughing in his face she skipped down the steps to collect her winnings her euphoria was shortlived she lost a fiver on each of the next two races the high event of the day was the ladies race sponsored by the bond street jewellers who make those diamond brooches with ruby conjunctivitis which rear up on smart racing womens lapels lets go and look at the gels leered a whiskery old gentleman with a purple face lazlos got a horse in this race called baudelaire said rupert its a bit green but lazlos got very high hopes for it its the black colt over there he bought it in ireland they think black horses are unlucky there so he got it cheap baudelaire rolling his eyes wickedly and snorting marched round the paddock snatching at his bit theyve had a devil of a problem getting weight on him said rupert he wont sleep walks his box all night sounds rather like his master said angora out came the women jockeys one tall girl with blond hair and very green eyes the rest small and very slight binoculars were immediately focused on the transparent breeches which clung to the girls svelte figures in the heat chrissie looked at them enviously lazlo says if i lose two stone hell buy me a racehorse she said which is lazlos jockey said steve the prettiest one of course said chrissie the tall one with green eyes do you think hes banged her yet said rupert angoras eyes narrowed for a second then she said lightly if he hasnt it wont be long the start was in a different place this time but bella was determined to place her bet with the same bookie on the other side of the track ill meet you in the members enclosure she called to rupert bella wait youll get lost he shouted after her she was returning across the course when just as she reached the white railings she realized shed dropped her betting slip turning she saw it lying in the middle of the course without looking to left or right she ran back to get it suddenly there was a thundering in her ears and the ten runners had come out of a side gate and were galloping towards her down to the start terrified she stood frozen to the spot then tried to run back to the rails but it was too late they were on top of her she screamed they must crush her to death then miraculously lazlos black horse had swerved frantically to the right to avoid her depositing his blond rider on the grass and galloping off down to the start the next moment lazlo was picking her up shed never seen him so blazing angry before what the fucking hell do you think youre doing trying to sabotage my horse what the hell are you doing trying to kill me jibbered bella she was riding straight at me no doubt at your instructions and if it hadnt been for that darling horse swerving out of the way id be a dead duck now dont be bloody fatuous said lazlo get off the course he went over to pick up the blonde who had staggered to her feet shocked but unhurt baudelaire having shed his rider was now having a high old time black tail straight up in the air reins trailing on the ground he cantered round the course using up valuable energy to the delight of the crowd and the shredded nerves of lazlo the stable lad and his blond rider he resolutely refused to be caught rupert fought through the crowd to bellas side darling are you all right of course i am i just dropped my betting slip and your dear cousins jockey rode straight at me she couldnt do much else said rupert they havent got very good brakes these horses hes doing marvellously now said bella admiringly watching baudelaire scampering away from a couple of stewards and come cantering back down the course hes got real star quality hes going to trip over the reins theyve got legs of glass these horses said rupert in anguish at last after ten minutes cavorting baudelaire got bored and came to a violent slithering halt in front of lazlo uttered a long rolling snort through flared nostrils and started eating grass the blond girl was put up again rupert lazlo and bella went back to the stands to watch the race hasnt got a hope in hell now said lazlo angrily they were off and for bella it was the same old rat race listening to the whisper of here they come here they come growing into a great roar not being able to recognize any of the horses in the shifting kaleidoscope of colours my god said rupert shes going to do it and suddenly the tall blonde crouched over baudelaires ears like a valkyrie by sheer force of personality and leg muscle seemed to shake off the rest of the field and drive the black horse first past the post the stand erupted in excitement christ what a finish what a turnup for the books said rupert back in the winners enclosure a great cheer went up as baudelaire came in the blond girl looked as cool as a cucumber the other girls dripped with sweat puce in the face their mascara running as though theyd just come out of the sauna baudelaire his coat covered with the kind of subdued lather you get after the first application of shampoo marched round the enclosure still rolling his eyes and laughing in his equine way congratulations were being showered on lazlo like confetti chapter twelve a great deal of champagne was drunk after that and bella got separated from rupert and was eventually driven back home by a lot of lazlos racing cronies chrissie whod come back with rupert had changed for dinner by the time bella arrived she looked prettier than bella had ever seen her wearing black with a huge diamond glowing between her breasts thats gorgeous said bella hoping to conciliate her and picked up the diamond between finger and thumb its called the evening star said chrissie ignoring bella and speaking directly to angora its one of the most famous diamonds in the world my mother would have a fit if she knew i was wearing it dinner finished everyone discussed what to do next we could play sardines said angora or why not murder i havent played that since i was a child when was that said steve yesterday angora pulled a face at him lazlo looked at his watch ive got to leave for the airport in an hour he said never mind said chrissie looking really excited for the first time in days we can play a couple of rounds before you go oh no thought bella not another of their horrible tribal games angora dealt out the cards good lazlo waved the king of spades im the detective i can stay down here and drink brandy wait till we get upstairs lazlo said chrissie then turn the lights off at the main we must do it properly i dont want to play said bella quickly come on dont be a spoilsport said angora taking her arm well im going to stay with rupert then no youre not said angora relentlessly as they climbed the main staircase you go along that passage bella rupert go this way and the rest of us will fan out towards the west wing as soon as she was alone bella quickened her pace if she could find some room and lock herself in shed be safe she started to run then suddenly everything was plunged into suffocating darkness as the lights went out she fell over a chair then found a door it was locked whimpering with terror she crossed the passage and found another door that was locked too then she heard footsteps behind her slow relentless she gave a sob slimy terror gripped her she crashed across the passage again found another door it was open she shot inside and pulled it shut behind her but there was no lock her heart pounding she leant against it the footsteps grew closer then stopped outside panicstricken she bolted across the room crashing into more furniture trying to find the window then she heard someone stealthily opening the door then equally stealthily closing it someone was in the room with her who is it she croaked in terror then suddenly as a waft of scent reached her she nearly fainted with relief shed recognize that smell anywhere it was steves aftershave steve she sobbed oh steve are you by yourself came the whisper yes im so frightened she stumbled forward and the next moment she was in his arms and bursting into a flood of tears i cant bear it i cant bear it stop torturing me like this he kissed her as hed never kissed her before as though he wanted to devour her and overwhelm her with the force of his passion he must love her to kiss her like that why have you been so horrible to me she moaned when she could speak i had to make you come to heel you cant marry rupert you know that yes yes promise youll speak to him this evening i promise anything anything just kiss me again he pulled her down on to the bed they erupted against each other i want you he whispered i want you now any moment hed be raping her and she didnt care it was a few seconds before they realized someone was screaming horribly bloody hell someone seems to have been murdered he said dont go dont leave me he started to kiss her again but the screaming went on echoing unearthily through the house id better go and see whats going on ill sort you out later but not until youve packed it in with rupert and he was gone when the lights came on she realized she was in a strange bedroom probably belonging to one of the maids in a daze of happiness she redid her face and staggered downstairs steve loved her she wasnt looking forward to breaking it off with rupert but it was no good marrying him if she really loved steve she felt so free she wanted to swing from the chandeliers downstairs she found everyone standing round chrissie who was in hysterics its gone she screamed its gone whats gone said lazlo sharply pull yourself together the evening star i was upstairs someone put their hands round my neck and the next moment the diamond was gone oh what will mummy say bust a gut thought bella and winked at steve but he didnt smile he looked the picture of concern dont panic i guess someones playing a joke bloody silly joke whoevers playing it snapped lazlo im going to call the police said chrissie dont be crazy said lazlo come on lets look for it but although they searched all the passages and rooms noone could find any trace of the stone lazlo looked at his watch ive got to catch that plane i must go ill ring you tomorrow he said as he kissed chrissie and whatever you do dont get the police in and that thought bella looking at lazlos broad departing back is the last ill ever see of that snake im going to call aunt constance said chrissie going upstairs but when she came back ten minutes later her eyes were glittering ive rung the police she said defiantly theyll be round any moment rupert frowned thats a bit extreme isnt it angora giggled how exciting she said starting to repaint her lips a brilliant scarlet do you think theyll search me sure to said steve rumpling her hair they smiled into each others eyes cant he let up even now thought bella then she relented let him have his little game of taunting her hed be hers as soon as she broke it off with rupert all the same she felt twitchy she hated the police she hoped they wouldnt ask too many awkward questions if they found out about her background they might suspect her thank goodness shed been with steve all the time and had a proper alibi when the police arrived chrissie talked to them first then steve who stayed in there a long time then angora rupert lazlos various racing cronies and finally bella the cid man had a smooth pink deceptively homely face after a few enquiries he said politely your real names mabel figge isnt it miss parkinson she caught her breath yes yes thats right and your father died in prison doing time for murder and robbery yes she clasped her hands together to stop them from shaking after a few more questions it was quite obvious they knew all the appalling details of her past who could have told them steve no steve loved her it must have been angora or chrissie probably clued up by lazlo where were you when the theft took place now she was on safe ground i went up the main staircase and turned left towards the servants quarters and slipped into a room along that passage mr benedict followed me she blushed under the detectives scrutiny we er spent the rest of the time together thats odd mr benedict says he was with miss fairfax all the time and she bears this out bella gave a gasp of horror hes lying he was with me he claims he was with miss fairfax in miss fairfaxs bedroom there was a lot of miss fairfaxs lipstick on the shirt he was wearing it must be mine you dont wear bright scarlet lipstick miss parkinson hes lying her voice rose ive also got to warn you miss henriques claims that the person who put their hands round her neck and stole the diamond wore bracelets that jangled he looked at the three heavy gold rings on bellas wrist but thats absurd other people were wearing bracelets not ones that jangled shes trying to frame me bella whispered shes madly in love with rupert and hes engaged to me they all hate me theyd kill me rather than let me marry their darling rupert oh god she clasped her clenched fists to her mouth she was badly out of control on the verge of tears the pinkfaced detective looked at her then to her amazement he said all right miss parkinson you can go now it was two oclock in the morning but she still made rupert drive her straight back to london she couldnt bear another moment under that roof she didnt know what steve was up to but she knew the only way to get the furies off her back was to break it off with rupert as they were driving down the bayswater road she took a deep breath and said im sorry rupert i know this sounds totally ridiculous and insane but i cant marry you i really cant im afraid im in love with someone else she had no idea how he took this because she was staring down at her hands how long have you known this other chap ages but well he only came back into my life about a fortnight ago the night in fact i was late for dinner the first time i met your parents i was with him and you still felt it was all right to get engaged to me i thought what i felt for you was the real thing and that i was just infatuated by him but now i know i cant live without him i dont like him very much but its driving me out of my mind im sorry darling ive not been thinking of you at all i know ive been a bitch i just thought i might grow to love you her voice ran out in a thin line of drivel the car slowed down outside her flat the pale green trees were lit up by the street lamps rupert looked quite calm but he was as white as a sheet wed better talk about it upstairs outside bellas flat however stood two men miss parkinson said one of them yes snapped bella what do you want were police officers sir we have a warrant to search miss parkinsons luggage dont be bloody stupid said rupert its all right said bella theres nothing in there youre quite welcome to search it but in the pocket of the smaller suitcase wrapped in one of bellas petticoats they discovered the evening star someone put it there bella screamed ive been framed i didnt take it im sorry miss parkinson said the policeman imperturbably im afraid well have to take you into custody chapter thirteen bella when she looked back later could recall very little about her spell in prison she remembered rupert making the most appalling scene when the police arrested her and later beating her fists against the door of her cell she remembered appearing in court the following morning nearly fainting with horror when the magistrate refused her bail and finally being gripped by hysterical panic at finding herself locked in a cell in holloway one of the wardresses had brought her some revolting stew and a sardonic doctor with rimless glasses had asked her endless questions about herself afterwards she lay on a hard narrow bed trying to control her mounting desperation why had steve denied being with her during the murder game who had betrayed her to the police was it chrissie angora or steve who had planted the diamond in her suitcase would the papers get all the details of her past if they did her career was finished at intervals the thought of lazlo rose black and churning choking her like a wave of nausea hes behind this she thought hes the one who cooked my goose im innocent she said over and over again but in spite of the stifling heat in the cell she couldnt stop shivering then a key turned in the door the prison governor wants to see you said the wardress the prison governor had a kind sheeplike face she looked embarrassed for a minute she played with a paper knife then she said im afraid theres been a mistake the evidence was very conclusive against you but the police have now discovered youve been framed the henriques family have withdrawn all charges were very sorry for all the worry this has caused you said the prison governor flashing her big teeth but of course all the papers will print the fact that youre innocent itll be wonderful publicity bella didnt smile back why wasnt i allowed bail there have been several big diamond raids in the past few weeks police suspect the same gang at work for some reason they felt you were mixed up in it have they arrested anyone else not yet suddenly she couldnt stand the awful sheeplike face any longer i want to get out of here at once of course theres a car waiting to take you to the court where youll be released immediately when she came out of court an hour later and felt the hot sun on her face she threw back her head and took a deep breath then a group of reporters surged forward and started to bombard her with questions oh god she hadnt thought theyd get on to the story so fast suddenly a tall man in dark glasses grabbed her arm and pulled her down the steps into a waiting car it was only after hed driven off leaving the reporters gaping that she realized it was lazlo henriques what the hell are you doing here she stormed youre the last person i want to see i thought you were in zurich i was rupert rang me in hysterics this morning begging me to come back and spring you from prison the things i do for my family it was your rotten family who got me shut up in the first place she was overcome by a terrible fit of shaking lazlo got out a packet of cigarettes lit one and handed it to her thanks she said trying to get a grip on herself wheres rupert gone to zurich carrying on the deal i started i thought it better if he was out of the way for a bit just in case i might have second thoughts about getting reengaged to him lazlo grinned how perceptive you are my dear was it splashed all over the papers my arrest it was too late for the dailies but the evenings lead on it with lots of pictures by the final editions theyll be leading on your release itll look like a publicity stunt thats what the prison governor said she started to relax london in the blue haze of the late afternoon had never looked so lovely where are we going she asked to my flat i want to go home dont be silly once the big press boys get on to this theyll never leave you alone how did you manage to spring me anyway pulled a few strings leaned on a few people id forgotten you were so influential who planted the diamond in my case ill tell you the whole story when we get home lazlos flat was a surprise she had expected it to be as ugly and impersonal as the henriques london house but it was sybaritic in the extreme with grey silk walls long fur rugs on the ground and brilliant scarlet curtains thousands of books and paintings covered the walls three large cats wandered up to welcome them lazlo went straight to the drinks tray and poured bella a vast brandy get that inside you im sorry im still a bit stunned bella said taking the glass would you mind awfully if i had a bath she soaked in emerald green scented water for a long time and scrubbed and scrubbed herself to get every speck of prison dirt off later she pinched some of lazlos scent from the row of bottles near the bath odd that he used black opal like steve she put on a dark green towelling dressing gown that was hanging on the back of the door in the kitchen she found lazlo eating smoked salmon sandwiches and reading his mail ive just weighed myself she said ive lost five pounds in the last two days lazlo handed her the plate of sandwiches well youd better eat something ill get you another drink im not hungry she said then realizing suddenly that she was ravenous she wolfed the lot the brandy was giving her heartburn but a mild euphoria stole down inside her she sat down on the sofa a large ginger cat jumped on to her knee and started purring and kneading her with his paws how did you get me out she said i told you i leant on a few people but please who put the diamond in my case a guarded look descended like a curtain over his face chrissie he said chrissie said bella in amazement what on earth for it was her diamond she loves rupert to distraction seeing you and him together when she knew you werent in love with him pushed her over the top she thought quite wrongly as it turns out that if you were arrested rupert would go off you bella thought for a minute shed gone through enough hell over steve to understand exactly what chrissie must have suffered oh poor poor chrissie she whispered for once lazlo looked surprised well its nice of you to take it like that the irony was that you broke it off with rupert that evening anyway so she neednt have bothered did you tell the police she did it he shook his head how did you get me off then i said you were with someone else the whole time we were playing murder happiness flooded over her oh so steves at last admitted that he was with me why on earth did he say he was with angora he was with angora said lazlo in a level voice for heavens sake said bella crossly i know i was with him you werent you were with me dont be ridiculous i know it was pitch dark but i couldnt mistake steve i recognized him by his aftershave black opal then she gave a gasp of horror oh no it couldnt have been im afraid it was darling said lazlo i was one of the stars of the footlights when i was at cambridge it isnt very difficult to imitate steves american accent im the same height and build as he is our hair is more or less the same length all i had to do was to douse myself in that rather noxious aftershave he uses and er well just leave the rest to nature for a minute bella was speechless then she screamed you bastard you bastard you tricked me into thinking steve was still in love with me and into breaking it off with rupert and whats more i practically let you rape me lazlo laughed and helped himself to another drink i must say i enjoyed that bit id never have dreamt you could be so passionate we must arrange an action replay sometime bella gave a snarl of rage like a maddened animal dirty lousy son of a bitch she shouted youve ruined my life what play did you say that in he said still laughing his amusement snapped her last thread of control gibbering incoherently she jumped to her feet and leapt at him trying to claw his face stop it he said catching her wrists unless you want your eyes blacked i dont have any scruples about hitting women for a moment she glared at him then realizing herself beaten she tore her hands away and slumped on the sofa the door bell rang bella ran out into the hall and opened the door two men with hard inquisitive faces stood outside miss parkinson said one of them congratulations on your release can we ask you a few questions no you cant said lazlo he pulled bella back into the flat mr henriques mr lazlo henriques isnt it said the second man in an oily voice get out said lazlo icily they wilted as he slammed the door in their faces how did you know i didnt want to talk to them bella said furiously you havent got time he glanced at his watch youre due on stage in an hours time dont be stupid theyll have got an understudy they havent i rang roger and told him youd been let out but i cant go on not after whats happened she collapsed on to a chair im exhausted and my hairs dirty dont be so bloody wet lazlo said brutally whatever your faults i thought youd got guts there was a crowd of reporters waiting outside the theatre but lazlo just elbowed them out of the way if bella hadnt loathed him so much she would have been speechless that anyone could swear as fluently as he could in her dressing room rosie hassell was waiting in a petticoat and a fever of excitement bella darling what drama how on earth did you get off so quickly that snake pulled strings bella said pointing at lazlo who was just behind her roger field popped in just before the five minute call bella darling he said thank god you made it how do you feel utterly hellish said bella through chattering teeth ive just been sick all that smoked salmon and brandy sighed lazlo what a tragedy bella ignored him i may be sick again any minute she said to roger itll be your entrails next said lazlo have you got any whisky roger before the performance roger went on stage and told the audience bella had been released and cleared of all charges when she made her first entrance there were a few isolated claps then a storm of applause followed and the audience cheered their heads off bella nearly broke down at the end of the play she received the biggest ovation of her career but she felt like a husk completely exhausted very near to tears in a dream she received congratulations from the rest of the cast and had just finished changing when lazlo walked into her dressingroom cant you knock she said crossly dont be silly he said taking her arm come on we cant fend off the press any longer im going home by myself she said snatching her arm away and running down the stairs she tugged open the stage door immediately she was blinded by a volley of flash bulbs and the whirring of television cameras there she is shouted a hundred voices oh no she yelped in horror and retreated slamming the door in the end it was the same rat race as before lazlo protecting her with his arms and roger field fending off the crowd somehow lazlo got her into his car and again almost before she could draw breath they seemed to be out on the m steaming towards oxford where are we off to now she asked listlessly to stay with some friends of mine in the country i dont want to stay with any of your bloody friends not if theyre anything like you theyre not said lazlo calmly shes a singer he writes youll like them i havent anything to wear you wont need anything cassll lend you a bikini he turned on the wireless and the hot summer night was suddenly flooded with mozart bella listened to those lovely liquid notes pouring forth like a nightingale and suddenly the terrible realization that steve didnt love her any more swept over her unable to stop herself she broke into a storm of weeping lazlo took absolutely no notice and let her cry finally when she reached the gulping stage he said theres a hipflask in the dashboard help yourself no thank you heartless beast she thought furiously he tricked me he pretended to be steve if chrissie hadnt started screaming hed have certainly gone the whole hog and screwed me a hot wave of shame swept over her at the thought of how much shed enjoyed it at the time they had turned off the motorway into deep country now cow parsley brushed against the moving car a huge moon was gliding in and out of transparent wisps of cloud finally lazlo drew up near a big rambling house covered in wistaria almost at once a woman came running out darlings she shouted you have made good time how lovely to see you this is bella said lazlo shes brought nothing with her so youll have to lend her everything ill just put the car away the woman hugged bella my names cass she said lazlo tells me youve been having the most awful time i do hate the press when their bloods up they went into a huge untidy room with crumbs all over the floor bowls of drooping flowers and two grand pianos covered with books and music a man with spectacles on top of his head put down his book and came forward to welcome bella i escaped up to london for your first night you were superb come and sit down and ill get you a drink cass plonked herself on the sofa opposite bella and stretched out fat legs burnt red by the sun grenvilles been in love with you for years ever since he saw you on television once grenville blushed i suppose we havent got any ice darling none at all said cass cheerfully the fridge is so frozen up i cant get the ice tray back in when he had gone out she said i didnt know the setup so ive put you and lazlo in different rooms but hes in a huge double bed so you can always join him oh no said bella horrified into dropping her guard id rather sleep with a cobra than lazlo how are the children said lazlo walking into the room his arms full of bottles of drink bella went scarlet how much had he heard of her last remark the children are away this weekend thank god said cass i do love them but its bliss when theyre away theyre boys she added to bella ten eight and seven ive brought them some gin said lazlo i know they like it cass laughed what are you doing after othello she said to bella the seagull we start rehearsing on monday for the first time in days she felt at home so much so that half an hour later she wasnt too shy to ask if she might go up to bed chapter fourteen she slept until lunchtime then got up bathed and washed her hair to her annoyance the orange rinse still wouldnt come out and her hair had gone impossibly fluffy like candy floss she found lazlo in the garden his feet up on a table reading the racing news drinking champagne and tearing a chicken apart he was wearing only a pair of dirty white trousers and his swarthy skin was already turning brown where are the others she said working have some chicken no thank you im not hungry it was a lie she was starving he poured her out a glass of champagne and said i do hope youre not going to be boring and sulk the whole weekend im about to ring my bookmaker i fancy bengal freedom safety pin and happy harry shall i put a fiver on each of them for you bella picked up the paper and scanned it no she said coldly i prefer merry peasant early days and campbells pride in the four oclock they havent got a dogs chance said lazlo still if you want to waste your money after hed gone inside she skimmed the rest of the paper on the front page was a picture of her and lazlo leaving the theatre who stole the diamond screamed the banner headline henriques mystery thickens as bella declared innocent with a beating heart she read the rest of the story but there was nothing mentioned about her past thank god her public image was still intact ive backed your horses for you said lazlo returning with another bottle of champagne she put down the paper and pointedly picked up her book trying to concentrate lazlo looked at the jacket its junk he said how far have you got page two hundred and fifty snapped bella oh yes thats the bit just before page two hundred and fiftyone said lazlo bella ignored him she later had the indignity of watching the three horses lazlo had backed romping home several lengths clear in three successive races her horses werent even placed you owe me fifteen pounds said lazlo i shant press you for payment not trusting herself to speak bella went off for a walk even the bosky greenness everywhere couldnt cure her bad temper by the time she reached the village shop however hunger overcame her and she bought two huge cream buns she was just wandering back to the house stuffing her face with one of them when a dark green mercedes glided down the road towards her choking with rage she turned her bulging cheeks towards the hedgerow so glad youve recovered your appetite said lazlo in amusement cass cooked a marvellous dinner and afterwards bella offered to wash up lazlo said hed help her but at exactly ten oclock after hed given her back a third plate to wash because it still had mustard on the bottom something snapped inside her picking up the remains of the duck she hurled it at lazlo missing him of course then she selected a very ripe peach and chucked it against the wall then she kicked over casss music stand lazlo started to laugh tell me bella what are you going to do when you grow up stop sending me up she screamed then she started breaking plates that had lazlo worried pack it in he snapped then when she wouldnt he slapped her extremely hard across the face for a minute she glared at him her eyes watering from the pain she gave a sob and fled upstairs in her bedroom her rage evaporated feeling bitterly ashamed of herself she undressed and got into bed she lay still listening to approaching thunder her eyelids feeling as though theyd been pinned back from her eyes she heard cass and grenville come to bed laughing fondly at last she drifted into an uneasy sleep it was the most terrifying dream shed ever had she was suffocating drowning unable to escape then she started screaming suddenly the room was flooded with light lazlo was standing in the doorway the next moment hed crossed the room and taken her in his arms its all right baby its all right its only a bad dream she could feel the warmth from his body his fingers beneath her shoulder blades what did it matter now that he was the person she loathed most in the world he was at least a human being i cant take any more she sobbed i get this nightmare over and over again i dream im drowning in blood and i know its my mothers oh god she buried her face in her hands come on talk about it i cant she whispered then suddenly everything came pouring out she wasnt really talking to lazlo but to herself ive always lied about my past she said in a choked voice i was so ashamed of it my mother was very respectable the daughter of a christian science minister but she fell in love with my father he was divine but as bent as a corkscrew my mother didnt realize hed been in prison four times for larceny even before she married him for a bit he tried to go straight but he kept getting sacked from different jobs then i was born there was no money and my mother was forced to go out to work go on said lazlo she worked as a char in other peoples houses but money finally got so short my father stole the church funds my mother found the money under the floorboards and she went straight to the minister her father and told him that night they confronted my father and said they were going to the police can you imagine it grassing on your own family my father made a bolt for it there was a fight my grandfather fell and hit his head on the fender and later he died in hospital my father got life imprisonment for murder my mother never visited him he died in prison ten years later from tb she paused and the faded mirror at the end of the room glinted gold with a strange roseyellow flash a violent crack of thunder split the air rain exploded from the sky it was during the court case that my mother discovered my father was already married and i was ilil she gagged over the word illegitimate said lazlo bella nodded my mother never smiled again she moved to another part of yorkshire a little town called nalesworth where noone knew her she went on working as a daily and saved enough money to send me to a good school but i hated it all the other girls laughed at my ugly clothes and my thick accent my mother was continually terrified i was going to take after my father i look like him you see she used to beat me and lock me for hours in a darkened room while she sallied forth to church meetings i grew to hate her bellas voice was so quiet now against the hiss of the rain that lazlo could hardly hear it i used to dream and dream of escaping to london and becoming an actress when i was seventeen they discovered she had cancer but being a christian scientist she wouldnt let them give her any drugs she must have been in agony and it made her far more vicious she used to drag her body round the house running her fingers along the furniture to see if id dusted properly we hadnt any money so i had to leave school and take a job in the local drapers shop and then i met steve she paused he was working at one of the local discos he was the most beautiful man id ever seen he seemed to exude hollywood glamour the bright lights and freedom needless to say he seduced me the first time i went out with him in the end my mother found out she ranted and raved but she was too weak to do anything about it one morning i heard two girls gossiping in the shop about steve saying he was seducing half the west riding and running up bills everywhere i went mad i rushed round to his digs and found hed walked out without even saying goodbye to me hed left no address i knew my mother was dying but i spent all day and all night combing the town for him i got home at four oclock in the morning two neighbours were with my mother she was in a coma she never recovered bella was shaking like a leaf now trying to stop herself from crying they all hated me in the town she said they drew their curtains and whispered behind their hands about how evil i was for three days i was alone in the house surrounded by all those damn wreaths of lilies but i couldnt think about anything except steve leaving me i was half crazy with misery it was only after a while that i realized what id done to my mother then the nightmares started what happened then i came south there was a little money left when the house was sold i got a scholarship to rada changed my name to bella parkinson told everyone my father was a librarian my mother a schoolmistress lies i told so often i almost came to believe them she looked down at her hands now you know everything i knew most of it already you did but how did steve tell you a little ive got a good information service bella gave a hollow laugh no wonder you didnt want me to marry rupert the bastard daughter of a murderer hardly debrett is it i didnt care a damn about your background she looked up in surprise lazlo didnt seem appalled or angry or contemptuous or any of the other things shed expected anyone shed ever told the truth to be for once his dark mocking face looked completely serious look he said it doesnt matter what happened before in your life noone minds except you its what you are talented funny he glanced down at her blotched tearstained face and smiled slightly yes even beautiful thats important the henriques have a pretty seamy past if you study it only four centuries back they were raping looting and murdering to get the things they wanted they just did it a few hundred years earlier than your father did besides he wasnt a murderer he just killed someone in a fight like you did said bella like i killed miguel rodriguez said lazlo his face hardening gently he laid her back in bed and got to his feet im going to get you a sleeping pill it was only when he came back that she realized he was still dressed in the black shirt and dirty white trousers hed been wearing all evening why werent you in bed she said i was reading i dont sleep a great deal theres usually something or er someone better to do she suddenly realized she was only wearing a very transparent nightgown and that lazlo had been holding her in his arms and that only two nights ago when hed pretended to be steve hed practically raped her she felt herself going scarlet and slunk down under the sheets im sorry she muttered i shouldnt have bored you with my problems bella he said in amazement youre apologizing to me are you sure youre feeling all right dont tease me she said in a strangled voice im not in the mood he laughed hell being a woman isnt it its just not your century chapter fifteen she felt like a convalescent recovering from a very bad attack of flu the next day she found herself impossibly shy of lazlo hardly able to meet his eyes most of the day she slept in the sun and in the evening she sobbed herself stupid over the king and i on television she also felt quite unnecessarily irritated when angora telephoned lazlo from france where she was filming and he took the telephone into the other room next day hed driven bella back to london to start rehearsals on the seagull and now here she was three days later sulking in the hairdressers because he hadnt even rung her up to see how she was bernard her hairdresser picked up a strand of her hair thats a bit of a mistake duckie he said the pink rinse had turned green in the sun ill say said bella crossly ive decided to go back to my natural colour bernard looked appalled but what on earth is it a sort of dark mouse not unattractive but darling youre crazy youve been blonde for years noonell recognize you itll ruin your image ive got to play a very mousey girl in my next play alas no woman is a dedicated artist to her hairdresser bernard grinned slyly dont give me that dearie youve met some nice straight bloke who you think doesnt like dyed hair nonsense said bella crossly but she blushed crimson the weather grew even hotter she had to rehearse all afternoon it was impossibly stuffy in the theatre she was just getting her teeth into her part when something happened to wreck her concentration five minutes later she was back in her dressing room what on earths the matter said rosie hassell in alarm it was going so well its johnnie stormed bella glaring at the handsome blond boy who played konstantin who was leaning against her dressing table didnt you see him sneaking on to the stage and letting loose that toad he knows im terrified of toads johnnie started to laugh bella angel the scene is played beside a lake it should be absolutely crawling with frogs and toads and things i was only trying to inject a little realism into the act you were not shouted bella you were trying to put the fear of god into me oh well johnnie shrugged his shoulders if youre going to be stuffy i am i bloody am roger field stood in the doorway frowning two of his leading players hurling abuse at each other cannot have been the most edifying sight but bella was past caring ill report you to equity and get you kicked out she screamed at johnnie thats enough bella said roger the whole theatre can hear you i dont care bella shouted do you know what he did he put this toad all right pack it in johnnie take that toad back to the thames or wherever you found it ill talk to you later grinning broadly johnnie slouched out of the room ill kill you kill you kill you bella screamed after him stop bawling like a fishwife said roger theres someone to see you i dont want to see anyone snapped bella i want you to stop that horrible boy putting toads in my her voice trailed off for in the doorway stood lazlo ill leave her to you said roger i hope you make a better job of calming her down than i did bella was speechless for a minute then she said what are you doing here watching your rehearsal said lazlo i was going to tell you how good you were but im not sure if you deserve it im glad you get abusive with other people besides me he said its not funny bella slumped down in her chair and gazed at herself in the mirror mousey hair scraped back in an elastic band shiny face without a scrap of makeup shirt soaking with sweat splitting jeans oh damn damn damn shed meant to be so silken and beautiful next time she met him what do you want she said ungraciously i was going to ask you out to dinner but i wont if youre going to be so ratty oh well she blushed and shuffled her feet ive got two arabs to entertain im meeting them at eight can you be ready in a quarter of an hour but i havent got anything to wear bella wailed lazlo got to his feet youd better borrow something he said im going to talk business with roger by the way he added as he went out of the door i like the hair its a distinct improvement the arabs were jolly and fat and ate all bellas potatoes and steak at dinner she had borrowed a pair of shorts and an orange tshirt from rosie which was much too tight across the bust her suntan was beginning to fade she kept wishing she could think of witty things to say the arabs wanted to make a night of it and kept muttering about strip clubs but lazlo managed to extricate himself and bella about midnight they didnt speak as he drove across london they stopped at a traffic light please make it stay red for ever she prayed she held her breath when they came to hyde park but he turned left she was appalled by the joy that flooded over her as she realized he was taking her back to his flat instead of hers as lazlo poured out drinks for them both she studied him carefully examining the thick black hair curling over his collar the broad shoulders in the immaculate white suit the sunburnt hands shooting soda into the glasses and suddenly she felt quite giddy with lust whats happening to me she thought in horror five days ago i was madly in love with steve and now all i can do is long and long and long to be in bed with lazlo as he handed her a drink their hands touched jumping as though hed burnt her she seized the glass and bolted over to the window its all right for him she thought in panic riverboat gambler with the morals of an alley cat and a million light years of sexual experience under his belt all he has to do is throw a little soft soap around and hell have me eating out of his hand lazlo took off his jacket and hung it on the back of a chair youre very quiet he said whats eating you bella took a deep breath i know youre only being nice to me she blurted out because you want me to fall for you just to make sure i wont go back to rupert lazlo sighed thats a very silly childish remark i did hope youd given up making remarks like that bella looked mutinous there was a pause then she stammered all right im sorry i was being ungracious he smiled good girl to apologize come over here no said bella in a strangled voice i cant do it i cant be another of your onenightstands just to amuse you for tonight because you cant sleep my dear child what are you on about the telephone rang lazlo took no notice hadnt you better answer it bella said shakily all right he picked up the receiver not taking his eyes off her face hullo yes aunt constance what an unexpected pleasure he grinned at bella and raised his eyes to heaven suddenly the smile was wiped off his face whats that he snarled when did this happen why wasnt i told before have you told the police all right ill come straight over the scar down the side of his face was like a livid gash as he put down the receiver his eyes were blazing with rage whats the matter said bella chrissie shes been kidnapped they want two million pounds ransom chapter sixteen lazlo stormed the great dark green mercedes through the deserted london streets shooting traffic lights squealing the wheels round corners bella sat frozen with horror beside him but how on earth did it happen she whispered chrissie went out to post a letter at half past six and didnt come back said lazlo aunt constance and uncle charles were out and the first anyone realized shed disappeared was when steve turned up at nine to take her to some party and she wasnt there steve was taking her out bella said sharply lazlo shot her a sidelong glance now angoras gone to france he said steve seems to have transferred his rather liberal affections to chrissie bella flushed what happened then the kidnappers telephoned at eleventhirty saying theyd got chrissie and theyd release her unhurt as long as we paid up two million pounds and didnt call the police outwardly he was perfectly calm now the harsh swarthy face betrayed no emotion but a muscle quivered in his cheek and his hand shook badly as he lit a cigarette if only i were angora thought bella miserably id fling my arms round him and find all the right things to say to comfort him she was further thrown by the fact that when they reached the henriques house the door was answered by rupert he had obviously just got off the plane from zurich his luggage littered the hall thank god youve arrived he said to lazlo poor darling little chrissie what the hell are we going to do about her everyones being absolutely useless my mothers having hysterics at the thought of parting with two million pounds my fathers shipped enough liquor to float the qe and that snake steve is suddenly he seemed to notice bella and pulled himself together oh hullo he said perfunctorily in the drawingroom they found charles standing in front of the fire with glazed eyes and steve on the sofa drinking brandy and managing to look completely at home and the picture of concern at the same time constance massive in maroon satin strode down the room towards them where on earth have you been lazlo out on the tiles as usual i suppose she added sourly then she glared at bella and whats she doing here you must talk some sense into rupert and charles they wont call the police quite right said lazlo the fewer people who know about this the better he turned to charles wed better work out the fastest way to get the cash together constance looked appalled but we cant raise that amount we shall be ruined i have enough trouble making ends meet as it is why dont you let the police sort it out if you call the police said lazlo brutally youll only panic the kidnappers into bumping chrissie off dont use those awful words said constance that child was like a daughter to me oh gawd said rupert rudely dont be such a hypocrite you treated chrissie like a slave she never stopped running errands for you constance compressed her lips it was chrissies fault in a way she said to steve i always told her if she went out without a hat shed get picked up by undesirable types those men were lying in wait for her said rupert through clenched teeth dont be so bloody stupid constance turned purple how dare you speak to me like that she said ive had enough to cope with all the strain of gays wedding and then you getting engaged to that terrible then she remembered that bella was in the room and just stopped herself in time but before anyone could feel embarrassed she launched into a further hysterical tirade against rupert lazlo looked at her reflectively and then said in a surprisingly gentle voice this must be a terrible strain for you aunt constance you must be exhausted i dont expect youve had any dinner either why dont you go to bed and well get someone to bring you something on a tray how could you expect me to eat at a time like this said constance but she looked mollified perhaps i should keep my strength up i suppose i could just manage a chicken sandwich steve got to his feet and gave constance one of his devastating smiles ill go and have a word in the kitchen he said youre such a comfort to me steve constance could be heard saying as she went up the stairs lazlo rupert and charles immediately settled down to discuss raising the money but charles was obviously having difficulty concentrating i think ill hit the hay too he said tottering towards the door thank you for coping so admirably with constance lazlo as charles left the room steve came back half a capon and a vat of french fries are on their way upstairs to constance that should keep her quiet he said to lazlo i cant tell you how appalled i am about chrissie ive only known her a fortnight but its long enough to realize what a great kid she is you didnt realize anything of the kind snapped rupert you were just after her bread shut up rupe said lazlo and went back to talking about money bella studied steve surreptitiously and wondered how she could ever have loved him to such distraction everything about him revolted her now hes just a handsome hunk of nothing she thought then she turned to rupert sitting in the window seat with his head in his hands completely gone to pieces then she looked at lazlo that muscle was still pounding in his cheek and she suddenly realized the titanic dependability and strength of the man and how much it must be costing him in sheer teethgritting selfcontrol not to give way to sniping and panic like the others as unexpected as an extra step at the bottom of a flight of stairs it came upon her it was lazlo she was in love with at that moment he looked at her youre tired he said i ought to go she muttered terrified that he might read what was in her mind ill drive you home said steve rupertll take her said lazlo i want to pick your brains about raising cash in buenos aires steve bella didnt speak on the way home desperately trying to control the raging emotions inside her but when they reached the flat she asked rupert if he wanted to come up for a drink he shook his head i must get back oh hell bella what am i going to do i took chrissie so much for granted treating her like a tiresome kid sister and now suddenly shes gone you realize youre in love with her he looked up his face haggard yes i am i thought i was going to shoot myself last week because you wouldnt marry me but now chrissies in such terrible danger i know its her i love and i dont suppose ill ever see her again bella put her arms round him there there its going to be all right lazloll find her for you oh hell get her back if anyone can said rupert with all his mates in the underworld he can pull strings like nobodys business but ive got a horrible feeling this isnt a straightforward money kidnapping that its all got something to do with miguel rodriguez bellas heart missed a beat the man lazlo killed rupert nodded miguels brother juan has been trying to pay lazlo back ever since what was the real story behind it miguel and juan rodriguez ran a vice ring in south america they had buenos aires so completely sewn up the police were terrified of them miguel had a much younger wife called maria whom he treated like dirt she and lazlo fell in love and had a raging affair miguel found out and pulled a knife on lazlo in a bar there was a fight miguel was killed the next day although noone could pin it on him juan had acid thrown in marias face her beauty was ruined she couldnt bear lazlo to see her like that a few days later she committed suicide the police were too scared of juan to do anything about it but lazlo and he have been stalking each other like a pair of tigers ever since i think its juans boys who have nicked chrissie and if they have theyll never let her go alive however much we fork out thats whats crucifying lazlo was she very beautiful miguels wife said bella trying to sound casual maria oh absolutely ravishing i dont think lazlos ever really got over her committing suicide after shed let herself into her flat bella sat for hours lacerated with jealousy at the thought of maria rodriguez chapter seventeen two days dragged by with no news of chrissie bella tried to throw herself into rehearsals but she could think of nothing but lazlo and the hell he must be going through she also tried not to feel disappointed when he didnt telephone her he must have far too much on his mind on the evening of the third day she came out of the theatre absolutely dead beat she had rehearsed all day followed by a gruelling performance of othello in the evening the audience had been as unreceptive as blotting paper particularly a coach load from the mothers union in the stalls who had talked and laughed through the last act it was a dark hot sultry night with no stars and a suggestion of thunder she was wearing only a skimpy red and white spotted dress the smell of frying garlic and onions from a nearby italian restaurant made her feel slightly sick she decided to walk part of the way home she passed a telephone box and resisted the temptation to go inside and ring lazlo to find out if he had any news of chrissie she would be too tonguetied to do it properly you must stop thinking about him she told herself angrily she turned right into a road only dimly lit by a few street lamps suddenly she saw a cigarette glow in the dark and a figure stepped towards her she jumped nervously as a voice whispered bella then she saw a gleam of silver blond hair and her nervousness turned to irritation it was steve what the hell are you doing here she snapped i must talk to you well i dont want to talk to you ive got nothing to say to you nothing honey he said urgently for petes sake listen im on the level ive found out where chrissie is bella turned towards him with a gasp are you sure is she ok i dont know theyre holding her in some deserted warehouse in the east end it sounds like a pretty amateur job to me one of the gang got cold feet and grassed to a mate of mine have you told lazlo i cant get hold of him he went to the races this afternoon and hasnt been seen since well what are we waiting for said bella not stopping to think im parked over there said steve pointing to a car under the trees bella ran towards it come on we mustnt waste any time her only thought was how pleased lazlo would be if they found chrissie steve opened the front door for her and she was just bending forward to get in when a voice in the back said in a thick foreign accent dont try anything silly weve got you covered and she saw the gleam of a pistol butt giving a scream she backed out again against steve but he shoved her violently into the car the next moment something hard and metallic hit her on the head and simultaneously it seemed someone reached in front of her suffocating her with a sweetsmelling cloth she had the feeling she was falling forward crashing her head on the dashboard of the car as she went next moment all was blackness she had no idea how long she was unconscious when she came to there was an excruciating pain pounding through her head and she realized she was in a moving car there was thick cloth tied over her eyes ropes were biting into her wrists and ankles and she could feel the back of her head bleeding still the blood dripping onto the back of her neck she groaned and retched steve im going to be sick noone said anything but the car slowed down she was lifted out like a sack of potatoes and someone held her head while she retched and retched sobbing with pain humiliation and terror let me go please let me go im innocent i havent done anything next moment someone was forcing her mouth open she struggled frenziedly as they poured liquid down her throat they were trying to poison her then she realized it was only brandy her throat was burning she thought she was going to throw up again they gave her another slug she began to feel a bit better hastily she was bundled back in the car still noone spoke to her and they set off again lulled by the brandy she decided not to ask any questions why provoke them they must have driven about four hours after that she kept worrying about the matinée next day and how there was no way she was going to make it and how the understudy would probably be much better than her then she thought of lazlo and what he would think if he knew shed been kidnapped probably wouldnt care anyway but why should they snatch her perhaps if they still thought rupert was crazy about her she might pull in a bigger ransom but steve had been there the other night it must have been quite obvious that rupert was only crazy about chrissie now and wasnt in love with her any more her mind reeled in turmoil shed never trusted steve but in all her dealings with him shed never dreamed he was a gangster perhaps tied up with a coldblooded murderer like juan rodriguez if it hadnt been for her he would never have been able to meet the henriques family and ingratiate himself into their good books and make off with chrissie so easily she was sure now he was behind chrissies kidnapping as well then with a shiver she remembered rupert saying that if juans boys nicked chrissie theyd never let her out alive perhaps shed get acid thrown in her face like maria rodriguez the anaesthetizing effect of the brandy was wearing off the pain in her head was excruciating panic took over oh lazlo help me help me she whimpered someone kicked her viciously in the ankle shut your bloody mouth said the same thick foreign accent rough with fear and anxiety she could feel the tension in the car someone was beside her in the back perhaps two in the front she could tell they were really scared there was a sickly sweet goat smell of sweat and over and over again she heard matches flare as cigarettes were chainsmoked being blindfold her whole nervous system picked up things quicker she had realized it must be nearly morning when someone turned on the wireless it was the six oclock news she waited breathlessly mrs thatcher had taken mr wilson to task during a late night sitting in the house australia had devalued the dollar a leopard had escaped from the zoo a royal princess had announced her engagement the weather would be hot and sunny although thundery showers were expected towards evening bella slumped back in her seat in despair noone would ever find her they were driving fast now presumably to reach their destination before too many people were about storming along straight roads squealing round corners it was getting hotter she was desperate to go to the loo finally the car stopped and they took her out she felt a warm breeze on her arms and legs and a distant smell of salt and the sound of the waves pounding suddenly she was panicking that they were high up near the sea and they were going to push her over a cliff she was shaking uncontrollably she started to cry again quickly someone put a hand over her mouth keep quiet snarled a voice and she felt something cold and metallic jabbed in her back then they sat down on the grass and took the ropes off her ankles so she could walk they must have moved her then a couple of miles she felt people round her all the time moving walking and whispering she could hear cows mooing birds singing and the hum of cars in the distance now her feet were on gravel crunching up a path she could feel the relief of those around her a lightening of tension she was stumbling over the threshold a door slammed a lock clicked there was a smell of musty unwashed house that took her straight back to her childhood in the slums she felt the sweat pouring off her next moment someone ran downstairs and taking her arm dragged her upstairs and pushed her into a room someone undid her hands she felt her blindfold it seemed to be held down with masking tape the next moment someone had ripped it off catching some of her hair her head was so tender she screamed dont hurt her said the voice with the thick foreign accent she blinked in the half light two men stood in front of her both were masked but she realized neither was steve one was very stocky with black hair a black beard sticking out from under his mask and massive shoulders the other was taller and slimmer with thinning dark hair listen baby he said he also had a spanish accent but less strong than the other one youre going to be here a long time dont do anything silly if you want anything well try and get it for you i must go to the loo said bella desperately the taller one laughed theres a bucket in the corner she was flaming well going to wait till theyd gone wheres steve she said is he here the taller one shook his head and showed her his gun i repeat dont try anything silly like escaping there are five of us here guarding you suddenly bella was terrified theyd taken off her blindfold because she knew if one of them forgot their masks or if it slipped off theyd have to kill her they left her after that and she had time to examine the room it was very small about ten feet by ten feet and lit by a twenty watt bulb a heavy wooden shutter was nailed over the window the wallpaper was stained dirty brown and thick dusty cobwebs hung from the smokegrimed ceiling the only furniture was a broken chair and the bucket in the corner she tried the bars on the window but they were firmly nailed down there were no weaknesses in the walls anyway shed bitten her nails so far down in the last few days theyd be no good for burrowing a hole a few minutes later another man came into the room to clean up the wound on the back of her head he had long blondish hair was very thin and had a quiet soft voice with the same accent as the other two she found herself ridiculously grateful for the gentle way he handled her warning her that the antiseptic was going to sting she sensed he felt sorry for her she noticed that he wore trousers that were too short rather flashy yellow socks on his thin ankles and illfitting basketweave shoes afterwards she lay down and tried to make herself as comfortable as possible outside she could hear them speaking to one another in spanish they must be juans boys sometime in the afternoon the thin blond boy brought her in a cup of tea and baked beans on a piece of bread on a greasy tin plate starving she wolfed the lot then two minutes later threw it all up only just reaching the bucket in time her head seemed to be splitting open clutching it she crouched on the floor sobbing she must get out she was going mad then she remembered reading somewhere that if you could survive the first fortyeight hours of a kidnapping you could survive anything she must get a grip on herself our father which art in heaven she began she noticed they hadnt risked giving her a knife and fork with her food she examined her face in the spoon her eyes were huge her face pale and streaked with blood she decided to try and recite the whole of othello anything to keep her sane but as she got to the third act as othellos jealousy is slowly awakened by iago her mind kept straying to lazlo reliving the moments theyd spent together the fights theyd had the weekend in the country when hed held her in his arms after the nightmare what was it hed said that she was funny talented and beautiful she looked at her reflection in the spoon again he wouldnt think she was beautiful now she felt a black churning hatred against steve at last out of sheer exhaustion she fell into an uneasy sleep chapter eighteen she was woken by crunching on the gravel outside light was no longer filtering through a crack in the shutters she heard three knocks then the front door being opened quickly and quietly and then shut again then whispered voices and a slight laugh and someone coming up the stairs past her door she still felt sick but the pain in her head was receding a bit she struggled to her feet feeling stiff and dizzy her mouth tasted awful she could feel a film of dirt when she ran her tongue over her teeth no colgate ring of confidence for you she thought licking her fingers and trying to rub away the bloodstains on her cheeks logic told her that if the kidnappers liked her and thought she was pretty they would be less likely to do her in she wondered who the latest arrival was but she didnt have long to wait next minute the door opened and two men in masks came in carrying guns one was the stocky bearded one the other whom she hadnt seen before was taller wearing very tight trousers over slightly overweight hips and a dark blue shirt he had a very large torso she could see patches of hairy chest between each button come on beauty he said tying her hands up in an oily lisping voice that made bella shiver its time for a little chat they led her down the passage to a brightly lit room in it were several chairs and a table covered with bottles glasses and tins of food a man lounged on an old sofa he was also masked but bella noticed he was wearing an expensive if slightly too flashy blue suit expensive gold cufflinks and watch a pale blue silk shirt and he smelt strongly of aftershave hi bella baby he said whatll you drink he had a nice voice deep slow and soft with slight american overtones well have her hands untied too carlos he said to the stocky bearded gunman we dont want you to be any more uncomfortable than you need and i guess we can trust you not to do anything silly why do they keep saying that thought bella irrationally lazlo would say she was always doing silly things carlos undid the rope with a bread knife it had left purple marks on her wrists the man on the sofa got up and rubbed them gently you really shouldnt have tied them so tight he said reproachfully bella was frightened by this soft approach she could feel the sweat running down her sides youd like a drink he said scotch bella nodded im afraid we dont run to ice he poured her a large whisky and put the glass on a chair beside her she glanced round the two guards leant against the door behind her fingering their guns she picked up her glass but her hand was shaking so much she could hardly get it to her mouth youre frightened said the man in the blue suit what are you afraid of your mob havent behaved with much gentleness so far youre afraid we might spoil your beauty forget it he picked up the bread knife and started to cut the end off a cigar she noticed he had beautifully manicured hands the nails slightly too long why have you brought me here she blurted out its tied up with chrissie isnt it sure it is is she ok shes just fine not bearing up under the strain as well as she might but shes been cooped up longer than you have and i guess shes led a much more cushy life than you not used to roughing it not a great fan of yours is she bella flushed its no business of yours cant say i blame her you took her boyfriend off her didnt you i didnt said bella nettled taking another slug of whisky he came of his own accord i dont blame him he said getting up from his chair and running his hand down her face youre very lovely he added softly as bella flinched away and im not surprised el gattos got the hots for you as well hes been trying to cut rupert out hasnt he bella looked bewildered then suddenly realized they meant lazlo no she said in a strangled voice its not true her early warning system wasnt working very well but it seemed vital to convince him there was nothing between her and lazlo or shed never get out alive is he going to be able to raise the dough of course he will but it takes time in the present economic climate sure said the man in the blue suit but hes got steel nerves lazlo bella went on he wont hand over a penny till he has assurances chrissies safe and going to be handed back well to help him get his finger out wed like you to make a little tape tomorrow telling him how much youre missing him and how miserable you are bella went white no she said in a strangled voice i couldnt do that i would if i were you youll find us very easy going as long as you agree to play ball can i see chrissie is she here too sure why not shes in here he opened a door on the right and filled up her glass take your drink with you bellas first thought was how beautiful chrissie had grown she must have lost pounds the black dress shed been kidnapped in hung off her her dark hair looked even darker because it was greasy and her eyes were huge in her dead white face when she saw bella she shrank away go away she screamed i dont want her near me i hate her i hate her she collapsed on to the bed sobbing hysterically the door closed behind bella a key clicked in the lock she bent over chrissie close to tears herself please dont cry its going to be all right lazlos going to raise the cash hes not hes not why hasnt he raised it before then everyones deserted me and now they bring you in here to torture me bella knelt down beside her here have some whisky i dont want any of their horrible booze said chrissie clenching her fists in a sudden spasm of misery i havent eaten anything since ive been here trust you to suck up to them and accept their beastly drink and swinging round towards bella she knocked the glass out of her hand so whisky spilled all over the floor and bellas dress i hate you hate you she sobbed steve was your crooked friend if you hadnt introduced him to us this never would have happened i wouldnt put it past you to be in this together im not anything to do with it said bella trying to be patient i was as appalled as you to find that steve was mixed up in it then why have they grabbed you as well said chrissie i suppose they think rupert would be more likely to persuade lazlo to fork out two million pounds for you than he would be for me and she started to sob again look please listen bella said its all over between rupert and me chrissie looked at her sullenly you may have broken it off because you got bored with him but hes still nuts about you hes not i promise he flew back from zurich the night you were kidnapped ive never seen anyone in such a state lazlo and i went round to chichester terrace the moment we heard the news lazlo started planning how to raise the cash constance was being her usual unspeakable self and charles was too tight to be any use but rupert had gone completely to pieces he absolutely tore a strip off constance when she grumbled about raising so much money i dont believe you said chrissie dully afterwards rupert drove me home only because lazlo told him to she added hastily he said hed always taken you for granted because youd always been there a kind of kid sister ready to adore him but now you were in danger he realized it was you he loved all the time he was absolutely demented with worry youre just saying it im not i promise chrissie started to cry then like a child with a bedtime story she said could you possibly tell me what youve just told me all over again later bella said how the hell are we going to get out of here i dont think we can said chrissie theyre all armed to the teeth they scare the life out of me there was a blond one who was kind to me when he cleaned up the wound on my head said bella thats diego said chrissie hes all right but theres a spooky one called pablo who hasnt said a word the whole time hes got a finger missing on his right hand and the really horrible one is ricardo hes the one whos bursting out of his shirts whenever he ties me up at night he touches me far more than necessary im sure hes going to try something soon they all seem so jumpy and frustrated i say do you really think rupert loves me chapter nineteen three days passed with unbearable slowness they listened to every news bulletin but there was no mention of the kidnapping even bella began to feel everyone had abandoned them one of her greatest worries was stopping chrissie from cracking up under the strain but in fact it gave her something to do fussing over the younger girl seeing she ate something keeping her cheerful they talked incessantly chrissie babbling on about her childhood in south america and about rupert and inevitably about lazlo bella trying desperately not to appear too interested whenever his name was mentioned now that chrissie had lost so much weight and her face had thinned down she reminded bella of him so poignantly they had the same cheekbones the same impassivity the same smile that would light up a blackedout city when suddenly they were amused on the second morning the gunmen took bella into the livingroom and made her record a ridiculous tape to be sent to lazlo and the family begging them to raise the money as soon as possible and not to contact the police she had to read it over and over again until they were satisfied with the stress and the timing and at the end say i love you said ricardo i wont said bella ricardo held the gun to her temple i would if i were you i love you very much whispered bella that should get el gatto to pull his finger out said ricardo chrissie whod just been brought in to make her tape overheard bellas last remark what the hells going on she hissed to bella as soon as they were locked up together again youve been pulling a fast one all the time why did you say you loved rupert just now you are still after him bella found herself blushing im not the gunmen have got completely the wrong end of the stick for some reason theyre convinced lazlo and i are mad about each other chrissies mouth opened and shut and then she started to laugh incredulously you and lazlo god they must be thick if they only knew how much you loathe each other bella didnt wince she was making great strides in selfcontrol but she found it very difficult not to react during the next day when chrissie kept saying you and lazlo and going off into fits of laughter chrissie now she had bella to protect her slept a great deal she had so many shocks in the last week to recover from this left bella plenty of time to observe her captors the smooth man in the light blue suit had left he was probably bella decided some henchman fairly high up in the rodriquez empire five others remained ricardo the thug with the bulging muscles and the soft oily voice diego the tall blond one with the gentle hands and voice carlos stocky and dark with a beard the very thin young boy pablo with the missing finger who never said anything and finally eduardo the tall dark one with the air of authority who seemed to be in charge of the operation all of them except pablo wore wedding rings there were always two of them on guard one at the bottom of the stairs by the front door one outside bella and chrissies door at night a guard stayed in their room with a gun ready across his knee ricardo was the most unpleasant for long periods hed be quiet then suddenly get explosive and violently argumentative nor did she like the way he stared hungrily at chrissie diego on the other hand was very kind to them one day when she was crying he got out a handkerchief and wiped her eyes and often when she got aches and pains from sleeping on the floor he would rub her back for her what really frightened her was the pity she frequently detected in his voice he knows were going to be killed she thought in terror physically she felt she was falling to pieces her red and white dress was filthy so was she she imagined her skin getting covered in blackheads her eyebrows growing like bushes from not being plucked her teeth rotting because she couldnt clean them the stench in the room was terrible she dreamed obsessively of lazlos ivy green bathroom and soaking in hot scented water on the fourth night the gunmen started quarrelling amongst themselves they had been drinking and she could hear them shouting in the room next door she wished she could understand what they were saying chrissie could understand spanish but she was asleep at midnight ricardo took over the watch from diego he reeked of brandy fumes and stumbled over a loose floorboard bella pretended to be asleep the shouting died down in the next room and soon all was deathly quiet bella opened half an eye in the half light the gun gleamed across ricardos knee chrissie turned over and moaned in her sleep her black hair flopped over her face the top button of her black dress was undone showing the marble whiteness of her breasts ricardos breathing became heavier as suddenly he got up stepped over bella and went towards the bed through halfshut eyes she saw him gazing down at chrissies full voluptuous body then very slowly he put his hand out and began to stroke her face chrissie moved again in her sleep edging towards him like a dog cuddling up to its owner ricardo went on stroking her cheek then his hand moved slowly down her neck and began to undo the buttons of her dress bella was frozen with horror unable to move suddenly chrissie woke up and gave a little gasp of terror at the sight of the masked face next moment ricardos hand clamped over her mouth and then he was on top of her clawing at her dress bella reacted instantly leave her alone she yelled picking up the broken chair and the next moment she cracked it over ricardos head he gave a groan and collapsed on to the floor as chrissie started screaming bella was about to hit him again when the door burst open and in came eduardo carlos and pablo all carrying guns put that chair down snarled eduardo he was trying to rape me sobbed chrissie bella looking at the three gun barrels dropped the chair pablo helped ricardo to his feet the bitch went for me said ricardo blood dripping from his head and the next moment hed turned on bella slapping her viciously across the face back and forth back and forth thats enough said eduardo well teach her a lesson another way he gave instructions in spanish over his shoulder to pablo who went out and came back with some rope with which he tied up both bella and chrissie they sat bella down on a chair she could feel the blood trickling down her cheeks where ricardos ring had cut her then carlos came in with a towel and put it round bellas shoulders suddenly bella remembered terrified how theyd cut off paul gettys ear oh please no she whispered shut up said eduardo lifting up her hair they were all standing behind her no screamed chrissie please dont hurt her for she could see what bella could not that in eduardos hand was a razor blade glinting evilly in the dim light bella jerked her head forward keep still swore eduardo or you really will get hurt she felt her hair being tugged backward and sawed at this way and that oh no she wailed not my hair eduardo ran the razor blade gently down her cheek quiet he said softly or we really will give you something to remember us by they cut her long mane off to a ragged three inches all over her head short as a boys shorter than most boys tugging and sawing till it lay in a heavy mass all over the floor eduardo then told pablo to gather it up well parcel it up and send it to el gatto it might make him get off his arse about raising the dough said eduardo after that they took her next door and stood her up with her hands and feet still tied and her head in a noose of rope hanging from the ceiling dont fall asleep or the rope will snap your head off said ricardo and he went out locking the door bella couldnt stop crying her only irrational thought was that now shed finally lost lazlo she remembered him saying he only liked girls with long hair not that shed ever had him but now with short hair there was no possibility that he could love her for four nights sleep had eluded her now that she had somehow to keep from dropping off she felt overwhelmed with exhaustion she must keep awake she tried to remember all the snatches of poetry she had ever known farewell thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou knowst thy estimate how like a winter hath my absence been from thee how sad and bad and mad it was then but how it was sweet oh heart oh heart if hed but turn his head youd know the folly of being comforted the trouble with every poem was that it turned her thoughts back to lazlo making her relive the moments theyd spent together the last time shed seen him with his back to the fireplace very suntanned in that dark blue shirt with strangely softened face saying come here and her going to him in spite of being frightened and then the telephone interrupting them just before she reached him then she allowed her thoughts to stray into the dangerous fantasy of the telephone not ringing of being in his arms and hearing all the lovely things he was saying his voice husky with passion oh god she thought it wasnt the racehorses or the yachts or the fur coats she wanted from him it was the understanding the kindness beneath the mocking exterior the protectiveness he displayed to his family and people he loved she started to cry again overwhelmed by utter despair why not fall asleep and die no she pulled herself together chrissie had to be looked after theyd got to get out diego took over the watch at four oclock and was obviously appalled by what he saw my god what have those bastards done your beautiful beautiful hair he untied the rope round her neck and feet and hands brushed away the hairs that were itching down her back and gave her a cigarette what happened she shrugged her shoulders ricardo tried to rape chrissie and i went for him with a chair so he had to take his revenge is the kid all right bella nodded physically anyway where are the others sleeping ill make you a cup of tea he went out leaving his gun on a chair bella could have picked it up and used it but she felt too tired and that diego trusting her was her one chance of getting out he came back with hot water and soap and washed her face and hands for her then he brought her a cup of tea and a pear which he cut into quarters and peeled for her bella had never tasted anything so delicious in her life youre so good to me diego she said do i look absolutely hideous like this he shrugged it was prettier long but it will grow soon will i be allowed to live long enough for it to grow dont think about things like that i dont know i am only given orders she took a gulp of the sweet scalding tea it seemed to give her strength why are you caught up in this racket she asked mine is a very poor country the only way to make big money in a hurry is on the wrong side of the law then he told her about his son who was five who had a very rare heart complaint if he doesnt have an operation soon he will die we do not have your health service in my country everything has to be paid for this operation costs a lot of money when this business is all over and el gatto pays up i will have enough to pay for the operation and be able to take my wife and children to live in a new country they will arrange a new passport for us but wont the people who give the orders expect you to do other things for them no only one job thats the deal but cant you understand the kind of people youre dealing with said bella theyll never let you go once they get their teeth into you youll be doing jobs for them for the rest of your life and one day youll slip up and itll be curtains shut up said diego its not true bella played her trump card juan rodriquez is behind this isnt he diego started how do you know lazlo knows it too and hes not stupid it wont be long before he tracks us down and whether were dead or alive youll have a long long spell in jug youre bluffing said diego suddenly very agitated juan rodriguez is hardly the sort of name id make up look i know all about him how powerful and vicious he is hell never let you go after one job and if he bumps off chrissie and me which he intends to doesnt he whether they get the cash or not lazlo will hunt the lot of you down until he gets his revenge with two maneating tigers on your tracks youll never get that peaceful life you want with your wife and child diego got up and began to pace about the room bellas heart was pounding but she tried to keep her voice calm look diego i swear something if you tip lazlo off where we are and itll only take one telephone call hell look after you hell get your wife out of buenos aires and hell see your child gets the best medical treatment in the world and youll be able to live in peace for the rest of your life not as a hunted man youre crazy said diego the fuzzll grab me the minute i get out of here youll do a year at the most particularly as its your first offence but probably lazloll be able to fiddle it so you dont even do that and at least your wife will be safe and your little boy saved diego sat down and picked up his gun and pointed it at her dont you realize the greatest crime among my people is infamita he said sternly to talk to the authorities if i shopped the others juan would make sure i was dead in a week not if you had lazlos protection theyre not worth being loyal to this lot theyre a bunch of cheap crooks youre different diego youre a good person i can tell dont talk to me like that if the others heard you it wouldnt be just your hair theyd chop off snapped diego lie down and get some sleep he took off his coat and laid it over her shoulders i ache all over said bella i cant sleep rub my back and tell me more about your little boy chapter twenty another day and night limped by pablo feeling contrite perhaps over his part in last nights shearing gave her an old copy of womans own to read to bella it was like stumbling on chapmans homer over and over again she read the cosy hints on crocheting and making lampshades and the romantic stories with their happy endings how her mouth watered as she pored over the pictures of lancashire hot pot and cheap ways with end of neck best of all was being able to look at new faces apart from chrissie shed seen nothing but masks for the last five days but at the back of her mind was always the thought that time was running out like high noon do not forsake me oh my darling the following morning pablo was keeping guard in her room smiling to himself as he polished his gun then shouting broke out next door get on guard she could hear eduardo yelling you know there should be two of you i need a drink it was ricardos chillingly oily whine youve had your ration for the day snapped eduardo go back to your post i want a drink theres only half a bottle left well someones got to go out tomorrow and get some more its too dangerous said eduardos voice harsh with exasperation as the day crawled by the atmosphere grew more and more tense quarrels flaring up at the most innocent remarks carlos complained ricardo hadnt put sugar in his tea ricardo hit the roof eduardo nearly got all the soup poured over him when he suggested there wasnt enough salt in it if this inaction goes on much longer thought bella theyll be at each others throats at midnight diego took over the guard at first he was offhand and sullenly refused to talk to her it must be very hot in buenos aires now said bella diego took no notice not much fun for a young mother looking after a sick child she went on i dont want to talk about it exploded diego i was brought up in the slums myself said bella and i know what hell it is and what its like to escape and leave it all behind ending up in a deserted farmhouse with a gun at your head eh said diego that was just bad luck but every child deserves a chance to get away and ones own child most of all oh diego dont you love him of course i do he snarled what do you think i did this for then give him a chance to get better and run in the sunshine and go to a good school and wear nice clothes juanll give me all that rubbish hes just put a noose round your neck which hell tighten if ever you dont play ball and do what he wants lazlo henriques is a good man whatever youve heard to the contrary she went on her voice breaking slightly hes tough but he knows how to look after his own people you love him dont you said diego softly bella nodded a great lump in her throat and ill probably never see him again the tears ran down her cheeks and she was overwhelmed by such despair that it was a few seconds before she realized what diego was saying if i contact el gatto how will he know im on the level bellas heart leapt youre going to do it i dont know come on how will he know ill write him a note no thats too dangerous well have this ring she slid the little gold ring studded with seed pearls off her finger rupert gave it to me lazlo always said it was the only thing hed ever seen me wear that wasnt in appallingly bad taste and use black opal as the password those are both private jokes that noone would know anything about oh diego you wont regret it i promise you just tell him where we are and how to find us i havent made up my mind yet said diego pocketing the ring suddenly there was a great crash from next door theyre quarrelling again probably about you said diego getting up and going out a few minutes later he was back ricardos just knocked over the last of the whisky carlos slugged ricardo tempers are running high then youll have to get some more supplies tomorrow said bella i dont promise anything said diego the next day dawned hotter and more sultry there were flies everywhere the stench grew even more terrible i wonder how nuns survive for years and years without washing thought bella the hair was growing bristly on her legs therell soon be enough scurf in my hair to bread a veal chop she moaned oh god i feel horrible diegos watch was taken over by eduardo who brought the wireless with him at eight came the news she could feel him tensing himself but there was again no mention of the kidnapping everyone had forgotten them so much for lazlos underworld connections when they played pop music she got up and danced a few steps later she listened to waggoners walk it was hard to realize that outside life was going on as usual people were making love going to their offices having toast and marmalade for breakfast for her breakfast she had tea without milk and a stale crust of bread is the service included she said what said eduardo oh forget it said bella they were obviously running out of supplies about midday there was a lot of talking and whispering outside and pablo came in and tied her hands again she was nervous she dreaded changes in routine but they only took her into chrissies room chrissie seemed pathetically pleased to see her but in bad shape how much longer is this going on was her first question im cracking up sssh somethings bound to happen soon ill go mad first why have they put us together again they never do anything nice without an ulterior motive im scared when they start softening up i think theyre going off to get supplies and were easier to guard if were both in the same room someone shouted something in spanish outside chrissie went pale what are they saying said bella they said tell el gatto if the money isnt raised by midnight tonight its curtains that means theyre going to ring lazlo said bella oh god i know were going to be killed said chrissie bella did her best to comfort her but she was really worried by chrissies low morale and by her health her eyes were sunken her cheeks were flushed and in spite of the stultifying heat of the day she was shaking uncontrollably she had also developed a tight rasping cough she got chrissie back on to the subject of rupert letting her ramble on and on finally chrissie said im talking too much talk all you want theres nothing else we can do ive had a hell of a lot of time to think in the past twentyfour hours ive been so vile to you because of rupert we all were but me in particular shouting at you at the wedding then bitching you up over the weekend and finally her voice cracked putting the diamond in your suitcase it doesnt matter said bella if i loved someone id have behaved just the same but youve been so good to me since ive been here youre so strong and brave you say youre ashamed of the kind of background you have but it certainly makes you able to cope with a situation like this standing up to them going for ricardo with that chair i dont really know why youre doing it but i just want to say thank you and that i was quite wrong about you and that i really love you and im sorry ive been so bloody bella turned away so chrissie wouldnt see she was crying ridiculous that when things were so grim chrissie saying those things should make her so happy lazlos got you all wrong said chrissie and when we i mean if we ones so superstitious about presuming anything get out ill tell him how lovely you are she started to cough on and on until eduardo brought her a glass of water youll have to get her something stronger said bella the others are going to bring back cough medicine said eduardo chapter twentyone the waiting was terrible bella read stories from womans own out loud acting out the dialogue camping it up to make chrissie laugh finally chrissie fell into an uneasy sleep it was amazing to bella that her violent spasms of coughing didnt wake her up the two oclock news still had no mention of the kidnapping but as the afternoon passed bella began to sense an increasing restlessness amongst the gunmen just after four oclock there was a swift crunch on the gravel three knocks the front door opening and shutting followed by raised urgent voices chrissie woke up i cant stand it she sobbed i cant bear being cooped up any more hush said bella sharply i want to listen she could recognize carloss thick accent and eduardos deep authoritative voice and ricardos oily whine but she couldnt hear diegos light gentle drawl her palms were soaking she must keep calm the next moment the door was unlocked and in came ricardo and eduardo looking thunderous and dragged her off into the livingroom ricardo seized her and forced her arm behind her back his fingers biting into her flesh youve been talking to diego havent you he said where is he ow youre hurting me said bella joy bubbling up inside her how should i know where he is ive been locked up all the time isnt he here ricardo bent her arm even farther back he liked you he fancied you youve talked him round i have not said bella indignantly its more than my lifes worth to talk to anyone here where is he none of your business snapped eduardo they crossquestioned her endlessly had she talked to diego what was his mood last night several times they gave her stinging slaps across the face but she was too elated to care finally she asked if she could have a cigarette we havent got any said ricardo diegos done a bunk with all the supplies she was thrown back into the room with chrissie dont get too excited and dont ask me any questions she muttered but things are looking up tell me whispered chrissie better if i dont said bella if you dont know they cant beat it out of you outside the door she could hear the panicking getting worse hope grew inside her if only they didnt get frightened into becoming violent she reread that damn womans own over and over again she could crochet that matinée jacket in her sleep now but she had to force herself to do something or shed go nuts hours limped by waiting for a crunch on the gravel that didnt come she listened to every bulletin on the wireless but there was still no reference chrissies cough was getting worse and on bellas nerves she suddenly started panicking that theyd notice her ring was missing there was a suntan band where it had gone could she say it had dropped off because shed got so thin and she couldnt find it back came eduardo and ricardo to crossquestion her what did he talk about last night tell us again nothing much mostly about his son he was worried about his health maybe hes telephoned home and got bad news and made a bolt for it you know something god i wish i did id have hitched a lift if i knew he was going to do a bunk stop fooling about said eduardo were going to start cutting bits off you and send them to el gatto through the post said ricardo evilly chrissie gave a sob he should have got your hair by now said eduardo what shall we send him next he picked up her hand and examined her fingers for a minute bella froze with horror then she realized it wasnt her seed pearl ring hand ricardo was waving a razor making patterns in the air then he ran it down bellas face shall eduardo and i play noughts and crosses he said come on talk snapped eduardo i dont know anything bella muttered cringing away from him talk hissed ricardo suddenly eduardo stiffened listen he said sharply and above the thumping of her heart bella could hear a faint droning like a hoover in a far off room then it grew louder buzzing like an angry wasp coming nearer and nearer a helicopter thought bella thank god it was obviously taking its time buzzing round and round overhead eduardo swore softly both he and ricardo went out to look she could hear their anxious voices outside i think she said to chrissie weve been located pablo came and sat on guard in their room and picked up his book but bella noticed he was reading with unnatural slowness his eyes fixed on the same place occasionally his fingers drummed on the back of the book and he kept darting fearful glances towards the window theyre rattled thought bella joyfully really rattled next door she could hear eduardo gabbling away to ricardo in spanish it was too fast for her what are they saying she asked chrissie theyre arguing about whether to make a bolt for it now or wait until dark said chrissie bellas red and white dress was drenched in sweat it was impossibly hot suddenly there was a flash followed by a huge clap of thunder and the storm that had been lingering for days broke over the house flash after flash filtered through the boardedup window the rain was falling like machinegun fire on the roof people were crashing about next door oh god theyre getting ready to move out thought bella perhaps we havent been discovered at all maybe the helicopter was just a farmer going home or a politician returning to his constituency ricardo probably for something to do returned to his taunting and questioning well cut off your foot i think he said and send it through the post to el gatto wouldnt go through the letter box said bella lazlos always out anyway so the post officed have to send him one of those buff pieces of paper saying we have tried to deliver this foot several times why not apply to knightsbridge post office she began to laugh hysterically then clapped her hands over her mouth she mustnt crack up she mustnt ricardo then tied up their hands and took them into the livingroom everything had been tidied up a couple of suitcases packed carlos was burning rubbish in the fireplace pablo was running a duster all over the furniture to remove the fingerprints there was a commercial on the wireless now a girls voice crooning about men loving her shining lustrous hair lucky thing thought bella wistfully remembering her long mane what would lazlo think when he got the parcel she wondered would he be sorry or just think how ugly she must be now its what you are funny talented beautiful that matters oh lazlo lazlo she felt the tears trickling down her cheeks suddenly her musings were interrupted by the calm impassive voice of the newsreader news has suddenly come to light of a double kidnapping which began in london nine days ago when christine henriques the niece of charles henriques chairman of henriques brothers the banking firm was seized as she was leaving her uncles house in chelsea the kidnappers demanded a ransom of two million pounds but warned the family to raise the money privately and not to notify the police three days later actress bella parkinson who is engaged to rupert henriques the son of charles henriques was also kidnapped on her way home from the theatre and the kidnappers stepped up the demand today however there was a major breakthrough when one of the gang contacted the family with vital information about the whereabouts of the kidnappers and their victims the men are all believed to be south american and police have made important steps in tracing the men behind the kidnapping both in england and south america the kidnapping is not believed to be motivated by politics there was a long pause then everyone started shouting and swearing bella didnt dare look at chrissie theyll kill us in a minute said chrissie in a shaking voice i dont think so said bella were the only card theyve got left i cant stand the tension said chrissie youve got to said bella dont upset them all we can do now is wait in the silence between thunder claps they heard the helicopter buzzing round again come on said eduardo wed better get the hell out of here he put a blindfold over bellas eyes tied it tightly then she felt herself being led down the stairs oh why doesnt lazlo hurry she prayed if we leave here theyll never find us they paused at the bottom of the stairs bella could sense the tension around her the storm seemed to have stopped im going outside to see if the coasts clear said carlos he opened the door and shut it again whats that said ricardo there was a crackling and they all jumped at the sound of a loudspeaker you are completely surrounded said a voice throw your guns out of the window send bella and chrissie out at once alone and then come out one by one with your hands up do not attempt to escape or you will be shot down theyre bluffing said eduardo im going to have a look he put his head out of the door in answer a semicircle of floodlights flashed on flaring between the trees in an arc nearly a hundred yards long jesus said carlos were done for no were not said eduardo they wont shoot into the house for fear of killing bella or chrissie a policeman moved forward from the lights the next moment eduardo opened up with a machine gun then he seized the terrified chrissie jammed the smouldering gun in her back and dragging her upstairs opened the window go on he hissed jamming the gun further into her back or ill pull the trigger tell them to go away that theyre not helping and theyve got to do anything we ask go away screamed chrissie theyll kill us theyll kill us her voice dried up on a screeched whisper tell them theyve got to do what we tell them whispered eduardo we want a car to get out of here and a plane to take us to south america go on youve got to do what they tell you screamed chrissie repeating his message then breaking down into hysterical coughing and sobbing there was total silence eduardo pulled chrissie inside and shut the window they all gathered in the livingroom at the back bella and chrissie tied up pablo keeping watch at the front ricardo with his gun trained on the two girls carlos and eduardo discussing their next move chrissie was still coughing and crying dont worry whispered bella they cant hold out much longer it must be over soon carlos found a further news bulletin on another channel the kidnapping was again the lead story the hideout of the kidnappers has now been discovered said the announcer a remote farmhouse just outside haltby on the devonshire coast it has been completely surrounded by the army and the police police also know the names of the four kidnappers and realize they are only the front for a much larger organization police and the army now have the whole area cordoned off and are preparing for a long siege a quarter of an hour ago one of the gang appeared at the front door and shot at the police later a gunman held miss christine henriques out of a first floor window at gunpoint in considerable distress she appealed to the police not to threaten the gunmen and to agree to anything they ask for chrissie was coughing nonstop now for christs sake shut her up said ricardo why dont you let her go said bella if she gets any worse youll have a murder on your hands without trying there was another crackling over the loudspeaker another voice was speaking now in fluent spanish bellas heart gave a lurch she felt blood rushing to her face it was lazlo chrissie tried to struggle to her feet bella gave a gasp of excitement which turned to terror as ricardo shoved a gun against her temple leave her alone snapped eduardo and listen its el gattos voice and she could feel the frisson of loathing around the room these are men she thought with a shiver who have been taught to hate the name henriques at their mothers knee lazlos voice went on softer more persuasive now it was too fast for her to follow whats he saying she whispered to chrissie that the police know who all the men are said chrissie and have photographs of them that theres no way the police are going to give them an aeroplane or a car she listened for a minute then caught her breath now hes saying juan and steve have both been pulled in so theres no point them resisting any more if they surrender they wont be harmed in any way bella wished she could see the gunmens faces to see how they were reacting the loudspeaker crackled and stopped finally he said the police were in no hurry and intend to wait until the gunmen saw reason said chrissie all very well thought bella but this lot are human time bombs liable to explode at any minute they were arguing violently now eduardo doesnt believe juan or steve have been arrested said chrissie he thinks lazlos bluffing ricardo agrees with him carlos is fed up and all for packing it in pablo as usual says nothing theyve run out of booze and food and cigarettes said bella they cant hold out much longer if they get hungry theyll get bloodyminded said chrissie if they starve them out therell be more chance of a shootout there was no sound or sign of life from outside the transistor was crackling like distant gunfire as they waited for the next news bulletin it was the same as the one before except it added that the police knew the gunmen had run out of food and drink and included an interview with a doctor on the effects of longterm starvation it is likely to sharpen the wits but decrease physical efficiency said the doctor in a calm flat voice great said bella well all be cracking jokes soon then the pangs of hunger will give way to dull painless lethargy probably accompanied by headaches went on the doctor how soon will the hostages be in any physical danger through lack of food said the interviewer man can live without permanent ill effects up to six weeks on water alone said the doctor jesus muttered bella its a hell of a way to go on a crash diet the voice faded and crackled again when eduardo shook the wireless the batteries are running out thought bella she moved slightly her side ached where the floorboards were biting into her flesh she started on the lords prayer it was too serious a time to make bargains with god she couldnt keep please let me out she prayed and ill try to be good for the rest of my life and try not to want lazlo too much if he doesnt want me the wind came in a sudden blast rattling the trees against the roof of the house next moment the arc lights went out this is your chance said carlos theyre trying to tempt one of us out said eduardo ricardo tiptoed downstairs and slowly opened the front door the next moment the lights went on and a volley of bullets was fired over the house your blackmail has failed said the loudspeaker send the girls out at once if you want to save your lives they heard whispering and breathing on the loudspeaker then everything went quiet chapter twentytwo somehow it was dawn it seemed to bella that they had been left to their fate she had terrible cramp down her side the floodlights had lost their brilliance under the door the loudspeaker had been silent for hours she had even dozed fitfully even chrissie having coughed half the night was asleep snoring gently perhaps dreaming of rupert and her soft bed at home carlos was dozing now curled up like an embryo ricardo guarded the front door still eduardo the window pablo had his gun trained on her and chrissie how can she sleep so peacefully bella wondered eduardo reached out and switched on the transistor but it spluttered and finally gave out they were arguing again now in low voices ricardo was obviously the one suffering most he was desperate for cigarettes and alcohol his nails bitten down to the quick the loudspeaker began again making them all jump take the only way out and surrender take the only way out i must go to the loo said bella ricardo looked at eduardo who nodded tersely ricardo undid bellas legs and at gunpoint led her to the lavatory at the end of the passage for a second she was able to peer out of a crack between the boarded windows the sight cheered her up across the grass on the edge of a wood she could see rows of policemen motionless and intent with revolvers raised to the window other policemen moved around behind rows of sandbags beyond were television cameras and television catering vans and hundreds of special branch men and handlers with alsatians on leads eyes alert tails wagging expectantly she strained her eyes to catch a glimpse of lazlo or rupert come on youve been in there long enough said ricardo feeling slightly dizzy she stumbled back to the livingroom where chrissie had just woken up and realizing where she was had started the interminable coughing and crying bella felt her head she was boiling hot why dont you let her go she said turning furiously on eduardo you know youre finished ricardo raised his gun at her juan will rescue us said eduardo quietly rubbish said bella didnt you hear lazlo saying hed been arrested and even if he hadnt been you know the kind of man he is that hed disown you the moment things got awkward not me said eduardo with sudden hauteur juan would never let me down nor i him the day began to take on a nightmare quality eduardo was constantly having to rally the others as over and over again the loudspeaker made offers of food and cigarettes in return for releasing one of the hostages all of which were refused in all the big kidnapping cases bella had read about recently the besieged gunmen had eventually capitulated but this is different she thought its a hatred thing all tied up with eduardos damn machismo hell never give in without a struggle at dusk the lights in the livingroom went out carlos stumbled out to the hall and tried the light switch there no light came on theyve turned the bloody electricity off he shouted for several hours they waited trembling in pitch dark then suddenly brilliant super arc lights blazed into the room making them all cover their eyes these lights were switched on off on off making sleep absolutely impossible they all moved into one of the boardedup rooms chrissie seemed to have sunk into a dull torpor which worried bella far more than the coughing sobbing and shivering the police are going about it the wrong way she thought were going to crack before the gunmen another dawn slowly reduced the power of the arc lights bella had lost the ability to feel anything ricardo and eduardo and carlos were all at each others throats if they start offering them cigarettes today thought bella eduardos going to have the devils own job stopping them accepting the loudspeaker crackled chrissie woke up whats that she said listlessly its lazlo said bella he was talking in spanish again tell me what hes saying chrissie wriggled into a sitting position and listened he says hes got something of particular interest for both ricardo and carlos ricardo first he wants them to listen carefully suddenly there was a womans voice pleading sobbing beseeching choking with emotion intensified a hundred times by the loudspeaker it sounded terrible ricardo gave a groan and sat down with his hands over his ears whats she saying bella hissed to chrissie its his mother said chrissie shes pleading with him to give himself up and let us go free she says shes an old woman and if he gets killed her life will be meaningless and as shell never be able to afford to come to england shell never see him again now shes asking him to think of his sister whos about the same age as us now shes saying that juan has been arrested and what are five years in prison which hell get if he gives himself up compared to death when he hasnt even said his confession she finished speaking and started to cry ricardo got to his feet stop it stop it he screamed i cant stand it pull yourself together said eduardo icily cant you see shes been forced into doing it not my mother hissed ricardo never she would never let herself be forced into anything the loudspeaker began again this time it was carloss wife a quieter more impassioned plea asking carlos to save himself because she and the children loved him and they wanted him back again she told him to remember that bella and chrissie were only young girls who hadnt done anyone any harm carlos reacted in a far less hysterical way than ricardo but bella could tell from his still body and clenched fists that he was very much affected nothing for eduardo she thought probably noone loved him enough to plead with him to save his life and what about the mute pablo standing motionless beside the door there was silence then a voice speaking spanish not lazlos this time we repeat come out at once and throw your guns out let the hostages out and come out yourselves with your hands over your head and you will not be harmed dont take any notice of those lousy tapes said eduardo theyre all rigged he sounded calm but the knuckles were white where he clutched his gun ive had enough said ricardo if theyve got my mother theyre quite capable of doing things to her im packing it in so am i said carlos bella felt a surge of hope that died almost immediately no youre not said eduardo his voice suddenly full of ice we came here to do a job and were going to do it later juan will protect us not if youre dead he cant said bella shut up you bitch snarled eduardo he waved his gun at ricardo tie their legs up again he said ricardos hands were shaking so much it took him a long time to tie the knots now blindfold them no said carlos starting to argue go on blindfold them said eduardo and bella knew it was the voice of the executioner cold fear paralysed her her throat was completely dry she wanted to scream for help to tell them not to kill her but as the soft scarf was tied over her eyes she was incapable of speech someone turned her to face the wall she heard eduardo order pablo to cover the front door with the submachine gun and ricardo and carlos to guard the two windows theyre going to kill us arent they whispered chrissie beside her im not sure said bella will it hurt very much i dont think so they say when the wounds mortal it hurts very little ricardo was arguing again shut up said eduardo im going to do this ill take the complete blame there was a long pause no prayed bella please god no she had a sudden vision of lazlo of his face softened holding out his arms to her then it seemed to merge with her father with his laughing tawny eyes gathering her up in his arms and holding her shrieking with delight above his head then she remembered her first night in othello and the audience clapping and clapping and the deafening way theyd clapped the night lazlo had made her go on after the diamond was stolen and suddenly the deafening applause seemed to turn into a volley of machinegun fire and the next moment she heard a groan and a scream as a body slumped at her side chrissie she screamed youve killed her bastards bastards she tensed herself waiting for another volley of shooting but it never came suddenly the blindfold was removed from her eyes she looked down at chrissie lying at her feet expecting her to be full of holes and realized with sudden incredulous joy that she was still breathing hardly daring to turn her head she suddenly saw a trickle of blood coming down the floorboards towards her feet it slowly impinged on her halfcrazed mind that it was eduardo lying dead riddled with bullets and now pablo was talking for the first time in a young hoarse voice telling ricardo to throw all the guns out of the window cautiously ricardo opened the window ducking to avoid a spurt of machinegun fire from the ground and then threw two guns out the firing started for a second then died away ricardo picked up the remaining guns and threw them out bella managed to bring chrissie round while carlos was untying her ropes what happened she gasped you fainted said bella pablo shot eduardo theyre just throwing their guns out hope sparked in chrissies dull bloodshot eyes but pablo still held the machine gun the next moment he shoved it into bellas back making a gesture towards the stairs with his head out you go he said she had to support chrissie down the stairs she seemed very frail she must have lost pounds pablo came to the door with them still clutching his gun bella turned to them its a trick she said youll shoot me in the back pablo shook his head why did you shoot eduardo to prevent him shooting you said pablo he had to you see he couldnt give in like the rest of us it was a matter of honour hes juans youngest brother then he opened the door and threw his smoking gun on to the grass thank you said bella ill tell them you saved our lives he gave a crooked smile stood back and with a curious mock salute ushered her out on to the grass for a minute she was dazzled by the brilliant sunlight and then the world came back to her in sharp focus fifty yards of parched grass stretched out before her to her left the guns lay in a pile like spillikins beyond the grass the trees and the sandbags began it was deadly quiet there was noone in sight a dog barked on the left bella walked slowly and hesitantly on half carrying the stumbling trembling chrissie tensing her backbone against a possible bullet she was only a few yards from the shadow of the trees now and she realized once more the strength of the operation the dog handlers the armoured cars the television cameras the ambulances the hordes of policemen next moment she had reached the sandbags and collapsed into the arms of a waiting policeman feeling his silver buttons against her chest and a hundred arms seemed to be pulling them both to safety behind the sandbags then there were people all round her and photographers flashing and cameras whirring and suddenly there was lazlo and she hardly recognized him she had remembered him catlike sunburnt exoticlooking in that white suit now he was deathly pale unshaven his face seamed with exhaustion his eyes bloodshot his jaw quilted with muscles to stop himself breaking down oh lazlo sobbed chrissie and collapsed coughing and sobbing into his arms its all right baby he said shakily its all over youre going to be all right youre safe now over her shoulder his eyes met bellas everythings all right now he repeated mechanically the next moment like a dog thats been deprived of its masters company for days a figure threw himself on chrissie tugging her away from lazlo cradling her in his arms kissing her face over and over again oh my darling my only love it was rupert youre all right youre not hurt he went on pausing and looking down at her chrissie started to laugh and cry at the same time im all right but im so dirty and horrible and revolting youre not youre not youre mine and youre lovely bella turned her head away to stop herself breaking down and then lazlo was beside her and she was overwhelmed with shyness for a moment as the crowd pushed him forward and he held her tight against him she could feel his shirt drenched with sweat and the frantic thudding of his heart then she pulled away there were so many people around and she was so filthy and stinking and she was so ashamed of her terrible hair she had rehearsed this reunion with him so long and now she couldnt say anything because she was so terrified of saying too much chrissie she blurted out shes ill you must get her to a hospital she swayed lazlo caught hold of her then everyone was round her offering congratulations a senior policeman in a peaked hat fought his way through the crowd thank god youre safe he said whats happening in there its quite safe said bella theyve thrown out all their guns are they all alive three of them eduardos dead pablo killed him because he was going to shoot us do you feel up to answering a few questions said the inspector bella nodded but i dont think chrissie ought to she needs a doctor at once and hows my star attraction said a voice in her ear bella swung round and there beside her was the wonderfully familiar freckled face of roger field oh roger she said her control snapping and sobbing she flung her arms round his neck chapter twentythree they had to fight their way out photographers were snapping frenziedly journalists pressing forward but a row of policemen made a gangway and the next moment she lazlo and roger were bundled into a police car and driven off she clutched on to roger all the way shaking uncontrollably still feeling hopelessly shy of lazlo who was sitting beside her two other policemen in the car inhibited her even further speechless she gazed out of the window at the countryside she thought she would never see again at the angelic greenness of the trees the wild roses hanging in festoons from the banks the buttercups golden in the fields every time a car passed them coming from either direction she ducked down she couldnt get used to the fact that noone was pointing a gun at her any longer hows everyone in the company she said to roger worried stiff about you i was quite worried myself her laugh wasnt quite steady enough she half turned to lazlo is diego all right he got through to you lazlo nodded and his wife and little boy said bella theyre being flown over here tomorrow or the next day ive alerted all the right people at great ormond street theyll get the best attention oh i am pleased she still couldnt look him straight in the eye it wasnt too much of a problem you didnt mind my saying youd do that for him christ no said roger it was the best hand youve ever played darling you obviously knocked him for six i said to lazlo its the old parkinson sex appeal working again she started to laugh but it strangled in her throat and she started to cry roger squeezed her hand harder its all right sweetheart we all know what youve been through give her a slug from your hip flask lazlo at the police station there were incredible mob scenes people standing on each others shoulders hundreds of reporters and television cameras let me look at her thats the girlfriend look at her hair good old bella what was it like did they hurt you they were all trying to touch her pulling at her clothing four policemen hustled her inside where she was allowed to have a cup of coffee and a wash before they started interrogating her the room was absolutely jammed with cops firing questions from all sides roger sat beside her holding her hand tightly defusing the whole thing when it became overemotional lazlo seemed temporarily to have disappeared when they got on to the shooting she started trembling again youre sure it was pablo who shot eduardo said the superintendent yes of course but you were blindfolded said an inspector with a big moustache i could tell from the direction the shots came from said bella and besides he was the only one with a machine gun but at first you thought it was eduardo who had shot chrissie i know but only because i was expecting it and two machine guns were thrown out of the window well they were only using one at the time and i know it was pablo because hed been so retiring up until then then suddenly he took charge but you didnt actually see him fire the shot persisted the superintendent the possibility that they might not believe she was speaking the truth became too much for her suddenly they seemed indistinguishable from ricardo and eduardo slapping her face back and forth to get information out of her its worse out than in she said and laying down her head on the table she started to cry im not up to it im simply not up to it next moment lazlo walked in he had shaved and put on a clean shirt and seemed to be his old forceful self once again if you dont get off her back he said walking over to the superintendent ill make the most bloody awful scandal thatll destroy any public image youve built up over this case its all right lovey he added taking bellas other hand it wont take much longer and with infinite tact and gentleness he took her over the mornings happenings and thats enough he said when she had finished ive just seen my sister shes not as ill as all that shell be perfectly able to give you her story later in the day if youre capable of showing a little consideration the superintendent shot lazlo a look both of dislike and respect all right mr henriques he said id like somewhere where miss parkinson and i can have two minutes alone together lazlo went on then you can take her straight to hospital they were ushered into an anteroom with a table and two chairs which smelt of furniture polish and chalk and fear a potted plant was wilting on the window ledge bella collapsed on to one of the chairs i dont want to go to hospital she said in a shaking voice im quite all right its only for a checkup so you can catch up on some sleep not for long only for a day or two until i get back she looked up in horror where are you going he paused his face inscrutable buenos aires oh no so they were bluffing juan hasnt been pulled in yet not yet but ive got all the evidence i need to nail him and the argentinian police arent going to let a chance like this slip through their fingers so ill get every cooperation whats happened to steve she said and felt herself going crimson inside said lazlo flatly he was picked up yesterday trying to leave the country and he talked lazlo nodded straight away sang to the rooftops bella winced wretched steve not even the guts to protect his own crooked friends he and juan had been planning to snatch chrissie for months lazlo went on so contacting me through the personal columns and pretending to be still madly in love with me was just a ruse said lazlo he read about you and rupert in the papers and went through all the personal column palaver just to lull your suspicions he realized how cliquey we are as a family how we resist outsiders you were the ideal way in it came out more brutally than he had intended oh god said bella feeling suddenly defeated so it was all my fault of course it wasnt said lazlo irritably there was a knock and a policemans head came round the door youre going to miss that plane mr henriques unless you hurry just coming said lazlo give me a few seconds more the head retreated bella was staring listlessly at her hands for a moment it seemed even lazlo was at a loss for words the tension between them was unbearable she felt an appalling urge to collapse sobbing in his arms pleading with him not to go but she just went on gazing at her bitten nails bella he said gently please look at me i cant she said in a stifled voice there was another agonizing pause he sighed and stood up all right i suppose its no good trying to sort anything out at the moment youre all in rogerll look after you get as much rest as you can ill ring you from ba as soon as ive got anything to report you will be careful wont you she said still not looking up ill try he said wearily and was gone and bella was overwhelmed with a terrible sense of anticlimax chapter twentyfour they released her after fortyeight hours in hospital the doctors said she must have an extremely strong constitution apart from the fact that at night she was continually woken by nightmares about guns pointing at her and by day she thought obsessively about lazlo she seemed to have made an excellent recovery roger steered her through a gruelling press conference when she came out the questions about the actual kidnapping and living with the gunmen were bad enough but soon they moved on to her private life you were engaged to rupert henriques said the gossip writer from the daily mail yes said bella but you broke it off he persisted yes why because we werent suited or because you were more suited to his cousin lazlo no said bella going scarlet lazlo tried to cut his cousin out with you didnt he this is not a court of law said roger field firmly so will you stop pestering bella with irrelevant questions but throughout the press conference journalist after journalist harked back to the question of her and lazlo until suddenly she lost her temper will you stop hounding me she screamed there is absolutely nothing between lazlo henriques and me and im not answering any more of your bloody questions it took all roger fields tact to calm everyone down in considerable distress wrote down the journalists in their shorthand notebooks as a minute later bella suddenly stood up burst into tears and fled out of the room i cant stand any more she sobbed to roger you wont have to said roger five minutes later she and roger were smuggled out of a side door and into a waiting police car where are we going said bella to a bolt hole of lazlos in maida vale said roger hes been hiding out there since you and chrissie were kidnapped too many people including the press know the address of his own flat they were welcomed at the flat by rogers wife sabina she was a tall slim brunette and her beauty in the flesh and in the photograph on rogers desk at the theatre had blighted the hopes of many a young actress who would otherwise have set her cap at roger she gathered bella into a voluptuous scented hug welcome home darling this flat has to be seen to be believed im sure its where lazlo keeps his first eleven mistresses all that peachcoloured satin and mirrors in the bedroom nonsense said roger sharply lazlo bought it as a base for visiting clients it merely happens to be empty at the moment because noones over here the arabs go wild about that bedroom business must be disintegrating said sabina he hasnt been near the office for days a huge pile of mail arrived this morning that hadnt been opened since before you were kidnapped ive put it all in his bedroom ive put you in there too bella so you can lie in bed all night and admire your reflection against peachcoloured satin in the mirror on the ceiling she added carrying bellas suitcase into the room on the right several of lazlos sweaters lay on an armchair and on the dressing table were jumbled together cufflinks nail scissors bottles of aftershave ivory hair brushes ties cheque books a wallet several race cards a fountain pen a huge stack of mail and a pile of five pound notes bella sniffed one of the bottles of aftershave it had strong overtones of lavender and musk and immediately conjured up the old smooth opulent mocking selfassured lazlo she knew before the kidnapping not the pale trembling shattered man whod greeted her on her escape it was almost as though sabina read her thoughts i dont know how lazlo survived the last ten days she said he never went to bed working flat out trying to trace you and not getting a lead from anyone just those damn telephone calls at twentyfour hour intervals getting more and more threatening then those absurd tapes they sent to prove that you were still alive that might have been made any time she took off the fur counterpane from the bed and began folding it up then your hair arrived through the post that was the last straw he was convinced you were both dead he completely broke down its always much worse when someone you never think will does roger thought he was finished then just as he was trying to cheer him up the telephone rang and it was diego after that he was all right bella felt herself going scarlet more than anything in the world she wanted to ask sabina what lazlo felt about her but she was too frightened of getting a negative answer i wish hed ring she said for the hundredth time oh hell be all right said sabina hes a cat with ninetynine lives ill leave you to get yourself sorted out im going to cook supper come and have a drink when youre ready after shed gone bella looked at herself in the mirror god she hated her hair she wondered if it would be worth getting a wig she sniffed the aftershave again and felt a sudden spasm of lust and longing then with a beating heart she started to leaf through the unopened mail halfway down she found what she was dreading a letter from france in a blue airmail envelope with the address written in violet ink in a flowing expansive hand the name on the back was of course angoras trust the silly bitch to use violet ink bella was itching to open it it was dated nine days ago so probably angora didnt even know of the kidnapping when shed written it firmly bella put it at the bottom of the pile then she changed into a green and black dress it was in the style of a cheongsam with a high neck and a slit skirt thats more like the old bella said roger appreciatively when she went into the drawing room i feel very ungaysha she said and what the hell am i going to do about my bloody hair i rather like it said roger it brings out the latent fag in me ive decided the next thing youre going to do is viola she never told her love but let concealment like a worm i the bud feed on her damask cheek quoted bella sounds just like me after dinner at about ten oclock when for the first time that evening bella was not wondering when lazlo was going to ring the telephone rang roger answered suddenly his face relaxed into a smile youre ok great well done well thats for the best under the circumstances he wont bother anyone any more do you want to talk to bella he handed her the receiver its lazlo her heart was cracking her ribs her throat was so dry she could hardly speak oh thank god youre not hurt not a scratch everythings sorted out this end oh im so glad what about juan hes dead he tried to shoot his way out and wounded a policeman so they let him have it god how horrible it wasnt very nice but at least now hes dead a lot of people in buenos aires will have their first decent nights sleep in years look i cant talk very long im catching a plane in a few minutes what time do you get into heathrow about tenthirty tomorrow flight b shall i meet you oh god she could have bitten her tongue off he probably had half london meeting him and there she was forcing herself on him but he merely said yes please and could you ask roger to ring diego and say im bringing his wife and the child with me so they had better have an ambulance waiting at the airport oh thats sensational cried bella hell be so pleased have a quick word with roger ill see you tomorrow she handed the receiver back to roger and went into the bedroom and sat down on the bed burying her burning face in her hands oh i love him i love him she said to herself ill never be able to live through the next twelve hours in a dream she started wondering what to wear to the airport perhaps sabina would lend her a big hat but then the brim would get in the way when lazlo kissed her stop it she said to herself youre counting your chickens before theyre even laid roger came into the bedroom well thats nice isnt it he said grinning good old lazlo rosie hassells in a play on itv in a minute do you want to come and watch her im just going to wash my hair first said bella after shed washed it she went back into the bedroom to comb it into some sort of shape she was still walking on air she looked at the mail on the dressing table again suddenly she felt so relaxed although she knew she shouldnt she couldnt resist having a read of angoras letter with wet fingers she tore open the envelope and skimmed through the contents pandoras box suddenly she gave a gasp of horror and her hand went to her cheek as she read it again properly my darling darling lazlo every word burnt into her soul christ this movie is a bore the director the producer the first assistant have never stopped trying to bang me the leading man on the other hand is trying to bang the first assistant but thats movies for you the director is also determined to have a scene in which i take off all my clothes but so far ive resisted it keeping myself on toast for you darling i tried to get you on the telephone but there was no answer but filming should be finished by the th thats today thought bella numbly and i plan to fly home on the th i hope youve at last managed to extract bella from rupert you should have no difficulty in getting her to transfer her affections to you but what a drag it must have been anyway ill make it up ten thousand times when we meet all my love and anticipation angora bella started to cry very quietly so that really was the truth she said to herself as shed been frightened all along lazlo had only been paying her so much attention deliberately to make her fall in love with him turning the full searchlight beam of his notorious sex appeal on her just to make sure shed never go back to rupert well hed won all round she had fallen for him she could never go back to rupert anyway rupert had chrissie now as lazlo had always intended now hed achieved his object he could go back to angora who was one of his own kind in agony she remembered the henriques family motto with which lazlo had taunted her the first time theyd met scratch a henriques and you draw your own blood where could she go where could she escape to then suddenly she decided to go back to nalesworth the slum where shed been born perhaps there she might find some kind of peace roger and sabina were well stuck into the play she scribbled a quick note to lazlo dear lazlo im afraid i snooped and opened this letter of angoras its selfexplanatory really im sorry ive been such a bother to you all i havent got any money so ive borrowed fifty pounds ill send it back to you when ive got it thank you for getting me out with my love bella stuffing the fivers into her bag she pinched a pair of dark glasses and tiptoed out of the flat later shivering with misery cold and exhaustion she crept into an empty carriage and cried without stopping until the train cranked its way into leeds station chapter twentyfive the flowers on the graves were spattered with mud and bent in the harsh bleak wind bella stood shaking still in her green and black cheongsam her teeth chattering the rain trickling down her neck and looked down at the lichened tombstone over her mothers grave bridget figge died a saint and deeply loved said the inscription she was a right bitch thought bella and not at all deeply loved by me still she reflected she might have been different if she hadnt married my poor feckless father then she started thinking about lazlo and she looked beyond the dark yews of the churchyard at the grey houses and the grey stone walls and the set grey faces of the passersby this is home she thought and i dont like it one bit im going back to london when she got on the train she headed straight for the bar the commercial travellers and the men in tweed suits around her were trying to steer brown windsor soup into their mouths it was only after her fourth double gin and tonic that she realized she hadnt eaten properly since last night by then it seemed too late to start she ordered another drink it was funny to see her face on the front of everyones newspaper with short shaggy hair and frightened eyes ten days of terror take their toll said one headline bella cracks up during press conference and denies romance said another she shrunk further behind her dark glasses took a slug of gin and went back to brooding over lazlo his behaviour towards her had never been remotely loverlike in fact most of the time it had been quite abominable and yet and yet her thoughts kept straying back to the first time he had pretended to be steve and nearly raped her in the dark he must have felt something to kiss her like that and also the way hed broken down when they sent him her hair everything suddenly became quite simple she would find lazlo as soon as she got to london and have it out with him by the time she came off the train she was very drunk indeed she tottered down the platform reeling round porters and oncoming luggage trucks she had great difficulty in finding a telephone booth someone picked up the telephone in lazlos maida vale flat on the first ring but it wasnt lazlo it sounded like a policeman hes at the office said a voice but whos that calling bella didnt answer who is that calling said the voice again with some urgency bella put the receiver down and rang lazlos office where she was told lazlo was in a meeting but who should they say called again the same urgency bella rang off suddenly the fact that lazlo was somewhere in london was too much for her im going to rout him out she said to herself in the taxi she tried to tidy herself up a bit her dress was still soaking wet from the rain her cheeks were flushed her eyes glittering she managed to put eyeshadow on one eye then got bored and gave up and emptied the remains of a bottle of scent over herself she kept rehearsing what she was going to say to him now look here it began the taxi got lost three times but finally drew up outside a vast tall grey building over a sea of bowler hats bella read the letters henriques bros eureka she shouted falling out into the street and belting through the front door into the building the beautiful redheaded receptionist looked at her in fascinated horror have you come to collect something she said slowly only lazlo henriques said bella tugging her rain sodden skirt down over her bottom have you got an appointment no but its terribly important i see him said bella trying to keep the mounting despair out of her voice the receptionist caught her first fumes of gin her cold blue eyes flickered over bellas stomach oh gosh im not pregnant she gasped not a bit in fact if thats what youre thinking a man in a commissionaires uniform came out of the lift the receptionist beckoned to him this er person insists on seeing mr lazlo the commissionaire looked at bella then started my goodness its miss parkinson isnt it yes yes said bella i must see him you cant throw me out her voice was rising hysterically suddenly a nearby door opened and a redfaced man came out cant you stop this damned row heywood he said sir its miss parkinson said the commissionaire bella staggered towards the redfaced man suddenly her selfcontrol snapped please oh please she sobbed i must see lazlo youve got to help me then over his shoulder through the haze of cigarette smoke she looked into a room and saw a long polished table and her eyes travelled down two rows of flushed distinguished looking faces to the man lounging at the end whose face was as white as theirs were pink her heart lurched into her mouth it was lazlo bella he roared getting to his feet and striding down the room where the bloody hell have you been ive got half london looking for you i went to yorkshire but it was raining so i came back again she was beginning to feel very peculiar lazlo caught her as she swayed youre drunk he said accusingly horribly horribly drunk and horribly horribly in love with you she mumbled and passed out cold in his arms chapter twentysix the first thing that hit her eyes when she woke up was brilliant scarlet wallpaper she winced shut her eyes and opened them again quickly and took in the row of ivory hair brushes the photographs of racehorses on the dressing table and the rows and rows of suits in the wardrobe noone else in the world had as many suits as that she was back in lazlos old flat she levered herself out of bed and stood on a fur rug feeling sick she was wearing a pair of black pyjamas that were far too large for her she stumbled into the drawingroom lazlo was sitting in an armchair watching racing on television and drinking champagne he looked up and smiled i feel dreadful she said cringing with embarrassment he got up and turned down the television sound and poured her a fernet branca ugh i couldnt drink anything she said shut up and drink it grumbling she obeyed im going to clean my teeth she muttered and shot into the bathroom as the pounding in her head began to subside she started to piece the events of the previous day together she went back into the drawingroom im sorry she said in a small voice what about barging into your office like that did i do anything awful you declared passionate love to me in front of my entire board of directors and then passed out like a light oh god were they very shocked riveted i should think there hasnt been anything half so exciting since decimalization wwhat happened then oh i brought you back here what time is it she muttered nearly ten past three i was just about to watch the threefifteen im sorry about being in your bed and things what happened to my clothes i mean did we she blushed scarlet er did we no we didnt you were dead to the world and ive never been keen on necrophilia he was laughing at her now i cant help it she said sulkily scuffing the carpet with her feet i didnt mean to behave badly or fall in love with you it wasnt on the agenda at all particularly when youre probably aching to be rid of me and rush off to paris on some loathsome dirty weekend with angora all my love and anticipation indeed the foxy cow lazlo laughed bella darling he said you should learn not to open other peoples letters that was angoras letter to me not mine to her then he got to his feet crossed the room and took her in his arms then he bent his head and kissed her very gently his mouth tasted cool and faintly of champagne and halfway through bella joined in and kissed him back and the whole thing became extremely ungentle then he said now do you still think im aching to be in paris with angora bella said she didnt and he kissed her again then he sat down on the sofa and pulled her on to his knee and said christ ive been wanting to do that since the night we played murder why didnt you then i couldnt i was in one hell of a position id played you a rotten trick quite deliberately setting out to seduce you by pretending i was steve i knew you loathed my guts i couldnt just move in one false move would have sent you scuttling back to steve but suddenly the biter was well and truly bit i had to go on seeing you not because i wanted to take you away from rupert but because i simply couldnt keep away but after chrissie was kidnapped you didnt come near me didnt even ring me up that was different once juan knew i was hooked on you i was scared stiff hed grab you too as he did in the end thats why i kept my distance but i kept tabs on you you were being followed all the time unfortunately the night they picked you up the man trailing you had nipped into a café to get some cigarettes by the time hed caught up it was too late all he saw was you being bundled into a car and driven off he didnt even get the number plate jesus darling if you knew what i went through those five days when i didnt know where you were i was so terrified theyd kill you before i had a chance to tell you i loved you it became an absolute obsession to tell you i was worried stiff about chrissie but the thought of losing you was what was really crucifying me i was the same said bella the whole time i was in there i thought about you it was the only thing that kept me sane i kept dreaming what would happen if i got out and by some miracle we ever did get together i rehearsed coming out so often and what i was going to say to you lazlo picked up her hand and held it against his cheek oh so did i so did i he sighed and then there was that terrible volley of shooting and i thought you must be dead then suddenly you and chrissie came out and i lost my nerve i couldnt do it i couldnt tell you i loved you in front of all those hordes of people in case you werent ready for it in case you still hated me and what about rotten angora and that letter she sent you lazlo grinned ruefully ill admit in the beginning i set out to seduce you because i didnt want you to marry rupert now i realize it was because i wanted you for myself so i lined up angora to get her off with steve and promised to give her a weekend in paris if you actually broke it off with rupert well i dont mind paying for her weekend but shell have to find another man to spend it with bella blushed hows chrissie fine coming out of hospital today rupert wont let her out of his sight so all your plans have materialized said bella unable to keep the slight edge out of her voice not quite said lazlo tipping her gently off his knee and going over and turning off the television i think just this once ill miss the threefifteen bella nervously cast around for something to say im sure rupert and chrissie will be very happy she said and me do you think ill make you happy said lazlo moving towards her deliberately and taking her in his arms i know i look sexually experienced she mumbled in panic but im not really not a bit you dont look as experienced as you might think he said softly but we can have the first lesson right now oh darling she said burying her face in his shoulder dont joke about it careful she thought careful dont give in straight away oh dear i shouldnt succumb so easily was her last coherent thought so here i am in bed she said to herself a couple of hours later and i should be in heaven why do i feel as though i want to cut my throat whats the matter said lazlo bella gazed down at her hands i was thinking that now youve had me you wont want me any more she said in a small voice bella you have the faith of a gnat he said oh please dont be angry she said i want to believe you love me but youve had such millions and millions of women im glad you put that in the past tense he said he lit a cigarette inhaled deeply and handed it to her then he said look lets get married bella choked on the cigarette then she lay motionless not daring to say anything he was joking he must be joking well you dont seem frightfully enthusiastic he said i thought you werent very keen on marriage im not in the general run of things ive never wanted to get married before never thought it was quite me going out to dinner every night with the same person but about you somehow i feel completely different im scared stiff to let you out of my sight ever again what about maria rodriguez that was a boygirl romeo and juliet thing it would never have lasted what screwed me up was her getting acid thrown in her face and doing herself in i love you you crazy child he went on taking her face in his hands im turned inside out by you i havent been so hooked on anyone since i fell in love with the cricket captain at eton bella giggled and looked and saw that although he smiled the tarmac black eyes were filled with a tenderness that made her quite dizzy oh please she said if you really mean what you said about marriage i should like it very very much and could we do it very soon ill get a licence tomorrow said lazlo im a great believer in bolting the stable door once the horse is well and truly in and im going to ask roger to give you a sabbatical so that after we get married i can take you on a long long honeymoon so we can both stop having nightmares about juan oh god said bella with a sob flinging her arms round his neck i must have done something amazingly good in a former existence to deserve this you did something amazingly good during the last couple of hours said lazlo and he kissed her again another nice thing he said when he finally came up for air is that aunt constance will be insane with rage bella giggled again then she suddenly caught sight of herself in lazlos arms in the huge looking glass above the fire we do look beautiful together she thought dreamily but something is wrong would you mind terribly if i went back to being blonde again she said the end
