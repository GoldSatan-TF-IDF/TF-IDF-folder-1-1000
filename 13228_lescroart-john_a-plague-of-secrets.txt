john lescroart a plague of secrets book in the dismas hardy series to my muse mentor partner and true love lisa marie sawyer men are not punished for their sins but by them elbert hubbard part one friday the end of the workweek on the small deck outside his back door a lawyer named dismas hardy sat with his feet up on the decks railing and savored a rare moment as the sun spent the last hour of its day lowering itself toward the horizon behind his home the house cast its everlengthening shadow out over the neighborhood to the east san francisco s richmond districtand it threw into relief the bright westfacing facades of the buildings in the city before him as it stretched away to downtown the random window reflected glints of sunlight back at him fireflies in the gathering dusk shimmering in the indiansummer air he sipped his gin and ice placed the glass down on the meshed metal of the picnic table theyd set up out here and was suddenly and acutely aware that he could not be more content his wife frannie whom he still loved after twentythree years was inside the house behind him humming as she did whatever she was doing his two children were away and doing well at their respective schoolsrebecca at boston university and vincent at uc san diego the law firm of freeman farrell hardy roake of which he was the managing partner was humming along as though it were on autopilot hardy looked for a moment into the blue above him blinking against a wave of emotion then being who he was his mouth cracked into a small grin at himself and he lifted his glass for another sip inside the telephone rang twice and stopped which meant that it was someone they knew and that frannie had picked it up her voice with notes of sympathy and understanding floated out to him but he didnt bother trying to make out any of the words she had begun to have a somewhat thriving career of her own as a marriage and family therapist and often would wind up counseling her clients from home hardy drifted not off to anywhere but into a kind of surrender of conscious thought for a long moment he was simply there in the same way that his drink or his chair existed or the light or the breeze off the ocean a little over a mile west of where he sat so that when the door opened behind him he came back with a bit of a start frannie put a hand on his shoulder and he brought his hand up to cover hers half turning seeing the look on her face whats up he asked his feet coming down off the railing are the kids all right always the first concern she nodded a yes to the second question then answered the first that was treya treya was the wife of hardys best friend abe glitsky the head of san francisco s homicide department anguish in her eyes frannie held and released a breath its zack she said referring to glitskys threeyearold son hes had an accident accompanied by her fiveyearold daughter rachel treya glitsky opened the gate in the hardys white picket fence dismas hardy in his living room watching out through the plantation shutters of his front window called back to his wife in the kitchen that they were here then walked over and opened his front door treya turned away and closing the gate reached down for a small duffel bag by the effort it took to lift it might have weighed a hundred pounds when she straightened up her shoulders rose and fell then she brought a hand to her forehead and stood completely still for another second or two with her tiny hand rachel held on to the front pocket of her mothers jeans while she looked up at her face her own lips pressed tight hardy crossed his porch and descended three steps to the cement path that bisected his small lawn the sun had gone down behind the buildings across the street although true dusk was still twenty minutes away as she turned and saw him now treyas legendary composure threatened to break she was a tall womannearly hardys sizeand strongly built her mouth expressive and normally quick to smile quivered then set in a line hardy came forward took the duffel bag from her and put an arm around her neck drawing her in holding her for a moment finally he stepped back and whispered how is he she shrugged and shook her head then her voice as quiet as his we dont know yet frannie came up touched his shoulder and came around to hug treya hardy stepped to the side and went down on one knee to face rachel at her level and hows my favorite little girl in the whole world okay she said but zack got hit by a car i know he did hon but hes not going to die hardy looked up at the two women treya gave him a quick nod and he came back to her daughter no of course not but i hear youre going to stay here for a couple of days while he gets better is that okay with you if mom says and she does is that duffel bag your stuff here let me get it if you put your arms around my neck your old uncle diz will carry you inside then they were all moving up the path and into the house abe went with the ambulance treya was saying we dont know how long were going to have to be down there i dont know how to thank you for watching rachel dont be ridiculous frannie said we love rachel she reached out and touched the little girls cheek where she rested it on hardys shoulder shes our favorite little girl hardy and frannie walked treya out after they got rachel settled in with cookies and milk in front of the television they stopped again on the path just inside the fence was he conscious hardy asked no treya paused then lowered her voice he didnt have his helmet on what happened exactly frannie asked we may never know she said abe had just brought down his big wheel bike and zack was on it but abe told him to just sit still and wait a minute while he turned around and got his helmet which hed set down like two feet away on the stairs but then as soon as his back was turned zack got aboard and either started pedaling or just rolling down the driveway just as another car was coming up the street one of our neighbors he was only going like five miles an hour but zack just plowed into him and got knocked off the bike and into the street she flashed a pained look from hardy to frannie he banged his head she hesitated ive got to get down there now you guys are great thank you go hardy said call when you can at tenthirty hardy was shepherding the evenings last glass of wine which he didnt need at all he was sitting in his reading chair across from the fireplace in the living room rachel had gone down to sleep early and easily about an hour and a half ago frannie was in the family room now and for the past half hour had been talking to their son vincent down in san diego shed already called the beck back in boston both calls not so much to share the bad news as to touch base with their own offspring to make sure they were safe neither treya nor abe had called yet with any report from the hospital hardy hamstrung by his overwhelming sense of dread had his hand around the stem of his glass but hadnt yet brought it to his lips he simply stared at the fire frannie must have hung up because she was now standing in the portal that separated their dining and living rooms diz he turned his head toward her perhaps surprised to see her there appearing out of thin air the way she had hey she crossed the remaining few steps to him and sat on the ottoman at his feet youve been just sitting there without moving a muscle since ive been in this doorway isometric exercise every muscle tensed for maximum effect but there was no humor in it are you all right he shrugged his effort to smile halfhearted at best hows vinnie good he got a bplus on his first polysci exam slacker he wanted to know if we needed him to come up he said he would i told him i didnt think so probably right nothing for him to do you either frannie said just be there for them if they need us sighing hardy shook his head you think this stuff is buried so deep down and next thing you know youre blindsided by it frannie hesitated but she knew what he was talking about michael hardys firstborn son had died in infancy thirtyfive years before a precocious sevenmonthold hed stood up in his crib well before he was supposed to be able to and had pitched over the guardrail that theyd kept at halfmast he had landed on his head i dont think ive consciously thought about him in five years and now here he is big as life bigger than he was in life frannie rested a hand on his knee this may not turn out the same lets hope i dont know if abe could take it how anybody does i dont know how i did frannie knew hardys sons tragedy had marked the end of his first marriage and the abandonment of his law career it had led to ten years behind the bar at the little shamrock where he had averaged somewhere between one and two dozen beers a day not to mention the rest of the alcoholic intake she squeezed his leg reassuringly lets wait till we hear something you want to come to bed i want to drink a bottle of gin you could but you wouldnt be happy about that tomorrow no i know plus if abe needs something he shook his head and looked away then came back and met her eyes shit frannie i agree but rachels going to be up early were going to want to be rested ive got to go lie down youre welcome to join me id be lousy company then softening it he patted her hand with his own couple more minutes he said and the phone rang the best bit of news treya was saying to both of them as they listened on the two extension phones is that hes out of his twos evidently the younger you are the worse the prognosis three is way better than two and this is a level one hospital so they had a neurosurgical resident in house which is also lucky since he could go right to work her voice while not by any stretch cheerful was strong and confidentsounding conveying facts honing to the bearable news she was keeping herself together the way she always did by sucking it up theyve cooled him down to make him hypothermic she went on which is what they always do and taken some scans and theyve got him on a continuous eeg and his vital signs are good so thats all heartening but hes still unconscious hardy asked frannie and hardy heard treyas quick intake of breath and flashed their reactions to one another well thats really not so much of an issue now since theyve induced a coma hes going to be unconscious for a while maybe a week or more hes in a coma frannie before she could stop herself its not as bad as it sounds treya said they induce it with some drug to let his brain heal and theyve got him on something for the internal swelling but the doctor says they still may have to operate in fact probably hardy possibly leaving the actual ridges of his fingerprints in the telephone at his ear asked whens that going to be the surgery probably pretty soon maybe by the morning theyve got him stuck with a couple of catheters in his head to measure his cranial pressure it gets above fifteen whatever that means theyre going to have to go in and its at thirteen now up from ten when he got here so do you need us to do anything frannie asked watching rachel is enough i dont see either of us leaving here for a while take whatever time you need trey frannies eyes were locked on hardys as they nodded together dont even think about that its no issue shes wonderful and we love having her both of us both of us hardy repeated so whats next i think probably the surgery what are they going to do they take a couple of bones out of his skull to relieve the pres sure not permanently hardy asked no treya said i dont think so but ill ask now for sure anyway then they make some slits in the dura whats that frannie asked oh youll like this treya obviously wearing herself down trying to keep a positive spin on things it means tough mother what does dura mater its the outer layer of the brain tough and fibrous they make some small slits in it to let the brain expand silence collected in the line as this bit of horrifying yet perhaps good information began to sink in finally hardy cleared his throat so hows abe treya hesitated quiet even for him its not his fault frannie said i know that it might not be so clear to him again a stab at an optimistic tone hell get to it i know he will frannie said hardy not so certain of that especially if zachary didnt make it turned to face away from his wife stealing a glance at his watch he did some quick math if the accident had taken place at fivethirty it had now been five and a half hours after theyd gotten his own son michael to the hospital he had survived for six the womens words continued to tumble through the phone at his ear but he didnt hear any of them over his own imaginingsor was it only his pulse sounding like the tick of a clock counting down the seconds bay beans west enjoyed a privileged location location location at the intersection of haight and ashbury streets in san francisco the large widewindowed coffee shop had opened in the summer of and from its first days became a fixture in the neighborhood it opened every morning at six oclock except sunday when it opened at eight and it stayed open until ten between the ucsf medical school a couple of blocks east the university of san francisco a few blocks north the tourists visiting the epicenter of the birth of hippiedom and the vibrant and wildly eclectic local neighborhood the place rarely had a slow moment much less an empty one the smell of its roasting beans infused the immediate vicinity with a beckoning aroma the management provided copies of the citys newspapersthe chronicle the free press and the bay guardian the papers rarely disappeared before three oclock even the homeless honored the custom except for crazy melinda who used to come in scoop all the papers up and try to leave with themuntil the patrons started setting aside a copy of each paper at the counter for her to pick up whenever she wanted them comfortable colorful couches were available as well as the usual chairs and tables the ethic of the place allowed an unlimited time at your seat once youd claimed it whether or not you continued to drink coffee for the past five years or so customers could avail themselves of free wireless internet service and legal or not pets were welcome for many in the neighborhood bbw was a refuge a meeting place a home away from home at a few minutes before seven oclock on this saturday morning the usual line of about twenty customers needing their morning infusions of caffeine was already growing along haight street at the establishments front door a longhaired man named wes farrell in jogging pants and a tshirt that read dammothers against dyslexia stood holding in one hand the hand of his livein girlfriend sam duncan and in the other the leash of gertrude his boxer they like many others in the city that morning were discussing the homeless problem for decades san francisco has been a haven for the homeless spending upwards of million per year on shelters subsidized rental units medical and psychiatric care soup kitchens and so on now suddenly unexpectedly and apparently due to a series of articles that had just appeared in the chronicle came a widespread outcry among the citizenry that the welcome mat should be removed wes finished reading todays article aloud to sam and folding up the paper said and about time too sam extracted her hand from his you dont mean that i dont i thought i did so what do you want to do with them i mean once you give them a ticket which by the way they have no money to pay so that wont work what part of that statement i hesitate to call it a sentence do you want me to address any part dont be wise im not but id hate to be the guy assigned to trying to diagram one of your sentences youre just trying to get me off the point which is what would you do with these homeless people who suddenly are no longer welcome actually theyre just as welcome theyre just not going to be welcome to use public streets and sidewalks as their campsites and bathrooms anymore so where else would they go are we talking bathrooms they go to the bathroom in bathrooms like the rest of us the rest of us who have homes wes i think thats more or less the point they dont youre right but you notice were loaded with shelters and public toilets they dont like the shelters theyre dangerous and dirty and the streets arent besides this may sound like a cruel cli ché my dear but where do you think we get the expression beggars cant be choosers i cant believe you just said that that is sosam dredged up about the worst epithet she could imagineso right wing wes looked down went to a knee and snapped his fingers bringing gertrude close in for a quick pet its all right girl your mom and i arent fighting were just talking standing up he said shes getting upset so am i if you try to pet me to calm me down ill deck you theres a tolerant approach and meanwhile i hate to say this but its not a right wing left wing issue here its a health and quality of life issue feces and urine on public streets and playgrounds and parks pose a health risk and are just a little bit of a nuisance i think we can admit are we in accord here sam arms folded leaned back against the windows of the coffee shop unyielding sam wes continued when i take gertie out for a walk i bring a bag to clean up after her thats for a dog you really think its too much to ask the same for humans its not the same thing why not because a lot of these people they have mental problems too they dont even know theyre doing it or where and so we should just tolerate it you send your kids out to play and theres a pile of shit on your front stoop next thing you know half a schools got hepatitis you dont think thats a small problem thats not whats happening sam thats exactly whats happening theyve got to check the sandbox near the merrygoround in golden gate park every morning for shit and needles some of these people think its a litter box well i havent heard of any hepatitis epidemic thats way an exaggeration the point is the alfresco bathroom kind of thing thats been happening downtown for years i think youll remember we had a guy used our front stoop at the office every night for a month we had to wash the steps down every morning there sam said that was a solution it was a ridiculous solution it was insane to say nothing about the fact that using the streets for bathrooms punishes innocent good citizens and devalues property aha i knew property would get in there propertys not a bad thing sam which is what every republican in the world believes and some democrats too dare i say most and for the umpteenth time sam its not a republican thing you can be vaguely left of center and still not want to have people shitting in your flowerpots those arent mutually exclusive i think they might actually be well no offense but youre wrong public defecation and homeless encampments on the streets and in the parks are gross and unhealthy and sickening i dont understand how you cant see that sam again shook her head i see those poor people suffering thats what i see weve got a fire department with miles of hoses we could deploy them to wash down the streets the city could get up some work program and hire people to clean up what a great idea should we pay them to clean up after themselves or after each other except then again where does the money to do that come from there it is again money it always comes down to money well as a matter of fact yes sometimes it does the point is wes these people just dont have the same options as everybody else and they never will sam thats rough maybe okay but its life and lifes just not fair sometimes which doesnt mean everybody else has to deal with their problems they get rounded up and taken to the shelters whether or not they want to go and i say its about time without either sam or wes noticing several others in the line both male and female had closed in around them listening in now a young hippie spoke up to wes youre right dude he said its out of control it is about time a chorus of similar sentiments followed sam took it all in straightened up and looked out into the faces surrounding her i just cant believe that im hearing this in san francisco she said im so ashamed of all of you and with that she pushed her way through the crowd and started walking up ashbury away from her boyfriend and their dog sam was the director of san francisco s rape crisis counseling center which also happened to be on haight street her plan this morning had been to take her early morning constitutional from their home up on buena vista with wes and gertie share a cup of coffee and a croissant at bbw then check in at the office to make sure there hadnt been an overnight crisis that demanded her attention but now seething just wanting to get away from all the reactionaries she had started out in the wrong direction to get to the center fortunately the line for the bbw stretched down haight street and not up ashbury and shed gone about half a block uphill when she stopped and turned around realizing she could take the alley that ran behind the haight street storefronts bypassing the crowd and emerging on the next block on the way to her office but first she stopped a minute not just to get her breath but to try to calm herself after an extraordinarily rocky beginning to their relationship she and wes hadnt had a fight in six or seven years shed come to believe that he was her true soul mate and shared her opinions about nearly everything especially politics but now apparently not it shook her and okay she knew that she was among those whom most people would include among california s fruits and nuts she certainly didnt too often doubt the rightness of her various stances she was in her early forties and had seen enough of the world to know that the dollar was the basic problem the militaryindustrial complex big oil and corporate globalism republicans but here now wes who had registered green and hated the right wingers as much as she did was arguing for something that she just knew in her heart was wrong you couldnt just abandon these homeless people who had after all flocked to san francisco precisely because of the benign political environment that would be the worst baitandswitch tactic she could imagine she would have to talk to him but after theyd both calmed down she crossed back to where she wouldnt be visible to wes or anyone else in the line as she came back down the hill it was the kind of clear morning that people tended to expect when they visited san francisco during the traditional summer months those people often left in bitter disappointment at the incessant fog the general inclemency of the weather but today the early sun sprayed the rooftops golden the temperature was already in the low sixties it was going to be a perfect day she got to the alley squinting into the bright morning sun when here was an example of exactly the thing she and wes had been talking abouta pair of feet protruded from the backdoor area of bbw not wanting to awaken the poor sleeping homeless man she gave him a wide berth and only a quick glance as she came abreast of where he slept but something about the attitude of the body stopped her it didnt seem to be lying in a natural position the head propped up against the screen door she couldnt imagine such a posture would be conducive to sleep most of the weight seemed to be on his left shoulder but under that the torso turned in an awkward way so that both feet pointed up as if he were lying on his back moving closer she noticed a line of liquid tracing itself down over the concrete and pooling in the gap between the cement of the porch and the asphalt of the alley in the bright morning sunlight from a distance it could have been water but another couple of steps brought her close enough to remove any doubt on that scorethe glistening wet stuff was red leaning over sam shaded her eyes against the glare and she saw the mans face a face she recognized had expected to see that morning behind the counter where he always was at bbw her hand already trembling went to her mouth at a few minutes past seventhirty a sergeant inspector of homicide named darrel bracco doubleparked on ashbury he unhooked his squawk box handset and draped the cord up over the rearview mirror so that a meter person coming by might surmise that this was a police vehicle and as such shouldnt get a parking ticket just to be double sure though he left his business card on the dashboard of his cityissue pontiac he knew from bitter personal experience that even these precautions might not be enough a crowd of perhaps sixty souls stood beyond the yellow crimescene tape that the responding unit had strung across the mouth of the alley and again farther down bracco saw that the coroners van hadnt yet arrived but two blackandwhite squad cars also helped to close off the entrance to the alley from the inquisitive populace his badge out excusing himself as he went he pushed his way through the mass of people and ducked under the tape a nononsense guy he met no real resistancebracco was fortytwo years old just under six feet tall cleancut casually buffed he nodded to the two uniformed officers who were keeping the crime scene from being violated over by the body obvious enough on the ground by the back door to one of the local establishments another uniform with graying hair and the start of a gut undoubtedly the lieutenant from park station was standing talking with braccos new partner debra schiff debra was thirtyeight wore her sandy hair short and possessed a very good if toughlooking face that looked tougher without makeup for which reason she never wore any bracco flashed his badge and stuck his hand out how you doin lieutenant darrel bracco bill banks nice to meet you thanks for holding down the fort i miss anything fun yet schiff answered shaking her head no waiting on the techs story of our lives huh youd think these people would have the good grace to get themselves shot during regular business hours but here it is first thing on a weekend time the techs get mounted and rolling they might not get here till noon she turned to banks but darrel and i can handle things here lieutenant if you want to get back to your station or go home your call banks clucked and shrugged thanks but if you dont mind ill just hang awhile see where this goes a little he was just telling me he knows the guy schiff said banks nodded everybody in the neighborhood knows him dylan vogler he managed this place and what place is that bracco asked the coffee shop bay beans west takes up the whole corner banks pointed this is the back entrance hes up against also i was just showing inspector schiff see on the side wall that hole in the stucco the bullet but hmm bracco moved over to look more closely what schiff said bracco his face right up against the wall said no blood schiff now over next to him pointed down and said backpack backpack bracco repeated thatd do it then he went down into a squat darrel schiff began a warning note in her voice but he put out a hand im not moving him debra if my eyes dont deceive me that holster on his belts got a cell phone in it he flipped the leather top open aha extracting the device from its holder he stood back up and opened it ice schiff asked pushing buttons on the phone bracco nodded bankss gaze went from bracco over to schiff ice in case of emergency schiff said ice theyre telling everybody to put that in their cell phones now you dont have that in yours banks shook his head im lucky if i can keep the damn thing charged here you go darrel pushed the send button and held the phone to his ear hello he said after a brief moment then identified himself im calling because youre the emergency number on a cell phone in the possession of a man named he raised his eyebrows at banks a question and got the name again from the lieutenant dylan vogler bracco paused listened yes yes he said im afraid so well at the moment im in the alley behind his place of business sure just tell the officers who you are and theyll let you through no you dont want to bring your child can we send someone up to your house to get you okay then okay theres no hurry maam well be here closing the phone he shrugged and let out a heavy breath the wife then cocking his head and checking his watch he turned to schiff not too bad for a weekend theres a siren now by the time the first cops had arrived there had been no question that dylan vogler was completely and absolutely deadno hint of a pulse the skin just warm to the touch his eyes wide open and unresponsive to light or other stimulation nevertheless the first responding squad car cops got some emts down to pronounce him the photographer took a couple of dozen photos memorializing the scene before anyone else touched the body at all behind bracco and schiff the threeperson crimescene investigation unit under lennard faro continued scouring the alley and its environs for evidence although within the first minutes theyd already called faro over to identify and bag as evidence acaliber semiautomatic glock pistol that had recently been fired and a brass bullet casing that probably went with it after watching them poking around and letting the assistant coroner and the photographer finish at long last bracco got to the body the first thing he did was take off voglers light blue backpack so he could turn the body over and look at where the shot or shots had entered he then turned the backpack over to verify the location of the bullet hole and there it was high up in the fabric adjacent to where the slug had exited voglers body surrounded with the bloom of blood that bracco had expected and failed to see around the hole in the stucco after he flipped the backpack over and saw the corresponding exit hole on the other side he sat back and turned to his partner squatting next to him i love opening presents bracco undid the clasp pulled the top up and held it open well look at that schiff said i am the pack was filled to about the twothirds mark with sandwichsize baggies of marijuana bracco removed one of them opened it smelled it again and passed it over to his partner what i dont get he said is why they didnt take this maybe they didnt know it was in there schiff said they definitely didnt know it was in there bracco said they couldnt have known about this much weed and just left it thatd skew my whole worldview someone tapped him on his shoulder and bracco half turned sorry inspector banks said but the wifes here nodding bracco sighed then straightened up hide that backpack he said to schiff we dont know nothing about no stinking backpacks got it his partner replied debra schiff dropped the backpack onto the asphalt out of sight behind bankss squad car turning around she saw that her partner had already gone over to greet the widow who was standing just inside the crimescene tape next to one of the uniformed officers from schiffs distance the woman appeared young and very pretty her shoulderlength black hair still wether morning showerframed a face of pale beauty with wide dark eyes strong cheekbones red lips she wore a longsleeved er tshirt tucked into her jeans but the blousy shirt camouflaged neither her breasts nor her tiny waist coming closer though schiff saw something else around the eyes tooa swelling that might be from the crying but might have another source and under the swelling did she discern a faint yellowish cast to the skin an ancient or notsoancient bruise i can see that its him from here she was saying to bracco her left handno wedding bandwas at her mouth now i dont know if i can if i need to go any closer thats all right mrs vogler schiff inserted herself into the conversation identifying herself and laying a hand on braccos shoulder im not mrs vogler the woman corrected her right away my name is jansey ticknor were not married werent married but just call me jansey okay her shoulders sagged god schiff wanted to get her away from her immediate reaction my partner mentioned a child when he talked to you ms ticknor nodded my son ben hes with our boarder hes fine her eyes went back to the body my god how did this happen we dont know yet maam bracco said we did find a gun did your husband own a gun jansey ticknor blinked into the sun for a moment he couldnt he couldnt why was that schiff asked janseys face went flat she looked from one inspector to the other he served some time in jail when he was younger what for bracco asked she shrugged he was a driver in a robbery it was the only time he ever did anything like that anyway he went to prison so no he couldnt have a gun schiff threw a quick look at bracco there was a real difference they both knew between going to jail which meant the city and county lockup downtown and spending time in prison prison was hard time and in san francisco the probation capital of the western world time in the joint argued strongly against janseys description that it had been the only wrongdoing of dylan voglers life jansey schiff asked did you see dylan before he went to work this morning no he got up early with ben our boy he lets me sleep in on weekends sometimes the body over on the asphalt drew her gaze again bracco spoke up did dylan have any enemies that you know of somebody who was mad at him not really no i guess its possible but he didnt have any power he just ran this coffee shop there wasnt any drama in his life maybe he fired somebody recently schiff suggested something like that no the staff its like only ten people or so and theyve all been here forever she shook her head dismissing the thought whatever it was it wasnt about his job im sure her eyes went to the doorway maybe somebody robbed him his wallet was on him bracco said cell phone no sign of robbery maybe they were going to take his stuff and something scared them away thats possible schiff said what stuff bracco asked she closed her mouth pursed her lips and shifted to her other foot i dont know what you said his wallet and cell phone like that bracco kept it lowkey he didnt have anything else particularly worth stealing that you know of that maybe wouldnt be obvious to us a watch maybe i dont think so no she turned her head back toward the body you cant just leave him lying there we wont jansey schiff said the coroners ready to take him to the morgue as soon as we release him lowering her voice she moved in closer it might save you a difficult trip downtown if you wanted to give us a positive identification now id be right next to you if you think you can handle it jansey was biting her lower lip and eventually nodded putting her arm in schiffs dont let go of me she said in case i fall down or faint or something please i got you okay lets go with bbw closed up schiff told her partner shed meet him at a place she loved that had been serving breakfasts on irving street just west of nineteenth avenue for about eighty years she and bracco had been partnered up for only about six months and still had favorite haunts that the other didnt know as usual the place was packed but also as usual they moved the customers along right smartly so the wait for schiffs table wasnt more than ten minutes shed just had her first sip of coffee when bracco came in caught her eye over the other patrons and threaded his way over to her when he sat down she lowered her cup what took you braccos normal sunny disposition sulked under a shadow he was all but breathing fire but simply shook his head his eyes dark you dont want to know she sipped coffee they gave you another ticket braccos head wagged from side to side they are twentyfourkarat idiots debra im going to find out who wrote this one up and go after him or her schiff said dont forget saying or her i never would of course not in my real life but i dont care if its a him or a her im going to take the sucker down whoever it is you didnt get tagged she shrugged but heres the thing i parked in the street with my squawker hanging from my rearview mirror and my goddamned card on the dash you know bracco homicide with the badge and all you think its possible they dont know that homicide is actually part of the pd maybe they think homicide is like the name of a pest control company i wouldnt rule it out bracco blew out heavily its not right debra its just so incredibly demoralizing it is i agree im not writing up another memo for another bullshit ticket like this the way it worked was that parking tickets incurred by city vehicles required the employee to fill out a form detailing the reason that the parking infraction had been unavoidable and hence forgivable the chief had issued a general order any officer who got a ticket had to fill out the form before leaving his shift for the day of course a lot of times people couldnt be bothered so about every six months theyd get a memo they had to sign and return acknowledging in a sub rosa fashion thatofficiallyparking violations were in fact about as important as murders i wouldnt write it up either darrel call those bastards on it why dont you bring it up to glitsky on monday let him handle it hell go ballistic he hates this stuff worse than me yeah but thats why they pay him the big bucks good point what else is he doing anyway right the waiter appeared at his elbow and bracco looked up anything better here than everything else two minutes later his eggs ordered bracco stirred his own coffee and looked across at his partner so how about our victim i think he hit jansey how do you get that her cheek didnt look right even under the tears she didnt love him i dont think you see how she talked about him he didnt have any power he just ran this coffee shop there wasnt any drama in his life thats not a woman who loves her man so she knew about the weed of course how could she not you notice she didnt say anything about the backpack she might not have known he had it with him she didnt see him leave home you remember but as you said the killing wasnt about the weed or whoever shot him would have taken it if hed known if it was a him well yes that their waiter arrived with their plates and both inspectors dug in for a moment before bracco took it up again you believe her about the gun not for a second i ask if he owns a gun and she says he couldnt not he didnt i heard that so he was shot with his own gun well find out soon enough but thats my bet he know the shooter maybe she chewed for a minute no sign of struggle anyway he gave him his own gun and then the guy shot him with it how does that play i dont know bracco put his fork down actually maybe jansey pretty early for that but maybe she pushed food around on her plate before she looked up we have to search the house i know and bracco added like yesterday joanne ticknor sat next to her husband holding her grandson ben on her lap on the couch in her daughters living room jansey came back into the room behind a man and a woman both of whom were dressed casually but who looked serious and professional mom dad she said these are inspectors bracco and schiff with the police department at the introductions wayne ticknor stood and shook hands and ben wriggled out of his grandmothers arms and came forward to do the same bracco went down on a knee to shake bens hand how you doing big guy okay are you going to find who shot my daddy were going to try ben were really going to try then he looked up at janseys mother but were going to have to have a little adult time to talk before we really get going getting the message she stood up come on ben lets you and grandma go and find ourselves a snack in the kitchen hows that sound as soon as theyd gone wayne asked do you have any leads yet bracco gave him a nod well as a matter of fact we might or at least a place to start including jansey now he continued dylan was wearing a backpack that was full of marijuana did you know anything about that she opened then closed her mouth finally came out with it i didnt know he had some with him this morning but it doesnt surprise me no he was selling it sometimes i wanted him to stop i asked him to stop but he said it didnt hurt anybody and we needed the money that asshole wayne said dad putting ben and you at risk like that what a fool schiff turned to the father you had other problems with him mr ticknor you could say that dad jansey repeated thats enough okay hes dead whatever he did its over now lets just leave it alone can we but bracco wasnt of a mind to do that what else did he do mr ticknor wayne looked to his daughter and shook his head why cant they know what he really was jansey that he wasnt much of a father to ben or that he beat you he didnt beat me she turned to schiff met her eyes he didnt beat me she repeated more softly he hit me a couple of times thats all recently bracco asked a couple of weeks ago we talked about this marijuana thing and he got mad at me but it wasnt really a fight he just got physical for a minute it wasnt really a big deal no no big deal at all wayne put in with heavy sarcasm except for six months ago when she and ben moved in with us for a couple of weeks he was under a lot of stress then jansey said he wasnt perfect okay but nobody is you know true debra said we all have imperfections but maybe one of his made somebody want to kill him you knew him better than anyone else maybe you could help us bracco jumped in was anybody mad at him jealous about his job anything like that nothing schiff asked jansey do you know where he got the marijuana if its any help she continued we brought a search warrant along with us this brought a bit of reaction what for bracco stepped up dylan was on his way to work from here at home which means the weed was probably in this house last night there might be more of it he might also have left some records of where he got it or who he was going to sell it to jansey looked to her father indecision playing over her features finally she came back to the inspectors its in the attic she said he grew it up there debra schiff climbed the stepladder and ducked through the small opening in the upper half of the closet wall and straightened up into a warm and humid room baking in a growlight glow she found a light switch next to the opening and flicked it then spoke back over her shoulder to darrel on the steps of the ladder right behind her youre not going to believe this bracco poked his head into the opening lordy lordy he said the attic space the size of the houses footprint was filled with plants in various stages of growth from justgerminated little shoots in cardboard egg cartons to fullblown sixfoothigh plants in raised planter boxes the air was rich with the resinous scent of marijuana bracco got through the opening and straightened up next to his partner taking it all in they shared a wondering glance and at last bracco let out a breath wow you said it schiff replied how much is this worth ten grand a pound right or close he turned around and peered across the space and into the recesses in the far corners and hes got a jungle of it up here walking over to one of the closer tall plants he reached out and picked one of the heavy and sticky buds rubbing it between his thumb and forefinger then smelling his hand not that i ever inhaled any of this stuff debra of course and not to get too technical but my limited experience tells me that this is some righteously good shit first thing monday morning bracco knocked on lieutenant glitskys door on the fifth floor of san francisco s hall of justice its open bracco turned the knob gave the door a push actually it wasnt glitsky a largeboned man with a prominent hatchet of a nose an ancient scar between his lips and a graying afro sat in semidarknessroom lights off blinds closed up glitskys elbows rested on his bare desk his hands covering his mouth even with half of his intimidating facial arsenal covered up glitskys eyes alone could do the trickthey gleamed like glowing coals the window to his mind announcing to anyone paying attention that it was scary in there today those eyes stopped bracco in his tracks you all right abe glitsky didnt move a muscle still speaking from behind his hands im fine how can i help you darrel can i come in you already are in bracco stood holding the doorknob if this isnt a good time i said its fine get the lights if you want yes sir he reached over and the room lit up glitsky didnt stir finally his eyes moved and met braccos anytime he said whenever youre ready the office featured a couple of folding chairs set up in front of glitskys desk a few more leaning against the wall under the active homicide board bracco took the nearest open one and sat on it pulling a folded sheet of paper from his breast pocket well sir he began i dont know how much youve heard about it yet but we had a shooting out in the haight saturday morning vogler right me and debra pulled it and here i am out there at seventhirty or so and theres no place to park so i double up out on ashbury and you got tagged yes sir again he came forward in his chair and placed the parking ticket on the desk the thing is somebodys gotta talk to them and make them cut this shit out glitsky lowered his hands his mouth expressing distaste bracco whod mentored under glitsky in his first weeks of homicide duty knew his lieutenants disdain for profanity as well as anyone and he shrugged you know what i mean glitskys shoulders rose and fell how many does this make for me like six or seven this year others guys might have more i figured i had to talk to you about it glitsky linked his fingers on the desk in front of him you think this is important yes sir i do enough is enough glitsky nodded and what would you have me do well number one get these tickets erased im out trying to do my job and i have to stop and fill in this totally bogus form thats just wrong abe so i thought maybe you could talk to somebody in traffic and just make it a rule that they cant tag us like this tell em that pretty soon its going to cut into the time we need for our sensitivity training that ought to do the job good idea darrel theyre always asking me how i can improve their operation and now ill have something to tell them glitsky scratched at his jawline or alternatively of course you can fill in the form or go to traffic yourself and make friends with whoevers running the place now plead your case that might work not giving in bracco said i thought if it came from higher up tell you what darrel ill mention the issue at the next chiefs meeting which is in about two hours im sure theyll give it all the time it deserves meanwhileglitsky pointed at the citationyou hold on to that particular ticket call a reporter maybe jeff elliot have him come down and pitch him a citytalk column suddenly the lieutenant pushed himself back from his desk and stood up i dont have you yet on the board coming around he went to the active homicide whiteboard and wrote the name vogler in the victims column then bracco schiff under inspectors finishing he took a step back over to his desk and rested a haunch on the corner of it so where are you on that couple of steps beyond nowhere but only that bracco filled glitsky in on some of the basics the lack of signs of struggle the backpack full of marijuana the apparent murder weapon in the alley because of the dope we got a warrant and searched his house on saturday afternoon and guess what the guy had a full hydroponic pot garden in his attic bracco waited for a reaction a nod something to acknowledge this discovery but glitsky was just staring over his head his bloodshot eyes vacant and glassy abe yeah coming back what an attic full of pot plants good glitsky said yeah we thought so to say nothing of the computer records the guy kept pretty good records on his clients and the wife commonlaw jansey didnt think to delete them before we got there so she knew glitskys gaze drifted back up to the ceiling bracco nodded well yeah meanwhile she the girlfriend jansey moved out with the kid back in with her parents about six months ago for a while why was that just working things out with the relationship if you believe her which debra doesnt again since he wasnt getting anything resembling normal feedback from glitsky bracco waited after several seconds he went on reporting he beat her up sir beat her up yeah go on and because of the weed still there in the backpack were leaning toward some other motive besides that maybe personal maybe like she got tired of getting hit jansey glitsky nodded wearily alibi thats another thing theyve got a boarder living in a room behind their garage young guy med student at ucsf robert tripp says he was with her the kitchen drain was clogged up he was helping her okay well okay except were talking about sixthirty on a saturday morning pretty early glitsky said thats what we thought meanwhile vogler the vic worked all day six days a week so jansey and tripp are hooked up not impossible by a long shot so whats next we talk to him see if the alibi story holds up if not i go back and hit jansey pretty hard but on the chance that its the weed in some way debras got the list of clients shes working through he kept a list he was an organized guy names cell numbers average buy disguised as coffee dates of course proving that this list was his marijuana customers wont be easy nobodys going to admit they were buying dope how many of em are there seventy or so it might take a few days so whatd he do unload this stuff at the coffee shop thats the theory he managed the place and had it all to himself seems like but he didnt own it no the owners a maya townshend were talking to her today see what she knows but the staff down there says they dont know her she never came in the shop if hes dealing to seventy people maybe its a turf thing that might turn up oh and last but not least vogler had a record robbery back in ninetysix jansey says he was just the driver and didnt even know what his friends were doing but i pulled up the file and he was not an altar boy they let him plead to one count but the smart money says he was already in the life and just ran out of luck glitsky took in that information in silence after a minute frowning at the effort to stay involved he looked down at bracco what about the gun on the street with vogler no idea abe other than it was probably the murder weapon probably they didnt run ballistics sure but its our old pal the glock hexbarrel bullets consistent with the gun we found the casing didnt have enough markings for positive id but we got one glock with a round fired one bullet from a glock and one casing from a glock and were running registration today its got a number will wonders never cease well well see bracco sat back in the folding chair so as i say a lots going to hang on janseys alibi but if it holds up were about at square one glitsky nodded and nodded sir bracco asked is everything all right glitsky looked through him then focused on his inspector fine he said everythings fine twentysixyearold robert tripps oneroom studio was a narrow rectangle about ten by fifteen tacked onto the back of the garage it featured a formica counter with the butcherblock knife holder of a serious cook every slot filled with highend cutlerycarving boning and filet knives of various sizes an impressive cleaver and a sharpening steel also a sink and fourburner gas stove a small shower sink and toiletonly bathroom in one corner hed papered the walls with enlarged fullcolor details of human body parts from his medical literature the double bed was made up a flatscreen television sat on a goodwill desk below half a wall of ikea bookshelf packed with cds magazines paperbacks and some folded clothes a wellused bicycle hung from the ceiling it was a little after two pm and with the predictable volatility of san francisco weather the weekends heat wave had been replaced by an arctic afternoon as an early fog had started to drift in just about when schiff and bracco had pulled up and parked on the street out front now the two inspectors sat across from tripp in his medical scrubs at his table in front of the solitary window that looked out onto a small grassless backyard bounded by a weathered brown fence and with moldedplastic swings and a sliding board playset erected in an island of tanbark the disposal was backed up tripp said i already told you guys this we believe you bracco replied were trying to get the timing clear thats all you said this was at sixthirty give or take it was still dark out so it couldnt have been much later schiff sitting back from the table with her legs crossed canted forward a bit and jansey felt okay coming over to knock at your door at that hour the young man lifted his shoulders and let them fall a couple of days stubble darkened his cheeks and the bloodshot brown eyes said he hadnt been getting a lot of sleep that combination lent a few years to an otherwise young face i was already up studying thats all i do every waking hour is study anyway she probably saw the light was on she couldnt fix the disposal herself bracco asked he shrugged again this seemed to be his default mannerism ben you know ben her kid he had a stomachache he woke her up and told her about it right after his dad left for work hed been trying to do the dishes theyd left in the sink or something and then it overflowed and he left the water running the place was a mess the kid was a mess he broke a smile it was a messy morning jansey was freaking out a little thats all it was and this was before she heard about dylan schiff asked of course what was she wearing bracco asked when when she knocked on your door i dont know i dont remember jeans i think maybe a tshirt why bracco came back with another question of his own so she was dressed shoes socks a jacket tripp frowned of course she was dressed why wouldnt she be dressed schiff supplied the answer if shed just gotten woken up by her son and there was disaster going on below she might have just thrown on a robe or something tripp shook his head impatient i just told you i didnt remember exactly what she was wearing i thought it was jeans and a tshirt thats what she usually wears you wouldnt have noticed bracco asked if she was in a robe maybe you were used to seeing her in a robe tripp sat back and crossed his arms whats that supposed to mean it means maybe you were used to seeing her in a robe bracco came forward in his chair what is your relationship with her with jansey were friends friends with benefits you mean am i sleeping with her no im not did i like her getting hit by dylan no to that one too did she come over here to talk about ben or her life sometimes yep schiff took over the questioning did you know dylan well the topic shift slowed tripp down to talk to he was my landlord he didnt treat ben or jansey right but that really wasnt my business i cant say im brokenhearted to see he got killed he put on a good act but he wasnt really that nice a guy janseys going to be better off without him so bracco elbows on the table asked so you were already up when dylan went to work saturday morning i dont know when dylan went to work but if it was after four i was wide awake in here studying until jansey came to the door and that was about sixthirty you said i said i didnt know the time for sure only that it was still dark after the inspectors left tripp followed them outside to make sure they were leaving when the car started up and headed down the street he walked to the back door opened it and walked inside jan in a minute she was in the hallway coming toward him and then she was in his arms they held each other for a long moment until finally tripp pulled out of the embrace at the very least he said they suspect they asked me directly about us but i said no we were just friends and how are they going to prove otherwise looking back behind her he went on so from the resounding silence im guessing they finished up there too she nodded they got it all every leaf every bud every seed jesus its okay actually she said i can always start up again when this has all blown over ive been thinking maybe it would be better if i didnt go back to it at all the inspectors took all the records all the buyers so id have to start completely from scratch and you know theyll be watching the house i doubt that theyve got better things to do jan i mean when theyre done with this case theyre not coming back here to check your attic again she nodded youre probably right but even so its no way to make a living maybe im just starting to realize that now living in fear all the time that youre going to get caught so how much are you getting from the insurance three hundred thats at least a few years i could do something else im sure you could he said anything you wanted probably and you wouldnt care he laughed quietly jan im going to be a doctor im going to make money hand over fist youre going to be able to do anything you want he drew her back into him so wheres our little benjamin now hes still at my mom and dads so were actually alone what are we waiting for maya townshends home was a big cut above average even in its very prestigious location behind a sculpted rose garden the residence rose four stories on the large northeast corner lot of green and divisadero behind it the escarpment dropped off precipitously down to the marina which meant that all of maya townshends back and westside windowsall fortysix of themhad killer views of the bay the rustred golden gate bridge the marin headlands it was a multimilliondollar property and standing out in front of it bracco whistled theres more money in coffee than i thought schiff stared at the immensity of the house shaking her head this isnt coffee money darrel unless she also owns starbucks but in that case bay beans west would have been a starbucks right no way she wouldnt have gone for the brand name it was closing in on one oclock the schizophrenic temperature back up near seventy above them high clouds drifted in the blue a fitful breeze barely strong enough to ruffle schiffs hair hinted of another change in the weather but for the moment it was nice the ornately carved door had an eighttoned ring lord we thank thee we bow our heads schiff turned to him what those bells the song that goes with it lord we thank thee we bow our heads you watch he said shes catholic maybe but the ferry building you might not have noticed plays the same song maybe its a vatican plot before schiff could come back with a suitable wisecrack the door opened to an attractive darkhaired woman in her early thirties who dressed as though shed never heard of the haightashbury or blue jeans for that matter in fact she wore a grownup upscale version of the uniform for a catholic girls schoola plaid skirt over a white shirt under an argyle sweater her hair curled under at the shoulders green eyes flawless skin bracco and schiff hadnt specifically told her when or even if theyd be coming by schiff had talked to her by telephone briefly over the weekend and said that the police might like to interview her sometime about dylan vogler and the business she owned but shed purposely refrained from making an appointment there was the possibility that maya wouldnt be in when they came to call of course but that downside was more than offset by the chance to catch her before shed talked to a lawyer or given too much thought to what she might want to tell the inspectors hello she said can i help you bracco had his id out police inspectors maam homicide we wonder if we might have a word on the dylan vogler matter sure of course she stepped back maybe unable to come up with an excuse on the spur of the moment why this wasnt a great timeand invited them inside through a large square foyer with a thirtyfoot ceiling schiff stopped agog at the panorama through the enormous windows apparently her reaction wasnt that unusual maya stopped and presented the view as though it belonged to her i know she said were very fortunate you must be selling a whole lot of coffee bracco said mayas contralto laugh was unforced oh this doesnt come from bbw this is all joel my husband hes in real estate the coffee shop is really more or less a hobby for me to keep me busy schiff came at her with a casual tone i understand you dont spend much time there maya nodded yes thats true very little but i do most of the books approve the ordering sign the paychecks that kind of thing she shrugged apologetically it might not be really true but i feel like im somewhat involved its good to have something keeping you busy besides the kids and outside of housework maybe you know neither schiff nor bracco was married so maybe they didnt but bracco kept the early patter alive but the place breaks even oh much better than that last year we grossed around forty thousand a month its actually quite a little gold mine all things considered people really like the place suddenly a pout appeared im sorry what kind of hostess am i here we are all standing around would you like to sit down can i get you some coffee or something sittings good bracco lowered himself onto an ottoman nothing for me though schiff took one end of the overstuffed floralprint couch im fine too for another second or two maya stood expectantly then she shrugged and took her place at the other end of the couch so all this business talk is interesting to me of course but thats not why youre here how can i help you schiff threw a look over to bracco and he came forward slightly well lets get the hard stuff out of the way first how long had dylan vogler managed bbw mayas lips turned up thats not a hard one he pretty much started when i opened which was ten years ago and took over fulltime about two years later were you aware bracco continued that he was selling marijuana out of bbw all traces of animation left her face to be honest i had heard a couple of rumors she looked at schiff the female inspector nodded they were evidently true he was growing highgrade marijuana in his attic he had a backpack full of it on him when he was shot hes got records at his house for about seventy regular clients a couple dozen of which weve already talked to he sold it out of the store mayas hand went to her mouth i didnt realize it was sobracco kept up the pressyou didnt know that he had a criminal record her brow clouded as she whiplashed back to bracco well yes i knew about that but that was a long time ago schiff again before he worked for you right bracco doubleteaming you knew about his record when you hired him of course of course schiff asked maya nodded we were friends wed been friends in college usf i knew hed made a mistake but hed paid for it and i had an opportunity to help him get back on his feet it didnt seem like any kind of risk he was a good guy and everybody liked him hes been an ideal manager for all this time she paused i cant believe he was selling dope over the counter at the store thats pretty much established maam bracco said do you mind telling us how much he made working for you for the first time maya showed a reluctance to answer her back straightened for a second i dont see what that has to do with anything nevertheless schiff said it could save us some time still rigid on her corner of the couch now no longer smiling maya looked at her hands in her lap he made ninety thousand dollars a year seventyfive hundred a month a lot of money schiff said as i said maya responded the store made money and largely because of dylans management he did a good job and i thought it was fair to pay him well whats a manager of a starbucks make schiff asked maya shook her head less than that im sure but that doesnt matter im not a big multinational corporation i dont have stockholders i can pay him whatever i want he worked hard and i wanted to keep him happy so i paid him well as i said we were friends in college once i got him set up and especially once he started having a family i felt a responsibility for him is there anything wrong with that schiff shook her head nobodys saying there is mrs townshend but bracco wasnt ready to stop mining this vein he jumped in quickly so did you and your husband socialize with dylan and his wife no maya said no not very much hes my employee after all we have very different lives now suddenly seeming to realize that shed exposed herself somehow maya relaxed back into the couch trailed an arm along the armrest im afraid i dont understand what all these questions are about do you think i had something to do with dylans death or knew more about his marijuana business i dont even know whats going to happen to bbw now i may put it up for sale joel and i dont need it and now that dylans gone theres no real reason she shook her head and shrugged reason for what schiff asked i mean to keep the place i certainly dont have the time to go back in there and work it every day i dont know what im going to do by this time her eyes had taken on a brightness and shineshe seemed to be near tears mrs townshendschiff laid a hand on the couch between themwere trying to get some idea of who might have had a reason to kill dylan its possible he said something to you something he was worried about a staff problem did he fire anybody recently for example no the staffs very loyal he didnt mention anything like that i really just dont have any idea maybe it was just a random shooting maybe bracco said but he wasnt robbed so that leaves us scratching for a motive if its not something to do with the marijuana maya offered i just cant imagine what it would be all right maam bracco got to his feet one last quick thing just for the record would you mind telling us where you were saturday morning clearly the question offended maya but she recovered i went to sixthirty mass on saturday bracco asked i go to mass most saturdays and sundays too its not too fashionable anymore i suppose she said but it brings me a lot of peace well heres to peace schiff said cant have too much of that she rose from her own seat flashed a perfunctory smile we may need to speak with you again at some point thatd be fine maya said if it will help you find whoever shot dylan bracco and schiff were driving back downtown they were stopped at a light at van ness avenue and bracco was in the passenger seat schiff was talking so theyre friends from college and she feels responsible for him and his family but they dont see each other socially and still she pays him nearly a hundred grand a year this sings for you why not bracco said you notice her house her husbands doing okay so why didnt she just sell the shop to him dylan i dont know maybe she hadnt thought of it maybe he didnt ask it wasnt broke so she didnt need to fix it they rode a few blocks in silence then schiff said another thing youre really chewing on this arent you tell me why theres no reason now to keep the shop its pulling in half a mil a year she hires another manager pays him half of what she paid dylan its still making a half a mil a year im not a business gal but i dont see selling something thats making me half a million dollars a year she doesnt need the money give me a break darrel half a million dollars to do basically nothing in the passenger seat bracco shrugged shell sell it for five times that and its out of her hair forever ive got to think she owed him something dylan what if she kept it open just to keep him getting paid youre fishing i am but i got a license they rode in silence for a half a block then bracco looked across at her partner i thought you were leaning toward jansey i was maybe i still am i like to keep an open mind but something robert tripp said stuck with me after a couple of seconds bracco said he didnt give us anything except the alibi no in fact he did he said ben went and woke up his mother saturday morning remember he nodded well schiff went on we can always doublecheckand i intend toby asking the kid about it but thats the kind of detail i dont see tripp or anybody else making up thats the story as he knew it and if its true it means jansey hadnt left the house early to go down and lie in wait for dylan at the store she could have shot him way closer to home anyway so how about tripp as the shooter bracco nodded again he admits he was up maybe its him who went to the store instead of jansey he could have thought he was protecting her who maybe hes got a thing with in spite of him saying no or wants to have one why why what why do it at the store i dont know he says hes walking to school to study and they go down together then maybe he knows dylans carrying a gun and theyre kind of friends so he asks dylan if he can just see it for a minute and bang he darted a quick glance at schiff that accounts for the lack of any struggle he caught him off guard threw the gun away ran back home in time to unplug the sink maybe schiff said could have happened but but nothing as i say im keeping an open mind the next day tuesday dismas hardy sat at a small twotop against the back wall of lou the greeks nursing a club soda and lime as it was still well before noon the lunch crowd hadnt yet materialized and looking around him at the grungy dark semisubterranean watering hole and restaurant hardy marveled anewas he did nearly every time he came herethat the place did any business at all much less accommodated the booming daily influx of people who worked in and around the hall of justice just across the street after all this was san francisco restaurant town extraordinaire you could eat like a king at a couple of dozen places within a halfmile radiuselegant ambience exotic ingredients worldclass chefs superb professional service where you wouldnt find any of the above was at lous the eponymous lou had a chinese wife named chiu who had all the creativity of any of the citys celebrated cooks a fact she proved every day with the special which was the only menu item the place served while showcasing chius culinary wizardry the special also revealed a glaring blind spot in her originalityshe believed that her creations should always and only include native dishes and ingredients from her own china and from lous greece together it wasnt exactly what the rest of california was eating under the name pacific rim fusion but within her rather limited universe chiu for years had been inventing meal after adventurous meal featuring oftenbizarre combinations of wontons bao dumplings grape leaves tsatsiki cilantro duck squid olives yogurtsome of which were tasty many not it didnt seem to matterthe crowds kept coming packing the place for lunch five days a week today the special sweet and sour spanakopita with fivespice lemon chicken had hardy thinking about passing on that selection and walking uptown to sams grill after his meeting ordering some sand dabs and a nice glass of gavi if shed only left out the sweet and sour he was thinking hey diz hardy caught unawares in his daydreaming pushed his chair back and stood to shake hands with harlen fisk a member of san francisco s board of supervisors and nephew of the mayor kathy west fisk at a couple of inches over six feet weighed in at around two hundred and fifty pounds and cut an impressive figure in his tailored italian suit hardy had first met him when harlen had partnered with darrel bracco and worked for a time as a hitandrun inspector in the homicide detail the cop phase had been just another step in the mans political groominghe was going to be wests handpicked successor and everybody knew it at fortyone he was getting to be the right age now but if he was impatient with the wait to become mayor he didnt show it now sitting down he glanced at the special card and grimaced you know he said spanakopita by itself is a fine dish whys it have to be sweet and sour hardy broke his grin i just was thinking the exact same thought and heres another oneif its fivespice lemon chicken doesnt the lemon make it six spices and what are the other five i think fivespice is more or less considered one spice like curry i thought curry was one spice no its a mixture thats why you have different flavors and heats of curries different mixtures of stuff dang just when you think youve got it all figured out hardy said his eyes brightened maybe theyd hold the sweet and sour if we asked fisk nodded we could always try though history argues against it ten minutes later they were served it turned out that as expected the sweet and sour was integral to this particular version of spinach in filo dough and couldnt be substituted out less expectedly when fisk took his first bite he discovered that it tasted pretty good he told a stillskeptical and reluctant hardy my kids like ketchup on spinach this is kind of similar hardy took his own small bite chewed shook his head in admiration the womans a genius he forked a larger portion so he said when hed swallowed whats up my sister harlen said my little sister actually maya her last names townshend now she wants to talk to a lawyer and i thought id recommend you if you were interested in all probability hardy said if its not a divorce i dont do divorce i dont blame you fisk said its not that what it is is she owns bay beans west a coffee shop out on haight you know it ive driven past sure but then hardys brain caught up and he pointed a finger somebody got shot there over the weekend the manager right dylan vogler is she a suspect fisk had a rich twonote laugh and he used it no no no way youve got to know maya little miss junior league mother of two sweetest thing you ever met no what happened is she just got a visit from homicide yesterdayactually in the smallworld department it was darrel and his new partner a woman debra schiff must be if you say so anyway they came and talked to her and after they left she called and said maybe she ought to have a lawyer if she was going to be talking to the police i love people who think like she does and shes not all wrong thats what i told her you cant be too careful on that front although in her case knowing her id say its a bit of a stretch whatd they ask her about she tell you fisk shrugged it all sounded general to me her guy gets shot outside her store theyre going to want to talk to her right it turns out evidently that dylan was selling dope out of the shop and she thinks because she owned it that might get her in trouble she might be right what kind of dope just weed i think how much weed i dont know does it matter it might if it was a major warehouse for distribution i dont think it was that it was mostly a happening coffee shop but say it was what a major warehouse or something hardy fixed him with a wary look you know something youre not telling me no no just to know so i can tell maya if she asks what if this guy dylan was moving large quantities what would be mayas exposure as the owner im not sure hardy said id have to look it up offhand id say shes probably okay if she can prove she didnt know anything about it but landlords in crack neighborhoodsi mean where theyre selling out of every second apartmenttheyve been known to get their property forfeited the word jacked harlen right up forfeited you mean the whole building hardy held up a palm to calm him sometimes but usually this is with bad guys kneedeep in the business if the feds get involved they can take the whole property hardy knew that actually the citys own da could try to take the property too but they never would in this situation he took a bite of his special but thats usually as i say when they know theyve got a live one theyre trying to hassle and that doesnt sound much like your sisters situation not even close diz she didnt know much if anything about this im sure shes a goody twoshoes and would never have taken that risk her husband is joel townshendtownshend real estate struggling by on a couple of mil a year believe me they dont need more money i hate them already hardy said me too but there you go anyway the point is the cops surprised her and got her nervous you know how that is so would you mind talking to her hardy told harlen that that went without saying then pulled a small grimace but its just a shame shes already talked to them thats all i was thinking you know how long they were there darrel and debra she didnt say half hour or so i gathered well probably not too much damage done as long as she didnt lie to them fisk nodded comfortably i dont think you have to worry on that score he said she wouldnt have done that thats just not who she is after telling fisk to have his sister give him a call to make an appointment hardy crossed the street and walked into the massive gray stucco block that was san francisco s hall of justice hed worked there as an assistant da for a couple of years after law school and then for most of another year when hed started practicing law again after hed woken up from his own griefinduced decade following michaels death he thought it said something about the buildings load of negative karma that after all the time hed spent in itit was also where hed tried the great majority of his cases as a defense attorneyhe still found the place oppressive back in the day the front doors at least had lent an air of expansiveness to the front lobby area but since the terrorism experts had closed all but one doorway covering the rest of the front window glass with plywood now everyone passed through the one door waited in line went through the makeshift joke of a security checkpoint metal detector and all and eventually emerged into the din and bustle of the ground floor which housed not only the line for traffic court serpentining its way out of the courtroom and past the elevators but also the southern station of the san francisco police department so uniformed cops were thick on the ground as were lawyers people visiting the jail upstairs workers in the building in its wisdom the city had also licensed a snack and coffee kiosk right out on the lobby floor and the line of cheerful folks queuing up for their something to eat or drink often got tangled up with their counterparts happily awaiting their turn in traffic court hardy had heard that the record for most fistfights in a day over spaces in one line or another was six although that was admittedly an anomaly the average for actual blows struck was no more than one a week but because hed met harlen early to avoid the rush at lous it was high lunch hour when he got to the metal detector and all the various lines within and without the lobby seemed to have merged into one cacophonous mob finally getting to the front of his own line hardy put his keys and his swiss army knife onto the desk next to the metal detector and walked through picking them up without any acknowledgment from the cop manning the station who was turned around the whole time arguing with another cop about when he was going to get relieved so he could have some lunch hardy felt he could have put a stinger missile on the table walked through the metal detector picked up the rocket and gone on his merry way and no one would have been the wiser hed seen plainclothes cops walk through with guns and had always told himself that this was because the station cops at the detector knew the plainclothes but really he wasnt so sure maybe it was just a stupid system that didnt work his sense of the surreal was heightened when he turned the corner and watched the stream of people coming through the completely unsecured back door between the hall and the jail the door was supposed to be locked but anyone who worked in the building for more than a few months could get a copy of the key and polite folks that they were many would routinely hold open the door for anybody else trying to walk in at the same time maybe he thought thats why the cops at the metal detector were so lackadaisical they figured that anybody who had a gun would probably have the sense to walk around the building and come in the back finally entertained by his musings hardy made it to the elevator pressed and rode up pressed by the crush of bodies against the side wall resolving he would never again come here for a social call as he was doing now when he was being paid okay but this was lunacy by contrast the hallway on the fifth floor was a haven of serenity still with all the charm of an eastern bloc housing project still a sterile airless walkway with industrial green tile and fluorescent lighting but peaceful nonetheless somehowstrangelycomforting even welcoming after what hed come through to get there he walked down about halfway and turned into the door marking the homicide detail neither of the two clerks assigned there were at their positions so hardy lifted the hinged counter that separated the room and went through to the hall leading to glitskys office with the metal detector still fresh in his mind and his swiss army knife in his pocket it occurred to him that he could quite easily take a few more steps into glitskys office and cut his friends throat and walk out and in all probability no one would ever know the thought brought half a smile it was a funny world hardy thought if you knew where to look now here he was at glitskys door but it was closed locked up he knocked once waited half a second if abe was in traditionally the door would be open or at least unlocked he turned to leave and heard a drawer slam inside one minute glitsky looked like hellashen and drawnand for a moment hardy thought that zachary hadnt made it and that abe had only just heard tell me hes okay he said the same the induced coma a nod and hardy took a breath of relief glitsky squinted out of the gloom of his office at his best friend what do you want nothing just checking in when treya came by his house to pick up rachel and take her to school that morning hardy had been stunned to learn from her that abe had gone in to work treya as usual had defended himtheyd done the brainopening surgery on zachary sunday morning and there was nothing to be done with him now for at least the next several days during which time theyd be keeping him in what was apparently called a pentobarbital coma abe could either sit in the waiting room at the hospital going crazy or go to work and hope the day passed more quickly hed chosen the latter now after another few seconds staring at nothing glitsky turned back toward his desk and hardy followed him in closing the door hardy reached for the light switch thought better of it pulled around a chair and sat a diffuse light from the high windows kept the place from utter darkness but reading here would be a stretch glitsky sat with his arms crossed over his chest his eyes focused somewhere a foot or two above hardys head from time to time hed draw a breath but nothing so deep as a sigh there was resignation in the wasted face but no rage usually glitskys default emotion the lack of anger worried hardy yesterday morning treya said theyre keeping him unconscious for a few days he said at last you got any more than that no she said the operation was a success in the sense that he lived through it i thought it gave the brain room to swell right thats what it does then what what do you mean i mean what are you looking at whats the prognosis glitsky brought his eyes to hardys it seemed a long time before he spoke either the swellings going to go down and he gets better to some degree although we cant know how much for a couple of monthshe hesitatedeither that or one of the clots breaks up too much or any other random thing happens and he dies the silence gathered you know glitsky said quietly at last im thinking it wouldnt have been the worst result if the heart thing had killed him when he was born zacharys birth had been accompanied by the discovery of a heart murmur which though later found to be benign had raised the specter of his early death from congenital heart failure at least that wouldnt have been my fault this wasnt your fault abe glitsky shook his head you werent there treya told me what happened she wasnt there either so tell me glitskys gaze went back to the ceiling he unfolded his arms and put his palms flat on the desk he was right next to me i mean all i had to do was block him one foot in front of that big fucking wheel glitskys unaccustomed profanity hung in the room a boundary crossed instead i walked over to get his helmet which should have been on him first he leveled his gaze five seconds diz five stupid seconds you know why they call them accidents abe theyre nobodys fault glitsky lived with that for a minute then i think im going to quit quit what this glitsky gestured around at the office here how would that help i dont know maybe it wouldnt he brought a hand to his forehead rubbed at the bridge of his nose what were we saying ive got an idea hardy said why dont you go home and get some sleep take a few days off while this shakes out and what just wait what else are you doing here glitsky looked through him for about five seconds finally he nodded and started to push himself back from the desk then stopped and reached for his telephone he punched a few numbers then after a moment spoke into the receiver hey he said no nothing new diz is up here he thinks i ought to go home and get some rest maybe you want to do the same thing he waited listened for another second or two then said ill swing by and pick you up on the way out when hardy got back to his office on sutter street about twenty minutes after hed left glitsky his receptionistsecretary phyllis greeted him out in the lobby with a chilly smile and the comment that since she kept his calendar it might be helpful if he shared his appointment schedule with her from time to time but i do he said religiously he put his hand over his heart phyllis i hope you know with an absolute certainty i would never under any conditions make an appointment without sharing every detail of it with you phyllis cast her eyes heavenward in her perpetual exasperation over her bosss sarcasm she threw a fast glance back over her shoulder indicating a young woman sitting and perusing a magazine on the couch against the wall behind her circular workstation hardy followed the glance the woman turned a page in her magazine shes here for me he whispered with a bit of theatricality it must be a trick to make me look bad in front of you i swear ive never seen her before phyllis pursed her lips she says she has an appointment referred by harlen fisk a mrs townshend aha she was supposed to call and make an appointment phyllis maybe she misunderstood but the real good news is that this was not my fault at her skeptical expression he added hey it happens leaving his receptionist with a conciliatory pat on the arm he breezed around her and in a couple of steps stood in front of his waiting guest mrs townshend dismas hardy sorry to have kept you waiting she snapped the magazine closed and popped up to her feet her mouth set in a prim line her forehead creased with worry reaching out she took hardys hand in a firm grip as though now that hed finally arrived she didnt want to lose him i asked harlen to have you give me a call to make an appointment im afraid i didnt expect you to come right on down she let go of his hand and brought her fingers up to her mouth oh im sorry i just thought i mean he told me where you worked and that hed talked to you and i was free and just gathered hardy held up his own hand stopping her its okay he said timings everything and yours couldnt be better i was looking at a long tedious afternoon of administration and now instead i get to chat with harlens sister he broke a welcoming grin and guided her toward his office with a hand under her elbow does that also make you the mayors niece yes wellhardy led her into his officeim a big fan of kathys as well since back in her own supervisor days closing the door behind them he motioned to the more casual of the two seating areas a couple of wing chairs by a magazine table can i get you something to drink coffee wine something a little stronger actually well its a little early but im i think i must be a little nervous maybe a glass of wine wouldnt be too bad you dont need to be nervous hardy said nothing we say in this room leaves here if you dont want it to red or white white white it is hardy crossed over to the mirrorbacked granitetopped wet bar that took up most of one of his walls the bar was a bit of a showcase piece with a golden inlaid sink and gold faucet one open shelf for the oversized wineglasses and another for the china cups a large commercial espressomaking machine and a selection of teas mixers and spirits arranged along the rest of the free wall space opening the halfsized refrigerator he stopped and turned back to her again chardonnay or other other i think i think so too maybe ill join you he pulled out a bottle of groth sauvignon blanc serving her he said if you think the bar service here is good waitll you see our legal work he flashed what he knew was his professional disarming smile sat down across from her and took a sip of his wine silently prompting her to do the same now how can i help you after her first small sip she held her wineglass on her lap with both hands i think im in trouble she began i dont know what to do lets see if the first parts true first then see where that leads us why do you think youre in trouble because the police came to see you about your managers death partly that i dont know how much harlen told you but dylan was selling dopemarijuana only i hopeout of my store harlen told me you didnt know much about that i didnt not really then you shouldnt be in trouble he broke a smile that was easy next problem really you mean really you shouldnt be in trouble he didnt feel he needed to go into the lowprobability scenario of a forfeiture yes really but well i mean i own the place im the legal owner if somebody trips and falls there im the one who gets sued hardy sat back put an ankle on a knee and took another sip of his wine thats not the same situation nobodys suffering recoverable harm because they bought marijuana at your place whos going to sue you but she shook her head again im not so worried really about getting sued im worried aboutabout the police coming to talk to me again against all of his training and possibly because of the casual nature of harlens request that hardy have a chat with his sister hardy was tempted for a moment to come right out and ask her if she had in fact killed her manager though he didnt for a minute think that this was likely it was a question you normally didnt ask an unspoken rule of the defense business because if you the lawyer didnt know you would always be acting in technical good faith in your clients defense and of course in theory it wasnt supposed to matter anyway you argued the evidence that could be proved in court not necessarily the facts so instead he said im guessing you really dont have anything to worry about i dont know if thats true she saw her wine sitting there on her lap and brought the glass to her lips why would that be true because your inspector bracco used to be harlens partner in homicide did you know that okay but what does that mean well the first thing it means in the real world is that braccos going to find out youre harlens sister knowing harlens inherent shyness he said with irony he might even know by now so unless braccos got something close to a smoking gun in your hand hes going to be inclined to cut you some slack to begin with youre the one whos lost your manager so youve been victimized by this murder too plus your connection to the mayor isnt going to make darrel bracco want to cause you any problems was he a little hard on you a little bit she hesitated he seemed to think that there was something weird about how much i paid dylan or something about our relationship i dont know what but it just made me uncomfortable its supposed to its one of the things cops do when they interrogate people they find a soft spot and go at it but why did he think it was a soft spot i dont know how much did you pay him dylan when he heard the number hardy kept his face straight and took a quick breath to hide his surprise thats a real salary i know but he did a real job he was good with the customers i hardly ever had to be there if ever i felt he was worth it well then whos to argue you own the place right but inspector bracco he wanted to know if we socialized together dylan and i and and i told him no which is true but he seemed to think that was weird somehow in spite of the fact that dylan and jansey had their own life and its nothing like mine and joels lots of business owners dont socialize with their employees hardy said i dont see why bracco would think its strange that you dont maybe because i told him dylan and i had been friends in college this was before he did his time in prison of course hardy took a beat to let that settle i dont believe ive heard about that yet she shook her head it was a misunderstanding a stupid juvenile mistake call it what you will he got involved somehow in a robbery and got caught but long story short when he got out i was hoping to get the store up and going and anyway he started working for me so you were close friends in college hesitating she tightened her mouth checked out the windows behind hardy we werent intimate if thats what youre asking we were friends hardy brought his glass to his mouth sipped waited she had more to tell him and he wanted to give her the space she scanned the corners of the room telegraphing to hardy the jumble of her thoughts he sat unmoving giving her time finally with an intake of breath she met his eyes i suppose i wasnt exactly the same person then as i am now i wouldnt think so hardy said that was what about ten years ago close enough so youre saying that you and dylan wouldnt have been friends if you met him now she shook her head not the same type of friends certainly and what type was that well she said we were a little wild i guess this crowd of us who just kind of found each other and got into doing stuff together partying drinking pranks you know hardy had an idea of what she was talking about dope mostly just weed she said but yeah some cocaine too once in a while when we could get it she picked up her wineglass and drank half of it down hell why am i sugarcoating this to you mr hardy dismas please all right dismas we would try anything we could get our hands on weed coke ecstasy alcohol mushroom pillsuppers or downers or whatever it was funny she went on it wasnt like we were all stoned all the time i mean we had classes and most of us generally did okay in them i think but then wed get together on weekends and just kind of blow it all out it was really stupid and youre afraid now that the police have this dope connection to dylan that somehow all this you did way back then is going to come back and bite you her expression of gratitude and relief at his understanding made hardy realize how seriously she was taking all of this i really didnt want to know about him selling dope through the shop but if they find out about the way we were in college theyre not going to believe me no matter what i say i dont know if id believe me belief isnt the point hardy said is there anything on your books from the shop that might make it look like you were somehow profiting from his dope business no there couldnt be i wasnt hardy sat back consciously pausing he had no intention of getting answers from his new client relating to the facts of her guilt or innocence but thats where this discussion seemed to be leading them he put on what he hoped would be a neutral expression well as i said earlier given your connection to harlen and the mayor bracco isnt going to be looking to open a can of worms investigating you and then in spite of himself in an effort to give her a touch of comfort he broke his own lawyers rule and added not unless hes got something tying you to dylans murder she took this as a question and evading it swallowed tried a smile met his eyes and quickly looked down hardy whod been about to stand up and walk her out with a figurative pat on the head checked himself and settled back into his chair is there anything else not really but im just afraid it might look id so really rather not talk to the police again its joel too your husband she bobbed her head he didnt know me back then i met him after that time was over i havent been able to make myself tell him about too much of it he thinks well hed never think that i could have been the way i was i dont think hed have an easy time accepting it were the townshends after all hes got investors who count on that so theres a certain expectedshe sighedbehavior hes always wanted me to sell the shop you know why was that it just wasnt the kind of business he felt comfortable with i think the bottom line was that he really just didnt like dylan didnt trust him didnt understand why i kept him on and wouldnt let go of the place why wouldnt you if you didnt need the money and i presume you didnt no it wasnt the money she hesitated then finally came out with it but the shop was my own it made me feel like i was contributing i just couldnt ever convince myself that there was a good enough reason to give it up she let out a breath of pentup frustration anyway harlen told me you could be there with me if the police want to talk to me again just to make sure i dont say something wrong i could do that hardy said and of course i will do that he leaned forward in his chair and leveled his gaze at her but you and i both know you dont need a lawyer to keep the police from asking you about the hijinks of you and your friends in college and practically speaking no ones really going to think you were skimming from dylans dope business if anything people will feel sorry for you that he was abusing your confidence the way he was so youre asking why i told harlen i needed a lawyer never that hardy said with a small smile everybody needs a lawyer all the time thats my motto but in this case from what youve told me maybe not so much you dont think im telling you the truth she said its not what youve said maybe its what you havent he pointed down at her hands and added gently thats a fragile glass if you squeeze it any harder ive got to warn you its going to break for a long moment her eyes glazed over and she sat utterly still finally a small tremor passed through her body she blinked and a tear spilled onto her cheek dylan called me the night before and said he had to see me first thing the next morning that it was an emergency so i went down there you mean saturday morning yes she closed both eyes trying to regain her composure i went into the alley and saw him he was already dead meeting hardys eyes she went on in a rush i didnt know what i should do other than i knew i didnt want to be there i got back in the car and left i mean there was nothing i could do for dylan that was obvious but then when the police came to question me at my house i told them id been at mass which is where i did go afterward except i was very late after communion and somebody might remember that and then i thought what if somebody had seen me and they described me or my car to the police hardy let her sit with her words for a moment then what was the emergency he didnt say just that he had to see me in person i know i didnt know what to do with thatit didnt seem to make much sensebut it was the first time hed ever called with a message like that and i thought i ought to go hardy placed his wineglass onto the small table in front of him suddenly things had turned serious she had lied to the police about her alibi for the time of a murder her reason for wanting him to represent her in the event of another interrogation was now not only rational but powerful given a lack of other quality suspects that fact alone might be enough to give her prominence in their investigation whether or not she was politically connected plus she went on he waited if they check his phone recordsand i guess they do that dont theytheyre going to find out he called me and theyll want to know about that wont they hardy shrugged he managed your store that wouldnt necessarily be incriminating he sat back again how about this when bracco calls again if he does let me know right away and well see what he wants to talk about and then decide if wed be well served by telling him you were there if not we wont hows that sound she attempted a shaky smile a little scary really i just want this to go away not have joel and the kids have to find out the way i was i dont know hardy said finally getting up taking one of his business cards out of his wallet and handing it to her people surprise you they might all understand and then youd never have to worry about it again and you know he added we were all in college and not all of us were saints maybe not even joel shaking her head she said you dont know him shed followed him up and now crossed over to his desk taking her own wallet from her purse im afraid harlen didnt mention what this would cost do you bill me or do i pay as i go whatever youd prefer hardy said willing in this case to break one of the major rules of defense law which was get your money up front but maya was harlens sister and he thought a little professional courtesy wouldnt be out of order going to the file drawer behind his desk he withdrew his standard contract and handed it over to her she scanned it quickly how does three thousand sound as a retainer she asked opening her checkbook thatll probably get you a refund when this is over he said she handed him the check and then they were standing facing each other by the office door so its okay i can call you she asked anytime day or night he pointed at the card all the numbers in the world where i can be reached the gratitude flooded back into her eyes thank you she said and he opened the door to let her out about twenty minutes later hardy picked up the phone on his desk yo yo yourself the voice of his partner wes farrell what are you doing when right now many things all at once hardy said breathing talking to you figuring out our talented pool of associates utilization numbers for the third quarter why because i wondered if you might have a minute are you upstairs wes worked alone on the third floor one level up in an office that had once in a different world been hardys you could always just come on down like you usually do i could but then id have to pass the phyllis test and i dont know if im up to it hardy heard something in the voice wes was nearly always upbeat but he wasnt now if im really not interrupting you at something important you want to come up for a minute sure hardy said im on my way as he passed the reception area phyllis raised her eyebrows and attempted a smile that nevertheless seemed somehow accusatory hardy pointed upward just going to see wes he explained firm business this was the password he knew hardy was doing what she thought he ought to be doing managing the firm phyllis graced him with an approving nod and swirled back to face her switchboard over the years hardy had developed a faint and grudging affection for his receptionistsecretary but as he mounted the stairway at the far end of the lobby he wondered how sad he would actually be if she were say mercifully and swiftly executed by a large truck running a red light farrells door festooned with leftwing bumper stickers yawned open and hardy knocked once before crossing the threshold the office such as it was gave only the merest nod to the legal work farrell supposedly did there no desk no files just a couple of couches a coffee table some random easy chairs a flatscreen tv on one side wall a nerf basketball hoop on another a library table with more functional wooden chairs scattered roughly around it one of the chairs was on its side at the moment gert his dog slept in a corner in another corner by one of the windows farrell did have a modern computer he never turned off and he was sitting at that now though facing away from it and toward him as hardy came in as usual when he wasnt going to court wes wasnt dressed much for success today he wore a pair of wrinkled tan docker pants and wingtips that hadnt been shined since watergate and of course he sported his usual tshirt which today took hardy more than the usual quick glance to read haikus can be easybut sometimes they dont make senserefrigerator hardy had to break a smile pointing to it and saying that might be one of the best farrell looked down yeah i thought itd get sam laughing but no you guys okay the shoulders rose and fell well probably get over it i hope so what this stupid argument or maybe not so stupid if it might really break us up which im starting to think its got a chance what about farrell rolled his eyes sitting in his ergonomic chair he slumped his thick brownishgray hair was unsecured and fell all around to the top of his shoulders hardy thought he looked about twenty years older than he was she thinks i dont care enough about the homeless what about the homeless we shouldnt tell em its cool to come here and then start making them go to shelters and stuff we should respect them as individuals jesus thats how it started anyway now its all shes not sure she knows who i really am or if she still wants to be with me normally hardy would have asked why she wanted to be with him in the first place but this wasnt the time so he asked because why exactly i think in the last fight i used the word vagrant or maybe bum or maybe both i probably did both knowing me when im arguing anyway somehow i betrayed my terminal insensitivity to the plight of he gestured in little circles with his hand et cetera et cetera farrell let out a long breath i dont know what im talking about diz and thats not it anyway what i wanted to see you about hardy pulled the fallen wooden chair upright and sat on it im listening but i hope youre not going to tell me youre quitting because glitsky just told me hes quitting and if you both quit on the same day ill start to feel like all my friends are old which would mean im old and that would be depressing farrells head came up glitskys quitting maybe not hardy said i might have talked him out of it he probably didnt even mean it hes having a bad time maybe we should start a club you dont want to be in his club his kids in the hospital with a head injury shit how bad bad enough but alive at least for now hardy let out his own sigh met his partners gaze so what do you want to talk about farrell came forward elbows on his knees his hands linked tightly in front theres this coffee place out near my house he said bay beans west maybe you read about it this weekend the manager this guy named dylan vogler got himself shot on saturday sam in fact discovered the body well i just got a call on my cell from debra schiff you know her sure hardy nodded homicide whyd she call you farrell hung his head for a minute because vogler sold weed out of the shop and he evidently kept a list of his regular clients on his computer at home he raised his tortured eyes its gonna get out diz hell its probably already out what im wondering is if you think it would be better for the good of the firm if i resigned schiff couldnt let go of what she felt was maya townshends crucial slip of the tongue theres no real reason to keep the place although admittedly slim pickins she felt it was worth pursuing bracco and she agreed however that they could do their fishing elsewhere first before coming back if necessary and taking on maya headtohead to this end in the midafternoon maybe ten other people in the shop they were sitting up near the bakery products area of bbw with eugenio ruiz whod been one of the assistant managers under vogler and whod opened the place this tuesday morning and was currently functioning as the manager eugenio was in his early twenties small wiry and highly strung he wore his thick black hair in a ponytail and had a couple of days of dark beard growth covering the acne scars today he was wearing black slacks sandals an incongruous buttondown pink shirt and a vest that looked like it came from south america a diamond sparkled in his right earlobe though not handsomenot with the prominent and crooked nose and the goldcrowned front toothhe had a confidence and a straightforward warmth that schiff thought gave him some appeal she must unintentionally have been conveying that fact somehow because even though she had at least ten years on him he was definitely hitting on her shes okay he was saying of his boss maya townshend nice enough but not as pretty say as you schiff did her best to ignore not just the comment but braccos quick smirk but you havent really talked to her that often she asked no the longest conversation i had with her ever really was yesterday when she asked me if i would take over the place for a while until she could get a new manager i told her i wanted to be the first to formally apply and she said she appreciated that shed keep it in mind so shes planning to keep the place open bracco asked i hope so i havent heard not why have you but schiff the cop was there to ask questions not answer them how would you characterize mrs townshends relationship with dylan what do you mean i mean how did they act together like friends or more like boss and employee eugenio scratched at the corner of his mouth a smile playing around his lips boss and employee but maybe not the way you think we dont think any way bracco said thats why were asking you schiff shot her partner an unappreciative glance and came back at the witness softening the rebuke what are you trying to say eugenio well just that if you didnt know and you saw them together you wouldnt think she was the boss youd think he was most people i think yeah a quick shrug when i started here the first time i see her come in shes back in the office doing some books or something and its cooking out herei mean we got a line out the door and everybodys in high gear so she comes to the office door and calls for dylan and hes taking the orders and doing his schtick and he just waves her off he doesnt have time makes a joke about accountants when were the actual bean countersget it coffee beans i get it schiff replied deadpan yeah so anyway the whole time shes back there and then finally she just finishes up and leaves without saying anything to anybody else and when it finally slows down i ask so who was that our accountant and dylan about busts a gut laughing that he says is the owner but i he says in that godfather voice he could do im the boss and dont you forget it but not really serious that was the way he talked that was all he could be funny when he turned it on so he was a good boss definitely did you know he was selling marijuana out of here ruiz quickly looked from schiff to bracco and back nope he said no clue did you ever buy any from him bracco asked no way man i dont do drugs a smile at schiff except caffeine of course since ruizs name did not appear in voglers computer schiff was willing to let this answer pass it might even be true lets get back to dylan and mrs townshend if we can all right did he always treat her as though he was the boss and not vice versa pretty much and she took it how i think mostly i mean i dont know for sure but if you ask me its why she didnt come in too often she was nervous like i dont think they really liked each other schiff told him that maya had told them she and dylan had gotten along his eyes went to both inspectors in turn well i dont want to get her in trouble she seems like a nice enough lady maybe they saw each other out of work no bracco said but she did tell us that with dylan dead now there was no reason for her to keep the shop open you have any idea what she meant by that the young man shook his head she didnt tell me she was going to close it up i dont know why shed do that the business is great that just doesnt make any sense in the passenger seat of their car just after the interview with eugenio ruiz bracco hung up his cell phone well thats interesting what guess whos the registered owner of our purported murder weapon ill give you a hint by all accounts shes not quite as pretty as some men find you you caught that huh im a trained detective nothing escapes you want to go by again and say hello i was thinking maybe we should slammed by the admission of wes farrell that he was one of dylan voglers marijuana customers and still worried sick about the glitskys and the fate of zachary hardy couldnt make himself concentrate on his junior associates utilization figures so he decided to leave work early and on the way home to seek an hour or so of solace in the company of his brotherinlaw moses mcguire who would be behind the rail at the little shamrock the bar they coowned out on lincoln near ninth avenue hed just found a miraculous parking place around the corner on tenth and pulled into it when his cell phone rang his most recent client calling in a panic to tell him that the police had just shown up at her door again and she didnt know what she should do it was getting late and the kids were underfoot and joel would be home soon too where are they now hardy asked the cops still out on the porch i told them i had to talk to my attorney before i could let them come in and talk to me again and inspector bracco said that that was fine but i should know that theyd identified what they think is the murder weapon and found out it was mine i mean registered to me is that true i dont know it could be i suppose i had left a gun i bought a long time ago down at the shop but i hadnt seen it in years i didnt know it was there anymore but i guess it was anyway they said maybe i should talk to them here and now if i didnt want to have to come downtown thats a bluff hardy said they cant take you anywhere you dont want to go without a warrant and they cant make you talk to them under any circumstances do they have a warrant i dont think so they didnt say so are they still out there yes i mean its only been he heard her talking away from the phone thats okay honey mommys just he missed the rest of it and then she was back with him im sorry where were we are bracco and schiff still there i think so a pause yes theyre just standing outside talking could you let me speak with inspector bracco please sure if you think just a second darrel bracco here whos this darrel its dismas hardy how are you doing fine maybe a little cold standing outside in the fog but okay call me a mind reader but mrs townshends your client she is i could be there in fifteen minutes how does that sound frankly sir it sounds like shes got herself lawyered up every citizens right darrel no question sir no question though as you know it sometimes gives a cop pause hardy well knew sometimes it should he said but i dont think this is one of those times although ill tell you frankly i dont know how much im going to let my client say to you until ive had a chance to talk to her a little more maybe not much why am i not shocked experience darrel its a beautiful thing can i talk to mrs townshend again sounds like its your show here she is maya hardy said why dont you ask the inspectors in and ill be there very shortly but dont answer questions until i get there is it really your gun it might have been if they say so im sure theyre right hardy wondered why she hadnt seen fit to remember that detail in their earlier interview but this wasnt the time to bring that up but what about joel she asked what about him hes going to be coming home i mean maybe we could meet someplace else later you and me and these people we could do that hardy said evenly what time does your husband get home sixish sixthirty usually but sometimes not its hard to predict hardy took a beat checked his watch its just past four now im sure we can get this all cleared up by five if i come right over but if joel gets home early youre going to have a hard time keeping this from him in any event maybe you want to get that part over with now but meanwhile ill be there in a heartbeat or sooner if you could she said the two unknown guests in the living rooma man and a womanstopped joel townshend in his tracks as he was coming in he looked a question at his wife who was sitting with them making small talk she had turned and now she stood up wiping her hands nervously on her skirt oh joel youre early walking back to him her face a map of her worries she kissed him on the cheek then turned to present the couple on the couch as they were getting to their feet together these are inspectors bracco and schiff they have some questions about dylan and bbw joel put on a welcoming smile took a few steps forward and shook hands all around thirtyfive years old tall and thin with shortcropped brown hair he projected an easygoing casual style only slightly belied by the perfectly tailored tan business suit light yellow shirt and brown and gold tie in fact though he gave no sign that these unexpected visitors bothered him in any way they were guests in his house and he was their host end of story please he said sit back down i didnt mean to interrupt you thats all right debra schiff replied you didnt interrupt anything were waiting for your lawyer anyway joels face clouded in confusion my lawyer actually mine maya reached out and took her husbands hand facing him now cutting off any further response she added a friend of harlens he thought we ought to have a lawyer if were going to be talking to the police about a murder joel made a dismissive gesture and shook his head with a bemused humor thats ridiculous you know i love your brother my but sometimes hes a bit too much of a drama junkie dont you think i hardly believe we need a lawyer to tell these people the simple truth do we you didnt have anything to do with dylans death no but well then and now were making them wait here in their busy day and for what well harlen thought she tried a conciliatory smile mr hardy will be here in just a minute anyway he thought it was worthwhile me calling him and asking him to come by in a bit of theatricality joel cast his eyes to the ceiling well of course he did you ask a mechanic if he thinks you need a brake job ninetynine times out of a hundred guess what you do new pads all around more brake fluid and lots of it maybe balance the tires while hes at it oh and ps thatll be five hundred dollars he looked at the inspectors am i right bracco wasnt completely successful hiding his appreciation at this response but he kept it lowkey were not encouraged to argue when citizens say they want their attorney sir he said but i think its fair to say theyre probably overused especially in situations like this one where your wife is not a suspect well joel said her brothers a big important city supervisor now and when he gets dumb ideas nobody ever calls him on them i know harlen pretty well sir bracco said i used to be his partner when he was a cop now he broke a broad grin the ambition thing makes him a little cautious there you go joel said excessive caution sometimes its just unnecessary still holding mayas hand he gave it a little confident squeeze im sure my wife will be happy to talk to you what do you want to know joel maya now squeezed his hand hard warning him off really my come on this is silly and the doorbell rang there he is now maya jumped as she let go of her husbands hand and ran to the door townshend watched her for a second then turned back to the inspectors and shrugged with some exaggeration fantastic he said hardy walking in to a cool reception at best from both the inspectors and the husband didnt make matters any better when first thing after the introductions he asked maya if he could speak to her alone or with her husband if she wanted i dont think we need to do that joel said maya doesnt have anything to hide she can say anything she needs to in front of me and these inspectors absolutely hardy said if she wants to of course she can maya your call they stood in a frozen tableau for a long moment until she finally turned to face hardy and said maybe joel ought to come with us after his initial stunned expression joel took in the cops again with an apologetic shrug then came back to hardy and maya with a terse all right lets go then maya led the little party of three off to a front working denflatscreen tv bookshelves fireplace closing the door they remained standing because joel gave no one any time to sit down before he more or less exploded although he kept his voice in check maya you want to tell me what this is about she threw a glance at hardyand again clearly this didnt get her any points with her husbandnodded took in a breath mr hardy knows that i went by bbw on saturday morning and saw the body and then got scared and drove away without calling the police joels mouth went tight you went to bbw saturday morning why because dylan called me friday night and said he needed to see me first thing that it was an emergency what kind of emergency he didnt say that but you went yes i went but the real problem ask mr hardy here is that the first time i talked to those people i didnt say anything about that i told them i went to mass the first time you talked to who those inspectors out there this isnt the first time hardy finally felt that he could join the conversation they talked to your wife yesterday morning joel couldnt take his eyes off his wife why didnt you tell me youd talked to them and not told them the truth i dont know joel i dont know i panicked i was afraid or embarrassed or something i thought youd be mad at me being in this on any level for getting you involved she had her arms crossed over her chest displaying more defiance than her words indicated the point is im telling you now all right i dont know what i should do right now and by the way you should know joel that the gun they think is probably the murder weapon is the one i left down there back when i first opened the place like ten years ago and its registered to me she looked from one man to the other and in case either of you are thinking it if i were going to have shot dylan which i never would have done under any conditions period i never would have been so stupid as to throw it away where the police could find it for a minute no one spoke eyes flashed between husband and wife hardy kept his own counsel in silence until he felt again that he would be heard the thing to do right now in my opinion maya is to go out there and tell the inspectors the truth as your husband has said if you dont do that and somebody did witness you in the alley on saturday morning it will look much worse and be a lot harder to explain as for the gun you owned it so what if you kept it at the shop dylan undoubtedly knew about it and probably had it with him illegally for protection while he was carrying the weed what weed joel asked maya shook her head in anger and frustration she spoke under her breath oh jesus dylan was selling marijuana out of your wifes store hardy said in his most neutral voice i dont know why it hasnt been in the papers the cops have known this all along how special for them joel said clearly seething now he spoke in a near whisper how long were you going to keep all this from me maya what is that about i thought we talked to each other we do not so much though as it turns out finally joel brought his attention to hardy so youre suggesting we go outside and tell these people that my wife lied to them is that it omitted hardy said not lied at least then we start over with a clean slate but mayas at the murder scene within apparently minutes of the crime thats true and in point of fact she was now joel came back to her and you dont know what the emergency was no no idea no joel really this wasnt enough for her increasingly furious husband he kept at her so the situation here correct me if im wrong is that dylan called you on friday night saying he needed to see you first thing next morning and you dropped everything and got up at fivethirty lied to me and the kids about going to mass but i did go to mass after joel waved that off after you went to see dylan first for some reason that he wouldnt even tell you is that what you expect me to believe tears glistened in mayas eyes thats what happened joel thats exactly what happened that twerp calls you doesnt even give you a reason and you come running and now weve got the cops sitting in our living room and your lawyer here says we need to tell them the truth except that the truth leaves you going down to visit the murdered man just about the time he was killed and with essentially no reason he turned to hardy how can we tell them she went down there if we cant tell them why can you answer that for me keep it simple he asked her to thats all some problem with the business some decision she had to make in person hardy slowed himself down im sure maya thought it was going to be a quick little meeting and then shed have time to make it back to mass isnt that right maya hardy had given her the answer and was glad to see her embrace it thats exactly it joel i didnt think it was anything really important i wasnt hiding anything from you it was just a small business hassle that i thought id take care of like i have a million others another silence finally broken when joel asked hardy you really think this will fly its the truth hardy said all things considered honestys still the best policy husband and wife stared at each other for a long beat maya reached out and took joels hand in hers that ought to be the end of it she said not exactly joel said extricating his hand from his wifes you and i are going to have to have a discussion we can do that she looked up at hardy meanwhile lets go tell em she said he nodded nononsense all right he said but let me do the talking at tenthirty that night hardy threw the nexttolast dart of his round at the little shamrock bar and it landed in his out spot of double eleven he plocked the next shot directly in the center of the bullseye ending the game he was playing and hed gone out ahead of his opponent wyatt hunt by hitting his last eight throws in a row a fairly nice run and all too underappreciated by hunt his firms private investigator who now owed him not only the tab for the three beers theyd each consumed in the threegame minitournament but the extra hundred bucks theyd put up as the pot no sooner had hardys winning shot landed than hunt handed him the franklin and offered to go double or nothing thats a sucker bet wyatt as you well know hardy took the bill and put it into his wallet but ill buy you a consolation drink to help assuage the agony of defeat assuage is a good lawyer word hunt said you dont hear people say assuage every day no indeed you dont hardy replied and yet sometimes it is the perfect choice le mot juste as hemingway would have said or me if i spoke french the private eye went about six three two ten an athletic hunk comprised of about equal parts gristle and testosterone if you could be handsome in an ugly way thats what hardy would have said he was hed grown up in foster homes done a stint in iraq i then worked a dozen or so years in child protective services taking kids from abusive environments away from their parent or parents pretty much the apogee of thankless jobs now and for the past seven or eight years he ran a private investigations business called the hunt club and hardys firm used it almost exclusively wyatt was leading the way as the two men moved from the dart area and into the narrow recesses of the bar proper which was having a relatively slow night two stools stood open in front of the taps and they got themselves seated that was an obscene run of darts you know admittedly im sure i couldnt do it again although youve got to figure that a guy whos got a board on the wall of his office and his own customized darts probably spends a few minutes playing the game hes going to get a lucky run from time to time hunt was grinning ill try to keep it in mind moses mcguire appeared in front of them and they ordereda club soda for each of them mcguire on a club soda regimen himself for the past couple of years still couldnt help himself whoa he said katie bar the door want those babies fullstrength up or on the rocks the great thing about drinking herehardy ignored his brotherinlaw and spoke directly to huntis the commentary i knew there was something hunt replied rocks hardy said coming back to moses and hold the pithy observations thank you mcguire pulled the drinks and hardy held up his glass to clink hunts i feel a little guilty inviting you down here and then taking your money but thanks for coming hunt sipped his soda long day actually fairly brutal hardy filled him in on the dramas surrounding both glitsky and wes farrell which had continued into the night as hardy after dinner at home went to the hospital to check on abe and zacharyabe still a zombie zachary unchanged hardy had stayed on with abe for a long half hour then patted his friends knee and told him to hang in there call if he needed anything and left unable to make himself go back home to frannie treya and rachel hed stopped by the shamrock and called farrell whod apparently turned off his telephones getting an idea then he had called hunt anyway between abe and wes its like im knocked off my horse i cant seem to get my arms wrapped around this dylan vogler situation not just what its done to wes or potentially could do youre really worried about that a little bit yeah well let me lighten your load diz you can get over that nobody outside of singapore cares about who smokes weed certainly nobody in law enforcement in this town course the bad news in singapore is they hang you for it but the good news is were not there not even wes but id warn him if hes thinking about making the trip ill do that hardy said with a strained tolerance but in actual fact wes is an officer of the court hes a rainmaker for the firm hes hunt held up a hand its only going to increase his street cred among his potential clients diz all of whom probably light up a doob with some regularity the guys one of them judges wont think thats a plus if it gets out i promise how are they going to prove it so his names on a list so what hunt drank hes not really thinking of quitting is he he offered a shrug i told him to think about it some more well before he does anything dumb at least he ought to talk to craig this was craig chiurco one of hunts operatives working on his own private investigators license at hardys look hunt went on this guy vogler had a good book ill give him that hardys eyebrows went up in surprise craig was on this list too hunt bobbed his head yeah and hes actually a pretty big number he came and told me about it yesterday i mean that the cops had called him about it he was worried it might affect his license chances same story if they could prove it it might but without a confession forget it right wyatt said and i dont really see anybody going to go out of their way to bust these guys even if they could prove anything at the most its casual use and then only if they in fact catch em in flagrante hundred bucks if anybody actually cares enough to write you up which they wont not in this town so whatd you tell craig i told him to dump his stash and give it up but really diz its a nonissue vogler maybe not but wes and craig and whoever else nothing hardy glanced over at his companion and lifted his glass okay since youve got all the answers tonight let me ask you another one theres a piece missing somewhere and i cant put my finger on it he ran down what hed learned about maya up to this pointthe mysterious call from vogler on friday night the early morning trip to bbw maya driving away from the body her concern about her supposedly profligate fling in college and then bringing the story around to dylans exorbitant salary the gun and so on when he finished wyatt nodded can you say blackmail okay for what i dont know something shes ashamed of or worried about probably when she was having her wild time back in college thats pretty much what id come to but i didnt want to let myself believe it why not because blackmail comes with implications shes done something bad in the past yeah but nearer the present is the real concern youre thinking she did it hardy hesitated for a few seconds if he was blackmailing her and she went down there on saturday morning the blackmail was the missing piece if its in there the picture gets a lot more clear and maybe real ugly in a hurry you think bracco and schiff have put it together if they havent already they will soon so what do you want to do i thought id ask you to see what you could find out about her college years at hardys nod hunt went on not that i couldnt use the work but why dont you just ask her tell her you figured out she was being blackmailed see what she does well i could but a couple of things first her husband kind of made it clear that he didnt want her seeing me without him being there too so if hes the one she doesnt want to know whatever it isand thats a decent betshe doesnt tell me no matter what next i might be wrong and the accusation might piss her off maybe even enough to where she wants to fire me which would be letting a potential big one get away finally if whatever she did was bad enough that she killed vogler to stop it coming out no way shes just giving it up even privileged to a lawyer she barely knows id be wasting my breath even asking better if i find out what it is on my own then hold on to it and use it as things develop knowledge being power and all truer words hardy said and why do you want to know all this exactly the question seemed to stump hardy for a minute if im going to defend her it would help to know who she is but youre going to bill her to find out something she doesnt want you to know if its going to help her in the long run if it turns out i need her history which now im thinking i might otherwise i step in it without ever seeing it coming and she winds up screwed he tipped up his glass brought it down slowly so what do you say hunt nodded i could give it a couple of days see what pops thats all im asking she gave me three thousand as a retainer you can spend a good chunk of it hows that sound doable hunt said ill give it a run hardy wasnt wrong when he said that schiff and bracco wouldnt be far behind him in coming to the conclusion that dylan vogler was blackmailing maya townshend theyd gotten to it almost by osmosis the next morning at a few minutes after nine am they knocked at the front door of janseys house figuring that she would most probably have known what dirt her man had had on his boss that he had used not only to keep himself gainfully employed but that also allowed him to treat her as an underling when she came into her own store last night in spite of their great frustration at having dismas hardy show up at the townshends to limit the free flow of information the inspectors had learned a great deal most importantly maya had lied to them about her alibi on saturday morning beyond that shed admitted that shed actually been called down to the murder scene by the victim and had discovered his body and then opted not to call the police and report it in the eyes of the inspectors these two revelations elevated maya in a hurry to a person of interest in the homicide she had had both the means and the opportunity to have killed dylan vogler if bracco and schiff could establish a compelling motive they would be well on their way to establishing her as their prime suspect and the fact that maya had apparently been at voglers beck and callcoming down to the store before dawn on a saturday morningargued strongly in spite of hardys disclaimers that theirs was not a simple business relationship vogler must have had something on maya that she didnt want revealed and maybe hed been threatening her with just thatupping the ante on what she was paying him making new demands maybe shed just had enough and decided to put an end to it it wasnt much of a leap for either of them to imagine her killing him and the why of it led them to janseys door again this morning she was barefoot in cutoff jeans and wearing her usual tshirt you guys put in some serious hours you know that you got another warrant not this time schiff said we were hoping youd talk to us about maya her forehead crinkled why i dont even know her you know who she is bracco said well yeah of course i know who she is she owns the shop do you guys hang out with the chief of police i take your point schiff didnt want to antagonize jansey who was at this point about their best hope do you think we could come in and talk for a minute about maya look i really dont know anything about maya but the cops simply nodded until jansey hesitated looked behind her then shrugged indicating they should follow her roberts over having some coffee with me she explained in advance as maya turned to lead the way back into the house bracco flashed his partner a knowing look and schiff acknowledged it with a nod as they fell in behind their witness in the kitchen robert tripp sat at the table again in his green medical scrubs hed heard the doorbell and then the discussion at the door and appeared if not actively enthusiastic about the police presence then at least engaged hey he stood up coming around the table and shaking both of their hands jansey and i are just having a cup he said its hot and fresh bay beanss finest sounds good to me black schiff would take anything that would give her and bracco more time to chat with jansey and robert wheres ben this morning she asked preschool eight to twelve jansey looked at bracco inspector coffee sure he said why not two sugars please jansey was grabbing mugs and putting them on the counter when tripp declared white sugarll kill you bracco let out a halfhearted chuckle that he said or something else i promise you sugars the least of my worries he pulled a chair around and straddled it backward so robert let me ask you this when do you go to school the question perhaps intended to get a rise drew only a muted reply i got off at midnight im back in at noon twelve on twelve off this week oh and im on call during the off hours every third day lest we start to catch up on sleep that would be wrong they dont want you to sleep schiff asked isnt that dangerous for patients if it turns out it is tripp said youre out of the program if sleeps more important to you than medicine you dont want to be a doctor bad enough anyway if lack of sleep affects your performance you dont have what it takes i dont think theres an americantrained doctor in the world who hasnt gone through five years of serious sleep deprivation its part of the culture if you cant hack it get another gig jansey set the mugs in front of the inspectors she put a quick hand on tripps shoulder roberts record is four days without a minute of sleep thats a long four days bracco said tripp broke a tired smile that was a long month inspector let me tell you i finally fell asleep outside an or standing up in the hall which i didnt think was possible until then luckily one of the nurses noticed and got me onto a gurney pushed me into an empty room schiff blew over her coffee bracco took his first slurping sip and pulled his tiny portable tape recorder out and put it on the table jansey got herself settled into the chair next to tripp reached over and touched his hand on the table then brought her hands back clenched in front of her so back to what you came for i dont really know what i can tell you about maya ive only met her a couple of times bracco and schiff exchanged a glance and bracco took the lead were looking at the possibility that dylan might have been blackmailing her the news didnt seem to startle jansey still she asked why do you say that couple of reasons bracco went on first his salary she paid him ninety grand a year for comparison the same job at starbucks pays around forty yeah but hed been there nine years okay so say he got raises every year that brings him up to fifty or even sixty ninetys still a good ways out of the box second some employees at the shop have told us that when maya came in which wasnt very often dylan treated her like she was the help like he had something on her and if he did its hard to believe he wouldnt have mentioned at least something about it to you at some time the young woman stared down at the table jansey schiff put in if he was blackmailing her it may have been part of the reason he was killed this brought her head up you mean she might have killed him we dont know bracco said if weve got a blackmail situation thatd be something wed be forced to consider schiff expanded on the theme it might have just been an ongoing thing covered in his salary so it wasnt like she was paying him every month out of her own cash even the ninety wasnt enough jansey said it was only sixty after taxes you know why do you think he needed to sell weed if he was blackmailing her he could have just asked for a raise and she would have had to give it to him right maybe bracco said but also maybe she told him she was at the limit she couldnt or wouldnt go any higher her husband wouldnt let her i dont know something did he tell you he wanted to ask her for more money recently something that would have made him a danger to her again he always wanted more money she looked across from one of them to the other youre right though about him not being afraid of her or of losing the job but he never talked about why schiff asked the most he ever said was that she owed him there you go bracco leaned forward did he say what she owed him for for a second she appeared to think about it it wasnt like we really ever talked about it she said once or twice he might have said something like she wont fire me she owes me her life but that was just dylan being dramatic she owed him her life im sure if thats a grieving woman bracco said as soon as they were rolling in their car again im the shah of iran i dont think theres been a shah in iran for a few years darrel lucky for me bracco replied and i dont really want a leadership role in iran anyway just think about it no booze no women talk about dull parties i cant even imagine what the inaugural ball must be like but i wasnt so much talking about iran as the grieving part if those two dont have something going on they will soon dont you think if body language talks its already happening and the little kids gone every morning for four hours when tripps home im tempted to give them fifteen minutes and go back and catch them in the act then well at least have caught the future dr tripp in a lie and it might lead to something else like their meshing alibis you think it might have been them together i think that if theyre an item and lets pretend they are they both wouldnt mind seeing dylan dead why wouldnt she just have left him schiff driving thought for a while this isnt a complete list but offhand here are the first reasons that occur to me because of the beatings he had power over her two ben was jansey and dylans kid together or maybe tripp wasnt that serious just some recreational sex while the old man was at work then finally dylan brought in the money and lots of it where tripps a destitute student that enough itll get us started debra in fact assuming tripp and her are serious killing dylans a solution to three of their problems maybe even all four if tripps good for taking over the father role but ill tell you something else whats that im getting sick of all this theorizing you ever get tired of people lying to you no its my favorite but who this time jansey you think she knows what the blackmails about you dont shes lived with the guy for like five or six years and doesnt know something that basic to dylans work to their whole situation if dylan was blackmailing maya she might have known about it might have even been part of it might might might i know i agree and if shejanseyand dylan were in cahoots on that where does that take us it gives her less of a motive to shoot him if thats their business together and that puts maya back square in the middle of the picture except if janseys really in love with tripp and wants out with dylan so weve got maya alone or jansey alone or jansey and tripp together or a random shooter out for a stroll im not leaning toward random shooter no me neither the two inspectors rode along in silence for a couple of blocks until at last schiff said weve got to figure out a way to turn up the heat hardy showed up by surprise with deli sandwiches and diet cokes in farrells office but theyd barely unpacked the lunch when hardy took the call from frannie the partners were both sitting on the dilapidated couch their food and napkins and bags of chips and cans of soda untouched on the low table in front of them frannie told him that shed just gotten off the phone with treya and they had brought zachary out of the induced coma and done something called a pinch test and that hed reacted which apparently was very good news the swelling had gone down considerably and they were now talking about reinserting the dura mater and closing up the brain again within the next couple of days the doctors were starting to think and had told treya and abe that their son appeared to be out of immediate danger on the mend and that he might recover completely although with these types of injuries there would be a long watchandwait period to determine if there were going to be any ongoing problems with development cognition or motor skills this still sounded quite serious to hardy and frannie agreed with him that it was but compared with what theyd been looking at for the past four days it was the best possible news hanging up hardy with a great sense of relief reached for his drink and sat back on the couch see he recounted the gist of the conversation concluding with things sometimes do turn around for the better farrell still wasnt much in the mood to agree with him in fact his confidence and spirits had retreated so far that hed worn a regular business suit to work today and without a funny tshirt under it hed gone out earlier in the morning and trimmed his thick graybrown hair to a length that qualified as relatively normal now wes hunched on the couch holding his sandwich over the table in front of him shredded lettuce spilling condiments dripping sometimes they do and im glad as hell for abes kid and for him but i havent even told you yet about jeff elliots call this morning what did our papers most esteemed columnist have to say he just wanted to give me a headsup cause were friends the chronicles talking about running the weed story and including the whole list of us alleged dopesmoking fiends hardy was shaking his head cant happen wont happen never in a million years why not because your name on a list on somebodys computer doesnt mean anything you didnt admit anything to schiff when she called and asked you about it did you im sure farrell rolled his eyes what im retarded thats my point youre not so you didnt cop to it so shes got nothing she can prove besides no way does this make citytalk that doesnt sound like jeff farrell chewed and swallowed chasing with coke no he was talking regular news and you might be right about the libel problem but the chrons got to be tempted its a great story its a nonstory they cant run it okay good but evidently theres more than a few semipublic figures on the list not including yours truly and wyatts guy and the public would like to know like who hardy asked jeff god bless him didnt want to name names to me but at least one judge more than a couple of city department heads several prominent educators two supervisors a few actors and like that public personalities and oh yeah some das you want to talk screwed hardy said just on the innuendo those das are screwed at least the ones that didnt have the sense to get medical marijuana cards yeah heads are gonna roll for sure if i still worked here id swoop and scoop em up cheap and get em on our payroll youre still working here wes dont worry about that im not worried about getting fired diz he looked sideways down the couch tell you the truth im just embarrassed as all shit to have exposed the firm like this you and gina dont deserve it and it doesnt exactly put on the best face for the associates either does it hardy waved that off wes its marijuana in san francisco in the twentyfirst century its going to blow over in a week maybe two i appreciate your feelings but truly nobody really cares they will if this murder turns out to be about a little benign weed it wont come down like that whoever shot dylan he didnt steal any of it how do you know that he was still wearing his backpack which was full of it how about that how about if he also happened to be pushing a shopping cart loaded with the stuff and the shooter ran off with that that proposal stopped hardy short for a second but then he shook his head banishing the unwelcome thought that didnt happen wes look worst case if the chronicle does the story itll sell a few papers but its a nonissue to everybody else in fact it wasnt a nonissue to at least one san francisco officialthe newly minted special assistant united states attorney jerry glass the previous us attorney in san francisco construed by the attorney generals office to be too liberal had been one of the notorious alberto gonzalez fires upon taking office his replacement wanted to waste no time establishing his credentials as a hardline prosecutor aligned foursquare against the permissive culture of the city that herb caen the legendary columnist for the chronicle had christened baghdad by the bay for some years after his graduation from law school jerry glass had been an assistant district attorney in orange county following his boss the district attorney to sacramento as a speechwriter during the first appointments of the schwarzenegger era eventually catching on as an assistant director of one of californias dozens of bureaucracies the department of alcoholic beverage control glass thirtyfive by now was a wellbuilt though slightly overweight plainlooking specimen with an office workers pasty complexion he shaved close and wore his light brown hair short parted low on the right he trimmed his sideburns up around the top of his ears he was also aggressive and ambitious and had seen his abc assignmentaccuratelyas a dead end hed had résumés out and was in a holding pattern when his exboss now an assistant attorney general in washington dc tapped him for the san francisco job and he jumped at it with this plum in his lap jerry had no intention of following in the footsteps of his predecessor and among other priorities set to work immediately making efforts to shut down the citys medical marijuana parlors of which there were dozens this was always a somewhat delicate endeavor since the state of california as well as the city and county of san francisco either sanctioned or at the very least turned a blind eye to these socalled compassionate use facilities but jerry was there to enforce us not local law and the use of marijuana was a federal crime he got his name in the paper several times during his first year in office for busting some of the medical marijuana folks but except for burnishing his conservative credentialsnot exactly a plus in the san francisco cultural environmentthese actions did little if anything to raise his profile and suddenly here in his office this cool wednesday afternoon all by herself was debra schiff hed run into the very attractive homicide inspector a couple of times at the bar at lou the greeks and hed planned to meet her there some more if he could but here she was now telling him about this murder of a coffeeshop manager out in the godforsaken haightashbury to date glass had only been aware of rumors and what hed read about this particular murder in the papers astoundingly he thought schiff was telling him with a straight face that she and her partner bracco hadnt brought up the dope connection to the news media before because it simply didnt occur to them that it might be of some special importancesince apparently no marijuana had been stolen it couldnt have been part of a motive in the case she waved off his objection no listen jerry theres always dope somewhere in a homicide picture a roach in the driveby car some paraphernalia around a dddomestic disturbancegangbangers loaded up with coke or heroin so its always there someplace you dont comment on it any more than youd talk about the weather in other news tonight she said in her best anchor voice shawahn johnson was shot seventeen times in an apparent driveby shooting in hunters point when the fog was in generally we dont mention the fog but this fellow vogler he had an entire marijuana garden in his attic didnt he thousands of dollars worth right right but again we didnt have any reason to believe that was part of our case at the outset we handed the dope part over to the narcs and that might have been the end of it but for what glass adjusted his spectacles for the next few minutes schiff ran the highlights of their investigation the bottom line though she concluded is that we think in fact were morally certain that maya jansey and robert tripp have lied to us in some cases more than once we have motives for each of them both alone or possibly together in the case of jansey and tripp but almost no evidence and certainly nothing we can use to bring any leverage to bear on getting anybody to talk were pretty sure for example that vogler was blackmailing maya and that jansey may have known about that but if they both say no he wasnt were stuck you cant just lean on them harder we could but as i say its kind of pointless without some new leverage some change in the status quo theres no physical evidence thats very compelling she shook her head besides weve already gone back and talked to all of them at least twice but jansey and tripp are at the very least wellrehearsed and mayas got herself a lawyer plus you know weve got to walk a little easy around her anyway whys that the whole political thing which i hate and darrel hates but there you go the plain fact is darrel and harlen fisk used to be partners and shes harlens sister jerrys eyes lit up are you talking supervisor fisk right which also makes her the niece of mayor west i guess so yeah jerry glass pulled himself up straight in his chair his attention now riveted is mr fisk interfering with your investigation is he talking to your partner not that i know of no that would be a little awkward even if she stopped what well she said harlen among many other names you might recognize was one of voglers regular customers this stopped glass dead he squinted through his glasses across at her marijuana customers youre sure of that absolutely hes on the list the list im sorry havent i told you yet about the list she gave him that news the incriminating computer records anyway in short it looks like theres a ton of connections between all these people and wed like an excuse to shake their trees and find out if we can what those connections are the blackmail for example what was that about was it serious enough that maya might have killed to keep it quiet or on the other hand noglass raised his palm to herhold up a minute lets go back to what might really make a difference youve told me that maya says she didnt know this weed was sold out of her shop right how credible is that to you especially if her brother was one of the customers he waited a smile beginning to play at the corners of his mouth thats what i thought and beyond that if the mayorim kind of new in town but harlens her protégé if im not mistakeni mean shed know as well or might know how much was maya paying vogler again ninety thousand schiff said well thats enough or almost enough to live on right do you think its actually possible that he didnt kick back some percentage of this drug money to maya who had after all set him up in business schiff kept nodding youre saying vogler im saying it sounds to me like he was her partner on the dope side as well which would explain his cavalier attitude toward her as much as blackmail wouldnt it he can treat her any way he wants and she cant fire him can she since hes her supplier theyre in it together hip deep glass was making sense although neither she nor bracco had yet considered the possibility that this whole thing might in fact be about the weed schiffs hope and the reason shed come to visit jerry glass today was that he could start some kind of a us prosecution on the marijuana issues that would make the principal witnesses nervous enough about the possible dope charges against them that in exchange for lenient treatment on that score they would perhaps be inclined to trade information they might have about the murder but now jerrys take took it to a different level contemplating that maya herself might have been the prime mover and armed with political connections and possibly even police protection she would have been all but invulnerable to suspicion much less prosecution and theninstead of this imagined blackmail about what shed maybe or maybe not done in her pastthe murder had simply been the usual dope deal gone bad maya had killed her employee because of any number of common reasonshe wanted a bigger cut he was selling to his own customers and leaving her out he was either getting sloppy or hard to control now jerry glass settled back into his chair his hands clasped on the desk in front of him a faraway glint in his eyes over a tightlipped smile i know how we can get these people to talk he said back in his office once again glitsky sat slumped his elbows on the armrests of his chair his hands joined in front of his mouth he was back in at work because what else was he going to do zachary was coming out of the coma although they were going to operate on him again to close up his skull tomorrow rationally he knew that there was reason for hope and yet all he could feel was a deep selfloathing regardless of what treya or hardy or anyone else said he knew that all of this was his fault through his lack of attention hed allowed his son to be hit by a carthere was still a reasonable chance that his boy could die even if he didnt die he might never be completely right in the head again and they might not know the extent of those injuries if any for years hed left the lights off at the door so again the high windows provided the only illumination and not much of it at that he clearly wasnt welcoming guests nevertheless somebody knocked and he straightened up and intoned come in bracco poked his head in sir lights sure glitsky covered his face with one hand against the sudden brightness then lowered the hand and faced both of his inspectors with a flat eye come on in have a seat bracco was on his way over to a chair but schiff saw him and noticed something and stopped in the doorway are you okay lieutenant he turned to look at her and surprised himself when he said my sons in the hospital he got hit by a car he came out of a coma this morning but hes got another operation tomorrow im sorry ive been out what can i do for you two both of the inspectors broke into condolences and questions and he responded and answered dutifully without really hearing many of the individual words they were just noise against the constant thrum of the guilt in his head and then finally he became vaguely aware that they were talking about something else something to do with their case and after a couple of minutes of thatmostly more white noisehe held up a hand whoa up he said to schiff who appeared to be acting as spokesperson can you repeat that last part are you talking about jerry glass federal jerry glass yes sir but thats what makes this so good at least potentially he says the dope is enough especially in the quantity we found at voglers place to trigger a forfeiture forfeiture schiff nodded with enthusiasm confiscating their property glitsky said i know what forfeiture is debra but whose property maybe voglers if for example we can prove that he used any part of the profits from the drug sales to pay off his house but also maya townshends and even better maybe her husband joels townshend real estate glitsky asked bracco finally spoke it could be huge abe millions and millions they were in the drug business i thought she didnt know anything about that well thats her story schiff said but darrel and i dont really believe it and jerry glass doesnt believe it and he thinks he can get a federal grand jury motivated to prove it well all thats well and good but hows it relate to the homicide youre trying to bring to trial were still doing homicide here right that hasnt changed during my short absence jerry thinks theres much more going on and that voglers murders in the middle of it he gets these people into a forfeiture situation on the civil side then he gets to ask them anything on the criminal side in secret with the grand jury they look into their assets get connections we wouldnt have a chance at plus bracco added the threat alone its pretty powerful leverage they tell us the truth or glitsky cut him off i get the concept he said but i cant say i really like it whats not to like schiff asked well for starters if you dont have any evidence how do you decide that these people are your suspects or that one of them is you leaning toward any one of them maya doesnt look bad for it lieutenant schiff said she was down there it was her gun we know her relationship with vogler was squirrelly at best so bring her downtown and sweat her not so easy schiff said shes already lawyered up your friend diz hardy wonderful glitsky studied the ceiling for a moment then what about this list of voglers customers you dont think its reasonable he was killed by one of them why bracco asked a shrug the usual stupid reasons darrel he cut the dope with parsley and somebody didnt like it or one of em graduated to crack and just went psycho or he stiffed a guy for five bucks or any one of a hundred other reasons have you talked to any of these people some schiff said theres seventytwo of them abe he nodded soberly im sorry about that i really am but it seems to me that at least youve got to talk to them if only to eliminate find out who was where on that saturday morning i know its tedious but thats the job sometimes weve just got to grind it out what about jerry glass schiff asked i dont know glitsky said if id have been here i might have suggested you two hold off on going that route for a while at least until somebody pops up as a bona fide suspect that the forfeiture or the grand jury might squeeze now i think we just gotta hope he doesnt get too much in the way as was often the case early on a workday craig chiurco was lounging in the small reception area of the hunt club wyatts office in the heart of chinatown chewing the fat with his girlfriend tamara dade who answered the phones and occasionally did fieldworktaking pictures tailing female witnesses tamara twentysix tended to dress for the office in brightly colored miniskirts with formhugging tops and there was ample form to hug over the tight and often exposed stomach with its tasteful little gold naval ring today only the rings shape showed under the orange leotard an inch or two before it disappeared into her black skirthalloween was coming up craig maybe five years her senior had been going out with her now for about three years although they still maintained separate apartments after four years working with hunt doing anything he was asked to do but mostly subpoena service and stakeout work craig had acquired enough hours in the profession to start the application process for his own private investigators license but of course being on voglers list his career plans were in jeopardy and he was saying so to tamara who dismissed the idea with a wave wyatt already told you not to worry about that oh okay i wont then craig really hes the one paying you so if it doesnt bother him how is it going to hurt you it goes on my record and i have to put that on my application tamara shook her head its a misdemeanor at most craig that would do it though tam which is kind of the point but you dont even have that the only way that happens is if they catch you with the actual weed being on this list isnt proof of anything and youve gotten rid of all your stuff so even if they come and search your placeas ifthen so what she gave him a tolerant look youre just upset because you got caught and because now wyatt knows maybe some of that except he doesnt care you dont think hes smoked a little weed in his time id bet not much well you might be right there but dont you think he supposes you and me maybe were together a time or two that your alleged dopesmoking took place craig reclining sideways with his knees up over the edge of the small love seat that was the only place for a guest or a client to sit broke a small smile i didnt rat you out tam promise she favored him with her own smile i didnt say you did galahad and i know you wouldnt but that doesnt mean that wyatt wouldnt have put two and two togetheror in our case one and one she picked up an emery board from her desk blotter and started working on one of her fingernails i think the smart thing for you and me to do which weve already done is just take it as a wakeup call to be a little smarter give the stuff up altogether chiurco arms crossed pursed his lips at that request what tamara asked would that really be so hard not really hard more like just unnecessary i like the stuff you like the stuff everybody agrees it shouldnt be illegal so why should i be coerced to give it up entirely tamara held up one finger me me monty call on me how about because it is illegal whether it should be or not and you want to work around law enforcement you get caught with ityou said itits on your record it can affect thingsyour application for example so theres a reason to give it up right there she pushed back her chair and turned to face him the thing is though in real life nothings going to happen around this your name is on a list that may or may not have been this guy voglers clients it might have just been people who owed him money a short laugh that too well thats fine you may know that but the police just cant know anything or prove anything about anybody on that list even if everybody else owned up and said they were his customers that still wouldnt prove that you were and by the way if youre worried that the paper might print it forget it theyd get sued from here to italy it wont happen okay he said im convinced good i mean bottom line is we just dont do it anymore easy enough right it should be chiurco said well there you go done deal wyatt hunt looked briefly out onto grant street through the one window across from tamara in the reception area then turned back to his employees i will entertain even the smallest crumb of an idea do we have a hint chiurco asked of what were looking for or some kind of timeline hardy thinks when she was in college so ten to fourteen years ago in the city here something she was embarrassed by or worse obviously he thinks something she could still get in trouble for if word gets out well said tamara who had taken her share of criminology classes as well the statute of limitations would have run out on almost anything she did back then except if she killed somebody what did vogler do that got him in prison could she have been involved in that hunt pointed a finger at his secretary there you go theres someplace to start if she was any part of that and vogler took the fall for it how well did you know him craig did he ever talk about that not to me i barely knew him at all except through the coffee shop maybe we could get our hands on that list and ask some of those people what they know i wouldnt bank much on that besides im thinking what tam suggests is probably going to be more productive see if he had an accomplice or two and go talk to them hardy should just ask her chiurco said whatever she tells him its privileged right nobody else would have to know i dont see the problem well one problem craig not to sound mercenary is if he asks her and she tells him there goes our fee but the other thing is that shes evidently cut a deal with her husbandhis names joelthat shes not going to be seeing diz except with him there with them too so whats that leave tamara raised her hand like a good student and spoke right out she doesnt want joel to find out ten points hunt nodded thats my guess too which of course means it might not be a criminal thing at all just some behavior shed rather he never knew about she had an abortion tamara said again hunt nodded not impossible especially being a good catholic and all like she is like they are wait a minute chiurco swung his body around and sat up she pays vogler ninety thousand dollars a year just so he wont tell her husband that she had an abortion and voglers the only one who knows i dont think that flies i dont know craig stranger things have happened maybe vogler was the father hunt pushed himself off the window ledge but why dont we see what we can find out about this prison time he did who he might have been hanging with see if it leads us back to maya in any way ill take that chiurco said fine meanwhile ill dig around and see if i can talk to somebody who remembers her from school i talked to diz about this yesterday and hes a little worried beyond everything else weve talked about that if vogler was blackmailing her she might know something dangerous that she doesnt know she knows so theres a bit of urgency chiurco was on his feet im all over it he said at a little before noon with a full blustery fall day building up around them bracco and schiff were back out in the haightashbury this time talking to an elderly woman named lori bradford they were all sitting around a small wooden table with a lace tablecloth in a nook off her kitchen she lived on the second floor of an apartment building looking out over ashbury several structures up and across the street from the alley where dylan vogler had died shed of course seen the police and the crowd last saturday and since then had read about the murder following the story rather closely in the newspaper over the last couple of days she had been trying to decide if it would be worthwhile to call somebody about a possible discrepancy that shed noticed and finally thought that yes it would be and here they all were are you sure about this schiff asked her yes absolutely there were two shots not just one mrs bradford in her late sixties had dressed for her appointment with these inspectors in a pair of purple slacks over sensible black shoes and a black turtleneck i thought at the time i heard them that i should have called nine one one but then there wasnt any more noise and no screaming or anything like that so i just assumed it must have been a backfire or cherry bombs or something if it was a real emergency someone else would have called nine one one anyway i thought it wasnt that i didnt want to get involved people always say that i know that they dont want to get involved but i dont have a problem with that but i think i just convinced myself that it was probably nothing i looked out the window thereyou see how youve got a clear view of the first twenty or thirty feet of the alley anywayand didnt see anything moving or on the street either and then i didnt want to send a false alarm which would have been worse than not calling at all wouldnt it anyway she said and trailed off well its good you called at whatever time maam bracco said but we havent heard anybody else talking about more than one shot braccos face reflected his frustration with san franciscos laissez faire reality this wasnt hunters point exactly in terms of gunshots per minute but bracco thought it wasnt such a high crime area that a couple of gunshots would be a completely normal event and yet apparently no one among the citizenry had seen fit to rally to report them if it wasnt napalm he figured nobody paid attention mrs bradford looked from one inspector to the other as though soliciting their forgiveness nobody else called nine one one then no maam oh then i really should have shouldnt i i wouldnt worry about that mrs bradford schiff said the point is that you called now and were here inspector bracco and i will check with dispatch and see if anybody called to report these shots or make a noise complaint on saturday morning maybe they didnt think it was an emergency and then it wouldnt have come to us through dispatch bracco leaned forward elbows on the table could you tell us a little more about these shots maam how far apart were they spaced for example mrs bradford sat back and stared off into nothing for a second or two id say about a minute a fairly long time anyway they werent right away one after the other i was awake i remember but still in bed when i heard the first one and i kind of lay there wondering what that was for a while and if id really heard it you know the way you are when youre half awake and then i decided id really heard something and got up to see if i could see what it had been and i was just in the hallway there when the second one went off and what did you do then schiff asked well mrs bradfords face grew animated at the recollection well then i of course got to the window as fast as i could and looked down at the street here and i could see the alley too but i didnt know thats where the shots must have come from i couldnt tell anything really anyway but then when i didnt see anybody moving and hear anything else down below there thats when i decided it was probably nothing and not to call nine one one mrs bradford schiff asked did you happen to notice the exact time of these shots yes she said it was ten minutes after six the second one i mean the first one just before that six oh eight or nine she pointed theres the digital on the stove and how sure are you bracco asked that it was the same kind of sound oh the same definitely if the second one was a shot the first one was a shot and vice versa loud and sharp louder than tv back to her recurring theme she said i really should have called nine one one someone might have gotten here in time to catch the killer really mrs bradfordschiff patted her hand on the tablei wouldnt lose one minute of sleep over that youve done the right thing to call us now and this is a very important bit of information that we didnt have before she cast an eye on bracco this may change our entire theory of the case and its all because youre a good citizen we thank you very much on the second flight down the stairs out of earshot schiff started talking about it you believe her i think she heard something there was only one bullet missing from the murder weapon maybe the murder weapon consistent with the murder weapon and i kind of vaguely remember debra vogler didnt shoot somebody in that alley nope and there was only one casing yep which means what it means the womans going on a hundred shes bored living alone she heard some noises maybe the same morning vogler was shot they came out into the overcast and windy day and turned downhill toward haight where even though theyd parked legally in an open metered space darrel had gone through his radioovertherearviewmirror and businesscardonthedashboard routine they were walking on the opposite side of the street from bay beans west and as they came abreast of the place schiff hit bracco on the arm darrel she said wait up look at that they both stopped what bracco asked on the door bracco squinted to look then stepped off the curb and started across the street what is that when they came closer the answer presented itself taped to the front door was an official yellowcolored single sheet of a government document with the heading posting of real property declaring that the establishment was subject to forfeiture to the federal government as the proceeds of trafficking in controlled substances jerry glass schiff said i fucking love that guy dismas hardy hadnt thought to bring his trench coat to work with him this morning and on general principles hed be damned if he was going to take a cab from his office the dozen or fewer blocks to the federal building on golden gate avenue but now he was paying for his stubbornness leaning into the teeth of a minigale as he walked suitcoat buttoned up hands in his pants pockets after the tenthirty am emergency cries for help first from maya and then minutes later from joel townshend hardy had immediately placed his own highpriority call to jerry glass who did not seem inclined to discuss much about the forfeiture situation on the telephoneit pretty much speaks for itself was all the explanation he was ready to volunteer but hardy had an ace or two up his sleeve as well in the person of his former da friend and mentor art drysdale now one of the grand old men of the us attorneys office and ten minutes after hardy got off the phone with art glass called him and told him hed give him some face time if they could do it in glasss office in the next half hour hence the hike but the exercise did serve a couple of small purposes it gave hardy time to think and walking into the gusts and grit really pissed him off now as he walked down the perennially sterile hallway on the eleventh floor hardy found himself forcefully reminded of the last time hed been down to this neighborhood on business it had been directly across the street in the state building at that time probably the best part of six years before hed essentially been accused of setting fire to his own home for the insurance an arson inspector and a couple of detectives had threeteamed and threatened him with arrest until hed called their bluff and simply walked out on them in the middle of the interview he wondered not for the first time if there was some kind of bland but powerful psychic karma in these two governmental edificesone federal and one statethat attracted heartless deceptive selfrighteous bureaucrats for all of his dislike of the physical layout and general tone of the hall of justice at seventh and bryantwhich is where he normally did his businessno one could argue that the place didnt thrum with almost the very heartbeat of humanity in all of its flaws and grandeur by contrast these fat faceless rectangles of glass and granitethe halls were silentseemed the embodiment of the anonymous power of the state to harm and to meddle wherever it saw fit under the rubric of enforcing the rules an aphorism of someone hed once known sprang to his mind the essence of fascism is to make laws forbidding everything and then enforce them selectively against your enemies it wasnt that bad of course hardy had several friends including art drysdale who worked in one or the other of these buildings but he himself avoided them whenever he could all but unconsciously and getting to glasss outer office he could neither ignore the bile that had risen in his gut nor the frisson of what felt like fear tickling at the base of his brain glass evenly carried twenty extra pounds on a frame about the same size as hardys today he wore a gray suit white shirt buttoned tight at the neck a light blue tie with some effort he shook hardys hand over his desk then sat back down and indicated either of the two beige fauxleather chairs facing him hardy generally thought it best to start out civilly i appreciate your taking the time to see me glass turned a hand up art drysdales a legend mr hardy he recommends that i talk to you thats what i do although im not sure how im going to be able to help you well then were a bit in the same boat hows that i think this forfeiture action youre contemplating is going to turn out to be an embarrassment and a mistake i dont know how im going to help you avoid making it glasss mouth tightened the lips conveying a mild distaste im not just contemplating going forward with the forfeiture process mr hardy ive got plenty of grounds and its a pretty cutanddried precedent you deal in drugs your profits and whatever you buy with your profits are subject to forfeiture fair enough hardy said but my client hasnt been dealing in drugs one of maya townshends employees evidently sold marijuana out of her coffee shop but she didnt know anything about it no no and youre sure of that its not a question of whether im sure of it which i am its a question of whether you can prove it which i dont see how you can well thats another matter and what ive already convened the grand jury about as im sure you know i cant talk about what goes on in those proceedings at all but as to whether your client knew this was going onand lets leave for a minute the question of whether she was profiting from the sale of this marijuana herselfit would be hard to imagine that she didnt and why is that because bay beans west has been the subject of no fewer than twentythree nuisance calls from neighbors in the past five years almost all of them concerned flagrant marijuana use much of it in front of children and adolescents the nuisance complaints were of course conveyed not just to the manager of the business but to the owner of the establishment who happens as well to own the building beyond that and leaving out the stabbing that took place in the alley behind the place two years ago to say nothing of the murder last week would you care to guess how many citations for marijuana smoking have been issued in the past twentyfour months on the street directly in front of the coffee shop in front of isnt in glass waved that objection away fortythree fortythree tickets the place is a wellknown dope den mr hardy be that as it may sir and im not denying it the fact remains that my client didnt know much about it she rarely went there she was a silent partner in running the place thats all she knew it well enough to have her civil lawyers come to the zoning commission when some neighbors tried to lift her business license three years ago it went all the way to the board of supervisors mr hardy and some say that if it werent for her brother they would have shut her down then this was completely unexpected and bad news to hardy neither maya nor joel had mentioned anything about it to him okay hardy said conceding the point but this is marijuana on haight street you can get it in any doorway you cant seriously claim that bbw was the source or even a major contributor to all these tickets glass sniffed his displeasure your client is the sister of one of our supervisors and the niece of the mayor and mustnt that be nice his lips turned up but no one would have called it a smile your client certainly knew the kind of place they were running believe me its a plain and simple narcotics operation complete with the gun thats the purported murder weapon for the latest problem there huge amounts of cashfar more than youd expect in a coffee shopand substantial quantities of marijuana on the premises hardy took in this information in silence masking his concern with a nonchalant posturesitting back now arms on the chair rests his foot resting over its opposite knee mr glass he said im not here to dispute whether or not the place was a source for marijuana obviously it was but its a long stretcheven if my client knew about it or had a hunch about it or anything like thatits a hell of a long stretch to prove that she profited from the dope at all do you know who joel townshend is he doesnt need dope money believe me you mean on the theory mr hardy that people who have a lot of money dont want to have more he doesnt need to take that kind of risk to get it he wouldnt take that risk neither would she which came first i wonder the real estate or the drugs mr townshend may have a fortune mr hardy but we intend to claim every dollar of it that came from the narcotics business then well see how much hes got left why would they take the risk hardy repeated glass had a hand stretched out casually in front of him as he scratched at his desk blotter one could make the argument i think youll agree given the shall we say personal relationship between your client and the mayors office that there was no risk here in this city in running any kind of illegal operation now he came forward his eyes narrowing a hint of real anger ruddying up the pale flesh of his face his voice though remained controlled she was paying the man ninety thousand dollars a year for christs sake thats right to manage a coffee shop correct last time i checked that wasnt a crime no but money laundering is he gives her his dope money she puts it in her or her husbands account and they pay him back out of that that wasnt happening hardy said flatly i intend to show that it was you get people worried about their assets youd be surprised what turns up hardy uncrossed his legs and came forward in his chair mr glass have you met these people they didnt do any of this no well well see but whats your point that id like them if i met them socially that it would matter to me im sure theyre charming people who deal in cons tend to be youve got this completely wrong hardy said you dont have any facts that implicate my client in any of this and meanwhile youve got her threatened with this forfeiture its just a blunt instrument at this point well glass folded his heavy hands on the desk itll get us on the road to finding out what we need to know and sometimes you just have to use the tools you got you can still do that hardy asked from the office doorway its like riding a bicycle art drysdale replied once youve got it he caught the last of the three baseballs hed been juggling at his desk tucked them into one enormous paw and with a lot more enthusiasm than jerry glass had evinced sprang up from his chair to shake hardys hand but hey youre looking great how you doin any better and theyd have to change my medication hardy said he cast a quick eye around the premises which sported a lot more personality than jerry glasss digs of course that might have been because drysdale himself had a lot more personality than his gungho new colleague drysdaleno relationship to the exdodger donhad been a professional baseball player in his youth making it up to the giants for a cup of coffee in the midsixties before deciding to go into the law the bookshelf that covered his lefthand wall was packed with sports memorabilia trophies from the pal coaching days photos with the greatmccovey cepeda maysand with his family four boys himself and even his wife usually attired in some kind of sports uniform if i hadnt just come from jerry glass hardy added i might even be positively glowing drysdale boosted himself back up onto his desk motioned that hardy might want to get the door behind him when that was done drysdale clicked his tongue mr glass didnt give you much satisfaction did he oh no to the contrary he was nothing if not informative the problem was that the information sucked you guys can really just take property drysdale grimaced were the federal government diz we can do anything we want why because whos going to stop us then in a different tone i admit its a bit of problem for some of us on both sides that little tiny potential for abuse of the system since if you play it close enough you dont really get seriously called on anything and thats what glass is doing playing it close a nod from what i hear hes pretty much on his game lets say that so what do i do what do you mean i mean ive got a client involved here art in theory im supposed to keep her and maybe even her family out of this trouble drysdale let out a dry chuckle well theres your problem the systems kind of set up to keep you out of it especially if hes using the grand jury which i happen to know he is yeah he told me that too okay so youll never find out what happens there dont even try diz no lawyers allowed no witnesses no talking about anything said there ever ever but you know this okay but hows he do the forfeiture well actually thats pretty slick hes only asking for a civil forfeiture as opposed to criminal i presume but what does that mean it means basically that he posts the property you know anything about this at all not really it doesnt come up every day no id guess not which is why glass can have so much fun with it just for starters you want to guess what the forfeiture rules are administered under the little league drysdale cracked a smile closer than youd think actually the rules of admiralty that was my second guess ill give you partial credit then and you know why it was admiralty rules because since elizabethan times the british empire allowed an action against a ship as a way of getting at the owner they would literally arrest the thing the ship before it took off and make the owners in some faraway country post a bond before they would release the ship back to the high seas then they could collect whatever was owed from the bond in rem jurisdiction latin for against the thing just like here grab the store make the owners come to court to free it in a civil case so basically your clients are going to have to sue to get their shop out of this limbo and surprise the burden of proof is now on them the good news is that they get to stay in businesstheir legitimate businessuntil the final ruling hardy walked over and settled himself into a rocking chair in the corner by the bookshelf so whats the point whats it get glass to just post the place not much if thats all hes doing he might win he might not but either way he gets their attention so what aha drysdale held up a finger so what is that hes allowed to talk about a civil case to the newspapers tv to your clients to the cops to anybody hes doing the public a service by talking about it meanwhile hes stirring the pot to see what rises but as opposed to what id tell you but i know you already know hardy paused and of course the obvious truth emerged the grand jury ta da drysdale spread his hands in a victory gesture two prongs one public one secret his face went dark it is a serious nobullshit press diz and my sources tell me that old jerry is playing it so far like a maestro you know he got his homicide inspectorschiff is itdesignated as a special agent of the grand jury he can do that drysdale tsked i believe weve mentioned that he can do anything havent we he can get the grand jury to designate anybody as its agent and what does that agent have access to grand jury documents including financial and bank records which by the way in real life the fedsuscan subpoena anytime and the state can never ever get its hands on drysdale turned a hand over now of course that agent cant reveal whats in those documentsthats secretbut she can act on her knowledge of them includingyoull love thisbased on this private knowledge she can argue for a judge to order release of these otherwise secret docs and also ps if that doesnt work once the documents leave the grand jury room sometimes they get leaked somehow though that of course again would be wrong hardy could listen to drysdales commentary all day but he wasnt even slightly amused this isnt right art drysdale laughed with some enthusiasm weve barely started diz and if you cant laugh at it youre in deep shit hardy sat back what else you really want to know at hardys nod drysdale settled himself on the desk jerrys got so many ways he can play this its just gorgeous you said kathy west may be involved here right and harlen okay first he has them talk to one of our agents a few times theyre not targets he tells them he wants them to roll over on your client but theyre not themselves part of the investigation so whats that get him well first if either of them tells even a little fib to the federal agent they are in felony land and guess what federal agents dont have to taperecord interviews now youre kidding me would that i were my son but that was j edgars original policy and its in force today so its always your word against that of a federal agent and guess who the grand jury is more likely to believe theyve even got a cute little name for this cute little strategythe perjury trap isnt that special beautiful and im guessing were still not done yet you catch on fast batman you really want to know i want to know where they teach this stuff ive been a lawyer for thirty years and ive never run across it thats not a coincidence diz i promise this is some très arcane shit but anyway since you asked lets say your peoplekathy and harlen and even your clientavoid lying to their friendly federal agent now they go in front of the grand jury as individuals where you remember they are specifically not targets glass gives them immunity for anything they say and whats interesting about that now they cant take the fifth now theyve got to answer every single thing glass asks them if they refuse they go to jail for contempt is that great or what why is that somehow familiar hardy asked because you as a lawyer will remember that this is almost exactly what happened to susan mcdougal in ken starrs whitewater investigation the grand jury called her up and even gave her immunity but she refused to answer questions because she was concerned her statements would be viewed as false theres a nice distinction hardy commented viewed as isnt it well anyway if they were viewed as false then shed be indicted for perjury so she didnt answer and so for her troubles she got slammed with civil contempt where you stay in custody as long as you refuse to answer or until the grand jury term expires which in mcdougals case was eighteeen months holy shit hardy rocked gently his hands gripping the armrests taking it all in so its way more than just this forfeiture stuff whats glass going for money laundering at least plus distribution conspiracy you name itwhere youre looking at major hard time jesus drysdale wasnt smiling anymore either and im afraid it just gets worse diz i cant really imagine how no you probably cant so let me tell you the real ugly truth you should know for your clients sake and kathy and harlens too for that matter that you want to do everything you can to keep them from getting charged at all thats what jerry wantshe wants to force them to cop a plea to maintaining a place even if kathy or even maya had nothing to do with the dope drysdale shook his head doesnt matter they can still both be criminally liable hows that because if any of them has reason to believe there was the criminal activity but didnt ask the jury is allowed to impute knowledge under what possible guise art simple and glorious they should have asked so its deliberate ignorance deliberate ignorance i love that and why would you not its a lovely thing hardy sat still for a long moment his feet planted to the floor so let me get this straight theyre going to get them at least for maintaining a place pretty much automatically it sounds like is that about right close enough then why wouldnt they want to duke it out in court on the moneylaundering and distribution and conspiracy charges good drysdale said i love a guy who pays attention that was just hanging out there wasnt it he absently threw up one of the baseballs and caught it i was saving the best for last i bet you think that if you get acquitted in federal court you cant be sentenced well yeah thats kind of what acquitted means doesnt it ah the naïveté of youth in federal court as it happens if youre convicted on even one count of anythingperjury maintaining a placethe judge can base a sentence up to the statutory max on your acquitted conduct so one small white lie to a federal agentwhich by the way may not have ever been actually toldcould get your client five years federal time and keep in mind that the max for maintaining a place is twenty years and oh yeah theres no parole with the feds so of course they try to plead it out even if it costs them the property maybe thats all glass wants anyway but probably not is that a lovely squeeze or what its unbelievable art theres got to be a way around it well if and when you stumble upon it my friend get the word out and youll make yourself a quick million bucks the first week i guarantee it glitsky said yeah i told debra maybe she moved a little too soon on that glass you know him hardy asked never had the pleasure it wasnt if its any help i kind of tried to call her and darrel off that would have been good if the horse wasnt already out of the barn i told her this being an agent of the grand jury wasnt really recommended sop for what that was worth which from her reaction i gather wasnt much at the table at kokkari glitsky turned a hand over another failure im afraid im going for a record hardy killed a minute lifting a perfect backbone out of the whole sea bass hed ordered for lunch hardy had cabbed back from glasss office and picked up glitsky in front of the hall of justice thinking maybe some great greek food would cheer them both up but so far halfway through the meal it wasnt working too well theyd covered zacharys situation on the drive over the doctors were recommending a few more days in the hospital before proceeding to the next operation to replace the dura mater early the next week the boy had apparently recognized everybody in the family on the visit last night going so far as to reach out and poke his sister whod come along to the hospital for the first time in the arm after which hed broken into a shortlived smile he still hadnt spoken yet which everyone agreed might be a little worrisomeglitsky loved the word worrisomebut his other motor skills had clearly improved the diagnosis had moved from critical to guarded and the general tone of the medical team was one of optimism although very little of that optimism had rubbed off on abe the usually glib hardy kept his peace as he squeezed lemon on his fish selfloathing was about the last reaction hed ever expected to run into from his hardassed longtime best friend glitsky hadnt before harbored too many doubts about who he was or what he was all about or if he did he didnt show it now zacharys accident seemed to have unleashed a pride of demons set upon undermining his confidence and selfrespect hardy chewed then put his fork down you know he began i was the one who changed michaels diaper before i put him in bed that last night i had all the time in the world to lift the side of the crib i mean there i was leaning over the damn thing tucking him in it was halfway up and all i had to do was stand and pull it up the rest of the way easiest thing in the world piece of cake unfortunately the thought never crossed my mind glitsky put his iced tea down halfway to his mouth unfortunately think thats strong enough hardys heart thumped in his chest with an unexpected jolt of rage that it took several seconds to control finally he let out a breath its how ive come to see it abe its what ive had to get to so i could live with it you think ive been lying to myself all these years you said it yourselfthe thought never crossed your mind hardy took a sip of his club soda picking his way with care so youre standing there being a good dad taking zack out on his new bike you get him settled on the seat and think oh yeah the helmet glitsky cut him off his volume up a notch i know what i did i dont know if you do dont push me diz i mean it hardy drew a breath im not pushing you im saying you didnt do anything that caused it the thought never crossed your mind it should have why anything remotely like that ever happen before youve got to think of every single contingency that can happen if that were true youd never let your kids out of your sight ever hell you might not let em get out of bed because something might happen something did happen you didnt make it happen i could have prevented it if id have thought hardy put a flat palm on the table between them if youd have thought he said but there was no reason you should have nothing like that had ever happened before next time okay youll think to put the helmet on first but not thinking of it then wasnt negligence abe it was a freak accident you could do everything exactly the same a thousand times and nothing bad would ever happen again it wasnt your fault glitsky sat hunched forward over his plate their table was by a window and he glared out at the blustering day finally he came back to hardy seemed to force the words out one at a time how can it not be my fault when he was my responsibility if it happens on my watch im at fault this isnt police bureaucracy abe this is your life being a cop is my life dont give me that shit being a cop is what you do the rest of you is your life the problem youve got here is this really happened to you to your boy so youre both victims of it and since the one thing you wont do ever is be a victim that leaves you holding the bag and taking responsibility for it cause thats who you are thats what you do its automatic glitsky spit it out its not wrong either im not saying it is not all the time not usually but this once this one time its beating you down when youre going to need to be strong when treya and rachel and even poor fucking attorneys like me need you to get over it so your troops dont go riding roughshod over their cases you didnt do this you didnt cause it it happened thats all youre a victim of that okay fine legitimately but that doesnt make you any kind of unworthy human not if you dont let it glitskys scar burned white through his lips his heavy brows hung like a precipice over hooded eyes which remained fixed on the plate before him and refused to meet hardys who thought it wasnt impossible that his friend would suddenly either physically explode at him across the table or throw something and storm out instead though the eyes came up you done pretty much glitsky nodded ill give it some thought it was a bit of an extra driveseveral other churches and even st marys cathedral were closer to her housebut maya townshend felt a special energy connecting her with st ignatius the church at the edge of the usf campus and it was where she had driven now she needed all the divine intervention she could get and here is where she most often came to pray for forgiveness those prayers she had prayed here had for the most part been answered answered in the form of joel and her life with him their healthy family their wonderful home and financial security if god had not forgiven her surely he would not have showered such beneficence upon her or so she had come to believe but now she was suddenly not so sure she knew that killing was a mortal sin and wondered if gods apparent acceptance of her penance and prayers was really just the first stage in a punishment that would strip from her all that she loved and cherished if because of all this if she lost joel now or the children or even their home and fortune it would be far more devastating than if shed never known such love and contentment god demanded justice as well as he dispensed mercy the church taught that there was no sin that god would not forgive and that the failure to believe that was the worst sin of alldespair gods mercy was infinite but the key to any claim to that mercy was confession and she could not confess she could never confess and that truth she believed stood to damn her for eternity a regular here she went to her usual back pew and knelt making the sign of the cross then bringing her hands together and bowing her head but no prayers would come her mind kept returning to the lies she had told joel just last night the lies shed been living now for so long the truths that were even worse the padded wooden rail on which she knelt had a gap in the middle of the pew and after only a minute of attempting to pray she moved down and again went to her knees but directly onto that gap now putting all of her weight onto it offering up the pain even as it shot up her leg and became nearly unbearable please god please please forgive me i am so so sorry she raised her head and through tearful eyes tried to focus on the crucifix above the altar far away up front on the suffering of christ but christ had never done what shed done christ knew that gods mercy would save him after the events of the past few days she no longer harbored that hope for herself not two hundred yards away from where maya suffered and tried to pray wyatt hunt turned another page in the yearbook thinking that private investigators in the future would have an easy time of it all theyd have to do with kids who were going to school now would be call up their myspace or facebook accounts and theyd have a blowbyblow account of everything their subjects had done from about sixth grade on maya townshend though at thirtytwo was just a bit too old for that approach so hunt was reduced to searching for clues in the hard copy of her college years of course first hed googled her and her husband and though there had been three thousand or so hits the majority of them by far concerned joels business and their philanthropy for such a politically connected couple there was very little about either local or national politics nor were they particularly active in san franciscos high society hits for bay beans west appeared a whopping four timesall of the stories variants on the little local coffee shop that could standing up to the starbucks giant and making it work not a whiff of marijuana or indeed troubles of any kind on a whim hunt had done a search for dylan vogler and the coffee shop manager had come up completely empty except for references to his death recentlyone of the countrys very few invisible men hunt thought maybe craig chiurco he thought checking the criminal databanks would have more luck his next stop was the library at usf where he started on the yearbook and found the standard posed picture of maya fisk looking about fifteenfreshfaced perfect hair big smile she was one of her classs representatives in student government her freshman year on the debate and im soccer teams active in music and theater appearing in two student productions she was also a cheerleader sophomore year was basically freshman year redux the change must have occurred late in her sophomore year or in the succeeding summer because her picture as a junior was so different from the others as to be nearly unrecognizable though the hair color had turned light and the style more untamed the main change from hunts perspective was the facial expression in place of the adolescent with the sunny smile of the previous two years now a young woman stared defiantly at the camera with a bored smirk seeking another view of this chameleon hunt turned to the club and team pages but here again something drastic had changedmaya had stopped taking part in extracurricular activities in her senior year her photo placed her more closely with the girl from her first two yearsshe wore a passive toothless smile and shed combed her stilllight hairbut it was a more formal portrait than the others had been and again shed joined nothing pretty much striking out with the yearbooks hunt turned to the microfiches of the student newspaper the foghorn for the first couple of years when maya was still active and might have appeared in some captioned photographs with other students in this he was luckier right away here was maya in her freshman year mugging for the camera with three other cheerleader friends at a pep rally hunt took down all the names and three others that he found captioned throughout the rest of her freshman year obviously at the beginning maya had been a popular and involved student shed costarred in othello her sophomore year and there was a picture of her with her leading man a handsome africanamerican kid named levon preslee in an accompanying story entitled its in the genes hunt read about mayas introduction to acting and to the theater through her aunt the truly famous actress tess granat whod by that time been the star of sixteen movies and had appeared in four leads on broadway hunt sat back intrigued by the connection about which hed previously been unaware hed seen some of granats films before he was sure but he couldnt remember any titles or whatever happened to her probably the same thing that had happened to so many former talented beauties who lost enough of their looks to become undesirable and uncastable in hollywood or had she died some tragedy the name tickled a vague memory of that but he just couldnt remember for sure in any event there was no mention in the article that granat had played any kind of a daytoday role in mayas life back then but she was another someone who may have known what the young woman was like or what she had done in those days and he wrote her name in his notepad sure he thought if she was even alive hed just call up the oncefamous movie star in hollywood or wherever she was and chat about old times that was going to happen not but the afternoon after all had not been a total loss when he was finished he had nine names of people mayas age who had known her in college it was someplace to start back in his office downtown hunt realized that having nine names to work with was all well and good but seven of them were women and this made it likely that some of them like maya had changed their last names since college meanwhile he had levon preslee and one other male jimi damico and levon was listed in the san francisco phone book hunt called the number got the young mans answering machine left a message and decided that it was time he got tamara working with him on this tedious business there were several damicos in san francisco and hunt and tamara called all of them hoping to find a jimi but since it was the middle of the afternoon on a weekday between them they managed to talk to only one human being who didnt know a jimi they left more messages as he thought it would be finding even one of the women turned out to be a chore he and tamara were hoping that one of the last names would reveal at least a set of parents who might be inclined to pass hunts name along to one of their daughters but this was going to involve quite a few phone calls and again messages messages messages by fourfifteen theyd been at the whole business for better than three hours when hunt punched up the twentythird telephone number under peterson and a womans voice answered hello he said im trying to reach a nikki peterson this is nikki hunt punched a fist into the air threw a paper clip at tamara to get her attention and let her know hed finally gotten a hit then went into his spiel identifying himself and stating his business when hed finished she said sure i knew maya we were cheerleaders together i dont know where she is now though i havent seen her since college is she in trouble why do you ask that well youre a private investigator asking about her i wasnt great at math but i can put two and two together so she is what in trouble not yet hunt said but she might be getting there pretty quick he told her he was free if she was and within an hour she was sitting across from his desk no longer a cheerleader but from looks alone she would still have a good shot to make the team so hunt asked her im talking to people who knew her back then did you know a guy named vogler dylan vogler she hesitated i dont think so was he a jock mostly i hung out with the jocks did maya hang out with the jocks i mean not really she started out with us then dropped off the team why no idea really maybe it was too much practice i dont know maybe she just lost interest that happens you dont remember any rumors or gossip about her sometime around the time she quit pregnancy abortion anything like that drugs arrests not really no but we werent really that close you know i mean i knew her when she was on the team but after she left like i said i havent heard from her since were there any other cheerleaders who might have known her better ive got a picture of her with you and two other girls in the foghorn amy binder and cheryl zolotny amy no im sure cheryl maybe a little but shes not zolotny anymore now just a second let me think take all the time you need in the reception room at tamaras desk the telephone rang tamara put her own call on hold and answered then said just a minute please can you hold a sec and then nikki answered hunts earlier question cheryl biehl thats it biehl biehl i think shes still in the city she was at the reunion last year you can try her okay well thanks nikki youve been a help shed no sooner left the office when hunt gave tamara the high sign and immediately was on the telephone again hello mr hunt thats me my name is jimi damico you left a message for me and it started all over again nothing gina roake asked nothing it was six fortyfive and gina dismas hardy and wes farrells law partner and hunts somewhat clandestine girlfriend had her shapely legs curled under her on the couch in her wellappointed onebedroom condominium on pleasant street just down from the peak of nob hill hunt sat across from her in one of her matched brace of reading chairs theyd pulled closed the drapes in the picture window behind him and shed turned on some of the rooms lights and the gas firelogs as the nowfierce wind rattled the panes gina barefoot but otherwise still dressed for work in a tan skirt and a beige turtleneck sipped her oban scotch and sighed that sounds like a long day wyatt hunt sat back shaking his head i dont mind long if i get something for it but we finally got to only five of them before i gave it up tamaras still at it and i must say its great to have workaholic employees but its a little weird its like maya almost didnt exist after her sophomore year and theres no way or at least its unlikely she was involved in some kind of scandal whatever it was if she was being blackmailed by vogler he was one of the very few who knew about whatever it was maybe the only one maybe thats why it worked and nobody knew him either not so far the mystery man and youre sure he went there usf diz says so did you check the yearbook and the student paper for him too no hunt made a face the reason i like you is that youre so much smarter than me but say he didnt go to usf so what i dont know you might be able to find out where he actually went which might tell you something you dont know about him i dont know anything about him except he did hard time for a robberywhich craigs checking outthen came back to town and ran this coffee shop and evidently moved a hell of a lot of dope pensive gina absently turned her scotch glass around and around on the arm of the couch finally she looked up at hunt youre saying he went to prison from san francisco yep if he was sentenced to prison he had a presentence report and the background section of that is going to tell you everything they could find out about him at the time surely you have a close personal friend in probation hunt considered for a moment have i already told you youre way smarter than me at hardys house less than twenty blocks from the ocean out in the avenues the approaching storm decided to get serious a heavy winddriven rain raked the rooftop turning the skylight over their kitchen into a booming kettle drum that reverberated through the rooms hardy on the wall telephone trying to hear his client over the din stood frowning with his finger in one ear and the receiver at the other the best advice he said is dont panic i got the impression that mr glass sees a political opportunity here he wants to get his name in the paper and he thinks tweaking you to get at your brother and the mayor is as good a way as any this hardy knew was easy for him to say but not so easy for the townshends to live with the truth verified that afternoon by art drysdale was that jerry glass was moving with an almost unheard of dispatch to bring pressure to bear on joel and maya seen in the kindest possible light maybe glass was motivated by a desire to help schiff and bracco solve their homicide but hardy didnt really buy that and by the time they both hung up he didnt feel like hed done much of a job consoling or reassuring his client still angry about glass and the way he was operating hardy thought a beer wouldnt hurt him and he opened an anchor steam and then placed a call to harlen fisk the supervisor picked up on the second ring yo diz whats up have you talked to your sister recently hardy heard a sigh i talked to joel earlier today well if it was before noon its gotten worse since then now theyre looking for a court order to freeze joels accounts jesus why because they can theyre saying theyve got a moneylaundering case but im thinking the real reason is so that jerry glass can finally get some national profile for being a good conservative prosecutor with the guts to be tough on dope he busts the compassionate use spots the only people who care at all think hes wrong and none of them are in the media but he ties you and your aunt into a bona fide dope operation i dont care how obliquely and you watch hes a household name in a week or so joel and maya arent running a dope operation diz guaranteed right but the problem is that he doesnt have to prove it to make noise about it can he do that i mean just freeze assets hes the us government he can sure try i dont think hell actually find a judge wholl approve it but hes got your sister half around the bend with worry but what about the forfeiture forfeiture is a civil case so in essence hes just filing a lawsuit i havent turned on the tv yet but the smart money says this gets covered tonight and tomorrow its in the paper shit i agree which is why i called you maybe theres something we can do to keep this from exploding any bigger than it has to like what like the first thing is call him on it get him back on defense a little you and kathy get together and make a strong public statement that this is just a political ploy another partisan attack on liberals then you get the medical marijuana or compassionate use people to go nuts its about politics pure and simple the second thing is something ive already got my investigator working on but maybe you can help me with it better than anybody else if i can im in what hardy tipped up his bottle well it looks like both me and homicide have come up with the same theory and thats that vogler was connected to maya in something that happened a long time ago the bad news would be if that connection gives her a motive to have killed him jesus christ diz maya didnt kill anybody thats crazy i hope youre right but you hope youre her lawyer diz youve got to do more than hope shes not some kind of a murderer shes my little sister for christs sake hardy kept his voice modulated this hasnt come out yet but youve got to know that she was down there that morning harlen vogler might have been squeezing or threatening her the homicide inspectors went to glass to try to get maya to start talking darrel did that glitsky said it was schiff but darrels on board with her thats bullshit im going to call him dont do that please dont do that they havent arrested her yet they dont have enough but if you try to pressure them not to i guarantee it wont help theyll think she ran to you for protection because shes guilty and you could pull strings this is insane its the way it is harlen so what did you want me to do about this connection see if you can get her to tell me what it was what exactly what was her history with this loser who treated her so badly why was she paying him ninety grand when the going rate is about half that ive already heard her answer to that it was a point of contention between her and joel at first she felt sorry for him and wanted to help him get back on his feet after he got out of prison and then he did such a good job ive heard that one too you dont think its true maybe i would if he hadnt treated her like the help but he did at this fisk went silent for a long beat so if and when we find out assuming shell tell me then what i dont want her to tell you harlen she cant tell you youre not her lawyer theres no privilege youd have to repeat anything she told you in court if you got a subpeona you have to get her to tell me or one of my investigators then at least weve got answers were dealing with the reality of what was going on down there glass is going on the theory that the ninety grand was money laundering through the drug business we need to explain away the high salary without any reference to the dope but as you say it also gives her a motive to have killed him this of course remained a true source of concern but hardy spun it the best he could im hoping if we can somehow defuse glass darrel and schiff wont get enough youre saying you think she might actually have done it im her lawyer harlen im trying to keep her out of jail jerry glass is trying to make her a drug dealer if shes a drug dealer shes a much more likely killer to darrel and schiff at this point its mostly a matter of perception and admittedly it isnt much but its about all we got the hardys rented a double garage only a couple of blocks from their home and most of the time this was an advantage over having to drive around the neighborhood for long minutes in search of a parking place tonight however the short walk through the ongoing monsoon had delivered frannie soaked and freezing to her home about five minutes after her husbands talk with harlen fisk he poured her a glass of wine to go with his second beer and suggested she go upstairs and run a hot bath while he made them one of his extemporaneous blackfryingpan meals since these were usually greattasting and an absolute snap to clean frannie agreed gave him a shivering kiss and a quick hug and disappeared up the stairs the heavy wellseasoned castiron pan was the one possession that hardy retained from his childhood and he treated it with great care normally it hung on a marlin hook behind the stove and now he took it down and after admiring the look of it for a moment he ran a finger over the cooking surface as always it was silken to the touch shiny with a micron brush of oil from its last use unmarred by any scratch or even the hint of residue rummaging hardy started in the refrigeratorperennially bare now that the kids had goneand after pulling out a half head of iceberg lettuce he fixed his eyes upon a carton of eggs and a decentsized half wedge of triplecrème daffinois cheese which he knew would turn the blood in his arteries to the consistency of tar but he cared about as much as he had a few days before when he and frannie had split the first half of it which is to say not at all something was going to get him someday and if it happened to be the daffinois he could think of lots of worse ways to go they had other onlyinsan francisco staples on handbutter truffle oil sourdough bread in the freezer some packaged dried mushrooms in the pantry hardy dumped the mushrooms in a bowl of warm water to reconstitute carried his beer with him over to the family room where he fed his tropical fish and sat down on the couch to wait for frannie to descend he was still wrestling with the idea of why he wasnt asking maya himself the reasons hed given wyatt hunt had at the time seemed reasonable but now he wondered true he didnt want to get maya defensive with him and one of the main tenets of defense work is that no lawyer wants to put his client in a position where she has to lie to him but he was dimly naggingly aware of another motivation that made him feel morally uneasyand that was that he didnt want to lose her as a client because she represented perhaps a quarter of a million dollars in fees if she got arrested which he was starting to consider at least as a possibility hardy billed a hell of a lot of very expensive hours every year as did his partners and their associates but even so a quarter million dollars or more wasnt something to risk if you didnt absolutely have to to say nothing of the publicity surrounding a case with such a highprofile client and if he got her off it was probably worth another half million or more to the firm plus the gratitude of the citys mayor and one of its supervisors he was hyperaware of the money that was it he didnt like to think that hed become strictly mercenary not when for so long the law had been a passion for himfirst as a beat cop and then a lawyer on the prosecution side then for the next two and more decades as a defense attorney of course it was also a business and had turned into a fairly lucrative one but the business side alone had never been the point and he didnt want it to be now he wondered if for all the wrong reasons he had sent wyatt hunt and now harlen fisk off to do a job that should by all rights have fallen to hardy himself or maybe should not be done at all he knew that he could argue blackmail to glass without revealing or even knowing the actual fact of it and thus refute the moneylaundering theory upon which the us attorney was building his forfeiture case but some instinct told him that there had in fact been blackmail and that the nature of it might be at the crux of this case he sat sipping his beer and staring at his tropical fish which didnt provide him with any kind of answers by the time the telephone on his belt went offwyatt hunt atypically calling him offhours he must have come up with something tell me youve got it already hardy said we got something all right hunt replied but it wont make you too happy im listening the guy who did the robbery with dylan vogler he was a friend of our client when she was in college name of levon preslee okay well not so okay as it turns out levons dead a gust of wind pulled the door of darrel braccos car out of his hand and slammed it for him just as a fresh volley of rain peppered the blacktop all around him lowering his head he pulled up the hood of his yellow parka and jogged at a good clip toward the obvious destinationthe coroners van parked in front with a squad car lights on at the porch and in the front windows it was ten fortythree when bracco flashed his badge at the two patrolmen standing by the door debra schiff was already there inside clogging up the hall by the kitchen with some coroner and crimescene people including lennard faro and the original team of inspectors whod pulled the callbenny yung and al tallant they were all trying to keep out of the way as the photographer finished her work schiff at a glance was wet and by the looks of her none too happy either darrel looked around as he came in out of the rainthe murder had occurred in a groundfloor front unit on the righthand side of a victorian building on potrero hill there werent any obvious signs of struggle in the living room to braccos right a distraughtlooking young man was sitting on the couch with his hands clasped between his knees while another patrolman sat across from him unspeaking there was similarly not much sign of struggle as bracco came and looked over schiffs shoulder except for the one overturned kitchen chair and the body sprawled out on the floor the puddle of blood underneath levons head not that im not thrilled to be here bracco announced to all and sundry but does somebody want to remind me again why we need deb and me tallant was a midthirties distance runner with big teeth a long jowly face and a perennial shadow that he couldnt ever seem to shave off completely not our call he said we ran it by glitsky and he said to bring you in debra turned back to her partner listen to this darrel she said why dont you hit it ben yung heavyset and normally cheerful at the moment seemed stretched thin and exhausted he reached over and pushed a button on the telephone unit on the kitchen counter levon a voice said i am a private investigator named wyatt hunt and im working for a lawyer here in town whos representing a woman named maya townshend maybe known to you as maya fisk who i believe went to school with you at usf if i could have a couple minutes of your time to ask you a few questions id appreciate a callback my cell number anytime is yung hit the stop button and turned back to his colleagues we called hunt and asked him what he was working on and eventually got around to dylan vogler i recognized the name and we talked about it and decided to call abe it was a good call benny schiff said dont mind darrel he gets crabby when his beauty sleep gets interrupted hey bracco said im not crabby i said i was thrilled to be here and if this is part of vogler even more so he pointed back toward the living room whos the kid out front boyfriend yung said brandon lawrence says hes an actor he called it in and waited for us to arrive had a dinner date and a key but this was over before he got here and i think i believe him well lets keep him on a while anyway thats why hes still here tallant commented with some asperity hes not going anywhere till we let him hey no offense al i see a fresh body i get a little pumped up bracco looked across and down to the body spoke to the crimescene boss so len what do we got faro the squads token metrosexual with his welltrimmed goatee spiky hair and multiple gold chains around his neck was in his early forties but looked and dressed a decade younger hed been leaning against the kitchen wall and now came off it he got hit hard and hit at least once again best guess is by the back of the cleaver we found rinsed off in the sink maybe dead before the second blow although thatll have to wait for the autopsy not that it matters much hes dead enough now faro moved away to the far side of the kitchen table whoever did this our victim almost undoubtedly knew him or her no sign of forced entry he pointed down at the table note the condensation ring still here across from where levon was sitting maybe they were sitting here together having a glass of something we bagged up some clean and dried glasses that were in the tray by the sink maybe find a print on one of em but unlikely so whatever else you might say your killers a pretty cool customer washing up after michelle he asked the photographer you get all this she nodded then pointed and shot at the ring on the table one last time and stepped back to survey the room and make sure shed captured it so whats his connection to vogler bracco asked besides maya al tallant knew that one none that we know of not yet is that why we got invited to this party bracco asked tallant nodded pretty good guess anything else schiff asked nope yung said levon was clean with a job and everything where bracco asked yung nodded act this was the american conservatory theater he had business cards in his wallet associate director of development he was moving up schiff looked down on the body not anymore how about dope bracco asked you see any sign of marijuana funny you should ask faro said he had a halffull baggie in the drawer next to his bed anybody else hardly worth talking about but if hes connected to vogler bracco nodded i hear you well tallant said if you guys wont be needing us anymore its been a slice bracco and schiff stayed on the scene until the coroners team removed the body well on toward two oclock in the morning faro and his crimescene unit stayed on as well poring over the house from stem to stern but adding little to their store of information out in the living room the inspectors tagteamed brandon lawrence who in fact had his own key to the apartment and had called nine one one when hed discovered the body he told them both verifying the obvious that levon lived alone and that they were in a wonderful committed relationship he told them that he hadnt touched anything after coming upon the body and not being able to stand the proximity to his lover had waited outside the whole time for the arrival of the first squad car he would do anything he couldanythingto help them find whod done this but hed seen nothing suspicious either in the neighborhood or once hed let himself in until hed seen the body bracco and schiff made sure they had his id dna and fingerprints they told him these were for elimination purposes and let him go home bracco walked lawrence to the door and then returned to sit at the end of the couch catercorner to where his partner sat back in an armchair in the welllit living room schiffs face wore a pained expression and she sighed finally she looked over at bracco id hate to think that getting jerry glass involved and shaking things up at the townshends had anything to do with this maybe it didnt debra maybe maya doesnt have anything to do with this do you believe that no you based on the rule of never a coincidence me neither id love to call her right now find out if shes got an alibi not yet not in the middle of the night without more than this i know but still we could pull an allnighter and hit her at seven sharp if shes got no alibi we sit her down for a serious chat shed just call hardy and he wouldnt let her talk fine wake him up early too and by the way ive been meaning to ask how do you get to be friendly with a defense attorney i wouldnt go so far as friendly he and abe are pals i worked with him a time or two he used to be a cop you know who did hardy yeah then a da get out of here true what made him go over to the dark side bracco gave her a sideways glance youre more mad at yourself than at me or hardy or anybody else arent you she shook her head i shouldnt have gone to glass levon might still be alive im not going to say you might have wanted to discuss it with your partner first good dont bracco took a beat what do you think of the cleaver as a murder weapon it seems to have worked you think its a womans weapon spur of the moment itd do but it couldnt have been spur of the moment whoever it was knew him and if they came over here to kill him they would have brought something to do it schiff nodded either that or she knew he had the cleaver all she had to do was get him into the kitchen and get behind him in fact warming to her theory a little she went on i think i like that she used the wrong side the dull side a guy maybe doesnt do that bracco sat back on the couch maybe not i dont know but we could talk about this all night and never go anywhere as opposed to what we do know which is what well keeping it simple lets assume that levon hung out with maya in college weve been thinking that vogler was blackmailing maya so lets call that a fact too what does that say to you shes the connection back when they were all in school thats what i see she didnt own the coffee shop then yeah okay so the blackmail didnt start then it wasnt until she had money maybe she was paying levon too somehow and then he finds out voglers been killed and suddenly hes a little uncomfortable no hes a lot uncomfortable bracco sat with his thoughts for a moment then suddenly came forward stood and went over to a lamp table across the room where hed left some small ziploc evidence bags and other stuff from levons pockets including his cell phone as a matter of course he and schiff were going to go through the recent history of calls received and made which were automatically logged but theyd both thought theyd wait until the next morning when people would be awake now though he picked up the phone turned it on and brought it back over to where hed been sitting i love these things he said remember what a hassle it used to be to get phone records on people days weeks subpoenas now push a button bingo ah here we go the very first number in levons recently made calls menu was a area code that struck bracco as familiar he took out his own cell phone and ran down his own recently called menu until he came to the same number it looks like levon got uncomfortable enough to call somebody we know he said debra schiff wasnt the only person feeling some responsibility for setting events in motion that had apparently and very suddenly gotten out of control at three am dismas hardy still hadnt gotten to sleep hed come down for the first time after an hours tossing in bed made himself a warm ovaltine gone into his front room and rearranged the caravan of glass elephants that trekked across the mantel over his fireplace sitting in his reading chair with the lights off though hed convinced himself that really he had had no choice all hed done was send his own investigator team out to try to pry loose one of his clients secrets he would need to do that to have that information if he was going to help her in her defense should it come to that whichpretty obviouslywas looking more probable every minute just before hunt had received the call from the police at levons place and called hardy with the news hed learned from his own employee craig chiurco that the same levon preslee that hunt had already identified as a friend of mayas during their time at usf was the guy whod been arrested with vogler in the robbery theyd committed at about that same time chiurco had gone out to levons apartment in potrero in the late afternoon but no one had answered his knockhe might have already been dead chiurco was in the process of reporting back to hunt planning to track the potential witness down either later that same night or in the next day or so to question him when the call had come in from inspector tallant with the news of levons death as soon as hardy heard this it had immediately become clear that if maya did not have an alibiand of course no one knew even the approximate time of levons murdershe was going to be even more squarely in the sights of bracco and schiff as a suspect not just in this latest crime but with vogler as well part of hardy wished that wyatt hadnt been so forthcoming with the police when theyd called him but then again what else was he supposed to do they already had the message hed left on levons phonethat he was working for the lawyer who was representing maya townshend he couldnt very well deny that and once the police recognized her name along with any connection whatsoever to the dead man she was going to assume a higher profile and there was nothing at all he could do about that the ovaltine finished hardy had gone back up to his bedroom and tossed for another hour and change his mind pingponging willynilly between maya and her husband and jerry glass then bracco and schiff and glitsky and zachary and wes farrell and then back through the litany in a different order everybody either in trouble or making it or both until finally he got up again grabbed a robe and padded downstairs the rain still fell heavily onto the skylight drumming away he went back up to the front of the house and settled himself down in his reading chair in the dark he couldnt afford a sleepless night he had a feeling he was going to get a call from his client in the very early am was somewhat surprised that he hadnt gotten one already but maybe she didnt know yet about levon or maybe she knew all too well and at this thoughtthe actual admission of it to himself as a possibilityall of hardys random imaginings about the troubles of his friends or those making trouble for them coalesced into a tiny pinpoint of something that suddenly felt like a certainty whether or not she was in fact a killer he was sure that maya was involved as some kind of active participant in all of this in both the deaths of dylan vogler and of levon preslee and it was starting to seem that regardless of what hardy chose to do and however cooperative maya was with the police she could be arrested for both murders still sleeping in his reading chair up at the front of his house the rain and wind pounding at the bay window three feet from his right hand hardy never heard the telephone ring and now suddenly here was his wife first touching his shoulder then shaking him gently dismas opening his eyes everything out of focus he saw her standing there in a bathrobe the receiver in her hand concern writ large on her features maya townshend she whispered straightening up his neck cricked with a stabbing pain it took him a few more seconds to get his bearings all right he was still downstairs mustve fallen asleep trying to figure hello im sorry did i wake you hardy cleared his throat no of course not what the hell time was it anyway he glanced outside where the heavy storm clouds kept it looking like halfnight this is just my precoffee voice dont mind it how can i help you theyre here again schiff and bracco theyre unbelievable these two i dont know i find myself believing in them lately what do they want apparently theyve got a search warrant they want to look through the house joels furious of course we havent even finished breakfast and the kids are all upset i dont know whos going to take them to school now in fact hardy heard children crying in the background what time is it actually ten after seven they got here at seven sharp hardy knew that this was a bad sign generally speaking police were not permitted to serve warrants in the middle of the night in fact search warrants were not valid for service between ten pm and seven am unless a judge specifically found evidence that justified the extreme intrusion into someones home absent an emergency judges were reluctant to issue such a warrant they would do that of course if there was cause to believe that a suspect would destroy evidence or flee under cover of darkness so the fact that theyd waited until seventhe first allowable minute without that extraordinary findingwas ominous so where are they now right here joels trying to reason with them they said we had to let them in they have us all sitting on a couch in the front room they wont let us move if we try to move they said theyll put us in handcuffs they wouldnt even give me my cell phone until i said i needed to call harlen to get the kids and then you can they do all this if they have a warrant they can did they say what theyre looking for specifically shoes andor clothing that might contain blood which meant hardy knew that she was now a suspect phone and financial records computer filesa lot of the same kind of stuff they wanted for the other the womans voice suddenly broke oh god i dont know why all this is happening to us all of a sudden i dont know whats going on its like were living in a police state can they just come in here and look through everything not without a reason so they must think they have one and they must have convinced some judge too have they talked to you at all to get in yes before they told me they had this warrant they asked me about what i did yesterday when yesterday what time afternoon and you didnt tell them anything right i said id gone to church thats all that was enough hardy thought wondering anew about his clients predilection to lock herself into a position that might incriminate her but he kept his voice mild you went to church again i know most people dont i suppose but i do all the time st ignatius and how long were you there i dont know a little while before i had to pick up the kids but i told them the inspectors that i wouldnt answer any more questions until you got here open barn door let horse out close barn door after it check but there was nothing to do about it now so hardy merely said good for you maya try to stick with that i can be there in a half hour hows that sound like a long time i know i cant help that ill get there as fast as i can promise okay hardy heard her breathe maybe between harlen and joel they can stop them before that harlen your brother harlen yes i told you i called him first didnt i yeah but you said it was something about the kids well that too but he and sergeant bracco are friends you know right im aware of that they were friends but now hes hardy stopped before he said anything else such as that given the presence of jerry glass around this case harlen fisk was possibly the worst imaginable choice of a person to confront the police and especially schiff about the legality or reasonableness of a search warrant in mayas house hell be good with them mr hardy harlens good with everybody okay then but even after he gets there if its before me can i ask you please not to say anything to the police until i get there can you promise me that after she did hardy pushed the button to ring off the phone and went to straighten himself but the crick in his neck asserted itself again and he sat back down with some care twisting his head to find an angle that didnt hurt are you all right frannie coming through the dining room with two steaming cups in her hands except for the icepick in my neck taking one of the cups youre the best you know that ive heard rumors so why again were you sleeping down here i wasnt sleeping upstairs and didnt want to wake you up you can always wake me up thats what they all say but they dont mean it i mean it dismas you know that i know im sorry just kidding he sipped his coffee and sighed but all kidding aside this isnt starting to look too good maya townshend he went to nod but stopped himself before he got too far i need to get over there right now theyve got to have something new or they wouldnt have moved like this you think its this guy glass i dont know maybe maybe i should call abe and what finesse him to get some inside dope failing that see if he can slow things down realizing the absurdity of that possibility he added which hes just plain not going to do is he not if they have something on her which they must right right i wish i knew what it was grimacing he reached over and put his cup down on the windowsill ive got to get moving he started up again and again his hand went to his neck but this time he fought through the pain got to his feet one step at a time he said half to himself one step at a time arriving at the premises hardy convinced bracco to let him sit with his clients in their kitchen in return for a vague promise that they might have something to say to the inspectors maya set her mug of coffee down on the countertop even if he did call me that doesnt mean i went and saw him afterwards does it i dont even know where he lives lived so you couldnt have gone there hardy said youre absolutely sure you didnt go there right well yes of course i dont see why there has to be a connection between him calling me and me going to see him he just wanted to talk about dylan and if anybody suspected him because you all used to be friends hardy said in a low voice the police had let them give the children to a neighborharlen hadnt made it there yetto take to school they were probably just as happy not to have the kids underfoot anyway the three of themjoel maya and hardysat around the island stove in the townshends ultramodern supergourmet kitchen every appliance from the refrigerator and stove to the toaster and coffeemaker was of brushed steel every flat surface a greentinged granite outside the wraparound back windows the storm swirled and eddied around them the lights had already blinked twice as gusts of wind hammered at the glass along with two other searchspecialist cops bracco and schiff were somewhere back or up in the house behind them occasionally the disembodied voices from one or more of these people would carry in to the trio in the kitchenthrumming undertones of a somehow undefined menace and conflict the uniformed officer left at the door of the kitchen to watch them didnt appear to be either interested or listening nevertheless they kept their voices low it made perfect sense to me dismas even if it doesnt to you she motioned back toward the rest of the house or to them hardy nodded although you must admit he added that the timing doesnt look too good he calls you the day hes killed i cant help when he called me maya said or what he wanted to talk about and it wasnt like i spent a lot of time talking to him he was mostly afraid somebody like those inspectors might think he had something to do with dylan you know and had i heard anything he was worried i know thats what you said and it looks like he had reason to be look hardy said as long as you didnt go there and they cant prove you did come on i told you i was at church for two hours joel asked i didnt time it joel as long as it took i dont know its all right hardy held up a hand if you were at church thats where you were all im saying is if thats the case theres nothing schiff and bracco can do if you werent at levons you werent there end of story maya stared hard at her husband thats what im saying joel and theres no dispute about whether i was there so the phone call doesnt matter anyway no doubt joel wanted to help his wife but he obviously didnt believe yet as hardy had come to that maya could possibly be going to jail maybe in the very near termpossibly today when hardy had arrived hed asked what had changed in their investigations that bracco and schiff needed to serve a search warrant on his client first thing in the morning they had told him about the call from levons cell phone to mayas home number after a flustered minute shed admitted not only to her past friendship with levon and the connection between dylan preslee and herself but that he had in fact called her yesterday out of the blue before that she hadnt heard from him in a couple of years the good news from hardys perspective was that now he felt sure he understood in a general way what the blackmail had been about the specifics might not ever be forthcoming but given levon and dylans criminal conspiracies and the fact of mayas close friendshipand perhaps morewith at least one of them it was pretty clear that shed gotten herself involved in some kind of illegal activity that shed made deals with each of them to keep herself off the radar the bad news of course was that her involvement on any level with two men murdered within the same week made her an extremely attractive candidate as a suspect in the killings except that according to her shed never been to levons home maya hardy now said it might be helpful if you could write down as much as you can remember about the phone call just to give it added credibility the police packed up and left taking with them a lot of clothing their computers phone books and financial records joel was on the phone in his office calling his place of business to see if perhaps the police had been there and trying to decide how to reconstruct the financial records the cops had carted off hardy and maya had just sat down in the kitchen when the doorbell rang and maya got up to answer it she came back in trailing her brother who parked his bulk on a counter chair and sighed i dont like this diz i cant say im wild about it either harlen but if shes never been to levons yeah but you cant prove a negative true but luckily the burden of proof isnt on us its on darrel and debra the doorbell rang again and again maya went out to answer it you think shes telling the truth fisk asked his body language saying he didnt shes my client hardy said i have to believe her if theres no evidence placing her at levons no blood on her shoes or clothes thats not what i asked no but mayas returning footsteps closed out the discussion as hardy turned to see her coming back into the kitchen its your investigators she said theyre wet and said theyre good waiting out in the lobby you asked them to come out here hardy shrugged standing up i didnt know what was going down exactly when i called them i knew your children needed rides to school but sometimes cops serving search warrants get carried away it never hurts to have backup witnesses tend to keep things copasetic although it doesnt look like thats needed today ill go and talk to them out by the front door wyatt hunt stood dripping in hiking boots jeans and a giants slicker and craig chiurco looked a bit more welldefended against nature with a natty tan trench coat but the weather wasnt foremost on their minds they didnt even notice hardy as he approached them so intent were they on their conversation whispering back and forth until he stopped two feet away from them and hearing chiurcos last words dont have to say anything about it hardy said about what hunt shook him off nothing ah the famous nothing you dont want to know diz hunt said really i like knowing stuff hardy countered its one of my hobbies you really might not want to know this diz i promise the only way you want to know this now is if it comes out some other way later and you didnt hear it here first youre saying id be pissed hardy leaned in toward them and lowered his own voice maybe i should get to decide i hate surprises later so i decide yes now hunt motioned off with his eyes behind hardy over toward the kitchen he stopped turned to chiurco and shrugged then shook his head to all appearances he had a bad taste in his mouth youre the boss chiurco said your call hunt hesitated another moment then finally let out a long breath craig saw her who hardy asked his empty stomach suddenly bunching up on him for of course he immediately knew who and when and where two minutes later they were all back in the kitchen joel had appeared from his duties elsewhere in the house and now stood over by the sink holding mayas hand theyd all been in a spirited conversation talking about something but stopped when a firmjawed hardy trooped in with hunt and an especially disconsolate chiurco in his wake without any preamble hardy looked around to joel and harlen and said if you dont mind id like to speak to maya alone for just a minute if i could joel on edge in any case and perhaps emboldened by his interactions over the past hour or so with the police moved a halfstep over in front of his wife protectively thats not happening weve already told you our decision on that were fighting this together maya and me all of it all right then hardy said but if thats the case i have to tell you that youll be doing it without me fine joel said we didnt maya held up her own hand wait maya joel warning her scolded her back into her place no she turned her gaze to hardy dismas cant you just say whatever it is in front of joel we are in this together she turned to her husband met his eyes we really are joel butcoming back to hardybut ill go talk with you if you need me to if thats the only way theres no only way maya theres no one way theres just the way its worked for me the way i do it joel adopting a reasonable tone said mr hardy all right maya wants to keep you on well play it your way if you need to but im telling you that you can say whatever you need to in front of me and harlen for that matter hes family too hardy exhausted from the lack of sleep and the postadrenaline slump after what hed just heard from chiurco felt his shoulders sag and this tweaked the crick in his neck anew this was not the way the practice of law was supposed to work to be effective you had to maintain control over the client the family the flow of information and now he was feeling it all inexorably swirling away from him i very much appreciate all of your cooperation with one another he said and your mutual trust but as ive told you this is just not how i do it ive got to talk to maya first and alone shes my client and ive got no choice he turned to her maya she looked around at the room full of men brushed her husbands arm and moved around him well be right back she said hes sure she said he said hes one hundred percent sure youve got a memorable face maya you passed right by him as he was going in i dont remember him no hardy said maybe you dont thinking that it was probably because she had just killed someone but you were in fact there werent you she didnt say anything maya she looked up at him i didnt think anybody would believe me if said i went there but he wasnt home but that was what happened why did you go there he asked me to he told me he needed to see me that hed tell about me and dylan and him if i didnt just like dylan what do you mean thats what dylan threatened you with if you didnt come down too no that was different that was the shop i already told you that hardy took a beat you also told me you didnt go to levons again silence finally so what are you going to do what do you mean i mean are you going to tell the police no of course not im on your side here maya we cant let the police find out about this at all were just lucky it was my investigator who saw you hell never tell a soul ill never tell a soul and there is no way we can ever be made to testify against you but i think its time we stop answering any more questions at all someone wants to talk to you you refer them to me but no sooner had they walked back into the kitchen than maya walked and then ran the last few steps up to her husband hugged him and started crying hey hey he said holding her then at hardy what did you say to her hardy stood his ground there were things she had to understand shell be all right shell be all right shell be all right look at her shes crying now for gods sake shes not all right at all im sorry hardy said i didnt mean to make her cry well whether or not you meant it he brushed his hand down over her hair its okay babe its okay she pulled away and looked up at her husband her voice breaking hysteria coming on its not okay its not going to be okay maybe not ever again sure it will well get through this and no joel you dont understand i was there i was there she turned and pointed to chiurco he saw me oh god oh god im so so sorry three days later after the lab confirmed that both mayas fingerprints and dna were on the doorknob of levons apartment schiff and bracco took maya into custody part two there were superior court judges hardy liked a lot and a very few that hed prefer to avoid if at all possible but only one he actively despised and that was marian braun the history between the two of them was so extreme that it included a contempt violation and actual jail time for hardys wife he honestly believed that he might prevail on appeal should it come to that if he argued that braun should have recused herself when she discovered that hardy was going to be defending a murder suspect in her courtroom of course the flip side of that was that if hardy was worried about the impossibility of getting a fair trial from braun he could have exercised his that section of the california code said that any lawyer assigned to trial could excuse one but only one judge without giving any specific reason the lawyer was sworn and simply declared under oath that he believed the judge to whom hed been assigned was prejudiced against himself or the interests of his client to the point he thought he couldnt get a fair trial that was itno hearing no evidence the declaration itself caused the judge to be removed forever from the case and challenges were reported to the judicial council obviously a judge with too many challenges acquired the unfavorable attention of that supervisory body but the move had its price first the courts hated challenges they not only dinged one of their colleagues however deservedly but screwed up the scheduling for everyone else because another judge had to take the case and someone had to take their cases and so on and even if the judges personally despised the object of the challenge they despised more the hubris of a mere lawyer who dared to suggest that one of their own tribe might not be fair so if hardy exercised a challenge he would likely immediately find himself in the courtroom of the most antidefense judge that the presiding judge could find available and that judge would have an additional motive to make hardys life as miserable as he or she possibly could hardy knew he challenged at his peril so hardy elected to roll the dice with braun call him superstitious or crazyhed also pulled braun for his last murder trial nearly four years before she hadnt liked him any better then nor he her and that trial had never been given over to the jury because a key prosecution witness had changed his testimony at the eleventh hour nevertheless hardys client had walked out a free woman braun or no braun hed already proven that he could win in her courtroom and if he could do it once he could pull it off again now as he sat in department on the third floor of the hall of justice waiting for his clients appearance in the courtroom hardy found himself marveling anew at the thought that they were about to begin a fullblown murder trial he felt vaguely responsible and notsovaguely incompetent that things had come to this point surely a better lawyer could have closed the case after the pxthe preliminary hearingwhich theyd had a little over four months ago within two weeks of mayas arrest at the end of that fiasco maya had been held to answer in superior court hed filed the pro forma which called for the dismissal of the two firstdegree murder charges against maya on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to present even probable cause to suggest shed committed these crimes hardy had even permitted himself a flicker of optimism there might have been technically enough evidence to justify a trial but surely the court had to see the same weaknesses in the evidence that he himself saw that was why hardy had demanded as maya had a right to do that the prelim take place within ten court days of her arrest he had felt that on the evidence he might win and in any event the case wasnt going to get any better for the defense but now here he was in brauns court hed been wrong the other political reason that hed pressed for the speedy px was that mayas arrest had set off a news frenzy in the city that hardy thought could only get worse over time and in this he was right the secret grand jury investigation that jerry glass was conducting on the usattorney front along with the public threats of forfeiture of the properties of one of the towns major development and political families had by now neatly dovetailed into a narrative that had captured the publics imagination as hardy had suspected it would knowing that the body politic of san francisco in general and probable members of jury pools specifically tended to have little sympathy and lots of hostility and envy for the two aligned andin the public eye generally malignantclasses of developers and politicians hardy had wanted to hurry up with a jury trial before every single person in san francisco had been so exposed to innuendo insinuation and the venom of the press that they had all long since made up their minds juries didnt always return verdicts based on the facts sometimes they voted their prejudices so given the dearth of evidence for the actual murders hed believed back in october that a quick defense was his best chance to free his client and cut short the debate about the kinds of people the townshends and other developers and power brokers must be and now in late february here they were with braun presiding about to begin exactly what hed strategized and labored to avoid and yet called down upon himself he had demanded a speedy trial and now he was going to get it even moving as quickly as he could he couldnt avoid the collateral damage that continued to wreak its havoc on the extended fisk townshendwest familiesharlens mayas and the mayor kathy wests it appeared that the us attorneys power to subpoenaparticularly financial recordsin capable hands like those of jerry glass could be a blunt weapon indeed by the time the preliminary hearing had begun glass had barely had time to look into the bay beans west bookkeeping much less joel townshends wider business affairs and how if at all they might relate to one another but since the marijuana connection with dylan vogler was intimately connected with bbw and this was needed by the state to establish a purported motive for maya to have killed him glass and his conduit debra schiff had obviously been supplying the prosecution with whatever they could in terms of questionable financial dealings between the coffee shop and the townshend household this hadnt hurt anyone too badly during the preliminary hearingalthough the money laundering possibility had apparently been part of the courts decision that a jury should weigh the evidence and reach its own conclusions in mayas casebut over the past months and especially in the past couple of weeks glasss investigators and accountants had finally unearthed what appeared to be a treasure trove of sophisticated financial relationships and arrangements that now appeared to implicate townshend harlen kathy west and some other large players in at the very least questionable if not to say unethical or illegal conduct potential kickbacks preferential treatment undocumented meetings about matters of public interest in violation of the citys sunshine ordinance very little if any of this had been proven yet except that glass had succeeded in crippling bbw and the government was preliminarily close to attaching the entire building as the probable proceeds from a drug operation although the place itself was still open day to day because maya had a fifth amendment right not to answer any questions in the forfeiture proceeding while her criminal case was pending any final decision was on hold for now but the questions alone raised a spectre of criminality over maya and everything she touched the bbw accounts were incredibly sloppy as just one example maya had cut vogler a check from her own personal checking account for for emergency repairs from water damage in july and another personal check for a half months pay last march there was no record he had ever given her back the money there was at least worth of checks from vogler to maya over the past two years with no explanation at all in their records the only question seemed to be what precise illegality was being funded by the operation maya told hardy shed been busy with the kids school and on vacation and hadnt been able to make it into the store to sign the business checks but shed also neglected to reimburse herself from the company account during the many visits when shed had a chance to do so she had no idea what the checks from vogler to her represented she had left it to vogler to keep the books in the current climate this explanation was widely discredited the victory for glass and the accompanying widely perceived truth that the townshends were in fact in the drug business had then in turn played a huge role in peoples perception of the townshends and public opinion shifted away from presumption of innocence suddenly if you did business with joel townshend or harlen fisk or kathy westin fact if you did business with the cityyou were going to get cheated thats just the way these people did things just this morning hardy had read the chronicles editorial and letters page and it was fully onethird choked with vitriolsupervisor fisk and the mayor should quit or failing that they should be impeached the drumbeat was picking up even in hardys office it was waterfountain talk and though none of this had anything to do with mayas guilt for the crimes of murder of which she was accused hardy knew that it was going to have a lot to do with paul aka paulie aka the big ugly stierthe assistant da whod pulled the caseand how he played the evidence from an untutored perspective the entire courtroom drama could unfold as a large multitentacled conspiracy fueled by drugs and moral turpitude in high places hardy glanced over at his opponent despite his flamboyant nicknames stier was in his midthirties earnest and from hardys dealings with him so far possessed of little personality or sense of humor the nicknames remained worrisome though it was a truism in the courtroom that what you didnt know would hurt you and hardy hadnt been able to pick up much in the way of gossip or dirt on the big ugly which probably meant he kept his personalityand his possible clever moves and dirty trickswell hidden until he needed them when they could inflict the most damage of course it was also possible that the nicknames were sarcasticthat stier was what he appeared to be a hardcharging fairminded goodlooking working attorney certainly he didnt look dangerous now leaning back over the bar rail chatting amicably with jerry glass they were simply two cleancut hardworking selfrighteous ambitious guys doing the peoples hard workone for the countrys government and one for the states hardy felt a twist in his stomach there also in the front row was debra schiff who hardy knew had started to see glass socially if not intimately leaning around further hardy briefly caught the eye of darrel bracco who gave him a quick ambiguous look and then looked awayclearly all along bracco had not been as gungho as schiff about mayas guilt and the wisdom of her arrest but in the maelstrom that had developed his doubts if any had surely been laid to rest still though to dismas the look somehow felt heartening or maybe it was pity at a signal from the bailiff hardy got up and walked through the door at the back of the courtroom leading to the corridor and the judges chambers there out of the sight of the jury the bailiff took off mayas handcuffs and hardy entered with his client followed by the bailiff and they took their places at counsels table in what hardy thought was a show of judicial nastiness if not downright personal affront to him braun had considered denying maya the privilege of dressing out or wearing normal street clothes when she appeared in the courtroom for the duration of the trial she opined his client would sit next to hardy at his table in her yellow jumpsuit hardy insane with rage had had to file a fifteenpage brief before he could convince braun that a variety of federal and state cases held squarely that his client had an absolute right to appear in front of the jury in civilian clothes dressed as a convict she would present to the jury an image that was at odds with that of a citizen who was presumed innocent she must be already guilty of something went the notsosubtle psychology of it she wouldnt be in jail wearing that outfit brought into the courtroom in handcuffs if she hadnt done anything at all if she werent a danger to the community brauns position was ridiculous and had been repudiated by courts for a good fifty years even so she had conceded this absolutely undebatable point grudgingly and with bad grace the gallery noise behind them abated slightly maya gave hardy a lost look and then scanned around behind her nodding at her husband in the first row on her side of the gallery or maybe it was that she was relieved not to see her children who had been living with fisks family all the while shed been incarcerated the whole thing was awful hardy thought simply awful and what made it worse all but intolerable from his perspective was that in spite of the lack of evidence hed finally come to lose almost all of his belief that she was not actually guilty of both murders certainly he knew she had done something she was unwilling under pain of life in prison to reveal also while her family and her outside world appeared to be imploding around her as the weeks had passed she seemed to have grown more and more acquiescent and less concerned with her defense as though she deserved whatever happened to her she still professed a desire to be found innocent but mostly because she thought the children needed her she didnt want them to have to live with the fact that their mother was in jail convicted of murder for herself though it didnt seem that critical an issue hardy stood and pulled out her chair as all the parties rose while another bailiff brought in the jury from their room farther back along the same corridor hardy and maya had just used to enter the courtroom when all the jurors were seated she sat and hardy pushed her forward until she was comfortably up at the table as hed coached her she cast a look over to the newly empaneled jury and nodded a few times making as much eye contact as seemed natural it was from his perspective a decent jury nine men and three women five whites four africanamericans three asians all between forty and seventy and hardy guessed from various nuances that seven or eight of them had at least tried marijuana nine of them held fulltime jobs two of the men and one woman were retired and had been moderately successful in business hardy was surprised that stier hadnt peremptorily dismissed any of these but maybe he hadnt factored the antidevelopment prejudice adequately into his juryselection strategy although sometimes hardy knew you just got lucky the way things had been going though hardy didnt think that was it in this case but before hardy had a chance to sit again behind them the gallery energy shifted and both hardy and maya turned around to see what had caused it well look at this hardy said a small grin toying with the sides of his mouth as kathy west the mayor of san francisco herself came walking down the center aisle toward them accompanied by her nephew harlen fisk and a small procession of both of their staff members beyond them flowed a steady stream of reporters courtroom groupies and the simply curious such that by the time kathy and harlen got up to the front row and began moving in beside joel the gallery was standing room only and the buzz in the room was constant and formidable the bailiff obviously at a loss as to what he should do especially after kathy west shook his hand allowed the mayor to further ignore the rules and reach across the bar rail to shake hands with both hardy and her niece while harlen pulled hardy a little closer and whispered this is kathys spur of the moment inspiration maybe put our friend stier over there a bit off his feed for his opening statement couldnt hurt hardy said the grandstanding coming as it did after weeks of inactivity and silence from mayas extended family was in fact far from unwelcome a smile creased hardys features and he glanced over in time to catch stier glass and schiff in what were to him sweet expressions of disbelief and shock but the energy had no time to gather momentum as the door by the judges bench opened and the bailiff up there at the far end of the room intoned all rise department twentyfive of the superior court of california is now in session judge marian braun presiding and braun swept in and up to her chair behind the bench glanced out at the crowd then glared as she became aware of her visitors after a seconds hesitation she lifted and slammed her gavel and said attorneys my chambers immediately the judge in her black robe was standing waiting for both of them as they came in she didnt even ask the court recorder ann baxtersitting on the couch with her magic machineif she was ready to take down every word that was said as was required in a murder trial before she started in mr hardy because of our long history together i thought id made clear that there wouldnt be any showboating in or around my courtroom and now i come in here on the first actual day of trial and who do i see out in the first row but the mayor and one of our city supervisors and if you think your honor hardy said but she raised a hand im not finished talking yet and i dont want you interrupting me ever here or in the courtroom clear it was unprofessional and might even be counterproductive in the short run for his client but if braun was going to insult him and act like a tyrant whose malice toward him might provide grounds for an eventual appeal hardy was going to be happy to help her along so knowing that decorum demanded that he respond aloud to herotherwise the court recorder couldnt put his answer in the recordhe nodded with an exaggerated solemnity and waited it didnt take braun long her eyes went nearly shut as she squinted across at him i asked you a question mr hardy i asked if it was clear that you were not to interrupt me yes your honor of course im sorry i wasnt sure youd finished and i didnt want to interrupt straightfaced she pointed a finger at him schoolmarmish her voice a hoarse and controlled rasp id like to know what you mean to accomplish by having the mayor and supervisor fisk sitting out there this is exactly the kind of circus environment that ive cautioned you that i want to avoid and here it is before weve even begun hardy stood at attention well are you going to answer me or not hardy canted his head slightly leaning forward im sorry your honor i didnt hear a question and didnt know you required a response what are they doing out there i dont know your honor intending to take in the trial or at least part of it why i dont know i wouldnt care to hazard a supposition i dont believe you i sense your hand in their presence here your honor you flatter me to assign me such influence but i assure you that i have no control over the movements of the mayor or mr fisk their appearance here is as much a surprise to me as it is to you they are sitting on your clients side you dont think this is going to influence the jury seeing them sitting rooting for her i dont know about that and i cant help how the jury will react ms west and mr fisk are both related to the defendant he turned as mr stier and i believe you well know again the finger dont you presume to tell me what i know or dont know of course not your honor but regardless of your knowledge or lack of it its only natural that as ms townshends relatives they should sit on the defense side of the gallery braun turned her angry eyes to the prosecutor mr stier do you have anything to add to this conversation the cleancut and quite possibly cutthroat attorney who had come in the door behind hardy and remained slightly behind him until now stepped up beside him cleared his throat but remained silent your honor with respect hardy began first and primarily this is a public courtroom anyone has a right to be here we fought a revolution about this sort of thing further there is an argument to be made that their presence might be calculated to combat the pretrial prejudice that the prosecution has been abetting throughout the leadup to this trial what are you talking about stier snapped hardy kept himself at attention eyes forward after a satisfying five seconds braun finally came at him did you hear mr stiers question mr hardy of course your honor well im sorry well what your honor i asked you if youd heard mr stiers question yes of course but youve instructed me many times to address my remarks only to the court im trying to hone to the courts protocol your honor as to mr stiers question im certain he knows full well what i was talking about would you care to enlighten the court what that is certainly your honor its no secret that for the past several months mr glass the us attorney here in san francisco has been prosecuting a campaign in the civil courts in the media and with a federal grand jury trying to link my client and her husband to her brother and to the mayor and trying to implicate all the families in a moneylaundering dopedealing and racketeering conspiracy thats why i submitted all the questions for your voir dire about which of our prospective jurors follow the news closely i had assumed you were aware of this your honor for an answer braun turned to the prosecutor mr stier nonsense your honor its true that jerry glass has been following his own trail of malfeasance that appears to lead through some of these same individuals including mr hardys client but to imply that weve colluded to prejudice excuse me your honor i didnt mean to imply any such thing i meant to state it as established fact stier wheeled on hardy thats absurd to the contrary hardy replied evenly facing braun its demonstrable your honor debra schiff the homicide inspector who arrested my client has been designated a special agent for mr glasss federal grand jury some would call that collusion braun glowered but more to the point your honor ms wests and mr fisks right to be here and my clients right to have them here is absolute of course if you or mr stier would like me to pass along a message to the mayor and a member of the board of supervisors that you want them to leave id be happy to oblige id actually be kind of interested to hear what they had to say to that a longish pause then all rightbraun bit off her wordsthats quite enough i wont condone this type of bickering either here or in my courtroom hanging her head for a second she shook it in disgust then came back to the attorneys standing before her this situation infuriates me but i dont see any help for it you gentlemen are excused ill be out there again in just a minute word had evidently spread quickly and by the time hardy was back next to maya at his table in the bullpen there wasnt a seat to be had in the gallery a line stretched out through the door that led from the hallway into the courtroom and hardy was more than a little surprised to see abe glitsky standing in it just inside the door having come down to check out the show he gave hardy an infinitesimal nod because they were scheduled to appear as witnesses and could not remain in the courtroom schiff and bracco had both abandoned their earlier frontrow seats in favor of a couple of reporters who were among the number of people questioning both harlen fisk and kathy west in what appeared to be a virtual impromptu press conference indeed the gallery was fairly humming on all sides so much so that the bailiffs ringing call to order as braun reentered the room and ascended to the bench went largely unheeded hardy up front heard it and turned but the noise behind him continued and if anything increased until braun standing used her gavel at first once gently and getting no response then with a more imperious and forceful bam bam bam order she called out order in this court until gradually finally the place grew silent braun waited until the last whisper had died then put her gavel down and still standing leaned forward onto her hands scowling down at the crowd this is a court of law she began her voice strained with emotion there is no place in it for bedlam i would ask those of you who have seats now to please take them and for those of you standing along the sides find a seat or i will be obliged to ask you to leave after giving the gallery time to comply braun finally took her seat thank you the court she went on recognizes her honor the mayor of san francisco kathy west as well as city supervisor harlen fisk and welcomes them both to these proceedings in a convincing display of graciousness the judge nodded through a tight smile then turned immediately to the prosecution table mr stier are the people ready to begin their case yes your honor mr hardy the defense ready your honor all right then mr stier you may begin for all of his lowaffect demeanor and appearance stiers public persona projected the first hint of the enigmatic pauliea real authority that seemed based on equal parts confidence in who he was and the certainty of his position he spoke in a normal conversational tone with few oratorical flourishes but his downhome sincerity created a simple eloquence that rang with conviction ladies and gentlemen of the jury he was standing just in front of and sideways to hardy and maya facing the jury box as he began he held his hands in a relaxed manner down and slightly out in front of him reminiscent of a shortstop in the ready position from time to time bringing them up clasping them for emphasis or sometimes pointing a finger from one of them for clarity or effect the evidence and facts in this case are fairly simple straightforward and unambiguous they concern a significant drugdealing operation and longstanding relationships among three individuals that for some unknown reason suddenly went bad with tragic in fact fatal results for two of them and they point to an inescapable conclusionthat the defendant in this case maya townshendand here he turned and pointed a finger directly at herwillfully murdered her accomplice in her marijuana business dylan vogler and then several days later she willfully murdered another former accomplice in the marijuana business levon preslee heres how we know this at nine fortyseven on the night of october twentysixth of last year a young man who is one of the two victims in this case dylan vogler the manager of a coffee shop called bay beans west on haight street here in the city placed a phone call to his employer the defendant maya townshend we dont know precisely what he told her during that phone call but whatever the message it was important enough that defendant first lied to the police about ever having received the call and only when caught in the lie did she admit that it was enough to convince her to get up before dawn the next morning and drive to bay beans west hardy squirmed maya had not been caught in a lie but had admitted her deception to the police on her own on his advice he made a note to make the point later through bracco or schiff but for the moment the accusation rang unchallenged in front of the jury stier went on less than one hour later by the time it was just starting to get light mr vogler was dead shot once in the chest at point blank range in the alley that runs behind bay beans west there was no sign of a struggle police investigators discovered a gun in the alley from which one shot had recently been fired one bullet was recovered one shell casing was recovered both matched the gun this gun belonged to defendant it was registered to her and her fingerprints were on it as they were on cartridges inside the gun so why did defendant do it they had been business partners for nearly ten years why did defendant wake up on this particular saturday morning and decide that she was going to have to kill mr vogler we may never know the precise reason but we do know with certainty about the life of crime they were leading together a life where violent death even at the hands of partners and associates is as common as this citys morning fog in june stier smiled politely at his homespun witticism but didnt pause at the time of his death he continued mr vogler was wearing a backpack into which hed packed fifty ziploc snack bags each containing a few grams to up to half an ounce of highgrade marijuana that he grew himself in his attic it seems that mr vogler used bay beans west the coffee shop owned by defendant and managed by himself as a cover for a thriving marijuana business a business whose books and accounting ledgers will show operated with the complete cooperation and collusion of defendant maya was beginning to fidget and hardy reached over and put a hand on her arm squeezing gently everything stier was saying was old news to both of them by now but that didnt mean it wasnt disconcerting hearing it laid out in a smoothly flowing narrative and he didnt want a member of the jury to pick up on mayas discomfort which any one of them might construe as guilt for his own part hardy wore a practiced expression of barely disguised disgust at this reading of the purported facts without lapsing into anything like true theatricality he let his head as though of its own accord shake back and forth ever so slightly whenever he sensed a juror checking him for his reaction stier went on but defendant wasnt done yet her drug business went back a long way and it would take more than one murder to keep it secure unfortunately the murder of dylan vogler aroused the suspicion of another of her confederates named levon preslee until his death mr preslee worked as a fundraising executive at the american conservatory theater like defendant and mr vogler he had attended the university of san francisco in the nineteen nineties while they were students there several witnesses will testify that the three of themdefendant and the two victims mr vogler and mr presleefirst got involved together in a marijuana distribution business eventually the law caught up to mr vogler and mr preslee and they were both convicted of robbery in connection with a dope deal gone bad and sentenced to prison hardy had fought vigorously to keep vogler and preslees prior marijuana dealings and the robbery away from the jury there was no evidence hed argued that connected maya to that in any way as with almost every other motion he had tried to make braun had brushed him aside goes to the relationship among the parties shed said as though that either made sense or had something to do with the legal ruling stier picked up the narrative again but not defendant the evidence will show that she remained a silent partner and that silence had a price in the early afternoon on thursday november first mr preslee got a phone call and abruptly left work at act in an agitated state at twoohfive that afternoon he placed a call to defendant on his cell phone although defendantagaininitially denied to police that she had ever been to mr preslees apartment dna and her fingerprints will in fact place defendant at mr preslees home right around the time of his death at their table hardys hand closed around mayas wrist and she cast him a downward look and let out a sigh this last bit of evidence of course had caused mayas arrest and was in many ways the low point of the past several months the prosecution had developed its theory about the supposed relationships and possible blackmail between vogler preslee and maya but without any physical evidence tying maya to preslees home even with his telephone call to her from his cell phone there was no practical chance that she could ever be charged with preslees murder and possibly not even with voglers ladies and gentlemen stier went on we have here nearly the exact same pattern of behavior from defendant in two related homicides when she was in college defendant became involved with both victims in the sale of marijuana you will hear evidence that defendant both used and sold this and other drugs and hear eyewitness testimony that her criminal partners vogler and preslee participated in robberies of other drug dealers since those days defendant has masqueraded as an upperclass mother a good wife a regular churchgoer and a lawabiding citizen this new life was allimportant to her for many reasons but most particularly because she is a member of one of san franciscos most prominent political families here at last was hardys first chance to stem the onslaught objection your honor he said irrelevant and argumentative judge braun frowned down at him and let him know how the wind was going to blow i think neither she said overruled stier nodded at the bench continuing smoothly defendant paid dearly to keep her past secret you will hear another eyewitnessthe victim mr voglers commonlaw wifetestify that her husband with whom defendant had been intimate was blackmailing defendant over an eightyear period the blackmail mostly took the form of an exorbitant salary that he took as manager of bay beans west but lately defendants financial records will reveal a pattern of money laundering through the coffee shop that corroborates the bare fact of the blackmail and provides a compelling motive for mr voglers murder and in fact for mr preslees the evidence overwhelmingly supports the peoples contention that defendant killed both mr vogler and mr preslee because one had been blackmailing her and the other was about to do the same she used her own gun to kill mr vogler andwith that gun in police custodyused the nearest thing that came to hand a kitchen cleaver to kill mr preslee but both of these were premeditated acts that the state of california defines as firstdegree murder and that is the verdict i will ask you to deliver at the end of this trial thank you glitsky sat feet up behind his desk which was getting pretty much littered with peanut shells hed opened the high blinds up sometime over the past six weeks since hardy had last been up here once it had become reasonable to assume that zachary would recover so the room was at last adequately lighted again hardy and frannie had been at the glitskys home two weeks before and while zack still wore a footballtype helmet during his every waking moment to both hardys he seemed absolutely normal back to what he had been before the accident it was abe hardy felt who had irrevocably changed not a man whom anybody would mistake for mr sunshine in any event glitsky couldnt seem to absorb the reality that zachary was better and that this was good news for him and for his life instead his focus tended to be on his own responsibility for the accident in the first place his general incompetence as a human being his unlucky star whatever it was much of what had always been at best a dark and cynical spark now had ceased to throw any light at all and hardy found it disturbing and wearying not that he was giving up on his best friend but he was constantly trying to come up with ideas that might help restore abe to something like what he used to be stopping up here unexpectedly at lunchtime today on the first day of trial with a fresh supply of peanuts for example the peanuts that glitsky had always kept in his desk drawertop left until hardy had surreptitiously moved them one day to top righthad run out just before christmas never to be replaced so even though he had his own opening argument to deliver when court resumed after lunch he stopped by to drop off the gift and chat for a few minutes and it had started of course with a discussion of stiers opening which glitsky thought was pretty compelling admittedly though he said popping a nut im the choir he was preaching to you probably didnt really want to ask me oh right i forgot for a minute what was the part though that convinced you of what that mayas guilty glitskys hands rested together on his stomach he leaned back in his chair ive got one for you what part of it didnt you believe i believed all of it hardy said there you go dont worry about it youre due for a loss anyway natglitskys eightysomething fathersays the occasional loss strengthens the spirit the old what doesnt kill us makes us strong right a shadow fell over glitskys face i have to admit though sometimes not when did you get a loss recently glitskys face went a shade darker hello you been around the last few months youre taking zack as a loss last i saw he was bouncing off the furniture last i saw he was walking around in a football helmet maybe you didnt notice maybe you didnt hear what you just said he was walking around the football helmet was against future injury if im not mistaken is there something you arent telling me about what zack all ive heard is that all signs point to complete recovery glitsky shook his head they dont know for sure but they say what i said dont they all signs point et cetera they say theyre cautiously optimistic thats cause if they say hes all better and something happens theyre afraid ill sue em how about if its because they dont think anything else bad is going to happen they can think it all they want nobodys saying they know it nobody can know it why again are we talking about this you were calling it a loss thats why yeah well its what it is whatever you call it glitsky pulled his feet off the desk what were we talking about before that came up stiers opening staring off into the middle distance between them glitsky absently cracked another peanut shell thats the main thing i used to have a pretty good brain now my attention span i get one thought it goes away another one stops by i cant string any of them together its just like im endlessly distracted i cant seem to get myself out of it hardy asked you talking to somebody sure treya nat you from time to time i mean a professional glitsky almost smiled thats not happening its not something i can figure out and decide to change how do you know that i just do all right he ate a nut and im kind of done with this topic okay hardy could take a hint sure what do you think about the mayor being down there pretty bold statement i cant figure out if it helps or hurts me i mean its a jury glitsky said only takes one howd braun take it like youd suspect she blamed me of course naturally i would have too well there you go but however it plays with kathy and harlen bottom line is its just another distraction and my clients only chance is if this thing starts being about the evidence at some point i thought that was the px never got there not even close hardy shook his head and threw a baleful look across the desk this might be a good time to remind you that you never signed off on the arrest if you recall lets not go there diz you know i didnt have to bracco and schiff had more than enough the px confirmed it and ps didnt you just tell me about five minutes ago you believed every word stier said yeah i think hes right it all works as a theory but i dont think he proves any of itthe evidence doesnt prove it thats for sure and thats kind of what hes supposed to do well glitsky suddenly realized theyd eaten all the peanuts hed left out so he stood up stretched his back started gathering the used shells for the wastebasket theres the beauty of the system if theres no evidence youll get her off id say isnt it pretty to think so abe except the lines already taken after hardy left glitskys short attention span still worked well enough to jog him into writing himself a note to go over the maya townshend file just to make sure that bracco and schiff had presented their case as clearly and with enough evidence as they could to paul stier hardy was rightglitsky had been out at the time with zacharys medical care issues and his troops hadnt run their evidence by him even once if theyd left anything out glitsky wanted to be sure he got it back in not that it would break his heart for hardy to lose one the guy god knew was due if hardy thought it had been madness in and around the courtroom for the morning session in fact it had been as a mild and peaceful meadow compared to the riotous frenzy that greeted him as he got off the elevator on the third floor after his talk with glitsky evidently kathy west was going to be staying around at least for the afternoon session and clearly this was making some big waves out in the real world the mayor didnt come down and sit around in open court very often and her presence had become just what hardy didnt need right nowthe biggest news story of the day perhaps the biggest nationwide the entire hallway was stuffed with humanitylots of the press varietyand hardy was trying to elbow his way through should he be even one minute tardy he would face judge brauns wrath and possibly a contempt fine hardy didnt know whether it was police paranoia brauns need for control or one of the mayors staff trying to protect the boss but someone had ordered a makeshift metal detector station outside the courtroom door and what had at first appeared to be an amorphous mob was in fact a restricted and organized line waiting to get in very very slowly at near the head of the line he made out the figures of his two partnersgina roake and wes farrellunexpectedly coming down for the show as if he needed it here was a true litmus test for how quickly the news of the mayors attendance had spread throughout the city but he didnt think he could push his way through enough to get to them in any event the crowd didnt strike him as one that would be tolerant of cuts hardy might not have been a fan of the architecture of the hall of justice but he knew his way around the building hewing to the back wall of the wide and echoing hallway he inched his way along against the current and eventually found that the door to department was open court wasnt yet in session there and he walked up through the deserted courtroom and into the back corridor that connected all the departments on this floor unchallenged by bailiffs all of whom were doing crowd control in department he approached the door through which they would later bring his client as he came abreast of the judges chambers he stopped the door to brauns chamber was open about halfway and paul stier and jerry glass were coming out of it still in amiable conversation with braun when they saw hardy both their progress and the discussion came to an abrupt and awkward halt gentlemen your honor hardy said and held his ground actually more shocked than angry waiting for the explanation that would have to be forthcoming one of the most sacrosanct rules in jurisprudence was that attorneys with active cases before a judge were not to have any ex parte interaction with that judge any and it went both ways a judge should not allow or entertain the possibility of such interaction what hardy had just witnessed was an apparently flagrant violation of that ruleenough that he might on those grounds alone immediately move for a mistrial and later the judges recusal of herself from the case glass came around stier and stepped right into the breach with what hardy considered a pathetically cavalier approach an offhand wave a light tone counselor this is not what you think it is this was unworthy of a response since obviously it was what it was hardy in no way tempted to be forgiving or friendly looked around the two men and into the room your honor he asked with a hint of demand in his voice braun came forward embarrassed but clearly determined to brass her way through mr glass is right nothing untoward occurred here mr hardy these gentlemen happened to pass my doorway and i heard them talking about the mayors appearance in the gallery and we exchanged a few casual words about it thats all much as you and i are doing right now with respect your honor you and i are talking right now in the presence of my opponent and overtly or not we are discussing the case before your court as a matter of fact before we go on and if we are to go on id like to request that the court recorder be present thats ridiculous glass blurted out hardy ignored him focused on braun your honor he said again after an excruciating five seconds the judges eyes having squinted down in concentration she nodded and with a touch of ostentation checked her watch courts back in session in six minutes she said ill see you gentlemen out there and with that she closed her door in the courtroom maya had yet to be brought in hardy greeted kathy and harlen cordially through the press around them and thanked them for their show of support he said hello to joel then excusing himself he caught gina roakes eye back a few rows and motioned both her and farrell up to the bar rail when they got there he said im going to believe you both came down here to take notes on how a master does an opening statement what else could it have been roake asked with a straight face then gave a little wave over at the mayor and harlen the bonds among all of them had of course become a bit strained over the years and all of these individuals evolved into new relationships new jobs evenit sometimes seemednew selves but seven or eight years before when the city was in turmoil over the resignation of district attorney sharron pratt and the grand jury indictment for murder of her chief assistant the thenmayor had appointed a new district attorney clarence jackman had come on board from the private sector to restore some semblance of ordergetting the department back on budget prosecuting crimes litigating the citys business problems jackman had gathered around him a kitchen cabinet that met most tuesdays at lou the greeks that group had included among a few others hardy roake their nowdeceased partner david freeman kathy west who was a city supervisor back then glitsky the chronicle columnist jeff elliot and jackmans secretary glitskys future wife treya although gina continued it is always nice to see kathy shes looking particularly perky today dont you think i do but enough about kathy hardy said i need a little advice ive got a question for you guys farrell was ready for him berlin he said good answer hardy replied wrong question though the real question is what do you do if you see your judge schmoozing with your opposite number yeah berlin would be wrong for that one farrell conceded youre talking ex parte when did it happen just now five minutes ago braun and stier and jerry glass back in her chambers what were they talking about roake asked not that it should matter too much thats my point hardy said i think at the least ive got to have her memorialize what went on farrell asked doesnt she already hate you i believe thats accurate so in that case how could it hurt it could always hurt roake said your judge hates you she can fuck you in myriad subtle and unreviewable ways as i know youre aware you really dont want her hating you more than she does yeah but this happened if she doesnt memorialize it it goes away all im saying roake went on is compare it to what happens if she does could be a lot worse and you wouldnt even know it and more to the point diz what do you get for pissing her off theyre going to make up some kind of bullshit explanation no matter what they were doing and no court of appeal will ever give you a reversal you get nothing for your trouble so anything you could lose is not worth it maybe farrell put in you could ask her if she wants to recuse herself that would just piss her off too farrell made a face okay then how about going to thomasino oscar thomasino was the presiding judge of the superior court and more importantly for these purposes a reasonably warm acquaintance of hardy and both his partners i thought of that hardy said but i didnt hear anything they said and braun will just say it was a casual conversation that had nothing to do with the case and guess what that too will piss her off knowing that i get out of bed every morning probably pisses her off now that i think about it maybe you should have challenged farrell said thank you hardy replied with heavy irony if only maybe ill whip into my time machine and go back and do it when i could do you really want her out diz roake asked hardy turned to her his voice barely a whisper nothing would make me happier but one ex parte communication seems a little thin as grounds go to get rid of her especially if they werent in fact talking about the case it might be smarter gina said to let her keep on knowing that youve got something on her i like that farrell said better to have her think she owes you and im guessing roake added that you want to decide right away actually i think ive decided but the last thing is i dont want her thinking im a wimp and shes frightened me off farrell grinned at that i think she already knows you better than that so i just keep this in my pocket that flies for both of you no memorializing no recusing his partners silently conferred with each other glances back and forth consensus as soon as she ascended to the bench and got the courtroom under control braun called the attorneys up to her bench for a sidebar mr hardy she began were on the record now is there anything youd like to bring up before the court calling him right away on what hed seen if he was going to make trouble for her it would start now and shed have it in her mind while he was delivering his opening statement hardy his blood rushing with what had somewhat surprisingly turned into ragetinged frustration tried to slow his breathing he finally came out with it nothing your honor hardy saw brauns eyes narrow if he looked he was sure he could have seen the wheels spinning in stiers head as he tried to figure out what trick the legendary dismas hardy was pulling now braun could see no reason not to accept the trojan horse and actually looked as though she felt a moment of relief if not gratitude that hardy had decided to let her off the hook mr stier she asked just at that moment a camera clicked loudly in the gallery followed immediately by a cell phone going off and braun looked up and exploded rapping her gavel several times in quick succession thats all im going to tolerate of cameras and other disturbances i granted permission for a number of news cameras to be in this courtroom at the slightest further disruption that permission will be revoked i want no more pictures taken i want all cell phones turned off here she looked over the front of her podium as a matter of fact now that i think about it for the remainder of this trial after todaybailiffs please notei will not be allowing cameras into the courtroom at the mild rumble of protest that arose in the gallery at this edict she banged her gavel again i am this close she said to expelling people with cameras right now but in the interests of keeping things moving ill hold off on that order unless someone abuses it she glared through her glasses for another ten seconds or so scanning the gallery right to left left to right for signs of disobedience finding none she returned to the prosecuting attorney standing next to hardy in front of her mr stier yes your honor i believe before that interruption that the court was asking if the people are ready to begin the big ugly for an instant took on an expression that somewhat explained the nickname nervous and with a light sheen of perspiration on his high forehead stier cleared his throat and threw a quick glance at hardy then came back up to the judge he finally decided that while he couldnt figure out what hardy was doing if hardy wanted something any smart prosecutor wanted the opposite your honor he began i call your attention to a meeting that took place just minutes ago at the door to your chambers where you and i exchanged a few pleasantries relating to the mayors appearance in the courtroom today but outside of the presence of mr hardy hardy couldnt believe his ears but he wasnt inclined to interrupt braun looked for all the world as though she was going to have a stroke right there on the bench go on she said what do you think is so important that it needs to be memorialized at this point in the proceeding oblivious stier kept digging his grave i believe that in the interests of precluding a defense appeal on grounds of this technically ex parte communication between you and myself it is in the interest of justice that that discussion be memorialized and entered into the record then if mr hardys got any objections he can raise them now hardy stood with the muscles in his jaw locked against breaking into a victory grin this was the kind of moment that his old mentor david freeman had lived for you plan and you plan and then you strategize and plan some more and then something completely unexpected happens and youre back in the ball game in a way you had never imagined possible sometimes you just had to love the majestic insanity of the law stier had just overstrategized himself into a truly dumb move and judge braun never subtle was letting him know it by her body language and withering expression very well counselor she clipped out through lips tight enough that it didnt appear she was moving her mouth at all by all means lets memorialize that conversation court reporter and attorneys in chambers tenminute recess finally hardy stood to deliver his opening statement he had the option of either delivering it now or waiting until the prosecution closed its case in chief but like most experienced defense attorneys he didnt want to give the jury too much time to live with the version of the crime theyd just heard described in the prosecutions opening statement even with many murder trials under his belt hardy expected that he would be struck by openingday jittersthe familiar hollowness in his stomach the deadness in his legswhen he first stood to address the jury especially with the large and captivated crowd in the courtroom the sudden sense that something of major import was transpiring here when he rose to come around his table and face the panel though he found himself possessed of an almost unnatural calm even a confidence the easy camaraderie between braun and stier had just suffered a serious blow and while the prosecutor was probably still reeling from it hardy could use this small but real advantage to push the envelope a bitmaybe throw in a little argument which was forbidden in opening statementsand while stiers attention was focused elsewhere perhaps escape without too much interruption in the form of objections from the prosecution table he began in an amiable fashion wearing an easy smile and making eye contact with every juror he could before he started good afternoon this morning mr stier related to you an extravagant scenario of motivation and coincidence that he hopes will convince you that maya townshend is guilty of two counts of firstdegree murder much in the same way that stier always referred to maya as defendant to dehumanize her to the jury hardy would strive at every opportunity to refer to her by her given name underscoring her humanity and personhood unfortunately for the peoples case but fortunately for maya and for justice what he left out of his story were the gaps and holes and inconsistencies in the socalled chain of evidence upon which the prosecution relies the prosecution cannot and will not prove that maya killed dylan vogler or that she killed levon preslee because she didnt did maya know dylan and levon when she was in college absolutely she did did she do some things shes ashamed of now as mr stier alleges yes will there be evidence such as direct eyewitness testimony to prove these things again the answer is yes hardy always conscious that he had a tendency to go too fast and gloss over elements of syllogisms that might be crucial to jury members had trained himself to slow down timing his restrained pacing from one end of the jury box to the other getting back to his table ostensibly to consult notes or take a drink of water sometimes just to touch it to keep him in his rhythm center him for another lap now he touched the wood of his table gave a quick confident nod to his client and turned back to the jury so the prosecution can prove that maya townshendhe walked over to her putting his hands on her shoulderssmallbusiness owner wife and mother of two young children made mistakes when she was in college we know that she was a student at the university of san francisco because there are records supporting her attendance there she appears four times in four years in the schools yearbook and several times in the universitys newspaper the foghorn similarly we will learn from her classmates at the time that she associated regularly with both dylan vogler and with levon preslee and we will hear from other eyewitnesses that these young students were not exactly members of the choir these are facts supported by both documentary and eyewitness testimony hardy didnt dare glance back at stier he was well into argument here and so far he was getting away with it the prosecutor still licking his wounds hadnt engaged yet he was no doubt listening but he wasnt hearing but thats not what shes accused of shes accused of murder and for that accusation the prosecution has no evidence the district attorney tells you that it has evidence to support the charges it has brought against her evidence that directly ties herand this is importantthat ties her and no one else to these crimes that is simply not so the actual truth is that unlike the story about mayas earlier life which the prosecution can back up with witnesses and documents there is nothing to tie her to evidence of these murders except innuendo and speculation and why is that hardy paused taking a moment up by the witness chair again meeting the gaze of juror after juror the answer ladies and gentlemen is quite simple the prosecution wont provide you with this evidence because none of it exists there are no eyewitnesses who will claim they saw her in the presence of either of the two victims on the day of their respective deaths there is no documentary evidencesay a time stamp or video recordinganalogous to the usf yearbook or the issues of the foghorn that places maya in the company of either of these two victims at the time of their deaths nearby yes by her own admission but nearby ladies and gentlemen is not good enough to meet the legal standard that will take you beyond reasonable doubt this time hardy stopped at his table for a quick sip of water he glanced out at the gallery at kathy west and harlen and joel in the front row right in front of him nodding to them soberly he came back to the jury now i can see some of you asking yourselves wait a minute this is a young woman without a criminal record if she didnt do it if there were no proof that she did it why would she be on trial why would the state of california expend all this enormous time energy and expense if there is no physical evidence tying her to these crimes these are excellent questions and unfortunately they go begging for answers because the real truth of this prosecution is that there is no physical evidence proving that maya ever fired the weapon that killed mr vogler or held the knife that killed mr preslee no eyewitnesses no fingerprints no physical evidence no incriminating bloodstains on maya or on her shoes or on her clothing no nothing she was in the vicinity of both deaths on the times they occurred yes but both times she was summoned to those placesas her phone records will attestby the victims themselves or by someone calling her on their telephones that someone is i submit the person who should be sitting where maya is now charged with these murders he or she is every bit as realin fact more realthan the socalled evidence you will hear connecting maya to these murders the police simply havent found or identified this person as a suspect thisthe theory of the case that hardy would be arguing whether he believed it or notbrought a significant buzz to the packed courtroom as hed known it would the pundits the reporters the court tv and other television crewsand with kathy wests presence he knew thered be vanloads of them now in the next few dayswould dissect this strategy from every imaginable angle was hardy wise to show his hand so early was this pure cynicism did he have any proof of his own to support what he was saying wasnt the sodditsome other dude did itdefense one of the most hackneyed and noncredible strategies in criminal law hardy didnt care whether he could prove it or notand he couldnthe still felt that he could make it sing to at least one of the jurors and that was the name of the game and incredibly he thought stier still hadnt said a word well hardy was going to give him another chance he took another sip of water set the glass down carefully turned slowly to face the jury panel again all this brings us back of course to the question of why maya has been arrested and charged with these murders unfortunately the answer is cynical at best and despicable at worst maya townshend owned the coffee shop bay beans west out of which mr vogler sold marijuana although there is again no evidence tying maya to mr voglers marijuana businessthe documents to which mr stier referred in his opening purportedly proving some marijuana business connection between mr vogler and maya are inconclusive and ambiguous at bestmaya proved an inviting target as a suspect for a number of reasons none of them having to do with evidence all of them having to do with political ambition and expediency if stier had been asleep to this point he was all the way awake now and seemingly in full fettle objection your honor argumentative this is an outrageous accusation offered without proof it has no place in an opening statement or indeed anywhere in this trial and again braun revealing the depths of enmity one encountered if one got on her wrong side as stier had obviously done surprised hardy i was wondering when youd notice mr stier she said but youre a few beats late mr hardy is simply presenting his theory of the case as you did in your own opening objection overruled you may proceed mr hardy thank you your honor hardy wasted not a second before getting back to his tale from the outset of their investigation the two homicide detectives handling this case were hampered withguess whatlack of evidence in an effort to shake up one or more of their potential suspectsand the testimony of those inspectors will reveal that there were more than a couple of themone of the detectives debra schiff happened upon the strategy of contacting a gentleman named jerry glass the united states federal attorney based in san francisco she persuaded mr glass to use the very tenuous marijuana connection between bay beans west and maya townshend not only to impugn mayas character and reputation but also to provide her with an apparent motive for these murdersone that has no basis in reality or in evidence but almost worse it also attempts to explain away this lack of evidence by the implication that mayas close relativeswho include a supervisor and the mayor of this citysomehow colluded with her to cover up her transgressions your honor i must object again stier rose at his table all of this highflown rhetoric is just a smoke screen meant to confuse the jury braun humorless looked down over her eyeglasses objections as you know mr stier must be on legal grounds argumentative then your honor she appeared to consider for a moment then shook her head overruled hardy nodded quickly to the bench acknowledging the ruling stier might not have realized it but hed just insulted the jury and questioned its intelligence by implying that hardys smoke screen would fool them into giving the wrong verdict now hardy thought hed play the other side of that coin praising their sagacity and collective wisdom finally ladies and gentlemen he continued i need hardly point out to you that this trial has taken on a very high public profile a glance at the size of the gallery here the number of reporters and even some of the spectatorshe paused for a ripple of appreciation to flow through the galleryall of these things make it clear that this trial has the potential to be a careermaking moment objection hardy heard the word behind him but he was too energized to stop himself now and not inclined to in any event he was speaking what he believed to be the absolute truth and he wanted the jury to hear in fact he raised his voice and continued a careermaking moment for people whose ambitions your honor louder still objection irrelevant and argumentative mr hardy whose ambitions exceed their sense of fairness and whose thirst for fame and recognition blinds them to the simple demands of justice bam bam mr hardy thats enough mr stier objection sustained mr hardy but he was a step ahead of her i apologize your honor i got a little carried away apparently she said please dont let it happen again jurors will disregard that last outburst of mr hardys then back at hardy all right you may proceed hardy took a small breath having made it at last to what had become almost his boilerplate closing this trial is about determining who caused the deaths of two peopledylan vogler and levon preslee one died by gunshot wound and the other by the stroke of a cleaver the evidence is quite clear on these points but where the evidence is not clear and in fact where it altogether fails is where it purports to connect maya townshend to either of these murders it is neither clear nor clean where it needs to be unambiguous it is open to interpretation where it needs to dispel reasonable doubt it only adds to it no real evidence inexorably connects maya townshend to these murders now his own adrenaline storm having passed hardy thought he could maintain his less dramatic tone and lull stier into failing to object on argumentative grounds one last time as you were seated on this jury you all swore an oath that you would presume the innocence of maya townshend she must remain innocent in your eyes until the prosecution presents you with enough hard physical evidence to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that she in fact committed these crimes that means you must be sure of the intimate details of these crimes when mr stier tells you that he cant say exactly how maya killed mr vogler or mr preslee he is admitting that he doesnt have that proof and without that proof there is doubt where there is doubt there is innocence my client maya townshend is innocentand she will rely on your sworn oath to presume that innocence and after you have weighed all the facts in this case to return a verdict of not guilty braun called a recess as soon as hardy sat down while maya was in the restroom hardy pushed his chair back to the bar rail and turned around resting his elbow on it well he said to what he hoped was his private little fan club of kathy harlen and joel townshend i think i got a few licks in anyway howd it play out here excellent joel said joel had become a rather more enthusiastic partner in mayas defense since the arrest of course this had come at the expense of a seismic shift in his worldview before the weekend of dylan voglers death hed never had occasion to think that the world wasnt at base a fair and equitable place hed always had enough money and social standing to remain above the little mundane headaches that most people faced constantlyhousehold bills fights about money or time or chores if he wanted to go out to dinner they hired a babysitter and didnt care what the meal cost if he and maya were tired or bored theyd go spend a night or two in napa or carmel to rejuvenate themselves their friends were people more or less like them and other people he met tended to be polite at least to him personally perhaps even more fundamentally he never really had to prove himself to get a loan or make a connection he got the benefit of the doubt and now not just suddenly but seemingly instantaneously all of that had ended the properties against which hed taken out more loans to finance other properties and ventures were no longer rocksolid as collateral his social life with his wife incarcerated in the county jail essentially vanished he found himself amazed by how completely life changed when you got accused of wrongdoing at first hed held to the belief that this whole affair was just a mistake and if he could just find the right person to talk to and explain everything it would all go away he and maya would go back to their real life but by now he had come to realize that this wasnt going to happen he and his wife were somehow in the criminal justice system and this more than anything meant that the benefit of the doubt had evaporated no one in the system was inclined to believe anything he said the motivations for anything he did got skewed and twisted by people who started out by considering him if not a criminal then at least a shady character and once they had that mindset nothing was going to change now he was going on to hardy i like the way you laid this conspiracy these people have cooked up right out there me too hardy said i couldnt believe braun let it in but if she was going to let me i sure as hell was going to run with it my concern harlen fisk said is its going to turn up the heat on glass let it kathy west declared harlen and i showing up here ought to be enough to do that i welcome it and diz you just declared open war which also suits me fine jerry glass has got nothing on us this will all get litigated away in civil court but in the meanwhile this is where we fight it where it can do maya the most good its great you both came down for this hardy said to kathy and harlen it was really a good idea kathy let them know were not cowering and hiding and plotting some backroom deal i think its really shocked them the mayor nodded that was my intention are you planning on coming in every day hardy asked this brought a smile when i can maybe i will if it will have some strategic value for you but daytoday ive still got this city to run i should be here most days fisk said wave the flag for my sis so whats the next step joel asked witnesses hardy replied we get down to it if paul stier felt hed taken a few hits from hardys opening statement or harbored any residual resentment at judge braun he showed no sign of either as he stood in the center of the courtroom the people call sergeant lennard faro the head of crime scene investigations stood up in the second row of the gallery and came through the door in the bar rail and up to the witness stand welldressed as always in snug tan pants a pink dress shirt and a subtly shimmering light brown sports coat he cut a dashing figure very much at odds with that of most other cops with his spiky dark hair gold stud earring and welltrimmed goatee he might have been a young graduate student or fashion designer but even so his experience and ease on the witness stand soon verified the credentials he outlined to stier as they beganfourteen years on the force the last eight with the csi unit the last six in charge of it now sergeant what is your role at these crime scenes my team of three officers and i search the general area for physical evidence that might be related to the crime we collect as evidence anything of interest we also photograph the victim and the scene to try and create a record of everything at the scene as it was when we found it though a bit unusual since murder trials often began with forensic and medical evidence hardy thought stiers decision to call faro first was a good bit of strategy this would put evidence at the crime scenes into the trial at the outset potentially rebutting hardys contention in his opening statement that there was little or no physical evidence tying maya to the murders it was also a prime opportunity to get pictures of the victims in front of the juryreal human beings whod been murdered sergeant were you present at the scene of dylan voglers murder yes sir and would you tell the jury how you proceeded sure faro the consummate witness nodded and came forward in the witness chair turning slightly to be facing the jury i arrived at a few minutes before eight with three other crimescene technicians would you describe the scene as you found it it was a saturday morning nice day and patrolmen from the local precinct had already cordoned off the site with police tape their lieutenant bill banks was also at the scene did it appear that officers had appropriately preserved the scene so that you could begin your investigation yes it did describe please the body of the victim mr voglers body was lying on the ground in a paved alley by the back door of his business he showed signs of a gunshot wound in the chest showing you peoples one through six do these appear to be photographs accurately depicting mr voglers body in the alley as you first saw it yes they do after the scene was photographed did you conduct a search of the alley to determine what if any evidence might be present at the scene yes i did hardy knew that in fact all four crime techs had searched the alley but if any of the other three located something they would call faro over without touching it and he would photograph and collect the evidence that way faro could testify to finding each piece of evidence without needing to have the other three come to court among other debris i found onecaliber brass bullet casing and acaliber glock semiautomatic handgun stier went through the same process of authenticating and introducing the photos of the items as they were found at the scene then he went to his counsel table and retrieved two evidence containers that held the items he had them marked as peoples exhibits and showed them to faro now sergeant do you recognize these yes i do please tell the jury what they are this allowed faro to repeat for the third timein case one of the jury members was actually so dense that theyd missed it the first two timeshis account of finding the gun and the casing in the alley whatever else stier might be he was professional and methodical he went through the same process having faro describe where and how he found the bullet in the stucco wall photos of the bullet hole and the projectile itself went into evidence for the next twenty minutes they went over all of the things faro had not found in the alley although he had looked for them no other casings no other weapons no other bullet strikes on any of the walls or surfaces no signs of blood no footprints absolutely nothing out of the ordinary in that alley he even described though they did not physically produce the bag of garbage they packaged up for later examination at the labthe coke cans cigarette butts and not surprisingly about a dozen coffee cups having finished the crime scene stier moved on to work faro had done at the lab as well as working at crime scenes faro wore a second hat as a firearms examiner in the lab stier went through his extensive training and experience and qualified him as an expert and then led him through the process of comparing the bullet from the wall to the guntestfiring the weapon and comparing the known bullet microscopically to the bullet in evidence as hardy knew he would he said that although the bullets appeared similar in class characteristics and likely came from the same sort of gun there were insufficient details on the recovered slug to say with absolute certainty that it had come from the gun in the alley stier knew that this was not his strongest point and he moved to buttress it tell the jury please what tests if any you ran on the spent casing and what results you got the brass casing is part of a round of ammunition used in thecaliber glock the marks on the base of the casingcaused by the weapons firing mechanismwere consistent with other markings we could create on other bullet casings fired from the same weapon does that mean the casing necessarily came from the weapon found in the alley no like the bullet it came from a glock but i cant say with certainty it was that same glock but of course sergeant you found no other bullets or casings in that alley correct right hardy knew that this was a repetitive and therefore objectionable question but that objecting would only draw more attention to something he hoped the jury would not focus on so he let it go stier saved the best for last sergeant is there a database that firearms examiners can access to determine ownership of a handgun hardy knew that this was gilding the lilyany cop could access this database even a clerk could access the database stiers question suggested that this was some sort of secret database and that you had to be a member of a club to look at it but there was nothing hardy could do about it once again he had to tip his hat to stier for knowing his business yes there is a database the gun had a registration number and i ran that with a brightness implying that this was all new to him stier glanced over the jury sharing with them his enthusiasm for the hunt a registration number you mean the gun was licensed to an individual yes and who is that person sergeant the defendant maya townshend a wave of energy swept through the gallery stier paused just a moment for dramatic effect until the room was dead silent again hardy knew that this was a low point and that it was just going to get worse when the fingerprint examiner told the jury that mayas fingerprints were on the magazine that held the ammunition on the weapon from the alley the best hardy could hope for from the fingerprint expert was going to be a discussion of an unidentified partial fingerprint on the spent casing but since hardy knew that ultimately that print could have been left by anyone who ever handled the ammunition who worked where it was manufactured or clerked in the store where it was sold that was precious little stier took the opportunity by a sideways glance to include the jury in his acknowledgment of the witness thank you sergeant then somewhat to hardys surprise stier half turned to look at him your witness mr hardy hardys surprise came from the fact that hed expected faro to remain on the stand to testify about the preslee crime scene but apparently stier had an alternate strategy in mind for that portion of the peoples case for now hardy had a job to do and he squeezed his clients arm and rose with a show of confidence from their table sergeant faro he began in your testimony today talking about the alleged murder weapon the glock and the brass casing and bullet that you found at the scene of mr voglers murder you used the words consistent with several times did you not yes i think so tell the jury please what you mean by that phrase after a moments hesitation faro shrugged im not sure i know a better word we fired a few rounds from the gun in the lab and compared the indent left by the firing pin on those casings to the gun from the alley and they were virtually indistinguishable from one another virtually indistinguishable do you mean to say that they were exactly the same yes but you cant say that the casing came from the gun can you sergeant no and thats because your virtually indistinguishable markings were in fact so few in number that they dont permit a comparison correct yes to make a point sergeant your name has an a r in it doesnt it stier spoke up from behind him objection irrelevant braun let her curiosity overcome her distaste for hardy overruled faro spoke up yes it does faro well so does mine sergeant hardy does that mean we have the same name objection argumentative sustained move on mr hardy braun reminding him that she was aware that shed been ruling in his favor more often than was her wont but that his leash was very short now and tightening sergeant how many glocks are there in the world objection speculation overruled mr stier you qualified sergeant faro as a firearms expert hardy fenced with faro in this vein for a moment before concluding in other words sergeant faro he said you cant tell this jury that this casing came from this gun can you no i cannot and in fact arent there thousands of other glocks that could have left this casing yes there are thank you sergeant hardy kept his face impassive but brought his hands together in muted delight now as to the bullet itself thecaliber slug that youve identified as the bullet that killed mr vogler again you used the words consistent with sergeant did you not run a ballistics test on this slug yes we did and arent ballistics tests conclusive generally yes they can be when are they not well when the slug is deformed or mutilated and was the slug deformed or mutilated no not too bad it was embedded in stucco and wood but it was okay and so was your ballistics test conclusive faro shot a quick impatient look over to stier shook his head at hardy no hardy put on an expression of mild surprise no why not because like with the casing this particular bullet lacked sufficient microscopic detail to permit a conclusive match faro seemed to feel obliged to defend his inability to give more conclusive evidence this particular type of weapon has a type of unique hexagonal rifling in the barrel that tends not to leave the marks necessary for an exact ballistics comparison so again sergeant let me ask you is it possible that the slug that we have here did not come from the gun owned by maya townshend this time since it was foreordained and though he clearly hated the pass to which hed come faro didnt struggle with his answer yes after a small pause hardy went on sergeant did you and your crimescene unit get called to the scene of mr preslees murder yes we did a confused frown well sergeant its true is it not that you found not one shred of evidence inside mr preslees home indicating that maya townshend had ever even been inside the place much less murdered anybody there as hardy had anticipated stier was on his feet immediately objection beyond the scope of direct examination well get to the levon preslee murder scene in due course sustained hardy didnt care he knew hed gotten on the boards first with that crime at least making his point in front of the jury hardy came back to the witness no further questions the door to the jails visiting room swung open and hardy stood as maya came in he waited patiently while the female guard asked his permission and then undid mayas handcuffs with a gentleness that he found heartbreaking maya had proven herself time and again to be much tougher than she looked but hardy had found that it was the little personal indignities that often broke peoples spirits when they were in jail but this guard was solicitous even going so far as to touch mayas arm and give her a confident nod before leaving attorney and client alone in the glassblockenclosed space i hate this place you know that maya said as they sat down on their metal chairs its worse than the cell i cant say its exactly my favorite either hardy quickly took in their surroundings hed been here many times and the small semicircular room had a certain familiarity to him at one time not so very long ago the building they were in had been the new jail and the polished concrete floors and glass walls lent a sense of openness and light to these rooms that at first had seemed far less oppressive than the rectangular confessionalsized attorneys visiting rooms at the old jail over the years though this rooms diaphanous warmth too had dissipated somehow perhaps under the psychic toll of its everyday use now it was just another old room somehow colder for its modernity its sterility its cruel illusion of openness through the glass maybe i should smuggle in some rugs a couple of plants he said i could bring them in my briefcase every time thatd spruce the place right up i bet unable to fake even a stab at levity maya simply said im not sure it would help no i guess not hardy tried to maintain an upbeat and easygoing style since he saw no reason to add to his clients pain but sometimes there was no help for it has joel been by she nodded swallowed the lump in her throat but outside at the regular visiting place this was a long room for friends and relativesas opposed to attorneyssimilar in fact to those seen on television and in the movies with a row of visitor stations on either side of plexiglas windows with speakers set in them rendering any true personal contact impossible it doesnt really work out there he only comes by because he feels like he needs to he comes by hardy said because he loves you all right maya clearly didnt want to talk about it she bowed her head lowered her eyes then with a forced interest so howd we do out there today i was going to ask you i cant believe they keep going ahead with it i know ive had the same thought myself especially with levon they have nothing at all do they your presence i guess they feel thats all theyre going to need once they convince the jury on dylan she sat still a moment hands on her lap i just keep thinking that if only he hadnt been carrying that weed with him they probably would have found the stash at his house anyway and the garden and maybe the computer records too but if he wasnt selling the stuff out of the shop we cant just keep doing if maya he was youre right youre right she paused so what about kathy and harlen coming down today does that help us i think so though i wish shed run it by me first another silence can i ask you something anything you want the other person who you said did it is anybody looking for him well the cops arent thats a safe bet so how about us how about us what we look for him or her dont forget her no i never would but really this gambit or suggestion or whatever it was was heartening in some small way but hardy kept his emotional guard up though technically it didnt matter what he actually thought about mayas guilt or lack thereof she might think it would give him a psychological boost at the trial if she somehow got him believing she was innocent and this question clearly telegraphed her assumption of another murderer without her having to directly lie to her attorney by saying she hadnt done it the problem was he knew that shed done something something damn serious about which she obviously was carrying an enormous load of guilt and he also knew or thought he knew what shed been blackmailed aboutrobberies or perhaps worse that she must have committed with dylan and levon so unless shed committed murder in the course of one of those whoa he told himself therein lies the path to madness but then he thought why not theyd come this far and he came out with it maya yes or no were you involved in the robbery that got dylan and levon sent to prison she straightened her back nobody can prove i was thats not what i asked she hesitated no a beat not that one so that is in fact what the blackmail was about she didnt answer turned her face to look at the wall i ask hardy pressed on because you should know that unless you committed murder or some other heinous crime during one of these robberies you cant be charged with anything anything else and the statutes of limitations have tolled her eyes came back to him they bore a shine that he thought might presage tears why are you so sure they were blackmailing me for one reason its the thing that makes the most sense you were involved in robberies with them in college yes finally her shoulders gave an inch ive already told you i did some bad stuff bad enough for life in prison maya bad enough to never live with your kids or your husband again she stared through him you want to tell me what it was just put it out here between me and you its privileged nobody else will ever know dont bully me her words had a sudden calm edge im not bullying you im saying you can tell me anything youve done what for so youd do something different i dont think so i think youd do all the same things make the same arguments in court whatever it is you believe id actually done isnt that true angry now hardy did not answer and then suddenly maya came at him on another tack what you dont seem to understand is that im being punished she said for what by who god god hardy felt his anger start to wane washed away in a wave of pity for this poor woman gods punishing you why the same reason he punishes anybody because of what theyve done she sat mute facing him maya if its unforgivable yes i thought his forgiveness was supposed to be infinite she answered in a small voice no not for everything no what wouldnt it cover how about if what you harm is truly innocent abruptly she drew herself up and stopped speaking what do you mean by that nothing i shouldnt have said anything hardy came forward in his chair maya he said are you talking about something that happened with you and dylan and levon a dead onenote bark of laughter didnt break the harsh set of her mouth if you even can ask that she said you dont have a clue what innocent means so tell me like the unborn that kind of innocent how about that that answer called to mind hardys discussion with hunt about whether the blackmail had been about an abortion early in her life so he asked her point blank is that it but she shook her head decidedly no i would never do that not ever but ive already said too much the point is that whatever happens however god decides all this has to go ill deserve it im good with that now im at peace with it well im not she lifted her shoulders in a small shrug im sorry about that she gestured around them about all of this i am too but so can we go back to what i was saying before what part of it looking for who did this a black throbbing bolus of pain came and settled in the space behind hardys left eye he brought his hand up and pressed at his temple what was this woman getting at hardy could think of several ways to interpret all that maya had said to him here this afternoon as a kind of confession and now she was urging him to look for the real murderer who he believed very probably did not exist he looked across at his clients troubled face and entertained the fleeting thought that she might be legally insane should he hire a shrink and do some tests would he be negligent if he didnt the first day of trial had already been too long too stressful it seemed to hardy that hed been in constant combat since early in the morning and now this he squeezed at his forehead maya he said are you telling me straight out now that you didnt kill these two guys her eyes widened closed down widened again and to his astonishment she broke into a genuine if shortlived laugh of course not leaving it as ambiguous as ever of course not she was not telling him such a thing straight out or alternatively of course not she hadnt killed dylan and levon after which she added in all seriousness how could you even say such a thing hardy left the jail shaken and confused when hed gone in to visit maya a february ball of pale egg yolk in the western sky was still dripping its feeble light onto the city when he came out his head still pounding it was full night and that added to his disorientation the neighborhood around the hall of justice felt more than ordinarily bereft of humanity but the emptiness seemed to go deeper a cold hard wind was kicking up a heavy dirty dust along with fast food wrappers from the gutters hardy had a walk of a few blocks ahead of him to get to where hed parked his car but when he got to bechettis the traditional comfortfood italian place at sixth and brannan he stopped long enough to consider going inside and having himself a stiff cocktail or twoalthough he knew it was a bad idea when you were in the first days of a murder trial reason won out but he hung a left and walked a hundred yards down the street and knocked at a purple door set in the side of a gray stucco warehouse and waited about ten seconds in front of the peephole until the door opened and then he was looking at wyatt hunt trick or treat he said hunt didnt miss a beat i hope you like jelly bellies thats all ive got left he opened the door and stepped back he was wearing black nikelogo running pants and tennis shoes and a tanktop warriors shirt and there was a shine to his skin as though hed been working out he certainly lived in the right place for it hed converted an ancient decrepit flower warehouse into a oneofakind environment the ceiling was probably twenty feet high the back third hed drywalled off into his living quartersbedroom bathroom denlibrary and kitchen which left an enormous open area perhaps sixty by eighty or ninety feet in front hardy had been here a few times before but every time was surprised by the fact that hunt parked his mini cooper inside his domicile just this side of the industrial slideup garagedoor entrance in the same wall as the front door the other unique feature was the actual halfbasketballcourt floorboard hunt had bought from the warriors the last time theyd upgraded for the fire sale price of four thousand dollars in the space between the court and his rooms on the other side of the court he had several guitars both acoustic and electric out on stands amps speakers his stereo system there was also a desk against the wall with a couple of computer terminals glowing with beachthemed screen savers but hardy hadnt gotten too far inside before hunt called out you might as well come out now i think the jigs up and gina roakebarefoot wet hair running shorts blue cal sweatshirtappeared from the back rooms holding up a hand in greeting a sheepish smile on her face yo she said yo yourself hardy replied i didnt mean to interrupt if this isnt a good time half hour ago gina said no shillyshallying around wouldnt have been a good time now the timings fine you can still have those jelly bellies if you want hunt said but i think im good for a beer if youd rather go in that direction if youre going to twist my arm hardy said im starting to think she might actually be crazy hardy with his beer was sitting on one of the tan stressedleather easy chairs in the denlots of books and magazines cds and dvds on builtin white shelves and a large tv now she wants us to go after the killer us hunt asked with our huge investigating team and unlimited resources thats kind of what i told her hardy said gina next to hunt said i thought she was factually guilty didnt she tell you she did it hunt asked i thought id heard that not in so many words but she never really denied it and then shes been acting all along like if shes convicted she deserves it not exactly an overt confession but hardy sipped from his bottle anyway so today she tells me she wasnt with levon and dylan on the robbery either though maybe it was another one another robbery gina asked a different one again ambiguous but apparently well then gina asked what would they have been blackmailing her about i asked her that she said god was testing her that struck hunt funny not just her he said hardy nodded tell me about it so then she tells me she cant believe i think she did this stuff i mean here we are almost a half year into this and suddenly not only dont we have what shes being blackmailed about anymore or what we thought it was but now she wants us to find who really did these guys shes trying to play you gina said thats what i thought too maybe still think i dont know but whats in it for her if she plays me what she proves im gullible so what hows it help her hunt cleared his throat this may be the obvious answer and im not a lawyer of course and maybe dont see the nuances like you two do but if he or she does exist and you find whoever it is doesnt that get her off hardy was sitting forward with his elbows on his knees and his shoulders sagged in other words he said what if shes not playing me hunt shrugged its a thought okay gina said but whyd this just come up didnt you tell me diz brought it up today at trial the other dude maybe its the first time she actually thought about that option as something we could do yeah but heres the thing wyatt hardy said you know this whole evidence problem were dealing with anyway same holds true if theres another suspect even a guilty one hanging out in the bushes the thing i hate about this because its true is that mayas got not one but two great motives she was at both places and i dont know if any of us were being blackmailed for ten years we might have gotten pretty tired of it ourselves definitely gina said i wouldve cleaned their clocks a long time ago and i wouldnt have left any evidence either thats my girl hunt punched her gently on the leg remind me to destroy those secret videos of us ive been taking then to hardy so what are you going to do i dont know if shes telling me now point blank she didnt do it im still not sure if i need that to get her off i just cannot see this evidence convicting her not in this city wellgina was going to add her two centsall other things being equal diz id normally agree with you but youve got the kathy and harlen connection theres no evidence about them either and thats wishful thinking gina said that is wishful thinking what is that youre obviously thinking some evidence standard is going to apply either to maya in the trial or to harlen and kathy and mayas husband on all the forfeiture stuff but as you so eloquently noted in your opening today this is not about evidence and im not just talking the trial im talking the whole megillah stier makes the case even subversively that the reason theres no evidence is because mayas got friends in high places who have all the means and power to get rid of evidence and guess what she goes down and them sitting there the mayor harlennice show of confidence and allbut its not helping your client and it sure as hell isnt impressing braun who undoubtedly and maybe truthfully sees it as intimidation i love it when she gets all riled up hunt said but hardy wasnt in the mood to laugh about it so your point is my point gina said is if youve got any chance at all of finding at least a living breathing human being to introduce as the famous other dude id pull out all the stops trying to find him with no evidence hardy asked i wouldnt even know where to start well on that hunt said i might have an idea theres nothing to be worried about wayne ticknor told his daughter jansey with her bittentothequick index fingernail she picked at a little dried blob of ketchup on her kitchen table the digital clock on the stove read thats easy for you to say daddy youre not going to be testifying true but theyve already told you everything they were going to be asking you about havent they coached you even i know but what if they dont just stick to that why wouldnt they maybe they want to get me on the weed too i mean they mentioned that enough wasnt i living off the proceeds wasnt i helping with the business i thought they guaranteed they wouldnt wasnt that part of the deal well it wasnt actually a real deal more like i was just made to understand that if i could help them theyd help me by keeping you out of the dope side of it i guess yeah i cant really deny that i knew about it she pouted and blew out a breath or the defense guy what if once im up there he starts getting into stuff about me and robert i mean if people know about that its going to look like we got together pretty soon after dylan and then if they find out it was before too how would anybody find that out her father asked i dont know and even if they did then what then they might start putting it together that dylan was hitting me so heres a guy whos hitting me that im also cheating on you see what im saying it wouldnt look good yeah but honey listen they knew that already and they didnt charge you or robert with anything did they they charged maya townshend they got her gun okay but everybody knows dylan just took that from the shop i dont think the cops do know that hon and i dont think id volunteer it dont worry im not going to volunteer anything suddenly running on nerves she stood up went over to the sink wet a sponge and brought it back to wipe and scour the tablethe dried ketchup a few days worth of coffeemug stains some petrified oatmeal it just worries me she said thats all well its natural to be worried she stood there squeezing the sponge i just dont want them to see how good a thing it was really dylan being killed i know you shouldnt say that about the dead but waynes eyes went black you can say anything you want about him to me you know that he couldnt have been gone soon enough then with an outward calm he went on they will never in a million years think that you had anything to do with it plus youve got robert and you saying you were both here the whole morning youre not a suspect to anybody hon and you couldnt ever be so just answer the questions you know the answers to and leave the rest of it alone hows that sound she lowered herself onto her chair letting out a breath it sounds like a plan daddy ill just try to keep remembering that you do that wayne said reaching out and putting a hand over hers on the table now how are you fixed for money lately she gave him a weak smile okay ive been talking to the insurance guy i got the feeling they were waiting for maya to get convicted when that happens they wont have any excuse left not to pay me so we ought to get the check soon after that after they convict her just to rule you out he didnt say that kind of not that anybody thinks she let the phrase hang in the room he just says if theyve got the choice having somebody else convicted makes it cleaner youd think somebody else getting arrested would be enough she shrugged maybe not though she pulled her hand out from under his and sat back in her chair gripping the sponge in the other hand as though it were a tension ball id bet a lot from what hes told me that no matter what theyre going to wait until shes convicted on the chance that she might not be convicted and then it would still be possible that it was me it was you who what you know killed dylan i cant believe he would actually say that not exactly no but its what it feels like to me her fathers face closed down he sat square to the table fists clenched glowering you got the insurance guys name maybe ill go and have a talk with him but jansey shook her head her father had had a talk with dylan and it hadnt helped at all you dont have to do that i dont think its him personally its like the company policy thats all you might be surprised wayne said they tell you its company policy and then you find out theyre just trying to get a bonus or brownie points or whatever by denying benefits until the last possible moment and even then some well daddy i dont think this is like that he seems like a nice man everybody thought your dylan was a nice man too she shook her head its not the same well no nothings the same really but i bet i could talk your insurance company nice man into rethinking his position or his company policy or whatever it is i dont think i mean i appreciate you trying to help me but i dont think i need it yet with the insurance wayne took a few breaths relaxed his fists and laid his palms flat on the table you didnt think you needed it with dylan either well as you say that was different maybe not so different though somebody taking advantage of your good nature thinking they can get away with anything but i look at you i see the hurt in your eyes the hurt in your life its not all hurt theres good things too ben and now robert but no promises from robert yet either she shook her head lets not go there again daddy its a little soon for promises hes still in med school and he doesnt treat me at all like dylan did hed better not he doesnt and for now thats enough okay please wayne reached out and again covered his daughters hand with his own his voice rather suddenly was husky with emotion i just see what youve been through already and now heres another guy whos essentially living with you and no talk of marriage or responsibility i dont get it i dont understand why you let yourself get in these situations this one isnt bad i promise and repeated i promise daddy he let out a lungful of air all right if you really think that and youre okay with money youre sure she nodded dylan left a lot of cash im using that drug money probably you know if youre spending that to live on and youve got no claimed income the irs might ask you how youre doing that maybe you should start thinking about a way to claim it im sure come on dont worry im not spending that much its not like im out blowing wads of dollars living high on the hog all i do is buy groceries and stuff and the irs isnt going to care about somebody like me i mean were talking probably less than ten thousand dollars this was untrue and said to palliate her father in fact dylan had put away close to two hundred thousand dollars and they kept itliterallyin a secret place under a couple of loose boards in the crawl space under the house she checked to make sure it was still there every single night and several times every day and no one not even robert knew of the moneys existence but one thing shed told her father was trueshe wasnt worried about cash youve got that much lying around the house do you know how dangerous that could be this finally brought a warm smile daddy she cooed at him you ought to be a shrink she lifted her fathers hand and brought it up to her lips when you got over here i was the one all worried about everything now its all you so now ill tell you you dont have to worry not about robert or the insurance guy or money or the irs everythings going to be fine i promise i really promise craig chiurco pulled himself up so that his bare back leaned against the headboard of his queensized bed maybe i should just find another line of work tamara pulling a green silk bathrobe around her as she came out of the bathroom stopped in her tracks lets see man makes love to his incredibly beautiful and sexually exotic girlfriend rolls over and lost in the afterglow says he wants to change jobs the girlfriend is a bemused b confused or c flattered hint its not c i didnt mean it had anything to do with us though as you might have noticed we work out of the same office and quitting your job would be more or less leaving me its not you she made a show of turning around checking the corners of the room is there someone else here im missing that you were talking to no good okay thats settled so why do you want to change jobs i was just thinking about this townshend thing so far ive embarrassed hardy and wyatt by showing up on voglers list and my total contribution to mayas case has been to confirm the worst piece of evidence connecting her to levons murder it was tons of fun telling the boss yep thats her shes the one i saw there maybe ill become a vet no wait i hate animals if your girlfriend thought you really hated animals she would start seeing other men you wouldnt would too tamara sat down on the bed but this trial isnt over yet maybe you could do something good ill take any ideas well for starters they dont have her going inside levons do they and without that what do they really have they have her lying again to the cops they get her established enough as a liar and it seems like they ought to be able to do that easily then whatever she says on the stand comes across as untrue and of course it also leaves the question why was she there anyway at levons in the middle of the day he called her and she just came running why i dont know maybe some variation of the blackmail again tamara went into a small pout so then when you saw her it must have been right after she killed him thats what ive been assuming and i think everybody else so how did she seem upset in a hurry to get away any of that chiurco shook his head it wasnt like that tam it wasnt like she posed for me she was there at the door turned around and we were face to face for about a second enough for me to notice her but not much more then she was gone and you were sure it was her it was her tam she admitted it remember and they got her fingerprints on the doorknob i dont know what youre getting at im just trying to get you something to make you feel better now with a little heat so maybe you could feel like you contributed to casting doubt on what happened like if you saw her trying the knob or something maybe trying to get in and she couldnt just before she turned and then you saw her as she was leaving i dont think im going to change my story now i saw what i saw you want me to commit perjury under oath i dont think hardy would want me helping that way no its just that you happening upon her just at the one second anybody would believe if you just got there a minute earlier and watched her trying to get in i mean mr hardy could ask you that anyway chiurco wasnt warming to this idea at all his mouth had hardened down to a thin line and then id just say no hey dont get mad at me she said youre the one who started with how bad you felt about not being able to help her im just saying maybe mr hardy could make it seem as if youd seen her not getting in then they dont have that assumption anymore you didnt see her coming out exactly did you i mean she was just there at the door suddenly chiurco slapped a palm down on the bed between them hey whats this interrogation what are you trying to get at here craig nothing im not trying to get at anything im just talking to you whats your problem what are you so uptight about after fighting his emotions for a second he gathered himself and let out a sigh maybe im uptight because im nervous enough about this to begin with im not going to go changing my story even a little even if it might help her that just gets me in trouble with wyatt with hardy with everybody i dont see how you want me to do that its tricky enough as it is whats tricky saying what you saw keeping it simple its not as easy as it seems especially when everybodys all over you with these little details you never thought about i got my story and im sticking to it the way you say it like that it sounds like you made it up im not making anything up jesus tam i cant believe youre saying this to me well i cant believe youre so touchy about it its not that big a deal were just talking no were not just talking now he sat up straight off the headboard pulling the blankets up around him and its way that big a deal you dont see that not as big as youre making it she stood up and walked across to the chair where shed put her clothes she slipped out of the robe and started to grab her underwear what are you doing chiurco asked im going home i think were done for tonight fine fine she had her jeans on pulled her sweater over her head and while were at it disagreeing about this and other stuff i thought wed decided we werent going to be smoking weed anymore now chiurco crossed his arms shaking his head back and forth and went silent rage and frustration smeared across his features in case tamara went on you think i didnt notice or smell it or anything i wasnt trying to hide it no a quick toke in the bathroom with the window open thats not exactly lighting up in front of me i thought youd be mad correct craig mad at you for using it and mad that you cant stop i dont want to stop tam ive told you i like it is the problem and i could stop anytime i want which maybe i dont maybe ill believe you when i see it start even a little and meanwhile this paranoia problem dont kid yourself thats the weed too now ive got a paranoia problem your testimony issues we just had a fight about them hello youre wrong youre just plain wrong i really dont think so she crossed over to the door i really dont craig and in the meanwhile im just plain gone in the living room of his marina mansion harlen fisk hit the remote switch and turned off the television right after the nightly news he and kathy had in fact made quite a splash by showing up today in the courtroom and the networks had played it up in a gratifying way the city wasnt coming close yet to an election cycle so in spite of the negative connotations being slung around about his connection to joels development deals and his sisters coffee shop the general rule of thumb was that the more your name appeared in the media the better your chances to get elected and getting elected was what harlen was all about still he couldnt help but be disappointed in his sister as a matter of fact disappointed was hardly the word well he told himself im not going to think about maya nowwhat her future might be like if in fact she got convicted and sent to jail that wasnt his fault it was her doing her clueless stubborn nature if she had only kept her mouth shut that had been harlens intent in putting her in touch with hardy in the first place a good lawyer should in theory have kept her from admitting anything that put her near any of the murders but by the time shed gotten with hardy shed already told the police that shed been out at church that morning and somehow the fear that shed be caught in that lie had led her to compound the injury by confessing to both the lie and her whereabouts near the time of the murder which put her in their sights stop dont keep worrying this to death he told himself get up go to bed but his body didnt respond he sat there with the reading lamp on next to him his hands crossed over his comfortablelooking stomach which tonight felt suddenly knotted with tension babe his wife jeannette looking in are you all right are you coming to bed in a minute what are you thinking about this trial maya the whole thing she came into the room pulled up an ottoman and sat on it she was tall solidly built athletic with shoulderlength blond hair encircling a wholesome allamerican face ill talk about it if you want he smiled at her i would have thought youd have been sick of it by now i might be sick of it but im not too tired to talk about it if you want to he paused a moment i just marvel that she can be so dumb sticking with the story that she didnt know much about the weed i mean come on i knew about it everybody knew about it her forehead creased in a look of concern i dont think i knew that you knew dylan how well did you know him he waved that away i met him first when he was her boyfriend for a while when they were in college then again when maya hired him just after he got out of jail i told her it was a mistake and of course she listened to me as much as she always does which is not at all harlen come on she listens to you maybe listens but doesnt hear i told her this dope stuff could be a problem a couple of years ago told her to fire him no chance why not she was saving him i think this messianic complex shes got shes got everything and shes so lucky and so shes got to help losers to balance the scales or something not realizing of course about the people who are covering for her you mean you let me just ask you he said whos got her kids right now i dont mind that theyre good kids no argument but theyre not ours are they and you and me we didnt sign on for the little darlings did we sighing he went on she shouldnt even be in this at all i told her not to go down there six in the morning i mean what kind of hour for a meeting is that and why do these things with her become my problems i didnt know youd talked to her when was that again he waved off her question the night before she called and asked me what id do i told her to call him back and find out what was so important but again naturally he turned a palm over meaning shed ignored his suggestion he let out a long breath his head shaking from side to side and then theres this levon thing too the other victim he nodded levon preslee actually not a bad guy you knew him too he faked a shortlived smile hey im a politician i know everybody so what is this levon thing he gets out of jail he comes to my sweet little sister to help him out since she helped dylan when he got out and if you havent guessed yet these guyslevon and dylanstill talk to each other so i know people right its what i do so way back then i put him in with jon francona over at act and it worked out pretty good until well until last fall okay okay so well the point is why i might be thinking about this stuff right now and getting a little edgy about it is jon francona died two years ago so nobody in the world besides my sister and you has got or knows of any connection between me and levon preslee and im just a little wee bit concerned that along with this forfeiture stuff were all wrestling with somebodys going to pull that up and wave it in my face too and dont get me wrong i love the publicity and all but i think that might actually do me some harm welljeannette reached out and put her hands on her husbands kneesnobodys going to fault you for helping the poor man out all those years ago nobodys going to know jeannette nobody can entertain the thought even for a minute that i knew this guy from adam he let out a last deep sigh i mean i keep telling myself maya put herself in this position ive got no choice ive got to let her get herself out of it i cant cover for her anymore or else everything weve got is at risk come on hon i think that must be a bit of an exaggeration harlen chewed at the inside of his cheek and pushed himself up out of his recliner not really he said not too much paul stiers first witness the next morning was san franciscos ancient medical examiner dr john strout the good doctor had been a fixture in and around the hall of justice for over forty years and had appeared in court at least a thousand times maybe more tall with wispy white hair and positively gaunt instead of merely thin hed somehow evaded the mandatory retirement he should have taken the better part of a decade ago but no one was pushing for it because he remained highly and universally respected his voice and manner retained a casual authority and easy affability that his southern drawl only accented now he sat back comfortable and waited while stier positioned the poster board with the mounted autopsy photographs on the tripod next to the witness box where both strout and the jury could see in many trials strouts testimony which concerned itself with the cause and basic fact of a victims death might have a huge impact on the verdict the patterns of bruises on the deceaseds body could be highly significant the shape of an injury could identify or eliminate an object as a possible murder weapon other more subtle distinctionsblood alcohol levels scans for various drugs or poisonscould be spun in myriad ways to cast doubt or lay blame but today no one expected much in the way of fireworks from strouts testimony in fact after the previous days nearly unrelenting drama the courtroomsans mayor and supervisorhad nowhere near the buzz hardy had expected and this was a relief after his conversation with gina and wyatt last night hed come to accept their mutual view that maybe kathy and harlens presence wasnt doing his client as much good as theyd hoped so strouts testimony was going to establish conclusively that there were in fact two dead people killed at the hands of another nevertheless you never knew exactly what was going to come up in live testimony and hardy was paying close attention as stier took the small pile of photos from the last juror to have viewed them placed them with the other marked exhibits and walked to the center of the room dr strout he said to begin with dylan vogler the gunshot victim were you able to determine the time of death no he looked over to the jury box speaking to them in an avuncular tone when the medical technicians arrived he was warm to the touch that suggests for example that he hadnt been in the alley overnight but i cant say more than that what killed mr vogler a gunshot wound to the chest please describe the injury strout did sothe entrance the exit the track through the bodyand stier took it from there how quickly would an injury like this be likely to incapacitate the victim the bullet went in his chest and then right through his heart most people would collapse immediately from the injury and die shortly thereafter doctor would you tell the jury what defense wounds are defense wounds are injuries typically sustained when the deceased tries to ward off blows or an attack injuries to the hands for example or forearms usually sometimes to the legs did you find any defense wounds on mr vogler no any abrasions scrapes cuts or bruises to suggest he had been in a fight or struggle no i cant say there were in fact did mr vogler have any sign of injury of any kind except the gunshot wound that killed him no in other words hardy thought vogler either knew his attacker or was shot without any warning or both but strout had one last word it was a pretty efficient killing hardy could have objected to this gratuitous commentit wasnt in answer to one of stiers questionsbut it wouldnt have accomplished anything and he decided to let the prosecutor go on dr strout moving on to the other victim then levon preslee again can you tell the jury about the cause of death of this victim surely the victim died from injuries sustained by blows to the top of the head from some sort of a bladed object that cracked his skull causing massive brain trauma and hemorrhage and were you able to determine doctor what time it was when death occurred no hardy knew that this was a madefortelevision question the public had become so inundated with the pseudoscience of primetime tv that they expected all sorts of forensic miracles stier simply wanted to dispel the popular notion that you could tell when someone was killed and that therefore the prosecution had been negligent in not presenting that evidence but strout amplified anyway the body had achieved ambient temperature and again same question as with mr vogler doctor were there any signs of defense wounds on mr preslees body no and how quickly did this injury kill mr preslee just about immediately he would have been stunned and probably rendered unconscious by the force of the first blow and died soon after maybe not as immediate as the bullet through the heart but pretty quick within a minute outside stier checked the jury to make sure they understood the violent gruesome bloody nature of this attack which if it had been perpetrated by maya painted her as a monster but he wasnt quite finished yet a couple of clarifications doctor you said blows how many times was the victim hit twice although either one would have been plenty hardy saw the effect this small sentence had on the jury as a couple of the members actually flinched imagining the moment and again stier went on you said the blows were struck by a bladed object can you explain what you mean by that over the next ten minutes stier and strout nailed down all the details of the attack on levon presleethe damage done and use of the dull edge of the cleaver the attack from directly behind the unsuspecting and probably stoned victim no surprise preslees blood tested positive for thc the active ingredient in marijuana overall hardy thought the effect of the testimony painted a coherent scenario of two apparent friends sharing a doob and then one of them going behind the other and launching a premeditated grisly and murderous attack that is in fact what had happened and hardy couldnt think of a spin in the world that would do any good for his client he also knew that there was no way he could control strout or stop him from delivering those little asides that had such a visceral impact on the jury so he passed the witness glitsky sat on the corner of braccos desk in the large room that the homicide detail worked out of darrel himself was in his normal chair at his desk while his partner debra schiff was three flights downstairs delivering her testimony in the trial of maya townshend itll bite you glitsky said i dont care im doing it i dont see what itll get you peace of mind very important for job satisfaction glitsky sighed whats the exact wording youre going with bracco looked down at the tr the department form that cops were supposed to fill out to explain away their parking tickets under alternative parking considered but not utilized he read aloud what hed written leave car on mayors lawn with siren on and lights flashing walk three miles to crime scene theyll flay you oh well bracco sat back no guts no glory maybe theyll realize the absurdity of all of this sure glitsky said thatll probably happen but meanwhile why are you even here as opposed to downstairs i thought you guys were testifying on townshend today schiff stier wanted her first why i dont know da strategy maybe shes a better witness in what way i dont know abe more passionate maybe the corner of glitskys mouth turned up with jerry glass you mean maybe a little of that bracco stood up and stretched now closer to eyetoeye with his lieutenant shes probably more convincing than id be anyway i dont blame stier putting her on i would too and not you as i said maybe later but maybe not at all he hesitated then shrugged either way it doesnt matter shell do fine shes a true believer i hope youre not telling me at this stage after the trials started that you dont believe in the case you guys have built its not so much that that sounds like its still some part of it braccos eyes scanned the large room over glitskys shoulder around behind them nobody else was around it was safe to talk i dont have any real doubt she did it abe maya i mean but from the time debra went out and talked to glass hesitating bracco made a face what you ever notice theres this mindset among certain law enforcement peoplei mean weve all seen it a hundred timesi just havent had it run into one of my cases before where anybody who has money and knows a criminal then that persons a criminal too yeah ive seen that in fact ive thought it you know why because its true maybe more than youd think darrel bracco rolled his shoulders but not always huh what are you saying im saying what i started with that debras probably a better witness hardy might be able to eat me up on cross whereas he wont touch debra who buys everything jerry glass is selling so does stier and you dont another pause then in a more quiet register i dont want to rat my partner abe she got the collar i thought you both got the collar if you get technical okay i dont care about technical was there something wrong with the arrest no i was there it was righteous enough i just if it was me i think i would have waited a little thats all maybe go to a da and see if hed fly it for the grand jury but debra just got the news about the fingerprint id on the doorknob and stepped in glitsky had seen this before too a relatively inexperienced cop would sometimes arrest a suspect before he or she had built a solid case based on the evidence occasionally this was warranted as when the suspect was a danger to witnesses or an immediate flight risk and had to be detained until someone could check more facts or when someone flat out confessed but more often the best case protocol was as bracco suggestedbuild the case and present it to the district attorney who thenif the evidence was compellingwould get a warrant or get it in front of the grand jury the alternative was that an inspector could simply go and make the arrest and only then would the das office review the case to see if it would be charged so what happened on this one glitsky asked i didnt think it was enough at the time darrel said and debra and i had words about it but what could we do it was a done deal and then hey of course maya gets held to answer at the prelim right so we got it it was going to trial we had other cases i stopped thinking about it but youve still got questions not really questions no bracco shook his head and not really about whether mayas guilty i mean who else and with her motive and connections to both these guys just that she knew both of them they were squeezing her shes a liar it just totally works but but i think we could have built stier a better case now its all this other stuff with the forfeitures and political heat so mayas a rich person who knows criminals therefore shes a criminal and if shes a criminal then she probably did these guys i just dont want to have to hold all that together on the stand thats all when i dont think weve got the evidence to back it up debrall be way better at it that same morning in chinatown the mood was strained at the hunt club tamara dade sat redeyed at her computer unspeaking unsmiling wyatt hunt had stopped by one of the local bakeries on the way in and had brought a bag of hot freshfromtheoven cha sui bao the delicious porkfilled buns that were a rare treat and tamaras favorite food on earth and she told him she wasnt hungry after twenty minutes back in his office hunt stood and opened the door back to the reception area tam he said gently have you heard from craig she half turned to face him he called in sick sick this was decidedly unusual sickness wasnt really an acceptable part of the culture of hunts business whats he got tam hey are you okay clearly she wasnt after the merest glance at her boss and again without a word or a look back she rose from her chair and walked out the main door this led both down to grant street outside and to the bathroom and hunt wasnt at all sure whether shed be back until he realized she hadnt taken her purse so leaving the door between reception and his office open in case she wanted to come in and talk to him he went back to his desk picked up his telephone and punched some numbers hey wes hey yourself you talk to diz this morning no hes at trial hes been going straight in i know but he stopped by my place last night whatd he want he wants me to put a press on who killed his victims this brought a pause farrell was the firms resident adviser on never believing that your client was innocent this was because the celebrated case that had made his bones in the citys legal community was one involving his best friend another attorney named mark dooher whod been charged with murdering his wife farrell had gotten him off cleanly acquitted that turned out to have been a bad mistake that almost cost farrell his own life a while later you mean maya townshends victims diz doesnt think so or at least he isnt sure anymore since when since yesterday afternoon when he talked to her denied it did she ambiguously at least enough to make him think he might be neglecting or ignoring something important he always thinks that thats why we made him managing partner nothing gets through hunt heard a breath in the phone anyway youre calling me about this because because you knew vogler another hesitation if diz told you that im going to have to have a talk with him it wasnt diz i did some net searching back when i first heard about this list of voglers customers howd you even hear about that you know craig who works here sure hes on it too told me about it right upfront in case it was a problem for me i told him it was nothing i couldnt handle but hed be smarter if he didnt do anything overtly against the law while he was trying to get his license anyway i got curious after that found it in a blog somewhere nothings sacred anymore in case you hadnt heard good news for the pi trade not so much for everybody else tell me about it so okay i knew vogler so did your craig ask him i would but hes out sick today i thought id start with you i have no idea wyatt what i could tell you thats the honest truth i believe you and that makes us about even i dont know what i want to know not exactly anyway i just figured the weed side of the equations been left out i mean if somebody on that side killed him so nobodys talked about how that whole thing worked how often for example did you buy from him about once a month i hope you realize this makes me damned uncomfortable wyatt ive been trying to put that all behind me as just another dumb mistake sam and i almost broke up over it too among other things what does it matter how often i scored with dylan again wes i dont know im trying to get a sense of how much marijuana he moved or anything else if he had seventy regular customers give or take what did a bag go for mine were a hundred so call it ten grand a month if you say so ive got to think thats serious enough money to get shot over in spite of everybody seeming to believe it wasnt about the dope howd it get delivered once again hunt heard a frustrated exhale you asked for the managers special whoever was on the register would call dylan hed go in the back come out with a sealed ziploc in the bottom of a regular coffee bag grind some beans in over it close it up and how long had this been going on i dont know i made the connection maybe six years ago so at least that long and i dont really believe i was his first customer and youre telling me that in all that time none of the employees picked up on it no i cant imagine they wouldnt have figured it out but according to diz thats been no part of the police investigation thats hard to believe yeah but i bet i know where some of that ten grand went every month and i know why the guy had such loyal employees you think one of them i have no idea wes just like when i called you but at least now ive got someplace fresh to start looking tamara stood in the open doorway her face blotched her eyes red im sorry hunt waved off the apology hed known his secretary since the time when as a child protective services worker hed been called to the home of the two dade children brother and sister whod missed several days of school without an excuse at the time tamara had been tammy a starving twelveyearold trying to feed and care for her emaciated younger brother mickey and waiting for her mothera heroin addict whod died in her bedroom of an overdoseto wake up hunt a former foster child himself had followed the lives of both of the kids into young adulthood and when hed opened his agency had brought tamara along fulltime and began using mickey as a runner and occasional driver now she said to him craig and i had a fight i think we might have broken up is that why hes not in here id guess so there was just the message when i got in that he was sick but he wasnt sick last night hunt leaned back in his ergonomic chair rocked in it once or twice you want to talk about it i dont know but she came inside his door and let herself down onto one of the chairs in front of him its just so stupid is all stupid happens he gave the silence another beat do you want to go home ive got some fieldwork i need to do we can close up no i can stay she raised her eyes and met his i hate all dope she said you know that since her mother had died from an overdose this shouldnt have been so surprising but hunt knew or guessed that she and craig were occasional pot users im not too wild about it myself to tell you the truth is that what the fight was about stop me if im prying she gave him a weak smile youve earned pry rights crossing her arms she stared into the space between them i mean everybody says a little weedll never hurt you you know its not addictive safer than alcohol blah blah blah and maybe a little wont but a lot craig does a lot i dont know how much i dont monitor it but we told each other we were going to stop or at least i thought we told each other that maybe we didnt i dont know im not trying to get him in trouble with you wyatt he doesnt get high when hes working i know he doesnt do that she shook her head i just wish he could stop he cant oh he says he can anytime he wants he just doesnt want to from the shine in them her eyes were on the verge of tears it just reminds me so much of what my mom used to say how she used to act and i kept telling myself that that was different she was actually truly addicted to heroin not the same thing as weed at all but now i dont know somehow it seems a lot more similar than not but i just dont think i want any of it in my life anymore and i try to say that to craig and hes all he just doesnt think that way even if it means losing you now a pair of tears broke and rolled down her cheeks i dont want to think that wyatt but thats what it seems like is happening i never meant to make it either me or weed you cant have both but i think its come pretty close to that hunt rubbed a finger against the grain of his desk ill tell you one thing if he picks the weed over you hes a bona fide moron but i think he might tamara said i really think he might debra schiff had given her direct testimony to paul stier and now was well into her second hour on the stand she thought she was holding her own pretty well in the first twenty minutes of crossexamination by dismas hardy most of it dedicated so far to the murder of dylan vogler he might have thought hed scored some points off her on the gun issue but shed stuck to her guns reiterating how maya had lied to them initially about whether shed even been in the alley that morning beyond that they had defendants registration of the gun in her name and her fingerprints for gods sake on the magazine what more could the jury want in schiffs mind there was no question of what had happened on that saturday morning and she knew that she was conveying it to the jury effectively in spite of hardys best efforts now he turned and walked back to his counsel table he turned a yellow legal pad around and appeared to read from it for a momentalthough schiff knew since both jerry glass and paul stier had told her that much of this extraneous physical activity was choreographed so that attorney and witness didnt just transmogrify into talking heads to the jury hardy walked back to the middle of the courtroom eight feet or so in front of her inspector schiff he began again id like to ask you a couple of questions about the levon preslee murder scene weve seen the pictures there was a great deal of blood was there not id call it more a moderate amount but there was blood yes a moderate amount then but certainly puddles of it both on the table and also on the floor between the table and the kitchen sink yes yes so the blood dripped from the table down to the floor did it not thats what it looked like yes but no blood was found on the cleaver which dr strout has identified from the deceaseds injuries as consistent with the murder weapon is that true yes no blood was found on the weapon it had been washed and how do you know that schiff for the first time showed a brush of annoyancea small pursing of her lipsgone almost as soon as it appeared well she said now directly at hardy and not to the jury it appeared damp at the scene as if it had been washed and there were traces of the decedents blood in the disposal under the sink and in the pipes underneath and the cleaver was next to the sink in a drying rack so presumably someone had washed the murder weapon in the sink is that right that was our assumption yes schiff cast a passing glance over at stier hoping that he might object she was a little uncomfortable talking about what the crime scene meant since that was really the provenance of the csi team but her ally the prosecutor just offered her a faint smile and sat with his hands crossed on his table all right hardy said that was your assumption that the cleaver was the murder weapon is that true yes all right accepting that hypothesis for the moment were there any other clues that indicated to you a trained investigator how the murder had actually taken place im not sure what you mean the deceased was hit from behind with the cleaver yes but just before that the deceased was seated at the table when he was struck granted but was there not a water ring on the table oh that yes and what did you assume from that that defendant was sitting excuse me hardy playing with her rhythm interrupted and looked up at the judge expectantly your honor move to strike that last phrase granted braun frowned down at schiff who was all of a sudden aware that hardy had tricked hershe really should have known better hed lulled her with these mundane questions and caught her off guard she would have to be more careful or risk losing her credibility sergeant the judge intoned at her most sanctimonious the jury will decide whether this defendant or someone else entirely was sitting with mr preslee just stick to what you observed hardy was graciousness itself a quick warm smile a barely perceptible nod thank you your honor now sergeant again she wanted to punch him we were talking about a water ring on the table sergeant and your theory of the murder schiff tossed another look at stier whod developed a frown and then at the jury it appeared that the assailant mr preslees murderer had been sitting across the table from him perhaps just talking having a glass of water and possibly smoking marijuana at some point the assailant got upmaybe on the pretext of refilling the glassgot behind mr preslee grabbed the cleaver and hit him hardy stood relaxed in front of her very succinct sergeant and i believe supported by the evidence herself confused by hardys comment schiff could only manage a small nod thank you she murmured and realized that this interrogation had somehow gotten away from her hardy was moving ahead sergeant what was the approximate distance between where the deceased was hit and the kitchen sink right behind it he was off on another apparent tangent schiff didnt see the point of any of these questions and yet stier was allowing them why wasnt he objecting to something her sense of dread increased and she felt a drop of perspiration fall out of her hairline she brushed it away and tried to narrow her focus just relax and stay with the facts she told herself and then aloud not far maybe eighteen inches and did the blood on the floor cover any of this eighteeninch area you can see from the pictures yes but im asking you to calibrate it for us about half of it so according to your theory of the case the assailant killed mr preslee then stood behind him cleaning up the murder weapon in the sink yes and the glass yes while blood dripped off the table just behind yes did you find any shoeprints in the blood itself no or tracks or any traces of blood except directly at the scene no so according to your theory sergeant the assailant stood directly behind the deceased with blood dripping onto the floor from the table into an area only eighteen inches wide and stood there long enough to wash both the cleaver and the glass is that correct yes her eyes flitted between the jury box and stier ive got no idea where hes going with this the thought unnerved her sergeant did you and your partner obtain a warrant to search the townshends house yes we did hardy in no hurry took another walk back to his table picked up a piece of paper then turned again and walked all the way back to her handing her the exhibit sergeant do you recognize this yes of course its the search warrant we served on defendant the day after levon preslees murder wasnt it first thing in the morning just at seven oclock that you served this warrant yes would you please read for the jury sergeant from the affidavit section what you were searching for with this warrant schiff looked down at the paper and suddenly aware of where this must be going read in a mechanical voice computer disks and downloads business and banking records shoes and clothes that might contain blood spatter thank you sergeant thats enough so you were looking for blood spatter true yes and why was that in the witness box schiff lifted a hand then cleared her throat we thought there might be blood spatter on her clothes and shoes and why is that schiff drew a breath and made herself sit up straight and face the jury she would brazen it out because we figured the blood dripping on the floor right behind her would have some spatter even if microscopic were you looking for spatter anywhere else we thought it possible there would be some on material covering the upper body why did you think that hardy now had schiff firmly assuming the role she didnt want and wasnt qualified for that of crimescene reconstruction expert but if stier wasnt objecting she couldnt very well refuse to answer the question we thought after the first blow the assailant would have to lift the cleaver which now had blood on it and swing it hard down again some blood might have come off in the swinging or from the second impact now hardy turned and faced the jury impassive without looking at schiff he asked sergeant did you in fact search for blood on the clothes you took from mayas home early in the morning after the murder of mr preslee yes we did isnt it true sergeant that you removed all the clothing from the house including her husbands and childrens and removed for testing the contents of the hampers and laundry room everything in fact except for what they were wearing yes and were there clothes in the washing machine or dryer or anywhere else in the house no so you got them all yes she hated this she knew it was coming across to the jury as some form of police harassment even if she didnt have the specific evidence she knew that it wasnt particularly difficult to be in a room or an apartment even for a substantial period of time and leave no physical sign of it especially if you knew you were going in to commit a crime she knew that maya had been at levons and if not to kill him then why she didnt know what the damned townshend woman had done with her clothes and her shoes in the time shed had to get rid of them and if she hadnt gotten rid of them schiff didnt know how shed avoided the blood spatter but none of that made any difference to her core belief that this defendant was a crafty and dangerous killer we were just trying to be thorough indeed hardy said thoroughness is commendable and you were careful when you seized this clothing to package it appropriately for later testing for blood by the crime lab were you not yes but with all their sophisticated testing the crime lab found no evidence whatsoever of blood on anything you seized from maya townshends house did they stier finally came alive objection hearsay sustained okay let me ask it this way then inspector i want you to assume that lab personnel will testify that they found no blood thats not consistent with your theory of how this crime was committed is it now stier compounded his error he should have let schiff say that maybe the defendant had gotten rid of her clothes or maybe there just wasnt enough blood to find but instead he objected speculation your honor irrelevant inspector schiffs theories are not evidence hardy couldnt believe his luck well gosh your honor he said my point exactly since the prosecution concedes that inspector schiffs theories arent evidence and since the prosecution doesnt seem to have anything besides her theories i have no further questions braun banged her gavel and chastised hardy for making speeches but he didnt care for the rest of the afternoon hardy continued to hammer the same point through the other lab witnesses youre a fingerprint expert right did you find fingerprints inside mr preslees home yes lots of them were any of those maya townshends fingerprints no in fact there are several fingerprints that belong to people whom youve never identified isnt that right yes fingerprints at the table where the victim was seated yes fingerprints at the sink where the cleaver was allegedly washed yes fingerprints on the interior door handle of the apartment yes and none of these are mayas and some of them are unidentified right correct hardy did the same with the dnasome recovered some unidentified none belonging to maya when he was finally done with his last crossexamination at quarter to five hardy took a long beat and threw a look at stier wilting at his own table the prosecutor had taken a beating today on the preslee evidence and he knew it but next up he would be talking about motive and motive evidence hardy knew was going to be brutal the apartment door opened and wyatt hunt stood looking at his young associate what is this bullshit craig what bullshit what bullshit he asks calling in sick when you look about as sick as i do except for a little red around the eyes are you stoned slightly and what do you hope to accomplish by that nothing im not trying to accomplish anything except figure out how im going to get back with tam you think better when youre loaded i dont know probably not and yet here you are i just thought id take a day off and think about things this is thinking about things no i felt bad about tam and was trying to cheer myself up about it yeah youre just the picture of good cheer what do you want me to say theres nothing you can say craig you know the rules you want a day off call in and ask for a day off if im not mistaken youve done that before and its never been a problem but you dont call in sick when youre not sick im sorry yeah well hunt hated this hated craig at this moment you want to get back with tamara its not rocket science she wants you to stop with this dope shit she send you here nope i wanted to see how bad it was chiurco blew into the air between them its not as bad as it looks thats great im glad to hear it because to tell you the truth it doesnt look too good right now you going to fire me im thinking about it i feel a little betrayed if you want to know not by me yep by you wyatt come on this is the first time for anything like this in likewhatfive years were not exactly in the busiest time weve ever had i just made a bad decision couple of em notice any connection between the dope and the bad decisions maybe a little maybe a little yeah and in the meanwhile dismas hardy comes by my place last night and gives us a shitload of work and im thinking you and me are going to be humping round the clock on this townshend case for at least the next few days maybe a week except you call in sick when youre not actually sick at all and tams all messed up back at the office can barely answer the phone and ive got no goddamn backup i didnt know that i couldnt have known that no i know which is why one of the rules is you show up at work when somebodys paying you so that if theres work to do youre there to do it chiurco hung his head his shoulders rose and fell again im sorry hunt waited until craigs head came back up then looked him square in the eyes shit he said this is no way to run an airline didnt we already have a discussion about this once how am i supposed to write a reference letter if this is going on how about if this is your chosen field maybe you want to avoid things that threaten it i dont usually smoke during the day you shouldnt be usually smoking at all craig you might lose your job over ithell your whole profession worse youre losing tam and you already know that i know you think i dont know that thats what ive been trying to figure out all day whats to figure out no answer and beyond that craig while were on the topic being high isnt going to help you figure anything out especially this isnt that pretty goddamn obvious it should be yes so soa sighso im gonna stop i mean it starting now wyatt i swear to god hunt just stared at him this discussion already far beyond his tolerance level so what do you think i ought to do about this now about you you could fire me if you want i know i could maybe i should if this wasnt the first time you screwed up like this i sure as hell would a trace of hope showed itself on chiurcos face i swear to god wyatt its over you can tell tam its over you can tell tam its over craig ive got other work to do i could no you cant he pointed a finger at craigs chest tomorrow you can if youre straight by then and this is the one and only warning fool me once shame on you fool me twice fuck you clear it is i hear you i hope so wyatt said then get some sleep and be on time tomorrow he turned on his heel and stalked off down the hallway bay beans west was open again business at least back to slow but steady wyatt hunt the embers of his anger still smoldering in his gut stood across haight street on this cool and overcast tuesday lunch hour and watched people come and go for about twenty minutes the clientele couldnt be more diverse and hunt reflected that if we were what we eat and drink then we human beings were really mostly the same nothing should really separate us at all since apparently every ethnic group in the world both sexes and people at every economic level drank coffee and lots of it hunt entered at last and got his place fifth in the ordering line getting up to the counter he ordered a regular with a couple of shots of espresso leaning over he then quickly showed his business card and mentioned that he was an investigatorhe specifically did not say police investigator although quite often thats what people heard and he usually didnt correct them could he please he inquired have a few words with the manager it was about the maya townshend case before hed had his order filled a flamboyantly dressed ponytailed young man with a diamond in his ear appeared at hunts side and introduced himself as the manager eugenio ruiz thanking him for coming over hunt again flashed his business card and this time identified himself as a private investigator working with the defense on the townshend case okay what can i do for you were trying to get a little specific hunt said about the way dylan vogler ran the marijuana out of here did you know anything about that ruiz had quick dark brown eyes and they flashed over to the register and then back to hunt dylan pretty much handled all of that himself i think really pretty much yeah at the counter they called hunts coffee and he turned and smiled thats me be right back you mind we go sit someplace for just a minute a minute sure hunt got his coffee turned and found ruiz again at his elbow theres some chairs in my office he said after me and led the way the room was small and narrow maybe six or seven by ten feet a cluttered desk sat along the lefthand wall and hunt took one of the two chairs at the far end of it the walls were papered with posters of coffeegrowing locationscosta rica hawaii kenya indonesia ruiz closed the door behind them then pulled over a small wooden barrel and sat on it ive only got a couple of minutes he began were getting into a rush out there seems like youve always got a rush thats pretty much true a hopeful smile came and just as quickly disappeared hunt took a small sip of his hot coffee really delicious he said yes well hunt said i guess the big question is how dylan distributed the money to the workers here was it only the assistant managers or did everybody get a slice ruiz to hunts gratification caught completely offguard opened and closed his mouth a couple of times um no no everybody got a slice the quick eyes triangulated the little room finally came to settle on hunt no neither this was all dylans thing no hunt said no we know thats not true it is true no its not hunt shook his head in commiseration good try eugenio but mayas told us in general terms how it all worked and frankly were to the point of getting a little desperate to find somebody else who had a motive to kill dylan or the jurys going to decide maya did it so shemayawants us to go to the police and start bringing you guys downtown to talk and really who can blame her but my boss thinks we dont have to shake things up that much to get what we need what do you need i need to know what you and your coworkers know like what i dont know specifically you see but certainly clients who might have been having a hard time paying or maybe were making trouble for dylan some other way competitors people threatening to bust you come on eugenio you know youve been doing this you dont run a tengrandamonth drug business and not have some problems eugenio turned halfway around to check the door when he came back to hunt again he shook his head no hunt smiled i thought wed been over that eugenio no is not the right answer no means you and your guys start going downtown but they say it wasnt about the weed they didnt steal the weed dylan had on him there you go they they is not she so who is they the highly strung manager fidgeted on his barrel i dont mean they like that so how did you mean it you know like a figure of speech okay but let me tell you something the more were looking at this the more were convinced that it is in fact about the weed maya thinks its about the weed since its definitely not about her so you see where were coming from were running out of time yeah but i dont know any names hunt broke a frigid smile well thats where youre in luck because it turns out we do have names a whole list of them we just dont know what kind of relationships some of these people had with dylan we need to talk to you some more and other staff members who were part of this thing nobody was part of it nobody sold or handled anything except dylan hunt leaned back in his chair i believe you eugenio but were not talking sales were talking cooperation and payoff you guys knew what dylan was doing and you helped him do it and in exchange he paid you under the table probably pretty well now i know this and you know it but it hasnt been the subject of much police concern so far because theyve been thinking about maya and murder so up to now youre all under the radar and the really good news here is that talking to me or my colleagues isnt going to get you in trouble but if the cops come down here and get involved thats all going to change hunt came forward is there something thats unclear about this to you this is a great deal for you guys i promise eugenio tattooed out a rhythm on the edge of the barrel do you have that list with you he asked i could look at it see if any names ring a bell at a few minutes past eight that night treya and abe glitsky were standing over the sink doing the dinner dishesabe washing treya dryingin their small kitchen they had a dishwasher but it had gone on the blink shortly after zachary had gone into the hospital and theyd just never gotten around to fixing it now it was beginning to look as though that might never happen the simple rhythm of handling the dishesrinsing handing the plates and cups and silverware to your partner to dry talking all the whilehad brought to them both an unspoken comfort and even a kind of intimacy that had somehow kickstarted their communication during those darkest days when treya sometimes thought abe would never really talk again sometime during that crisis time with zachary treya had also instigated a practice she called parent savings time or pst and tonight she had put it into practice for the first time in a couple of weeks the idea she admitted was fiendishly simple and perhaps even inlaid with a tiny element of cruelty but kids could be such a pain sometimeseven though of course you always loved themthat she didnt feel too guilty laying some payback on them for their own cruel ways pst involved going around the house and setting the clocks an hour or even two hours ahead then after dinner youd look up with surprise and say oh my gosh where has the time gone its bedtime already and you whisk them off to their slumbers now treya took a dish from the drying tray and began wiping it down so what did diz say he said it wasnt schiffs finest moment so whats going to happen nothing diz says that the levon count might not even get to the jury wow how often does that happen not too normally you go for a double one eight seven if the second ones squirrelly they dont file it or maybe it gets dismissed at prelim but never in the middle of a trial still diz is talking about a motion to dismiss as soon as stier rests i cant imagine braun granting it but if she did it would be pretty huge for diz he paused it wouldnt be so huge for me you what do you have to do with it well though you might not know it to look at me especially the last few months in theory i run the homicide detail which means i have some input on what we bring to the da or not at least where theres a question youre saying there was a question here i thought there might be when debra first went to glass but i just couldnt seem to stay focused back then gee abe i wonder why that was glitsky put his sponge inside a drinking glass and turned it absently around the rim the reason doesnt really matter trey no i know god forbid you have a legitimate excuse or worse use one i dont need an excuse i take full responsibility you youre kidding he handed her the rinsed glass quit busting my chops woman would you im not im teasing you im laughing see me laughing she put down the glass put a finger into his belt and turned him toward her kiss me my hands are all wet i dont care kiss me after about thirty seconds he said are we going to finish these dishes i doubt it she said at least not right now wet hair wrapped in a towel wearing a pale yellow terrycloth robe treya came out into their living room where abe in black flannel pajamas sat on the couch hunched over a couple of stacks of papers on the coffee table well look at this she said shooting her a false glare you starting again with me she smiled down at him you want me to he patted the couch and moved over an inch or two she sat down finding anything shrugging he turned a page over laid it facedown on the second pile thats the problem another page and another diz said it was about the blood and he might be right what about it there isnt any not on mayas clothes not in her house nowhere couldnt she have just ditched them abe put his current page down and sat back on the couch lets see if this flies for you she kills levon in a pretty spectacularly bloody way spends a few minutes cleaning up running water in the sink no doubt splashing and blood dripping off the table onto the floor like a few inches behind her okay okay first thing we know shes got some blood on her we do got to trey no way with all that splashing front and back can she avoid it so from there weve got two possible scenarios one she doesnt see any blood and just goes from levons to pick up the kids and then goes home with them weve got a timeline for her somewhere in herehe pointed to the papers in front of themthat shows her actions from picking up the kids until the next morning her story anyway but corroborated by her husband and their housekeeper before anybody thought it was an issue so im tempted to believe it she didnt go out which means it means those clothes are at her home at seven the next morning when bracco and schiff show up and luminols going to show the blood even if she couldnt see it all right all right so it didnt show up whats the second scenario she sees blood and has to dump her clothes but the problem with that is she picked up the kids promptly at three so she either brought a change with her not no i agree or she what went home first and changed glitsky shook his head no time for that and besides which the maid says she didnt come home first so whats that leave thats the question all the people who alibi her could be lying thats true but you dont think so glitsky nodded not that it couldnt happen but they wouldnt have known what they were covering for when they said it so its unlikely so what does this all mean she wasnt inside im okay with no fingerprints no dna all that hard but doable if youre careful but if she was there and killed him she got blood on herself thats all there is to it you know what its good to see you into this she put her hand on his leg he turned to face her im starting to believe hope whatever that zacks going to be all right he leaned forward and rapped on the coffee table knock on wood anyway so maybe im not hopeless maybe theres something i can do to make sure they dont get blown away on the vogler side of the trial too is the evidence better on that oh yeah no question basically but still if they left anything out maybe i can help them get it back in like what i dont know shore up if theres any other weak spots whatever they might need treya sat silently for another minute her hand resting on his leg so if the judge dismisses the levon side then what nothing really except that diz looks good for a media minute which actually lasts only about thirty seconds no i mean about levon what about him well technically wouldnt he be an open case again abes mouth tightened up in concentration not really i mean even diz thinks she looks good for it even if the da cant he ground down to a stop met his wifes eyes except treya said she had no blood on her did she she never went inside which means somebody else was in there and killed him doesnt it at around nine oclock the next morning hardy nocommented his way through the crowd of reporters who accosted him as he tried to sneak into the back door of the hall of justice he was in relatively high spirits having slept well for a trial daywaking up without an alarm at fivethirty as opposed to the more usual three or four even though neither kathy west nor harlen fisk had shown up at the truncated morning session of the trial yesterday the powers that be had determined that a metal detector was still a necessity so a line of spectators and more reporters snaked for fifty or sixty feet outside of department upon laying eyes on it hardy was about to backtrack and take his shortcut behind the courtrooms when he heard a familiar voice call his name and turning was somewhat surprised to see fisk striding toward him the normally hale and hearty face seemed today to have an underlying pallor and dark circles under his eyes spoke of a lack of sleep but if hardy had a sister on trial for murder he thought he might lose a few zzs himself he stepped into the line and extended his hand hey harlen got the trial bug do you he tried a smile that mostly failed maybe some of that diz but mostly i wanted to ask you after yesterday why cant jackman just drop the preslee side of this thing careful harlen your politics are showing the short answer is that stiers picked this fight for them and theyre in it what i am hoping is that maybe braunll do it for them she can do that she can grant my motion to dismiss when stiers done with his case if i can convince her that no reasonable juror could convict on the preslee count with this evidence whats it going to depend on hardy chortled leaned in closer to whisper in theory careful weighing of the evidence in fact pretty much whim thats heartening welcome to superior court but in truth i think we might actually have a chance there really isnt anything that proves she killed levon harlen nodded this whole thing is a mockery if you want my opinion always has been i agree and if braun does drop levon isnt that saying maya didnt do it well not exactly it means they cant prove she did it so what do they do then who the police the people investigating his murder hardys grin had a sardonic twist to it again were up against theory versus reality in theory the police should start looking for more proof but there isnt any that ive seen so then still in theory they should revisit the investigation and see if they might trip over another suspect somewhere along the way in reality since the cops believe that maya in fact did kill levon thats insane harlen interrupted i know she didnt do that this stopped hardy if you do tell me how the supervisor too hesitated for a second what i mean is my sister isnt hitting somebody on the head with a cleaver diz it just flat couldnt happen im not saying i disagree with you its a stretch for me too but the cops think thats what happened even though she avoided all traces of blood which is a pretty good party trick if she did anyway the bottom line is that in reality braun dismisses levon and nobodys going to do a damn thing about it they figure theyll get her on dylan anyway but the good newsand this really is good harlenis if levon gets dropped its no longer specials by this hardy meant special circumstancesmandated by multiple murderand because of which maya would be facing life in prison without the possibility of parole without levon life without was going to be off the table but harlen didnt take much solace in that i dont want her to go down at all he said thats why i turned her on to you in the first place i never intended for this to happen you were supposed to stop it from getting to here hardy had seen this before the family becoming adversarial to the defense as the trial progressed still harlen was a longstanding colleaguejust short of being a personal friendand the accusation stung wellhardys decent mood by now completely leached awayi hope you know im doing all i can to keep that from happening i know that i didnt mean yeah you did its okay its not okay diz harlen swallowed took a deep breath i tell you these fuckers are killing all of us joel and i almost had it outi mean actual fistslast time we saw each other he said i was ratting him out with the grand jury you ever testify for one of those yeah but i wasnt a target well heres the good news neither am i or they tell me thats good news but you ask me make me a target anytime so you can take the fifth right not that ive got anything to hide really but it would be a nice option instead of letting glass last time he got me on the stand rip me a new one then he starts on my tax returns for like ten years ago and how do i account for this and how did i really make that and how do i prove that my sister and i were not actual partners in bbw and that the dope money isnt really what got joels real estate stuff started or at least bailed him out after nine eleven and you had to answer every time or im in contempt i mean that son of a bitch glass treated me like i was a major criminal but ive got nothing to tell him then after all that joel busts my ass anyway the big man blew out heavily and you notice kathys lost about ten pounds ten pounds on her thats like fifty on me and it isnt her new exercise routine believe me i hadnt heard theyd called her yet no thats whats so awful theyre keeping the big axtestifying with the grand juryover her head glass waiting to see what happens down here in court maybe i dont know but its eating her up too like literally i think thats what more or less got her to come down here put the fucker on notice show him shes not afraid he leaned in closer but let me tell you something diz between me and you she is from his own experiences with joelarguing with him over billing cash flows trial strategy his treatment of mayahardy had known that glasss campaign against the families was taking a serious psychic toll now though harlens totally uncharacteristic outburstthe man was a professional politician after all he never lost his temperhad made hardy realize how deep the knife cut how threatening the grand jury must be how very real loomed the possibility of ruined careers and even prison time now hardy took his own deep breath well harlen he said with a mustered calm he didnt come close to feeling were still a long way from done here thats all i can tell you weve got to let it play out hardy let fisk go through the metal detector and then stepped aside out of the line and walked back to the other familiar face hed noticed in the lobby behind them chiurco in a coat and tie looked wellrested and cleareyed as hardy shook his hand hey craig he said you here with wyatt no wyatt told me to come down here and see if i could be of some use this wasnt the most impressive offer hardy had ever heard the only thing craig had to talk about was mayas presence outside levons flat just before or after he was murdered which meant that if hardy put him on the stand all he could do was damage the case further but then suddenly unexpectedly an idea surfaced something you could do he said with all the craziness you and i never talked about whatever you found out about levon and dylan sure but ive got to tell you beyond the robbery and his address it wasnt much wyatt didnt ask you to follow up on any of that craig shook his head no and i dont really know what it would be i think you guys know all i know probably hardy said but maybe you know something you dont know you know stuff you might have seen with maya at the door this brought a frown tamara kind of hinted that maybe id want to mess with my story if but hardy jumped all over that no no no nothing like that im not talking about making up a story just if what actually happened might change an argument or something well whatever youd want you want to set a time give me an hour sure when tonight tomorrow night call phyllis at my office and she can set us up you okay with that of course good so now if youll excuse mehardy indicated the courtroom behind himher highness awaits upstairs glitsky let bracco and schiff into his office closed the door behind them and walked around his desk to his chair he had hot tea in his sfpd mug and he pulled it in front of him and cupped his hands around it not that he was cold he felt he needed a propsomething immediate and proximately painfulto take the edge off his main emotion at the moment which was a fine amalgam of embarrassment disappointment and fury as a further subterfugeto all appearances this was simply a chat about procedureshed bought a couple of starbucks froufrou coffees downstairs and had put them on the edge of his desk in front of where his inspectors were sitting schiff pretty obviously hungover and now motioning to the coffees glitsky said i hear those are great orange macchiato or something like that treya swears by em bracco reached forward took a cup removed the plastic top thank you sir youre welcome debra she raised a palm maybe in a minute thanks the tension among the three of them taut as a wire are you feeling all right a brisk nod little bit of a rough night is all glitsky kept his eyes on her after a minute he sipped his own tea it takes some getting used to but you cant let that stuff get to you she didnt reply you have a tough day of testimony glitsky said its part of the job comes with the territory you shake it off and do better next time at least thats my experience the coffee might really help schiff sighed and reached for the cup of course glitsky continued pressing his hands around his mug focusing on the heat in his palms its preferable if you make sure your evidence is rock solid before youre stuck with explaining something that might not make much sense schiff her mouth set tight let a long slow breath out through her nose she left the paper coffee cup where it sat on the desk and straightened back up in her chair it made perfect sense lieutenant people have been known to cover their tracks and she did it doesnt mean she wasnt there no of course not in fact she was there well in fact to be precise she may have been at the front door she was at the front door abe her fingerprints and dna say so thats true sir bracco said glitskys eyes went from one to the other all right still the preslee count isnt too wonderful is it if it wasnt for vogler in fact you and i both know it wouldnt have been charged why do you think that might be schiff wasnt backing down like i said she planned it and pulled it off and let me ask you something did you get your take on this from your friend mr hardy the scar through glitskys lips went a little pale in relief im going to pretend i didnt hear that debra its way beneath you and maybe just a result of how youre feeling this morning huh im feeling fine good because i did want to ask you both about something never mind your writeups or your testimony or what maya townshend might or might not have done at levons place how do you either of you explain to me the complete absence of blood from any of her clothes or shoes or anything else you looked at and before you start let me give you my analysis and you tell me where im wrong for the next few minutes glitsky outlined it for his inspectors he wrapped it up by saying and this isnt a question of admissible evidence or lack of sufficient proof to convict im talking here the actual fact of what happened schiff didnt even hesitate the actual fact is she killed him her husband lied when he corroborated her alibi either him or the housekeeper happens all the time glitskys mug was tepid by now it was failing to serve as a calming device youre saying she got home when before she picked up the kids she might have we dont know but we do know dont we glitsky replied what time she got the call from preslee couple of minutes either side of two right and we know she picked up the kids at three sharp so youre telling me she gets this call at her house on broadway decides on the spot to kill preslee drives out to potrero and by the way i did it this morning coming in no traffic city streets twentytwo minutes one way so anyway she sits down and drinks some water and maybe smokes a joint with levon whacks him with the cleaver then cleans up with a lot of care and shes got time to dump her bloodspattered clothes before she gets the kids she could have done it anytime that night so the husband knew about it had to glitsky looked over at bracco darrel no hesitation if she did it and she did abe then thats what happened while a part of him admired the loyalty of his troops to one another glitsky felt his stomach roil at this absurd display of professional obstinacy he was all but certain from his earlier discussions that bracco thought that they couldve tightened up the case before the arrest and that schiff had acted precipitously but darrel wasnt going to contradict his partner in front of his lieutenant and that was all there was to it never mind that their convictions flew in the face of the first law of criminal investigationfacts must flow from demonstrable evidence and not the other way round where the evidence is massaged or explained to fit a set of predetermined perceptions now knowing he was defeated in his primary objectiveto get his inspectors to admit that they might be wrong and might want to spend some of their time looking for who had really killed levon presleeglitsky let out a breath gave up on his tea and leaned back in his chair all right he said but i think youll have to admit its possible that the jurys going to have a hard time with levon can we go with that you know as well as me abe schiff replied san francisco juries have a hard time with guilt period all too true glitsky said and all the more reason to make sure we give the da everything he needs every single time hes got plenty here abe schiff said shes going down for vogler even in san francisco all right fine i believe you and i hope youre right and youre both confident youve built the strongest case you could on vogler darrel was the first to pipe up yes sir debra absolutely okay then glitsky pulled a small stapled stackfive or six pagesof computerized printouts over in front of him and flipped it open to the middle then ive just got one last quick question for both of you who is lee or lori buford or bradford the two inspectors traded glances with one another nobody schiff said nobody glitsky repeated but i see here a postit in the file with our case number on it and that name or one like it schiff her own blood high by now wasnt hiding her anger youre riding this one a little hard wouldnt you say lieutenant im in charge of this detail sergeant and in my opinion this case we gave the da is about halfway down the tubes because we just didnt quite have enough evidence when we made the arrestcorrection when you made the arrest and you want my opinion were still a damn sight light on vogler and if this nobody happens in fact to be somebody you guys in your zeal to arrest just plain forgot to include in your writeups or reports and who might actually help the da get a conviction on this townshend woman then its my job to point that out to you either of you got a problem with that cause if you do we can take it upstairs and have a discussion with the chief hows that sound bracco jaw set a flush in his face said lori bradford an old woman out in the haight a senile old woman out in the haight schiff corrected him you didnt take notes when you talked to her after a minute bracco said no we decided she wasnt credible abe there was nothing worth putting in the file glitsky knew that though strictly against regulations this was not an uncommon practice although inspectors were supposed to memorialize every interaction with witnesses or potential witnesses either by tape or notes in practice it often became the call of individual inspectors to include or exclude testimony for whatever reason or for no real reason from their reports it was clear to glitskyif only because he was certain that bracco knew better but also because of the look of pain on braccos facethat schiff had drawn the short straw to write up the report on lori bradfords interview and had decided for reasons of her own to leave it out keeping his voice under control glitsky finished the last of his tea nevertheless he said if either of you two remember id be interested in hearing what she might have told you before the decision really had a chance to sink in a smiling and confident big ugly stier never looking bigger nor uglier to hardy rose at his table andno doubt seeking to undo some of the damage hardy had done with schiff yesterdaycalled cheryl biehl to the stand paul stier had discovered biehl née zolotny in much the same way that wyatt hunt had by chasing down mayas college connections in the hope that someone who knew her both then and in the present could shed some light on the blackmail question and hence on mayas purported motive for the killings now the former cheerleader conservatively dressed in a tan business suit clearly uncomfortable in the role of prosecution witness shifted as she sat waiting for stier to begin mrs biehl how long have you known the defendant about fourteen years now and where did you meet at usf freshman year we were both cheerleaders and have you kept up on your friendship yes until she got arrested we usually had lunch together every couple of months or so mrs biehl did you also know the victims in this case dylan vogler and levon preslee yes and to your personal knowledge did defendant also know both of these victims when you were all in college yes did you ever witness defendant using marijuana with either or both of these men biehl cast an apologetic glance across to maya and nodded to stier yes i did and did you ever witness defendant either alone or with one or both of the victims selling or distributing marijuana yes i did would you characterize this as a more or less common occurrence for a while when we were in school yes they were the main connection if you wanted to buy pot among our friends all three of them yes all right mrs biehl moving ahead several years in the lunches that you and defendant had together did she ever mention either mr vogler or mr preslee yes she mentioned both of them dylan quite frequently since she still worked with him but she mentioned levon preslee too right but not really recently do you remember the last time she mentioned mr preslee about eight years ago just after he got out of jail and by jail mrs biehl dont you really mean state prison yes right i thought prison and jail were the same i guess but yes it was just after he got out of prison and what were defendants comments on mr preslee at that time just that hed gotten in touch with her through dylan he wanted her to fix him up with a job or something what was her reaction to this request it really frustrated her how did you know that because she said so she said she was never going to get out from under these guys she was never going to get out from under these guys did she offer any explanation of what she meant by get out from under no she didnt thank you mrs biehl now turning to dylan vogler he was her manager at bay beans west was he not thats right and in these conversations you had with her how did she characterize her relationship with mr vogler biehl hesitated for a long moment before replying unpleasant was she more specific well a couple of times she told me she just wanted him out of her life and shed offered to buy him out but he refused stier eyebrows raised flagged the significance of this testimony to the jury she used the phrase to buy him out yes did you find that strange a little bit yes and why was that well because he worked for her i wondered why she just didnt fire him did you ask her about that why she didnt simply terminate him yes we talked about it a couple of times and what did she say she said she couldnt couldnt fire him i mean and why was that she wouldnt say specifically did she tell you in a general way another look over at maya then biehl let out a wistful sigh she said she could never fire him because he owned her he owned her those were her exact words yes she said them more than once stier to all appearances sobered by the enormity and surprise of this testimonyalthough hed guided her directly to itnodded to the witness then over to the jury mrs biehl in the few months prior to defendants arrest did you two have lunch together again yes at the end of last summer and did mr vogler come up again in your conversation yes how did that happen i brought him up i told her id been worrying about her situation with him id heard somewhere that he was selling marijuana out of the store and i told her that whatever it was she was hiding it would be better just to get him out of there and get it behind her otherwise it was just going to go from bad to worse and what did she say to that she just kind of shrugged it off and said i shouldnt worry about it i was right it wasnt a good situation but she was going to take care of it pretty soon a final repetitious riff to the jury she was going to take care of it pretty soon and then stier was turning to hardy your witness biehls direct testimony got them to lunchtime so there wouldnt be any crossexamination until the afternoon session and this suited hardy fine he didnt have much of an idea of what if anything he was going to ask her her testimony had been true and probably accurate vogler had no doubt been blackmailing maya he and preslee probably both had had their claws into her so that she wanted to get out from under their control the strategy hed decided to adopt called for a steady drumbeat about the lack of physical evidence tying maya to either of the crimes but biehl hadnt offered anything he felt he could refute he had a voice mail from wyatt hunt on his cell phone telling him that hed be having lunch at lou the greeks if hardy wanted a report on what hed been doing out at bbw and suddenlyif for no other reason than he was perpetually somewhat morbidly curious about the specialthat seemed like a good idea so he hung back until his client and stier and most of the crowd had dispersed from the courtroom then snuck out walked the two flights down to the throbbing lobby where it was too crowded for anyone to notice him outside trenchcoat collar up and head down in an overcast chill he jaywalked across to lous stepped over the sleeping or dead body in the outer doorway then descended the halfdozen ammoniatinged steps that took him to the restaurants entrance proper swinging double doors covered in red leather as usual at lunchtime patrons stood three deep at the bar each of the twentyodd tables was taken as well hardy recognized several cops harlen fisk at a small table alone with cheryl biehl five or six of his fellow attorneys and a couple of members of his own jury at one of the side tables and somewhat to his surprise at the largest table in the house glitsky and treya and debra schiff and darrel bracco along with district attorney clarence jackman himself scowling and listening intently to whatever bracco was saying nobody at that table looked happy enough to interrupt and besides hunt was holding up a hand flagging him from one of the booths so hardy picked his way through the mob and the cacophonous din and slid in across from his investigator souvlaki lo mein hunt said by way of greeting that actually sounds edible it does i know but i predict a secret ingredient octopus something like that all those little legs and the noodles mixed up together so you cant tell which is which octopus legs and noodles i could tell the difference you could how the legs are probably going to be thicker and have those little suction cups on em thats the giveaway just at that moment the proprietor stopped at their table lou was midfifties or so with thick black hair short legs a solid round stomach under his starched white shirt hey diz wyatt lunch or just drinks well have the octopus hardy said if you can cut the suction cups off the legs for wyatt here he thinks suction cups suck lous face clouded over in something like real pain no octopus noodles and lamb maybe some hummus and hoisin delicious can chiu put some octopus in mine hunt asked come on guys cant you see im hoppin here we dont do substitutions you know that how long you been comin here you eatin or not two specials hardy said there you go water tea beer what both men chose water and lou was gone on to the next order hardy jerked his head a little out toward the room check out the summit meeting i know they got here a few minutes after me i dont think its a birthday hardy looked over and again noted the tension around the table maybe they just arent as enthusiastic as we are about the special those are our guys arent they i mean our case schiff and bracco yeah maybe they screwed up theyve probably got ten other cases but we can always hope the water arrivedpint jars with ice chipsand hardy took a drink so how you doin on our list slow hunt said but we were right about all the staff being in on it they really really dont want to talk to the actual police are they still dealing out of there it wouldnt shock me though not at the level dylan was at least not yet so who the new manager ruiz sharp guy but he says theres a guy he thinks called paco who got in a beef with dylan while levon was there maybe a couple of weeks before he got killed hardy sat up they were both there together dylan and levon oh yeah pretty frequently at least every time levon came for his pickup well there you go except theres no paco on the list ive got ruiz watching for him if he comes in again but he says he hasnt seen him since the big day and of course he could be making it all up of course hardy threw another quick glance at glitskys tablejust as cheerful as last time i had a chat with your man craig this morning you know yeah he called in can he do anything for you well so far he puts maya at levons but he doesnt put her inside so if i need him for something on the stand he wont do too much damage with that actually it might be a little better than that the way it sounds to me shed just got there and couldnt get in as opposed to she was just coming out big difference hardy said no shit wyatt hesitated for a second but how did he seem who craig fine why hunt shrugged he and tamara broke up i think hes having some problems but he was okay he seemed fine good just checking on the puppies hunt turned his glass around in its condensation ring i did get something else maybe actually gina got the hunch from something else i was saying if its anything you think you got enough qualifiers in there i dont want to get your hopes up ill be on diligent guard meanwhile at this point hardy said i dont care if daffy duck is your source ill take it okay what do you know about tess granat hardy felt hed be nothing without his memory and he had his answer in a second movie star falling leaves death by starlight died here in the city didnt she hit by a car when she was pregnant if i remember hunt nodded hitandrun mom and unborn kid both died driver never found okay okay did you know she was kathy wests sister with his water halfway to his mouth hardy stopped cold and slowly replaced the jar on the table the words unborn kid went jangling around in his brain as did the details of his interview with maya in the attorney visiting room at the jailwhen she had talked about the innocence of the unborn but had denied ever having had an abortion her words came back at him with a visceral force lou had a lunch staff of two white women and two filipino menall middleagedthat delivered food from the kitchen and never slowed down and one of the women showed up and plopped their specials down without fanfare between them then threw after them their utensils wrapped in paper napkins hardy finally found his voice again when did this happen the hitandrun march of ninetyseven hunt said maya was a junior that year its when things seemed to go south for her howd you get this hardy asked or gina we were just talking about how i got started on all this and i mentioned running into an article about tess granat being mayas aunt in usfs newspaper and i ask gina what was it that happened to her so gina being senior to me which i never let her forget remembers the hitandrun the whole story and then it hits us both at the same time theres a connection maybe worth asking about so youre thinking the blackmail might not have been about a robbery im not thinking anything im just wondering granats death was a big deal at the time a huge deal a muscle worked in hardys jaw they were an item back then too you know maya and dylan hunt stopped to let that fact settle then continued although by senior year or maybe sooner they broke up and she goes back to being junior league and finds religion again it would explain a lot hardy getting into it if she knew anything about the hitandrun with granat and didnt go to the cops at the time and then her family found out about it later shes fucked the family would never forgive her and she cant forgive herself which is why she thinks she deserves whatever happens to her its god working in biblical time just paying her back now for what she did then its a damn compelling theory hunt said but the bad news is that it doesnt actually change all that much dylans blackmailing her about that the bottom line is hes still blackmailing her so shes got the same motive not exactly hardy was already thinking about how he could get any of this in front of the jury if its not about something she and dylan did with levon around dope in college it takes levon out of the picture at least out of her picture shes got no reason at all to kill him except if maybe dylan told him never knowledge being power and all if dylans the only one who knows and my money says he is then he doesnt dilute it by telling anybody else youre right only sometimes but it would be nice if this was one of those times hardy pulled his special over in front of him and poked at it with his fork hmm looks a little like yeanling clay bowl this probably lous most famous and mysterious specialit didnt come in a clay bowl and no one had any idea what a yeanling wasshowed up on the menu about half a dozen times a year you think maybe yeanling could mean octopus hunt asked but before hardy could do anything about his latest information he had to be sure that it was true he stood in the wide hallway behind department and waited depressed as always by the sight of the shackled prisoners belching from the elevators coming down from the jail above him maya over in the new jail behind the hall of justice would be coming in through the back door in her personal little chain gang her saw her now and walked down to meet her the months of incarceration hadnt been good to her shed asked for a short haircut to minimize the lack of luster brought about by the caustic soap they had in the showers but the result was just an unkempt vaguely butch mopand now it was even showing signs of gray her skin too had the familiar jail pallor although ironically shed gained perhaps fifteen pounds with the huge servings of highcalorie jail food and no one would ever mistake the deep creases around her eyes for laugh lines he accompanied her into the fourbyeightfoot cage built into the wall and connected to the back entrance to the courtroom and the metal door clanged as the bailiff closed it behind them this was where she waited every day usually all alone until court was called into session and this is where they now both sat on the cold concrete ledge that served as a kind of bench braun walked by them coming back from her lunch in conversation with one of her judicial colleagues and she didnt even glance in their direction shes an awful person maya said yes she is how does somebody like that get to be a judge usually the governor appoints them first then they just keep getting elected so the qualification is they know a governor and probably either gave him money or helped him get it assuming a male governor of course and why wouldnt we she plucked at her jail suit im sorry im just a total bitch today i shouldnt be so judgmental im sure shes trying her best she sighed and to think thats so much the life joel and i bought into before all this began whats that you know fundraising benefits helping people like her get appointed im beginning to think its really not about justice at all i wonder what we were doing what we were thinking all that time protecting your interests hardy said your assets and you wind up with people like braun and glass for that matter as your gatekeepers and they take it damn seriously problem is once youre perceived of as outside the loop youre the enemy youre the threat joels not a threat finally some color came into her face hes never done a dishonest or illegal thing in his life and theyre all over him hes going to beat it hardy said but hes going to need you beating this thing too she turned her head toward him i thought thats what we were paying you for hardy had heard this kind of thing before from both husband and wife even from harlen and he showed some of his growing impatience with it as weve just been discussing sometimes money doesnt get you what you think it should sometimes youve got to change your vision your idea of what youre all about like for example are you inside that big wall protecting your assets or are you going to just let these people take them me am i just going to just let these people take them like ive got any choice in whats happening here or out there hardy put his back against the wall and turned to meet her eyes there was no warmth in his expression youve got all the choice in the world maya she just stared over at him shaking her head what are you talking about ive got no choice about anything are you out of your mind maybe i am trying to defend you with the wrong theory the wrong motive and you sitting there day in and day out watching me do it letting me do it i dont know what youre saying yes you do maya im talking about the basic fact of this case dylan wasnt blackmailing you because you guys sold drugs in college and gosh maybe people would find out that wasnt it was it although thats what you let me build our whole case on and why would i do that two reasons one you felt guilty and that you deserved to be punished and two you could never tell anybody the truth not even your lawyer because you cant trust him enough hardy came forward his elbows resting on his knees okay so enough now its time true or false maya dylan was blackmailing you because of something to do with your aunts death wasnt he her body gave slightly no words came what was it maya did you know who did the hitandrun and not tell the police did you loan them your car now mayas mouth went loose her eyes glassy you were there werent you maya in the car with them hardy suddenly felt his own head go light as the probable reality hit him no he said no you were the driver for a long moment she regarded him as she might her executioner then all at once a small sound came out of her throat she hung her head and her shoulders began to heave tears splashed like raindrops onto the floor between her feet shed passed through the sobbing though the blotched and wet effects of it remained on her face what matters is that nobody in the family can know which means nobody at all cause whoever knew would tell them she let out a shuddering unsteady breath how did you find out serendipity hardy said my investigator mentioned tess granat and you to his girlfriend in the same breath and there it was youve kept this to yourself all this time of course i had to then a hand quickly on his leg and you cant tell anyone either ever no i know that you dont have to worry about that he hesitated but maybe you could after all her tortured gaze fell on him if you think that she said you dont understand my family at all or me or any of this what about your husband tell him i am a murderer tell him the mother of his children is a child killer hardy straightened his back stiff up against the cell wall youre being too hard on yourself maya it was a long time ago she shook her head its yesterday she said its this morning its now for gods sake dont you understand i killed her my moms sister kathys sister and her unborn child everybodys favorite it was an accident i was stoned and drunk both loaded it was murder and youll never forgive yourself for it why should i i did it would you i dont know to tell you the truth maybe after all this time id be tempted to start trying time hasnt made it go away it might if you shared the burden of it if you told somebody maybe you need absolution i pray for it every day its not going to come without some kind of confession what now youre a priest not even close hardy said just a fellow sinner like yourself but i was raised a good catholic believe me i know how the forgiveness thing works you ever kill anybody hardy nodded i was in vietnam i killed a lot of people including not just in vietnam he thought but also the victims of the horrific gunfight hed been part of here in san francisco the aftermath of which had dominated his emotional stability and career for the next three or four years so yes hed killed his share of people and kept his share of secrets too a plague of them he sometimes felt but frannie his children glitsky roakethey all knew what hed done had worked through the consequences together and that had helped maya shook her head vietnam was killing in a war what like that doesnt count it felt like it counted trust me i know it did to the families of my victims i know it did to me he drew in a breath my only point is i think maybe keeping this secret has hurt you enough look at the power it gave dylan vogler i hated that man id imagine so he was in the car with you she nodded it was his car no connection to me he just washed it up and never told anybody the bastard when did the blackmail start not until he was out of prison but right after that he couldnt get any other work not that he really tried i dont think he looked me up and reminded me how much i owed him for his silence i get it hardy said i dont know if you do i dont know if anybody can her chin fell a puppets string cut it never ends its just a constant weight i dont want to beat a dead horse maya so im only going to say it one more time you could let it go let joel in at least hes stuck by you through all this and here maybe thinking you killed somebody too he loves you he could handle it she had her arms crossed over her chest hunched over now rocking on the hard concrete ledge god god god its all right maya its all right no no its so not all right seconds passed and she slowed herself down in her movements finally became still youd think i would have been on guard against it i mean it was the great myth i was raised with what was that eve the garden of eden the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thats what it all was to me back when i met dylan he was the serpent just so attractive so much wiser i thought willing to try anything you know for the experience of it here try some of this and i was this kid whod never done anything who was justjust so simple and stupid and you know what the real stupidity was whats that i really was happy she looked over at hardy searching his face to see if he understood at all i mean before dylan i was a happy person a good person but then hed started challenging and questioning me about everything about who i was how can you know youre as happy as you can be when you havent even tried to experience anything outside of your wellordered little life maybe youre just afraid to find out what real life is about and if thats the case then all your socalled happiness is just cowardice and sham isnt it her eyes pleaded with hardy how could i not see what he was doing its seductive thats why hardy said if its any help i doubt eve saw it either she just wanted the knowledge to taste the forbidden fruit one little taste thats all i wanted just to see original sin hardy said and so youre not the first to commit it are you it goes back a ways that fall from grace some would say its the human condition but it wasnt who i was ever supposed to be no hardy said heavily no i dont suppose it was thats the horrible thing and then tess her voice broke again if i could just have those days back that day john greenleaf whittiers phrase hovered in hardys consciousnessof all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been but he merely draped his arm over his clients shoulder and drew her in for a moment next to him youve still got lots of days ahead of you maya better ones i promise you suddenly the bailiff knocked from the courtroom side and swung the connecting door open recognizing the not unfamiliar tableaua suspect wrung out with emotion a face nearly disfigured swollen and red from cryinghe stepped into the doorway and leaned over toward hardy asking with an unexpected solicitousness everything okay here sir if we could get a couple more minutes id appreciate it hardy said and maybe some kleenex stier stood looking down onto seventh street from the thirdfloor window in clarence jackmans office youve got to be shitting me jackman obsidian black stood six feet five inches tall and this morning had grunted in satisfaction when his bathroom scale failed to clear the twohundredseventypound marker as always he was dressed in a welltailored dark suit and white shirt today with a maroonanddarkblue rep tie ignoring stiers profanity jackman spoke in his lowregistered powerful quiet voice you needed to be told right away get it in front of marian put the woman on your witness list stier turned of course nothing else to do really he shook his head in disgust this was schiff apparently although bracco says hes just as responsible another dismissive head shake cops what was she thinking i really believe shed convinced herself it was immaterial the woman seemed senile schiff didnt think youd want some probably untrue random detail screwing up your story i dont care about my story clarence i build the case out of whatever story ive got to work with if its got inconsistencies but hell you know this and it would have been nothing if i laid it out up front now it looks like we buried it i know that stier slammed his hand on the windowsill shit right but im afraid theres something maybe worse if youd like to sit down the request clearly surprised stier but this was his boss so he went where jackman indicated and sat on the front couple of inches of one of the leather couches shoot he said well let me start out by admitting a personal bias which i do try to leave out of my professional duties nevertheless i think you may know paul that kathy west and i go back quite a way when i first came on here she walked me through quite a few minefields on the political side actually was one of my informal advisers well i jackman forged his smile of steel and held up a hand cutting off the interruption if i may my point is that ive watched this case develop over the past few months with a lot of interest and a bit of a sense of discomfort not only because of the inherent weaknesses in the evidence but because of the media blitz thats accompanied all of jerry glasss side of things with the mayor and harlen fisk and your defendants husband but i never felt i had to discuss this with you because as i say i generally like to stay out of battles where i have a personal stake but also because you won at the px so there was nothing for me to say the court had ruled jackman slid his haunch off the edge of his desk and went to sit across from stier in his leather wing chair but now suddenly he continued this new wrinklemaybe there were two shots and not just oneseems to undermine your basic theory of the case this is important to me first because its no longer personal and second because contrary to popular opinion my jobour jobs yours and minethat job is not only to prosecute its to serve justice its to find the truth of what happened if we find exculpatory evidence its our duty to put it in the record not hide it so we can go ahead and get our conviction im not hiding anything clarence i didnt know about this until twenty minutes ago no i know that i guess my real question is how does this make you feel about this case and about your defendant does it change anything for you and if so what stiers body languagehunched shoulders flushed complexionbelied the control he exerted over his confident tone strategically id admit its a pain in the ass its going to give more credence to this testimony than it deserves but as to the actual facts first they probably dont change a lick you tell me the womans apparently senile so she may or may not have heard two shots and in any event she didnt get to schiff and bracco until a couple of days later hell what she heard might not even have been on the morning of the murder so do i have an issue with my basic theory no none nothings changed jackman hands relaxed and linked in front of him nodded and mr glass regardless of what the medias doing with the mayor and all that jerrys helping me make the dope case clarence and thats the motive here i know its unusual for the feds to get involved in one of our murders but to me the financial stuff hes got already proves the money laundering which in turn proves her complicity with vogler as for the mayor stier met jackmans gaze shes no part of my case neithers fisk that said their financial dealings with joel townshend are complicated and wideranging and i dont think jerrys out of line looking into them welljackman stole a peek at his watchthanks for making the time i see youve got to be back in court in ten minutes this was a dismissal certainly stier got up and made it to the office door before he turned thanks for the headsup on schiffs witness clarence although i dont think shes going to make any difference in the verdict and on the other stuff i appreciate the candor cheryl biehl considered herself a close friend of mayas shed visited her twice in jail and hardy knew that for a nonfamily member to brave the bureaucracy indifference cultural challenges disorganization noise and crowds of the jails visiting room showed a rare and true commitment and friendship and to do so twice biehls affection for maya must be genuine so he was happy that he wasnt going to be grilling her on her earlier testimony to stier testimony that had effectively painted her friend as a longstanding user and seller of drugs he was also marginally cheered if slightly perplexed by stiers addition of a new witness lori bradford at this stage in the proceeding calling for a sidebar and admitting as soon as the court had come back into session that he had only been informed of the existence of this witness during the lunch recess stier acknowledged that he would in all probability not actually call her but he told hardy and the court that a perusal of police procedures during the investigation had revealed that this womans testimony had not made it into the inspectors reports and hence not into hardys discovery documents painting the oversight as little more than an unimportant technicality stier just wanted to preserve the sanctity of the record hardy accepted this for the time being he would have time to find out everything he might want to know about lori bradford and her testimony and in the meanwhile he had what he hoped would be the simple crossexamination of cheryl biehl where he might elicit some facts about her continuing friendship with his client that might help the jury view her in a better light in the here and now ms biehl he began in the past eight years have you ever witnessed maya using or selling marijuana no when you told her that youd heard about dylan vogler selling marijuana out of bay beans west what did she say to you about that she said she was sure that wasnt happening dylan didnt need to do that and about her statement regarding levon preslee that she was never going to get out from under them in spite of that comment to the best of your recollection did she ever mention levon preslee to you again no so it was just that once right after he got out of prison thats right and how long ago was that i dont know exactly it must have been seven or eight years hardy took a beat walking back to his table maya her eyes still puffy from the crying jag nevertheless seemed to be more engaged less burdened somehow he gave her a subtle nod of encouragement and in fact hardy felt he had cause for a renewed sense of hope after all he had two brandnew and unexpected facts with which to conjurelori bradford and tess granatand in his experience facts had always had a way of expanding concentrically although he couldnt identify as yet the exact territory they were expanding into now he paused hed been considering trying to use cheryl biehls crossexamination as a way to give the jury some kind of a sense of the real reason that dylan had been blackmailing maya of course this would be a very tricky strategy on a couple of levels not the least of which because it left maya with essentially the same motiveblackmailto have killed her manager but these he considered might both be mitigated by other considerations in the first case blackmail over the hitandrun took mayas purported selling of dope and its attendant moral turpitude out of the equation and this also removed any motive for her having killed levon also in the real world and absent mayas confessionwhich would never be forthcomingthere was no chance of building a case for the hitandrun so that issue was moot but somehow the risk of pursuing any of this seemed suddenly too great hardy had his own responsibility under the attorneyclient privilege to keep any hint of what hed just learned to himself he didnt want to play any morally ambiguous games with his fragile client on this score he was now finally her confidant and confessor and he couldnt betray her by notsosubtle implications of other motivations so all in all though hardy thought that getting the fundamental truth about maya and dylan before the jury might have its advantages in the end he decided it was not something he could do he turned back to his witness thank you mrs biehl he said no further questions as far as witnesses went jansey ticknor had opened up after theyd charged maya back in october in her first interviews with bracco and schiff she had been unforthcoming but during the course of paul stiers preparations for the preliminary hearing back in november she had come to remember quite a bit of what she couldnt seem to initially recall about maya townshend and her relationship to dylan now stier was seeing to it that she was laying as much of it as she could out for the jury so mr vogler told you about their earlier relationship hardy objected on the grounds of hearsay but as he thought she might braun overruled him hearsay was one of the most flexible and confusing concepts in all of jurisprudencesometimes allowed sometimes notand brauns interpretation today looked like she was going to be allowing janseys testimony she was buying stiers theory that voglers statements were against his penal interestsomething so unfavorable to him that he would never have said it if it wasnt true and this was an exception to the hearsay rule braun also appeared to accept stiers argument that the statements were admissible for voglers state of mind an argument so arcane that even hardy couldnt follow it in any event whether it was a valid legal call or not brauns decision was going to be the rule in this courtroom today and hardy had to live with it yes she said they had been intimate in college and since then this time in frustration hardy held up his hand objection relevance goes to motive your honor stier replied if he wasnt going to convince the jury about the blackmail hed take the jilted lover as a backup position braun nodded in her brusque fashion and again shot hardy down overruled since they finished college then ms ticknor did mr vogler tell you that hed had an intimate relationship with defendant yes up till a little before he met me hardy felt a tight grip over his forearm and mayas voice sharp in his ear thats a damn lie loud enough for all the courtroom to hear it and maybe even the one next door judge braun slammed her gavel but maya all but inert for much of these proceedings so far suddenly had come alive thats just not true she said to hardy then turned the other way in her seat toward the jury and addressed them directly thats not true she repeated bam bam mr hardy control your client bailiffs but before either of the two bailiffs could get to her maya had turned completely around to face her husband sitting in the row behind her its not she said its not its all right he said i believe you and he went to put an arm out to touch her but by this time the first bailiff had come up and gotten in between them knocking joels arm away looking up at braun for instructions and as if in response to this escalation the entire gallery seemed to erupt at once over the steady cadence of the gavel when at last after nearly a minute a restive silence if not true order had been restored braun glared down from the bench looking to hardy as if shed suddenly aged ten years real fright that her courtroom had so quickly gotten out of her control showed in her face in the set of her mouth maybe it hadnt happened to her in a while but whatever the reason she had been unprepared as hardys heart pounded in his ear from one pulse to the next braun shifted from intimidated oldster to wrathful prelate she wielded her gavel randomly it seemed in the near silence and then dropped the little hammer again until the silence was complete gathering herself she summoned stier and hardy to sidebar she spoke with an exaggerated quiet mr hardy any further outburst from your client such as the one weve just all endured and i will order her removed from the courtroom she can watch these proceedings on closed circuit tv if she cant control herself is that about as clear as i can possibly make it yes your honor he could have gone on with a bit more of a floral apology but decided to leave it at that if nothing else his client had just achieved one of his primary objectiveshumanizing herself to the jury hardy went back to counsel table and squeezed mayas hand stier for his part seemed to have enjoyed the blowup as well for his own reasons he would be happy to grant the defendants humanity too so long as it was a humanity characterized by a hot temper and a dismissive disregard of authority he came back to his witness ms ticknor how long did this intimacy between himself and the defendant go on after mr vogler got out of prison until he met me and when was that about six years ago hardy had one hand over mayas own hand on the table and his other hand firmly holding her arm just above her elbow so they broke off their relationship because of you yes maya leaned over and whispered to hardy why is she saying this hardy thought he might know but this really wasnt the time to talk about it so he shook his head very slightly and squeezed her arm tighter braun frowned in their direction and stier went on yet after this breakup mr vogler kept working for her at bbw as his domestic partner did you know mr voglers salary there yes ninety thousand dollars a year a few gasps from the gallery greeted this intelligence did your partner share with you why he was paid so handsomely your honorhardy showing some exasperationhearsay relevance facts not in evidence conclusory none of this entire line of questioning is probative it all goes to motive stier put in as will be clear shortly very well braun said the objections are overruled go ahead mr stier stier repeated the previous question and jansey nodded with some enthusiasm she wanted to keep him around because she loved him she thought shed get him back and how did you feel about that i didnt like it of course i resented it did you ask him to quit his job several times what reason did he give you for not quitting he couldnt make anywhere near as much anywhere else besides he could sell the marijuana out of bbw without any hassles he had the perfect situation he said he couldnt be fired she was paying him just to keep him around so to your knowledge did mr vogler tell you that defendant knew about the marijuana sold out of her shop yes of course another whisper from maya that lying bitch another upperarm squeeze from hardy stier paused for a moment pure theatricality ms ticknor did anything change between mr vogler and defendant in the last year yes and what was that they started up an affair again and how do you know about this dylan wasnt coming home when he usually did and i called him on it so he admitted it yes and what did you do i moved out in with my parents when was this about this time last year say six months beforebefore he was killed and what happened next after a couple of weeks he stopped itthe affair he told me hed made a mistake and begged me to come back to him which i did mostly because of ben our child i wanted our son to have a father jansey ran a fingertip under one of her eyes then the other yes of course stier replied with an admirable sanctimoniousness he turned to the jury including them in his heartfelt emotion now returning to his witness he cleared his throat after this second and most recent rejection of defendant by mr vogler did things change at bbw yes in what way now she wanted to punish dylan for dropping her to fire him but he couldnt let her do that he had too much stuff going on at the store he couldnt let it go so what did he do well mostly he threatened to tell her husband about the affair and also some of the stuff theyd done in college in other words he started blackmailing her if you want to call it that yes thank you and turning he said to hardy your witness in spite of mayas outburst both she and hardy had known the gist of janseys testimony before shed gone onto the standthey had heard a similar version of it during the preliminary hearing hardy had hoped that much of janseys testimony would never in fact be heard by the jury because so much of it was hearsay well that would show him but against the urge to hope he was always prepared taking some pages from his binder he walked up to his place in front of jansey handing them to her ms ticknor he began do you recognize these pages which ive just handed to you she glanced down at them turned them over yes theyre transcripts of the talks i had with the inspectors youve had a chance to read them and to compare them to the original taperecorded statements that you gave police yes and they are a full and complete record of those interviews yes they are ms ticknor youve just told mr stier that you knew that mr vogler was blackmailing the defendant right correct and youre absolutely sure about that yes now ms ticknor id like you to turn to page two and read to the jury the highlighted section jansey looked down found the place and read in a shaky voice if he was blackmailing her he could have just asked for a raise and she would have had to give it to him right thank you for the jurys benefit ms ticknor the him and her you use refer to who dylan and maya good so you were asking the inspectors a question about if dylan were blackmailing maya isnt that so i guess so but hardy cut her off so ms ticknor if it is true that you knew at the time that dylan was blackmailing maya why did you have to ask the inspector something that you already knew well i let me ask you again did you know for a fact that dylan was blackmailing maya well i dont see how he could have ms ticknor excuse me yes or no did you know for a fact that dylan was blackmailing maya well yes he told me but is it correct that you have no explanation for that passage in the transcript that you just read no i guess i was just confused thank you hardy kept right on now you have just testified that dylan told you that he was not afraid of maya because he could tell her husband about their affair and she needed him for the marijuana business isnt that right well yes thank you now id like you to read another short excerpt from the transcript of the same interview page four please the highlighted section again the witness found the spot and began to read youre right though about him not being afraid of her or of losing the job but he never talked about why the most he ever said was that she owed him she looked back up at hardy the most he ever said was that she owed him are those your words yes and you are referring to dylan and maya again right right so youre saying that the most dylan ever said about not being afraid of maya or of losing his job was that she owed him again a querulous uncertain nod i guess so this isnt a guessing game ms ticknor again either thats what you said or it wasnt which is it okay thats what i said the most dylan said about not being afraid of maya was that she owed him is that it yes yes hardy turned to include the jury but you just testified that he said a lot more than that didnt you i dont know what you mean you just testified that he said he could blackmail her for two separate reasons would you agree that thats different from that she owed him do you agree or not yes or no well thats what i meant and how often did you have these conversations a lot of times she took her plea directly to the jury just when we talked it was just stuff he told me but when hardy persisted if you didnt know about any of this when you spoke to the inspectors after dylan was already dead when could you have talked about it with him jansey threw an agonized glance over at stier i dont know im not sure but we did im sure we did the point made hardy left it one last short reading if i may the highlighted section in the middle of page five by this time her voice had shrunk to a nearwhisper but she found her place did he say what she owed him for it wasnt like we really ever talked about it it wasnt like you really ever talked about it that would be you and dylan correct yes just one more thing ms ticknor tell the jury what the police found in the attic of your home what do you mean i mean about a quarter million dollars worth of marijuana thats what i mean well yes the marijuana was up there and thats the marijuana that you have just told us dylan was selling in mayas business yes so naturally youve been arrested and charged with having a very large stash of marijuana growing for sale in your house havent you well of course not but youve just told us you knew it was there yes growing in your house yes providing the money that supported at least in part you and your child right well i never took any dope money but the fact remains youve never been arrested for or charged with possession of any of that sizable stash of marijuana did you ever discuss that possibility with the police well yes they told me i wouldnt get in any trouble let me refresh your recollection ms ticknor as to the order in which these conversations took place first you told the police you knew very little about what had happened and nothing about the marijuana upstairs correct well that was my first statement then more than a week later after police told you that you could go to jail for a very long time if they connected you to dylans marijuana business you recalled information that incriminated maya townshend and then the police told you you wouldnt be charged for the marijuana upstairs isnt that pretty much the way it went well okay but its not the way you make it sound thank you hardy said no further questions it wasnt as though the media had lost interest in the trial and todays testimony sent the scribes and pundits scurrying from the courtroom to their telephones and keyboards to report on the newly revealed allegations of mayas infidelity her subsequent rejection and the added motivation this would certainly have given her to have murdered dylan vogler all this was for example on the evening news which hardy and his partners over drinks were watching on the huge tv theyd had installed in tasteful cabinetry on the back wall of the solarium although as soon as the broadcast was done hardy hit the remote and turned the television off never mind that none of it happened he said though i hate to quibble farrell drinking espresso was more or less back to being his old self reconnected with his girlfriend sam getting his hair cut with some regularity since it was after business hours phyllis had gone home so wes was comfortable enough coming downstairs with his dog and wearing his tshirt which today read eternity smoking or nonsmoking you live to quibble he said to hardy quibbling gives meaning to your life as anyone who knows you will surely attest gina roake sipped her oban neat are you sure she asked none of it happened okay when they were in college but not since sorry but i believe maya so jansey just perjured herself gina asked hardy in trial mode took a pull at his bottle of water and nodded all over the place why wes chuckled i love when you ask that gina like perjurys a surprise im not surprised so much as disappointed it keeps happening and whats in it for jansey is i guess what im getting at i think first mainly hardy replied is shes in nomansland and this is her ticket out early on stier or schiff or somebody probably told her something like were not interested in how much you knew about dylans dope business or what you got out of it or if youre still in it were interested in maya killing him and if you can help us out on that well just conveniently forget about the rest so shes heavily motivated to give them something and what better than a bunch of stuff dylan supposedly said to her which no one can ever check or even refute its perfect and she probably thinks maya did it anyway that is if jansey didnt do it herself you think thats possible gina asked hardy shrugged somebody did janseys alibis squishy at best shes got a new boyfriend already probably had him before shes one of the best bets to have gotten her hands on the gun but though i hate to say it maya still doesnt look too bad for it either attaboy farrell had a strong and it must be admitted oftjustified prejudice that the client was always guilty dont wimp out on that now dont worry im pretty secure although i admit theres a small chance i could still be swayed by what farrell asked oh i dont know a new fact or two well farrell said thats not going to happen not at this stage actually it might hardy said in fact maybe it already did he told them about lori bradford new to stiers witness list ive already sent wyatt out to talk to her see what shes got to say whats in the police reports gina asked a rueful grimace it seems they never got around to writing it up you shock me farrell said i know hardy agreed its rocked my worldview but the fact remains shes got to have something to say or stier wouldnt have made such a fuss about getting her on the witness list even if hes not going to call her hes hoping im going to let her slide too he smiled at his two partners but im afraid im going to let him down on that at least until i know what shes got or not seventhirty pm killing time until craig chiurcos expected arrival hardy sat at his desk as was his habit he was reviewing his files hoping something among this amorphous mass of kindling might spark the files now ran to four thick black threering notebooks into which hed crammed in some semblance of order forensics reports police reports interview transcripts such as those hed used with jansey in the courtroom today photographs private notes of schiff and braccothe endless accretion of litigation at last having reviewed his notes on janseys testimonyfortyseven pages worthfor the second time he closed the binder and leaned back into his chair though part of him yearned to recall her to the stand and pick apart individual strands of her testimony that hed left unaddressed that afternoonwhich was after all most of ithe also realized that hed succeeded in doing his main job which was discrediting her so that all of her testimony was suspect besides he couldnt ignore his gut feeling his pure instinct that there was nothing in her perjured story that were the truth known would likely change any jurors opinion about mayas guilt the basic facts remainedwhether maya had had an affair with him or not vogler had been blackmailing her shed been paying the blackmail which meant she was guilty of something shed gone down to bbw and over to levons why why why jansey was undoubtedly lying but lying for all of her own probably very good reasons in the end he believed that nothing she said was going to make any real difference hardy got up walked first over to the window where he looked down on sutter street then came around to another recessed cabinet on the wall across from his desk this one holding his dartboard he opened the doors of the cabinet and slid them back into wherever they went then grabbed his tungsten beauties from their slots and retreated to the dark cherrywood throw line in his polished white oak hardwood floor twenty double twenty five from the board to the line one five twenty then one one five another four or five lost roundsterrible atypical shootingbefore he finally rang up twenty twenty twenty okay leaving those darts where theyd landed he lifted himself back onto the desk chiurco again in his coat and tie sat in a wing chair across from hardy in the more informal of the two seating arrangements in the office he seemed nervous so hardy did the initial lifting so levon preslee okay remind me how did his name come up in the first place wyatt had put me on dylans old robbery conviction he thought there might be some tiein to whatever he was using to blackmail maya or even better we might turn up somebody else who wanted to kill him so howd you get to preslee i just did a web search i found vogler that gave me the robbery in and theres his codefendant levon so i run him on the web and find out hes working for act youre not going to believe this but hes also listed in the phone book i figure he works in the theater hes probably home during the day so i drove out there i didnt even know that wyatt had run across him too until i heard about that from you guys you didnt call him first no sir i thought in case he wasnt right with all this stuff i might get better answers if i caught him off guard so then what then i get into his lobby and theres this woman standing there at the door howd you know it was maya had you met her before no but shes our client i saw her picture in the paper it was her as it turns out youre right but anyway i didnt know what she was doing there or what i should do so i just stood there for a minute then what well she told me he wasnt home and walked out past me mr hardy honest to god i think she was jiggling the doorknob like she was trying to get in but i got there a split second too late and i cant be absolutely positive but really thats what i think i saw well then if thats the best you can do for us then thats what were going to go with at least its something if i call you to testify dont try to improve it thats what youve got to say got it got it okay then so write it up just like that and sign it because if i decide to call you ill need to give the discovery to the da cool okay then have a good night you too shes an old lady wyatt hunt said but i dont know where they got senile hardy had remembered to call home and tell frannie he didnt know when hed be incommon enough during trialsbut at the same time hed remembered that hed also forgotten to eat so when hunt had checked in after his meeting with lori bradford saying he was at his own office just around the corner on grant chinatowns main street preparing to go out to grab some chinese hardy invited himself along now they sat on high stools sharing a tiny twotop in the front window the only two customers eating shrimp and pork and no sign of souvlaki lo mein à la lou the greeks a good thing so whats her story hardy chewed and listened while hunt laid it out for all of its simplicity the implications hardy realized might be enormousnothing less than a complete restructuring of the theory of the case more importantly there was no set of facts he could imagine that would be consistent with maya having been involved in this twoshot scenario no he told hunt think about it theres only one shot from the supposed murder weapon right right so what did she do shoot onceat what dylan some kind of warning shot unlikely but the main thing is if theres that second shot from the one gun the magazine would have been light two bullets and it wasnt just one and to get back to that one she would have had to reload and thats just plain absurd stiers going to say it didnt happen period hell even use your own argument of no evidence no second casing no second slug no nothing it didnt happen it was a backfire yeah right i know but lets pretend for a minute all right so what do you see got to be two guns two hardy into it put down his chopsticks whoever came to shoot dylan had his own gun and knew dylan carried so he stuck him up at gunpoint for the other gun first why why didnt he just shoot him bang he knew him maybe first he thought they could talk it out whatever their differences were maybe dylan tried to stall him somehow so they had a meeting planned with maya too hardy shook his head i dont have that one figured yet how would this woman the one you saw tonight lori right how would she be on the stand pretty good id say sincere and smart knew exact times for the shots and remembered the day and date even after all this time shes no dummy diz so what is it did stier just not believe her i mean why leave her out up front instead of trying to find some way to explain her story and ps its pretty easily explained as youve already done about a minute ago he might not have known about her till when then hardy pointed a finger recalling the tense lunchtime gathering at lous with glitsky and jackman and the inspectors maybe lunchtime today huh the thought crossed my mind to be honest this could do it hardy said for the verdict i mean hunt popped a shrimp it might he said then cocked his head with a question is there something else besides the verdict theres who really did it wyatt if it wasnt maya and if there were two guns the idea set back hunt in his chair well now he said and stared out the window into the misty street an innocent client wes swears that never happens in real life i know hell be devastated but hes been wrong before after a minute hunt came forward again elbows on the table but so on the other thing ive been dying to know what you found out what other thing tess granat the hitandrun i googled it after lunch thank god for google hardy said really wishing that hunt hadnt brought this up again everything thats ever happened there it is except dylan vogler his early life at least what do you mean i mean that except for the few days right after he got shot i think our friend dylan might be the only human being google hasnt found and chronicled you looked diz googles half my life maybe three quarters its where you look first which brings us back to tess granat who was very real and very chronicled so whatd you find out hardy picked up his tea and blew on it nothing nothing she wouldnt say or what even if she wasnt involved she must have known all about it hardy could see there wasnt anything to do but come clean it was a privileged conversation wyatt i cant talk about it hunt broke a smile diz dude im your investigator im covered by the privilege well just because i can tell you doesnt mean i should and dont think it doesnt break my heart hardy put his cup down moved on but listen i dont know if were going to need that anyway this lori bradford as i said might do it all by herself weve got to get her subpoenaed as our witness absolutely and asap i think hunt took a small notebook from his jacket pocket and made a note ill have craig come by your office for it in the morning thatll work hardy said ill make one out first thing and leave it with phyllis give the boy some meaningful labor work through his problems well im hoping hes over them kids you know love ive heard of em both hardy said anyway if craig doesnt show i will dont worry and i got lori on tape tonight anyhow for what thats worth its back at the office locked up excellent hardy put away the last bite of pork and looked at his watch quarter to ten blowing out heavily he shook his head sometimes i think im getting too old for these things anymore trials not just trials murder trials i thought they were the fun part when lawyers felt most alive hardy gave him a look uhhuh only in the sense that when youre suffering at least you know youre alive well there you go there you go hardy said but suddenly hardy realized as he was driving home that the confluence of the two new facts hed only discovered todaythe twoshot scenario at the alley behind bbw and mayas involvement with the death of tess granathad much against his will and inclination pushed him not just over the line into doubt about his clients guilt but into a near certainty that she might in fact be innocent the key element regarding tess granat which he and hunt had hinted about at lunch today was simple and yet profound dylan vogler had known about the accident and had been blackmailing maya about it since hed gotten out of prison hardy could believeand in fact had believedthat his client had all the motive in the world to have killed dylan shed also had means and opportunity what had changed in the tess granat scenario which had the rather significant advantage of being true was that to hardys mind it completely eliminated levon preslee from the picture hed already gotten his one favor his job from maya and maybe even through dylan but that had evidently been enough that job had worked for him for a new start on a different life and in any event that favor or whatever it was had been years before there was no record or even sniff of a record that maya had seen or spoken to him in eight years before she suddenly went over to his apartment on the day he was killed againwhy because levon had called her in just the same way that dylan had called her or had someone else called her either or both times someone who was connected to both dylan and to levon in the present and who might have had dealings with them in the past as well paco at tenfifteen long after everyone else except the downstairs guards had left the building harlen fisk sat holding a glockcaliber semiautomatic weapon the twin to his sisters in his office upstairs in city hall harlen had bought both the guns at the same time while he was still only a couple of years into his service with the police force as was the custom when glock came out with the new model theyd offered it at a discount to activeduty cops in the hope that cops would come to favor the gun and entire cities would order it as the onduty weapon for their police force in fact hed insisted on buying mayas for her after theyd had an early robbery at bbw you needed a weapon if you owned a store in the haight even if you werent planning to use it it was good for peace of mind back in those days dylans time in prison hadnt seemed to weigh so heavily on everyone not even to a cop like harlen theyd all known each other when dylan and maya had been in college harlen the older brother not yet a cop sometimes they all smoked dope together had some laughs then dylan had done something truly dumb and got caught but hed paid for it and now he was working with maya doing a great job harlen never considered that hed go back to crime why would he he didnt need it so hed bought the guns the glocks harlen hadnt even known or cared about the ballistics quirkthat fired bullets from this model couldnt usually be traced back to a particular gununtil hed heard about it at trial harlens office wasnt large and most of it was filled with the oldfashioned desk and freestanding bookshelves that lined the wall to his right to his left the view out his large windows across van ness included a glorious stretch of san franciscos somewhat grandiose architecturethe opera house performing arts center and war memorial behind him a framed rogues gallery of himself posing with various other politicians and celebritieshis aunt kathy of course bill and hillary dianne feinstein robin williams dusty baker in his giants uniformoffered mute but compelling testimony to his own popularity and success harlen had made it in a somewhat tortuous route and in the most cutthroat of fields almost to the very top at least to the citys topand after that who knew how far he could go hed been a supervisor now for seven years after starting out as a clerk in kathys office just out of college about seven years before that through his aunt kathys tutelage and influence hed joined the pd as a uniformed patrolman and rose quickly finally making it all the way to homicide for a few months before finally quitting and jumping over to the political side starting with the low rungs of community activist worksoup kitchen and homeless shelter service on the one hand victims rights advocacy a natural with his police background on the other mix in a couple of stints on various visible boardsthe national kidney foundation friends of the san francisco public libraryand a term on the school board and then kathy moved up to mayor and he ran for and won her seat on the board of supervisors and now here he was gun in hand wondering if it was all going to end the immediate problem was cheryl zolotny no biehl now sweet sweet girl and hot hot hot when shed been younger in fact she was still more than easy to look at and in other circumstances he might have found himself falling into those bedroom eyeseyes that hed once known wellover lunch but not today today her testimony about all those years ago with maya simply had made harlen realize how at risk he still was this was a woman whod not only known him shed done drugs with him and so okay it had only been marijuana lately and in spite of his longterm support of the medical marijuana laws and parlors in the city hed come to appreciate how much trouble a little pot could get people into if only dylan hadnt been wearing that backpack but he had and now cheryl from out of nowhere had suddenly returned fullblown into the picture not that she was so far as he knew out to get him in trouble in any way in fact at lunch shed been nothing if not inviting even downright flirtatious in spite of her marital status making noises about how flattered she was that hea very important man now in his exalted positionthat he even remembered her from back when theyd fooled around a little when shed been just a kid but what if she talked to somebody some reporter anybody really there was nothing more true about harlens business than the fact that you couldnt hide he took it as a truism as universal as murphys law that a politician with a damaging secret somewhere out in the ozone was a finished politician it would come outthe fact that hed known levon too hung with him he kept asking himself so what so what and the simple answer was that he didnt know the consequencesfrom petty to profoundif the people already hounding him about these forfeiture issues got any more to chew on no matter what he thought it would mean more headlines and not the good kind it was one thing to help a poor black kid get a job at act after a stretch in prison but quite another to have partied with him and his doper friends and your own murdersuspect dopedealing sister and even if it wasnt a careerbreaking matter to the general public it would be to kathy it could finish him and cheryl knew all about it and yes shed told him that of course if it was important to him shed keep all that old stuff to herself but what if what if he looked down at the gun in his hand what did he think he was doing with that had he come down here thinking that his career his life was really so close to over that perhaps he was really going to kill himself what about jeannette and the kids what would they do without him he had to relax after all nothing had happened yet maybe nothing ever would and cheryl had promised him that shed keep it between them forever just like their other secrets from when theyd dated shed never betray him she understood everything hed told her and agreed that it was important super important shed actually said and the insipid valley girl adjective had brought back one of the other realities about cheryl the excheerleader she had been hot hot hot no doubt but also dumb dumb dumb super dumb was she too dumb to understand what she knew or should he try to contact her again set up an appointment make it clearer robert tripp in his scrubs came out of the bathroom peeled off his surgical gloves and dropped them into the trash can in janseys kitchen i think i got it all he started running the water in the sink soaping up his hands but that was not a pretty job thank you she said she sat at the kitchen table a glass of wine in front of her i owe you i just couldnt handle that tonight tripp turned what if i wouldnt have been here i would have quarantined the bathroom and forbidden flushing until i could call the plumber you could always do it yourself she made a face i do a lot of goodmother stuff robert i really do but putting my hands in that tripp held up his hands gloves then soap does wonders did he use the whole roll you think most of it looked like it anyway yuck im sorry but yuck lucky you got me he dried his hands and came to sit down across from her but other than that mrs lincoln howd you like the play she drank off about half her glass and shook her head its been a tough day if you want to know tough all the way i look at maya sitting there across from me and she looks so harmless really so pathetic almost i think shed been crying before she came into court then i feel like such a beast somehow he reached across and put his hand over hers she did it hon i thought we were pretty clear about that no matter what she looks like i know i know but theres just all this other stuff what other stuff you know the insurance when theyre going to pay out whether the cops are still going to come after me for something about the business didnt they say not wellshe shruggedif you believe them but i never signed anything so i guess they still could tripp stood up and came around the table pulling up a chair next to her he put his arm around her shoulders and drew her toward him kissed the hollow of her neck and held himself there for a moment youre just worrying i love you i just think what if its not her he pulled away but it is her who else would it be i know i know but it was just way different actually facing her and saying all that stuff out loud and i also knowdont think i dontthat once shes convicted its way better for us hey he said gently were cool we dont have to worry about us but i do i mean if he calls me back again whos that the defense guy mr hardy what about him well he didnt even ask about us why would he well you know because because were an item she turned to him not because were an item now robert because we were an item i mean then thats never come out and if it does then what i dont know but something id think why because it gives me a reason she blinked back the starts of tears he pulled her again to him his hand on her neck whispered into her ear youre just worn down janz its been a long haul thats all and it doesnt matter if youve got all the reason in the world to have done himwhich by the way you did dont say that all right but the fact remains it still doesnt matter since i said you were here but i was here of course but me saying it makes you really here with an actual alibi as they call it you know what i mean he put a finger under her jaw gently lifted it so that she was looking at him weve talked all about this lots of times i know im being stupid i guess not so stupid he kissed her but really really cute all upset the way you are she pouted shook her head i dont feel cute i bet i could fix that in about five minutes she stared past him through the window into the darkness outside he never asked me about us at all she said thats because you and me were not what this is about this is about maya killing dylan and helping the prosecution prove it thats all its about youre really sure im positive hon absolutely positive ruiz thought it would have been downright irresponsible since they had the program in place and working smoothly to simply abandon the business just because dylan was gone along with his steady supply of quality sensimilla the other longterm employees at bbw werent likely to find any other job that gave them a monthly bonus even close to what dylan had paid them for their loyalty and cooperation and ruiz was of course ready to step in almost immediately once the heat just after the shooting had dissipated now near midnight ruiz was in his tenyearold camaro crossing golden gate parks panhandle at masonic on his way to tonights meeting with his new sourceactually his old friend jaime gutierrez but who knew he was dealing weed until you looked aroundand pick up some product for the upcoming week tuesday was always the night and earlier on jaime had left him a text message on his cell with the always different address same as usual so ruiz had shut down bbw at ten oclock and swung by his apartment on parnassus where hed picked up his eight thousand dollars cash which he knew was way too much to be carrying around normally but it was only once a week and had to be done he also grabbed the old funky revolver a sixshooter actually that jaime had sold him once theyd done the first couple of deals and it had looked like it was going to keep working of course ruiz knew that having a gun hadnt done any good for dylan but thats because dylan had gotten complacent over time everybody at bbw knew where he kept it at work and how he carried it in his jackets inside pocket whenever he was moving either product or money or both and he was really at base such a trusting guy made a lot of money gave a lot of it away a sweetheart ruiz was smarter nobody at bbw knew he even had this gun or when he moved the money in and out or especially when or where he scored his product although he had to admit this was the area of the business where dylan had shown a talent for organization and control and ruiz was planning on emulating that model once he could get himself into a bigger crib where he could grow his own in quantity the way dylan had done in his attic which had meant that dylan didnt have to go to these weekly buys that always felt a little sketchy dylan hadnt had to buy he only sold and that made everything so much cleaner even after all their years together ruiz never figured out where hed stored the cash in or around the store no one ever knew when hed show up with the product or leave with cash so the lesson to take home from thatkeep all your logistics to yourself as dylan had done the thing to watch for ruiz knew was one of the other guys in the shop getting ideas that he could take over if ruiz disappeared just as ruiz had dylan had never considered that possibility or at least never showed it if he did oh well times changed lives changed and now in his new life ruiz parked on turk down by divisaderothe whole area darkened now since this neighborhood the outer fillmore tended to be underserved by the department of public works streetlights were not the biggest priority hereit was hard to say if in fact there were any other civic priorities either locking the car checking for foot trafficnoneruiz heard hiphop loud from a block or two away the wind was light but very cold and ruiz pulled his parka up over his chin hands in its pockets around his gun in one and his money in the other and checked doorways until he got to the address and stopped it was an oldstyle apartment building four stories the lobby shimmered under dull ceiling fluorescents their coverings yellowed with age and neglect ruiz tried the front door which was open how jaime found these places he didnt know a large gray cat sat in a litter box just under the mailbox and from the smell ruiz was pretty sure it wasnt the only animal that had relieved itself nearby maybe even some humans he was looking for f so he pressed the single elevator button but it didnt light up he only waited twenty seconds or so before he gave up and turned for the stairway the second floor was dimmer than the lobby but somewhat to his relief the third was brighter sweating now with nerves and the exertion of the climbhe had to get going making his own garden growhe turned out of the stairwell and walked back to f where he knocked twice then once spy shit he chuckled at it ridiculous and in a moment the door opens and here is jaime happy as ever slapping his five mellow without a care in the world ruiz took a last look behind him on the landing then stepped in and jaime closed the door behind them threw the dead bolt an adequate apartment if a little smallmaybe one of jaimes girlfriends living room dining room kitchen furnished in goodwill but not bad tasteful their usual protocol was they had a beer or two and caught up exchanged money for product made sure they were good for the next week and said goodbye and this is what they did now the whole thing took twenty minutes tops and then they were saying their goodbyes jaime was throwing back the dead bolt starting to open the door when suddenly it exploded in on them and they were being backed up by two guys in big parkas each carried a gun pointed straight at jaime and ruiz both guns had extensions on their barrels the two parkas advanced but didnt back up their targets for long maybe a step or two then they opened fire i know youre awake pick up it was still dark out am and hardy was having his morning coffee and reading the frontpage story in the paper about his day in court yesterday when jansey ticknor had implicated his client in a longstanding and he was sure completely spurious affair with dylan vogler for not the first timeand though he already had some marginally serviceable answershe was asking himself why she had perjured herself so thoroughly and wondering if he had anything to gain by calling her back to the stand and taking her head off but at the sound of glitskys voice these cogitations fled and he leaned over and grabbed the receiver this isnt what we call a reasonable time youre in trial i know youre up frannies not in trial i didnt call that phone youve got all the answers got to im a cop people depend on me actually im glad you called i was going to check in with you today about lori bradford i figured you would someday but thats not what i called about do you know who eugenio ruiz is why do you ask diz dont play games with me please of course you know who he is right bbw the new manager right except now hes the new dead manager oh my god poor eugenio i dont know maya maybe not so poor so what does this mean she asked him they were next to one another at the table in the glassblockenclosed attorney visiting room it was still a few minutes short of eight am besides that after this now were definitely closing the place down we should have done it before but joel wanted to make a stand against glass so youre telling me they were still selling dope out of there it looks like it at least eugenio was hardy shrugged this was by no means the most important issue of the day nor the most unexpected dylan had the whole system set up everybody who worked there probably in on it it makes sense somebody kept it going do they have any suspects i mean for who shot him no its way too soon for that i hope joel has an alibi if he found out that eugenio was dealing again after all weve been through he would have killed him lets not mention that to anybody okay but it wasnt joel even without an alibi there were two differentcaliber bullets so it looks like two shooters what it looks like classically in fact is a dope rip somebody followed somebody to where the money and the dope changed hands and just started blasting away that happens over marijuana every day maya every day it seems so strange remember when we were younger i wasnt young when you were but i know what you mean its so hard to imagine i mean a little grass was like nothing no big deal at all and now these people are dying over it its illegal so its prohibition all over again they ought to just legalize it thats a different discussion which id love to have with you someday but lets not make the argument when you get on the stand hows that the comment clearly offended her im not stupid diz not even close maya he pushed his chair back a little from the table crossed one leg over the other but you asked me what the killing of ruiz meant for us id like to pretend that braun or maybe stier will see this as the next step in a turf war that began with dylan and levon and one that you couldnt have been involved in so theyll just decide this whole prosecution and trial is a mistake and let you go but unfortunately that is not happening not in a million years so whats left whats left is a guy named paco who eugenio maybe could have identified and now definitely cant paco ring a bell well actually yes hardy sat back with a little thrill of surprise and pleasure tell me you know him and where he lives and you could pick him out of a lineup she bit her lip none of the above im afraid but i do know that name he was a friend of dylans and levons too for that matter all dead guys now you notice when did paco know them back in college she nodded sometime back there evidently they were all kind of the in crowd before i became part of it you know dylan and his pals always doing this crazy dangerous stuff and this kind of legendary guy named paco so what happened to him you never met him no he was supposedly gone by the time i showed up dropped out transferred what no idea really maybe he wasnt even in school with us was just kind of a hangeron except you know im pretty sure paco wasnt his real name it was more like a nom de guerre sometimes i got the feeling it was somebody we all actually knew i mean still knew and still hung out with it was just like dylan to wrap it all up in a mystery and be the one keeping the big secret sound familiar you think dylan might have been blackmailing him too i dont know i kind of doubt it why well i think first he didnt need to he had me and second if you dont have a weak and guiltridden person like me youre dealing with blackmail can be a little dangerous i mean youd better know your mark you threaten to expose the wrong thing about the wrong guy and the guy goes uh no i think ill kill you instead you know what im saying i do and paco wasnt weak or guiltridden evidently not his toughness was why he was legendary he was a real player he used to go out with dylan and levon like i did later but was well he wasnt just a tagalong they supposedly hit this liquor store once and the clerk pulled a gun and paco shot him dead this was a different robbery than the one dylan and levon went down for yeah before id even met them but when dylan told me about it i thought he was just bragging making it sound like they were such romantic studs sticking up places these fearless kind of robin hood guys getting money from these liquor stores and buying our dope with it which they shared with everybody how did i ever get involved with people like that i just dont know how that happened maybe by doing robberies with them you make it sound way worse than it was it wasnt anything strong arm it was more just intimidation to get stuff we wanted three or four of us putting the press on somebody thats all it was mostly just other kids and their dope you just took it from them she didnt answer looked down at the floor at gunpoint no never with a gun dylan wouldnt use a gun after paco said you couldnt predict what would happen and didnt want another mistake dylan thought it was a mistake then using a gun oh yeah definitely he saw it as the reason paco stopped hanging with them and that really bummed him out one less guy he had power over so paco checked out because maybe he grew a conscience about the guy he shot the way i heard it was paco hadnt planned to kill anybody it was all kind of a lark that suddenly went bad she looked askance at hardy thats the way it happened with dylan you started messing around with him and doing crazier and crazier things until you did something awful that you didnt mean to do at all just one moment of frailty falling in with these guys and then somehow later you are in just completely the wrong place you never really meant to be me and what happened with tess levon maybe this guy paco i dont know it appeared that stier wasnt going to let himself be sidetracked by the discovery of lori bradford or the murder of eugenio ruiz he had three other witnesses tentatively scheduled to appear whose testimony hardy knew closely adhered to that of cheryl biehls about mayas collusion with both dylan and levon in the marijuana business in college but since stier had skipped from biehl straight over to jansey ticknor hardy thought he was probably going to abandon any more discussion about mayas distant past everybody in the courtroom probably believed by now that his client had dealt drugs in college what stier had to get to next was her current involvement in dylans operation and to that end as soon as braun had taken the bench he called michael jacob schermer schermer in his midsixties might have been an athlete in his earlier life or even still a longdistance runner in this one tall thin whitehaired and very well dressed for the courtroom in a light green italian suit he projected a quiet confidence as he took the oath and went to the witness chair mr schermer stier began what is your profession im an accountant and for how long have you been in accounting schermer genial sat back to enjoy the experience of testifying which hed clearly done many times before he broke a small smile that he shared with the jury about forty years and have you developed a specialty over these years yes i have its called forensic accounting again bringing in the jury its kind of like a superaudit with a lot of computerized analysis and other bells and whistles if you want to put it in lay terms and you are licensed in this field yes i am licensed and accredited as a cfe or certified fraud examiner and what do you do in this line of work wellschermer shruggedas the name implies im basically trained to identify fraudulent business practices or financial transactions embezzlements misappropriation of assets questionable bankruptcies and so on and how do you do that well it gets a little complicated here he paused for the jury and gallery to chuckle with him but basically i analyze both physical and computerized accounting records to document i and e to excuse me mr schermer what is i and e oh sorry i live in a world of jargon im afraid i and e is income and expenses so i basically analyze i and e and movement of assets i also reconstruct i and e to find hidden or illicit income stuff like that money laundering yes thats more or less my subspecialty good thank you now mr schermer have you had occasion to examine the financial records of bay beans west for the six months ending november first of last year yes i did and did you discover accounting irregularities i did hardy sitting back in his chair knew that this was not going to be a high point for the defense his only early hope had been that the financial testimony itself would be so dry and technical that the jurys interest would flag after five minutes or so but schermers chatty and agreeable style looked like it was going to trump the material itself a quick glance at the jury verified this view could you summarize these irregularities for the jury well there wasnt just one kind hardy thought he might as well get in a lick or two if he could and he objected nonresponsive your honor and much to his surprise braun sustained him irrationally buoyed by the tiny decision he straightened in his chair pulled his yellow legal pad over in front of him perked up but only slightly stier turned back to the witness starting from what you consider the most significant irregularity can you tell the jury what your analysis uncovered well i always start in this kind of a retail business with the cash register since it will have a record of the primary sources of income for most of the next two hours schermer put on a pretty compelling coursecomplete with charts and graphs and regressive analyses of cash flowsthat to hardys perspective and he was sure to the jurys proved that bbw was not run to say the least according to strict adherence to established accounting procedures it wasnt simply the personal checks that maya had written to cover expenses or the lack of traceable reimbursables during the course of his testimony in the six months before dylan voglers death schermer identified no fewer than sixtyseven individual transactionscash in or out payroll discrepancies simple checking errors food and beverage cost and use analysisthat painted the business and of course maya as its owner in at best an unflattering light and at worst of course as a sophisticated criminal and all this before it got personal mr schermer stier had put away the latest graph and now stood again in front of the witness in the center of the courtroom at the time of mr voglers murder what annual salary was he drawing as manager of bbw ninety thousand dollars though jurors had heard about the salary before in stiers opening statement still this number seemed to nearly knock a couple of the jurors out of their chairs and sent a ripple of noise through the gallery as well stier knowing he was on to some juicy testimony pressed ahead and what was the approximate gross income of the coffee shop over the past fiscal year well going on the tax records the business filed the shop brought in gross four hundred sixtyone thousand ninetytwo dollars and fourteen cents now mr schermer was the salary of mr vogler typical of other employers working similar jobs in the same business no it was approximately double the city average double and were other employees at bbw similarly compensated in terms of multiples of the citys average pay for those jobs no they made about the norm which was essentially an hourly rate slightly above minimum wage lets take the assistant manager for example mr schermer an employee named eugenio ruiz did he work for an hourly rate or was he on salary he was hourly making twelve dollars and eighty cents an hour plus tips about five hundred dollars a week at forty hours so two thousand a month about twentyfour thousand dollars a year as opposed to mr voglers ninety thousand dollars yes thats about right mr schermer in your professional opinion was mr voglers salary as a percentage of the coffee shops gross income defensible as a viable business practice hardy knew he could object but also knew that it wouldnt do him any good schermer with the credentials of a recognized expert witness was allowed to give his opinion the jury didnt have to believe it but the court would permit the testimony he sat his hand on mayas arm and both of them seethed no schermer said it was an irregularity of a dramatic nature so would the business running on this model be sustainable over the long run in my opinion no not given the businesss gross income and this salary and as a forensic accountant does this type of irregularity raise a red flag for you of a certain kind of financial malfeasance yes it does and what is that most commonly it would be money laundering could you explain to the jury how that works certainly schermer turned in his chair to face the panel lets say that there is an unreported source of illicit income in a coffee shop such as bbw such as the sale of marijuana for example an employee can ring up any number of coffee drinks on the cash register and not actually pour any of these drinks so that in the course of a day you might have an extra two or three hundred dollars or more or less on the till then you simply supply the cash into the register that youve made on your illicit business and entered as regular coffee income and it becomes part of the businesss legitimate cash flow now the dirty money is socalled clean or laundered money and since you can account for the income it can be redistributed as dividends profit sharing or salary or salary stier repeated loving this and so it seemed was the jury now mr schermer he went on is there any way to reliably identify the existence of this sort of moneylaundering scheme yes there is thats what my work essentially entails can you explain well in our example above i think we can all see that there is actually less coffee poured than there is a record of so by comparing the amount of raw coffee beans actually bought by the business with the income that would be produced by the sale of that coffee cup by cup we can pretty accurately determine if there is a discrepancy and did you find such a discrepancy in your analysis of bbw yes and to what extent well based on the actual amount of coffee beans bought by weightweve seen this on one of our graphs if you rememberthe maximum gross income from the sale of coffee drinks over the past fiscal year should have been no greater than about three hundred and seventy thousand dollars as opposed to a reported four hundred and sixtytwo thousand so a difference of ninetytwo thousand dollars almost precisely dylan voglers salary thats correct thank you mr schermer no further questions he turned to hardy your witness but braun interrupted mr hardy as its getting close to noon i suggest we hold off beginning your crossexamination until after our lunch recess is that acceptable to you thats fine your honor all right then braun tapped her gavel courts adjourned until onethirty stier might have simply decided to ignore the ruiz murder as a factor in mayas case but as head of homicide glitsky could not do that even if he was of a mind to which he most assuredly was not over the past several months while abe had been perpetually brooding over his sons accident and ultimate prognosis and his own karma hardy had grown unhappily accustomed to his new lowaffect persona to the point that nowmeeting with him behind a curtain in a private booth at samsthe full flower of evident rage emanating from his friends demeanor struck him as perhaps actually dangerous to abes own health maybe but more to his inspectors the source of this anger and if you can imagine he was saying with a guttural intensity now schiff is all bent out of shape because i didnt put them on ruiz after what theyve done to vogler and preslee they should be happy theyre not busted down to robbery or even patrol learn a few of the basics over again hardy smeared butter on some sourdough maybe you could drop by the courtroom after were done here and share some of these thoughts with braun she needs to hear them im not saying your clients innocent diz no of course not you just asked me here to talk secretly because no one else would have lunch with you and i cant say that i blame them although im a little surprised about treya youd think being your wife and all shed at least feel sorry for you he popped the bread into his mouth why did schiff want ruiz and bracco too i assume why do you think obviously because its bbw again and if thats the case theyve got doubts about maya no they dont not even one dont even ask them how about you not so much doubt about maya diz glitsky tipped up his water glass and chewed some ice i just dont know how they moved the case even this far along you dont know i know its jerry glass and schiff they got the whole thing out of whack as a righteous murder much less two it hasnt made any sense from the beginning not that maya couldnt have actually done these guys but theres never been any case evidencewise you know this well at least im thinking it now i just wonder what else is going to pop thats going to make the detail look even more incompetent you mean like lori bradford close enough have you talked to her not yet but wyatt hunt did i put her on my witness list which is great for the good guys but not for you schiff and bracco knew all about her and decided she wasnt important thats what i gathered i think though she might be glitsky sat back as the tuxedoed ultimate professional waiter drew back the curtain and took their ordershardys everytimehecamehere sand dabs and a crab louis for glitsky when hed gone a small silence settled until hardy said so you didnt invite me down here to help me get maya off true so so the bottom line is the case is starting to look like a loser for us certainly the preslee side as it should be okay granted maybe thats the problem when things start out so sloppy and get all political im more or less aware of that abe what do you want glitsky took a beat i want to know if youve got something i need to know on ruiz like what if i knew i wouldnt need to ask would i if i do know something hows it going to help my client it probably wont hardy broke a grin wow you really make it tempting what do you have so far essentially nothing if he hadnt worked at bbw wed be at absolute zero glitsky chewed another piece of ice as you may have surmised this goes a little up the food chain hardy considered for a second remained deadpan against the urge to show his surprise and pleasure kathy a nod backstage of course and always deniable but through clarence then batiste the da and the chief of police respectively serious highlevel pressure from above her mayorship has made her case especially after hearing about this lori bradford fiasco yesterday that somehow a solid investigation into another bbwrelated murder will set maya free im not so sure of that it might help on vogler though i think shes going down for that and she wont need it on preslee but whatever kathy thinks ruiz is going to open a door and shes more or less dared us to do something on it and fast or maybe a head or two will roll yours not impossible maybe even the chiefs too who you remember serves at the mayors pleasure the waiter knocked opened the drapes and delivered their plates as the curtain closed hardy said to glitsky so where were we kathy west and eugenio ruiz hardy forked a bite of fish taking his time finally he made his decision and came out with his answer i might have something might i like that i knew you would hence my careful locution i might have something if youve got something to trade probably not but what if you find something based on what i give you i want it too glitsky didnt hesitate an instant shaking his head from side to side i cant do that fine diz no argument abe you cant do it you cant do it you mean if it helps your case i mean whatever i cant you know i cant hardy chewed and swallowed not my issue my issue is my client what if it doesnt help her ill be the judge of that sorry but those are the rules he hesitated look if its any help give it to stier too i just wouldnt like to see whatever it might be disappear the way lori bradford did hardy by now unexpectedly hopeful at the possibility of having the resources of the entire police department working on his behalf nevertheless didnt want to push he had the cards here and glitsky either would recognize that fact or not he took a sip of his club soda pushed some buttered capers onto his fish it would be discoverable glitsky said hardy shook his head before that under the tableunder this very table if you wantbut before it goes through stier and company from what you say jackmans going to back you and sos batiste theyre my troops he said bracco and schiff i undermine their case i get it though one could argue that its already undermined and they deserve whatever happens but again abe not my problem and hey what i have might be nothing it took glitsky another full minute maybe more hardy eating with gusto and apparent contentment tasting none of it finally glitsky capitulated you want me to sign an affadavit or is my word good enough hardy put down his fork took a steadying breath against the rush theres a guy who may or may not be named paco who knew both levon preslee and dylan vogler back in college and who showed up from time to time at bbw to buy his weed but not since october may or may not be named paco now dismissively thats what weve been negotiating about hardy shrugged its what i got abe ruiz was looking out for him what do you mean ruiz was going to get in touch with wyatt hunt if he came back into bbw and by the way it looks like the whole crew down there was getting cut in yeah were assuming that well be talking to all of them this time instead of a select few but this paco is he on voglers list no no of course not glitsky said he wouldnt be howd you find out about him well ruiz first then maya glitskys eyes narrowed she knew him too knew of him the name back at usf he hung out with vogler and preslee andmaybekilled a guy in a liquor store they held up this stopped glitsky midbite maybe hardy shrugged it was what it was where i dont know except it was probably in the midninetiesninetyfive or six it might have been in the papers there would have been an investigation maybe a suspect knock yourself out hardy said did paco know ruiz was looking out for him no idea anybody working there could have told him though glitsky put down his fork youre not making this up not any of it after lunch hardy stood and approached the forensic accountant in the witness chair seemingly as relaxed as hed been all morning mr schermer he began you have given a great deal of technical testimony about accounting practices working with numbers are any of these numbers subject to a margin for error well yes of course some to a greater extent than others but generally yes referring to the analysis you offered on bbws gross income versus the amount of raw coffee bought over the last fiscal year would this have a greater or lesser margin for error than some of the other calculations you performed and shared with the jury rather on the high side id think it is after all an estimate an estimate with a margin for error rather on the high side i see and is there an industry standard that enumerates the margin for error in this kind of analysis here for the first time schermers face creased into something like a frown im not sure what you mean well i mean you take a certain weight amount of a raw productcoffee in this caseand you do an analysis that shows it takes say a pound of coffee to make a certain amount of cups and then you deduce that the business didnt buy enough raw coffee to make as many cups as it claimed it sold isnt that the basic idea basically yes well then can we assume that this type of analysis is a standard tool in the industry in a general way yes with other products you mean yes how about with coffee is this a test with a long history of analysis and comparison with other similar tests well no this was specific to this one business bbw specific to this one business do you mean to say that other licensed and accredited forensics accountants such as yourself and in fact the organization to which you belong have not established benchmarks to measure the reliability of these analyses well no not exactly but no is sufficient thank you mr schermer now can you please tell the jury a little about the methodology you employed to measure the amount of coffee needed to make a cup at bbw finally given a chance to simply discourse on his specialty again schermer leaned back in the chair and faced the panel well i gathered information from other coffee shops in the city both chain and individually owned and took the average of the number of cups of coffee produced from every hundred pounds of beans how many coffee shops did you use for your comparison ten and how many different kinds of beans were represented in your answer i dont know what you mean well beans come from a lot of different places south america africa jamaica and so on so what kinds of beans were represented in your sample as i recall most of them were from colombia and is that the sole source of bbws beans colombia no i dont think so they came from all over the world did they not yes i believe so all right and do you know how many bags were delivered from all over the world over the course of the fiscal year to bbw i dont know that exactly perhaps hundreds but several thousand pounds of coffee wouldnt you say yes at least and did you test to make sure that all of that coffee had the same density that is approximate number of beans per pound uh no so the representative sample you used for your analysis might have been stores that used more or fewer beans to make a cup isnt that true i guess so yes and in fact bbw was a very popular coffeehouse was it not yes could that popularity have been based on the flavor of its coffee that is that its coffee was stronger or more mild than the shops you used in your sample i have no way of knowing that all right then hardy glanced over to the jury all of whom were with him following the crossexamination with none of the more common postlunch torpor lets talk for a minute if we may about the coffee made from these beans is there a standard bbw uses for various strengths of coffee strong medium weak i used medium which is their house blend strength but do they serve other coffees of different strengths yes both stronger and weaker yes which is why i used medium to be about average but do you in fact know the percentage of coffee actually brewed there that is weak medium or strong schermer took a breath no longer enjoying himself at all no and what about espresso what about it it was a rather large percentage of the coffee sold at bbw was it not yes it was do you know the exact percentage mr schermer no and espresso is roasted differently than other blends of coffee is it not yes hardy hammering the man mercilessly decided to back off for a moment lest to the jury he come across as unsympathetic he walked back to his desk took a sip of water gave half a nod first to his client and then to joel townshend and harlen fisk sitting next to one another in the front row he pulled his legal pad over and pretended to read from it then turned and came back to his place in the center of the courtroom mr schermer at the beginning of this crossexamination testimony you said that your analysis of raw coffee bought versus coffee served was merely an estimate with a margin for error isnt that true yes but there is no industry standard that defines an acceptable margin for error for an analysis of coffee shops is there not for this particular comparison correct would you care now to estimate for the jury and after the questions ive just put to you how high the margin for error could go on an analysis such as this with different density beans and differing strengths of various coffee drinks i dont know if i could say ten percent twenty percent yes yes i suppose in fact since there is no industry standard on this margin for error for this particular test it could even be higher could it not in theory i suppose it could how about fifty percent could it be as much as that well i really dont think so you dont think so hardy repeated with just enough emphasis on think to make his point to the jury thats correct i dont think so okay then lets go with the twenty percent that you admit is a possible margin of error now if i could just ask you for a moment to revisit the actual income numbers you gave in your direct testimony hardy went back to his desk quickly and this time brought back with him his yellow legal pad you said the amount of raw coffee bought should have produced income from coffee drinks sold of three hundred and seventy thousand dollars and instead bbws books showed an income of four hundred sixtytwo thousand dollars isnt that right yes and would you agree sir that twenty percent of three hundred seventy thousand dollarsthe margin for error weve been discussingis seventyfour thousand dollars that sounds right it is right sir which means that according to your own calculations bbws coffee drink income from raw coffee bought could have easily been as high as four hundred fortyfour thousand dollars or only sixteen thousand dollars short of the reported income isnt that right thoroughly dispirited by now schermer stared down at the floor in front of him it sounds like it well mr schermer hardy said given your direct testimony outlining sixtyseven simple accounting errors does a sixteenthousanddollar discrepancy on a gross income of between three and four hundred thousand dollars strike you now as necessarily indicative of money laundering stier started to rise but before he could object the witness replied not necessarily no the judge let the answer stand and hardy whirled smiling no further questions stier had no redirect mr schermer braun said you may step down mr stier your next witness stier threw a look over at hardy back up to the judge your honor the people rest braun nodded once and looked up very well mr hardy i believe youll have a motion yes your honor all right ladies and gentlemen of the jury im going to give you a longer recess than usual please remember my admonition not to form or express any opinion about the case or discuss it among yourselves or with anyone else until the matter is submitted to you come back in fortyfive minutes ten minutes later with braun back on the bench hardy made his his motion to dismiss the charges on both vogler and preslee normally this is a pro forma motion made at the end of the prosecution case in every criminal trial but at least as to the preslee count hardy actually thought he might have something to talk about your honor he said no reasonable juror could possibly convict my client particularly of the levon preslee murder stier defended the charges in spite of inspector schiffs admission about the lack of physical evidence in the preslee slaying there is no net change in the prosecution case admittedly it is light on physical evidence but as you know there are other kinds of evidence and they can be compelling eyewitness testimony for example consciousness of guilt this is circumstantial but compelling evidence yes your honor but the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove not just that maya was in the hallway but that she was inside the apartment and more than that that when she was in there she killed levon preslee they have nothing remotely approaching that you dont just convict the person with a motive who happens to be closest to the scene of the crime especially in a case like this where you have no idea who else might have had a motive or for that matter who else had been inside i dont have to prove that maya wasnt inside that apartment mr stier has to prove she was and there simply is no such proof letting the jury consider this evidence in this count would not be only an error with respect to the levon preslee charge it would inevitably taint any verdict on the vogler count hardy was pushing it pretty hard here normally a judge could figure that if the evidence was really as weak as the defense claimed the jury would simply acquit as to that count and the defense would have nothing to appeal but hardy was taking that out away from braun by tying the charges together hardy was arguing that the judge would be tainting any verdict on vogler even if the jury acquitted on preslee so braun was actually going to have to make this decision or expect to hear about it on appeal later hardy had her in a corner and she knew it she took in the situation with a reptilian silence her eyes closing to mere slits turning to her recorder she said ann im hoping you got all that yes your honor mr stier comment your honor the prosecution rejects mr hardys efforts to tie these counts together like that each count stands on its own each count is supported by the evidence and thats how the court should rule nobody has put maya inside the place your honor hardy said you cant ask the jury to decide she was there if theres nothing putting her there i can do what i want in my courtroom mr hardy i could get up on my desk and do a tap dance if i want to yes of course your honor i didnt mean you couldnt thats what you said mr hardy im sorry your honor i misspoke apology noted and now braun surprised him all right mr hardy you raise a colorable point give me a moment please she came forward and put her elbows onto her desk her fingers templed over her nose her eyes closed finally her shoulders heaved and she brought her head back up this issue is too complex to decide on the spur of the moment court is in recess for another half hour ill have a decision for you before the jury is seated again hardy had a message on his cell phone that craig chiurco was outside in the hall having escorted lori bradford down on her subpoena as a courtesyservice with a smile from freeman farrell hardy roake now with the court in recess hardy walked out through the gallery accepting congratulations from joel and harlen and some of his associates whod shown up as they usually did when one of the bosses was in a big trial to see how it was done all and sundry agreed that he had just kicked some serious ass with schermer and between that crossexamination his lunch at sams with glitsky and brauns unexpected consideration of his motion to dismiss hardy had to fight to keep himself from getting cocky it still and always was going to come down to the jury and without another suspect for them to even consider maya remained in a precarious place hardy had to get paco or someone like him into the testimony somehow and now with ruiz dead that was going to be problematic mayas purported knowledge of the man was hearsay anyway and even if it werent she certainly couldnt put him at bbw or with either of the victims outside in the hallway chiurco sat on one of the wooden benches with a whitehaired woman dressed in a light blue pantsuit the two appeared to be in a somewhat animated discussion enjoying each others company as hardy approached seeing him chiurco got up and gave him his signed statement from their conversation of the night before then touched the womans arm and introduced her thank you for coming down on such short notice hardy said thanks to this young man for bringing me hardy grinned ill see he gets a raise right away and did you say dismas she asked dismas the good thief thats him though too few people seem to know it i dont believe ive ever actually known a dismas well you do now i hope its good for you youre cute she said so are you hardy sat down next to her has craig here explained what wed like to talk to you about in the courtroom what i saw or heard that morning you remember the date dont you of course october twentyseventh two thousand seven to be exact exact is good we like exact her eyes brightened with the adventure and two shots one at six oh eight or nine and one at six ten very good he leaned in toward her i was hoping to call you to be a witness pretty much right away if thats all right with you of course its all right with me thats why im here good now ive already heard what you said in your talk with mr hunt and that will be the basis of your testimony but if you dont mind maybe we could just take a minute here before we go inside and run over some details sure of course she said that would be fine in spite of the glimmer of hope hed begun to entertain about his motion to dismiss hardy wasnt particularly shocked nor even greatly disappointed when braun came back to the bench and ruled against him denying his motion in its entirety still he was buoyed by his belief that lori bradford was going to be an important and powerful witness offering a completely alternative version of the bare facts of the case he had given some thought to the phraseology and tenor of his opening questions wanting not only to get to this witnesss information but to alert the jury to the homicide inspectors wily and discreditable ways now already having established a solid rapport with her one that he hoped the jury would recognize as between equalsas opposed to a young man condescending to a senile witnesshe began his questioning mrs bradford where do you live i live in a secondstory apartment on ashbury street here in the city on the west side of the street right up from haight its also she added coached by hardy right across the street from the alley that runs behind bay beans can you see that alley from your apartment the first twenty or thirty feet of it out the living room and dining room windows yes now mrs bradford do you remember anything unusual and specific about the morning of saturday october twentyseventh yes and what was that at a few minutes after six oclock i was in bed in the back of the apartment but already awake for the day when i heard a loud report like a firecracker although for some reason i remember thinking that it might be a gunshot so i got up and was in the hallway going to the front windows and thenbangthere was another one about a minute later and what did you do then i got to the window and looked down into the street and across to the alley and did you see anything unusual down there no nothing it was still pretty dark out did you call nine one one not then no there didnt seem to be any emergency it was just the two noises although of course when the police cars started getting there i realized something must have happened by then it was too late to call nine one one but you did eventually call the police did you not yes a couple of days later and why was that the delay i mean well mostly because the news reports were all saying that there had only been one shot and i thought theyd want to know that id heard two of them you heard two shots yes lori god bless her added the word hardy had recommended definitely raising his eyebrows for the jurys benefit he went on and so you called the police to tell them about this information yes and did you speak to some inspectors yes two of them came by the apartment and we talked about it you told them about the two shots did you yes i did and what was their comment about that if any they thanked me and said that the information might be enough to change the entire theory of the case i see and then did you hear from them soon after that no no a pause for the effect not even back in november after theyd arrested the defendant and they were preparing for the preliminary hearing no and not as this case went to trial no hmm when the inspectors did speak to you at your home did they tell you that they didnt believe your testimony or your eyewitness account objection irrelevant goes to the witnesss state of mind your honor this didnt make a lot of sense but hardy had learned from the testimony of jansey ticknor that braun didnt have a real good grasp of what this hearsay exception meant he figured if stier could use it to get stuff in he might be able to as well it worked overruled hardy asked permission of the judge and then repeated his question mrs bradford did the inspectors tell you that they didnt believe your testimony or your eyewitness account no to the contrary as ive said they talked about it changing the theory of the case and yet they never called you back or served you with a subpoena or asked you to come down here and testify in court correct objection asked and answered sustained thank you mrs bradford i have no further questions stier was on his feet before hardy was back at his counsel table mrs bradford he began did the inspectors you spoke to ask you if youd seen anything in the street on the morning of mr voglers death yes and did you in fact see anything down in the street or in the alley no as ive already said now as to the noises you heard are you familiar with the sound of gunfire no not particularly in your testimony with mr hardy you said that while you were in bed you heard a report and this is a direct quote like a firecracker unquote isnt that true yes it is i thought it might have been a firecracker or a backfire and yet you told mr hardy that you definitely heard two gunshots did you not i did and here stier in his enthusiasm and lack of respect for this witness made his big error so let me ask you this how could you know they were gunshots hardy had asked mrs bradford that very question in the hall and had fervently hoped stier would be foolish enough to ask it in front of the jury well they were identical sounds and we know for sure that one of them was a gunshot from the alley across the street dont we thats when mr vogler was killed wasnt it right when i heard the shots rule number one hardy thoughtyou talk to every single witness yourself every single time hardy saw stiers shoulders slump as some of the jurors came forward and the import of this testimony hit home he turned hesitantly toward the panel stopped came back to the witness he finally said but can you say for certain that the second sound was in fact a gunshot and not a backfire or even a firecracker she thought about this for a second i can say for sure that the two sounds were exactly alike if the first one was a gunshot the second one was a gunshot and vice versa stier decided to quit before he made it worse thank you maam lori bradford got up from the witness chair and they really did sound like gunshots she added with a believability and sincerity that cemented her complete defeat of the big ugly the three partnershardy farrell roakeand wyatt hunt were at the freeman building after the close of business gathered around the large round table in the solarium considering options the overhead lighting was on full against the encroachment of the misty darkness that gathered outside the glass panes a bottle of red wine stood open on the table although ginas choice was her oban and hunt next to her was having an anchor steam hardy was running out of time if he wanted to get any sort of other dude paco or anyone else into the consciousness of the jury before ruiz had been killed hed half planned to call him as a witness both on the paco question and to counter the allegations that there had ever had been anything romantic going on between dylan and maya but now of course that option had been foreclosed by events other witnesses for mayas defense were few if any and far between this was why hardy had grabbed so desperately at lori bradford at least here was a real bone for the jury to gnaw at nothing in the prosecutions case contemplated or explained a twoshot scenario and that fact if taken as fact created a glaring hole if any jury member cared to look hard in that direction but since there was no second bullet nor casing nor even gun for that matter there was no guarantee nor even a likelihood that this would happen and as for maya her alibis were flimsy and unsupported nobody had seen her either kill anybody or not kill anybody and there were still the huge and unresolved questions of why she had been at both murder scenes the time in dylans case and the location in levons pretty well eliminated any consideration of the idea that shed simply been in the respective neighborhoods shed gone to both places on purpose apparently summonedor setting upthe victims and if she hadnt gone by to kill them then why ive got to call her hardy said let the jury hear her story maybe im missing something gina said but what is her story i mean does she even have any explanation for why she was at these places dylan called her and then levon called her gina sipped her drink and she just went no reason when was the last time shed even seen levon i know hardy said its weak weaks one word for it farrell leaned back in his chair you might just want to go to argument i mean the theory is that theyve got to prove something and you dont hardy reached for his glass id just like to give em something anything at all well hunt said there was lori and god love her hardy replied but two shots kind of goes nowhere without another story to go with them and that i dont have how about glitsky hunt asked hardy had informed them all of his lunchtime deal with abe but like everything else about this case it was looking like anything abe could bring to the party was going to be a day late and a dollar short were supposed to talk again tonight but if he had anything live and pressing i think id have heard maybe you could call the homicide guys abe put on ruiz gina offered talk about another weedrelated murder at bbw this one while mayas in jail and couldnt have had anything to do with it theres an element of doubt something else going on at least thats an actual thought hardy said although abe would have me killed if i called his guys in the middle of this yeah but at least youd be killed by professionals farrell said so it wouldnt hurt much he went on braun wouldnt let it in anyway ruiz is six months removed from our victims here thats a tough sell he took a healthy drink of red wine im back to closing argument youve just got to argue that theres no evidence thats all you can do well not to get picky gina said but there is evidence theres mayas gun her fingerprints on it fingerprints on levons doorknob she shrugged its not much granted but its hard to explain away any other jurisdiction in the state given the motives i think she goes down here maybe youll get your one juror but on argument alone i wouldnt get my hopes up well on that cheery note hardy tipped his wineglass up and pushed himself back from the table im on all my phones all night if anybody gets any ideas the clerk id bet glitsky said was named julio gomez twentyfour years old when he died in ninetyfive the place was ocean liquors glitsky going out of his way to stop by hardys home had interrupted his friends seemingly unending perusal of his trial binders and now just past nine oclock they stood in the kitchen waiting for the microwave to beep for glitskys tea was there an investigation back then no glitsky said sarcastically homicide just decided not to look into this particular murder it seemed like too much work a beat of course we opened an investigation and and we closed it about a month later no suspects not a one he pulled an envelope from his inside jacket pocket i copied the file and brought it around for you though as you can see its a little thin then gesturing back to the dining room where hardys binders were spread out on the table not that it looks like you need much more reading material i gather thats your case in there what there is of it the microwaves timer sounded and hardy crossed over took the cup out and handed it to his friend santé how about witnesses witness one you can see him in there old asian guy coming out of a bar across the street twelvethirty on a tuesday night and the fog was in evidently heavy plus hed had a few anyway he heard the shot saw somebody run out of the store get in a car then take off he pointed down at the envelope its all in there yeah but so a driver more than one guy two guys waiting in the car he doesnt say and i know what youre thinking that this is your paco it could be is this the only liquor store shootup in those years no there were actually six of them homicides but believe it or not we got four of the guys all solos although to be fair two of em got shot themselves by guys they shot behind the counter which made it a little easier the other one was a woman never caught that left whoever killed this guy gomez maybe your paco after all hardy nodded with satisfaction thats pretty thorough you ought to do this stuff for a living glitsky blew over his tea im motivated but none of this ancient history is helping much with ruiz you havent got anything well weve talked to most of the workers at bbw thats going to go on for a while but so far not much just everybody shocked that ruiz could have been involved in drugs hardy chuckled i can imagine but none of this helps maya either i never thought it would sitting at his dining room table having already scrutinized his binders all the way through again until he was nearly blind hardy accepted a kiss on the cheek from his wife at around tenthirty and told her hed be up in a while this is going to be over soon isnt it frannie asked one way or the other a day or two thatd be neat ive been thinking it really wouldnt be so bad having a husband again i know its why ive stayed married to you to have a husband i know she kissed him again ill probably still love you good thatd be good but in reality barely hearing her kissing the air in front of her face reaching for another pass at one of the binders nothing nothing nothing he closed the black binder and stood going back into the kitchen he opened the refrigerator closed it back up cricked his back and saw glitskys envelope on the counter this gomez killing thirteen or fourteen years ago wasnt his case glitsky had given him the summary and even if it had been paco so what so hed left the envelope and gone back in to try one last time to find something in his binders standing at the counter he pulled out the half dozen or so pagesincident report copies of some pictures of the deceased autopsy ballistics two pages of testimony from mr leland lee pretty much as glitsky had described it more nothing he started through the pages again his routine more slowly this time eyes burning he forced himself to read every line wait a minute wait he turned back to first the autopsy then the ballistics report the bullet that had killed julio gomez was acaliber a handwritten barely readable scrawled notation by an unidentified ballistics lab worker read probably glock ballistics markings unidentifiable okay he had to make some assumptions but they seemed warranted and what other choice did he have anyway somehow these longago and nearinvisible events and relationships he was sure were at the heart of the case that had consumed his life for the past six months it was all about perhaps not maya at all but certainly dylan and levon and the mysterious paco back at the computer in his family room he suddenly realized that although hunt and chiurco had looked into them he himself had never really pursued any of the details in the robbery that dylan and levon had been convicted of and why should he have it was at best tangential to mayas situation and again in the far distant past but now he suddenly realized what he should have considered a couple of days ago when hed first become aware of the existence of pacothat if there had been a trial back then or even a plea bargain there would have been both witnesses for the prosecution and possibly friends for the defense friends and witnesses whose association with dylan and levon might have extended back beyond when maya had met and hung out with them back when paco had been in their crowd and as a real human being not a nom de guerre in fact he pulled his legal pad around and wrote a note to call wyatt hunt and leave him a message and instructions for tomorrow as soon as hed finished his computer search here hed just realized that cheryl biehl and the other three female witnesses that stier had never called might fit into this same categoryof people whod been at usf back then and had known dylan and levon and who might have known paco under his real name but in the meanwhile he could do a quick search for the case that had involved dylan and levon and armed with that he might be able to have hunt or chiurco identify the actual case files the officers involved other witnesses he went to google and typed in dylan voglers name recalling even as the short page came up that wyatt hunt had told him that there was little mention of vogler on the net other than the recent details about his death shifting over to california inmate record search he again entered dylans name and there he was at corcoran state prison in for robbery likewise here was levon preslee in the system starting two months into dylans time did any of this mean anything or help hardy in any way certainly these facts told him nothing about the actual crime theyd committed together he spent another fifteen minutes or so searching the various criminal databases to which he had access he found dylan and levon in several of them what he didnt find was any indication that they had committed their crime together or had gone to trial together that information had apparently vanished into the mists of time and if that was the case suddenly staring at the screen the issue that had nagged at him for days came into focus with a startling clarity bringing with it a jolt of adrenaline so powerful that it threw hardy back into his chair suddenly breathless blood pounding in his ears he brought his hand up to rest over his heart thought it all through beginning to end it had to be it had to be there was no other option and late though it was he reached for the telephone hardy didnt know if it was because of her recent albeit clandestine interaction with the da and the chief of police but for whatever reason kathy west with her attendant entourage was back in the first row of the gallery when hardy entered the courtroom from the holding cell with his client sitting between joel townshend and harlen fisk she had also brought her trail of reporters and once again the gallery was filled to overflowing in this friday mornings paper the mayor had gone public with her suspicions completely unfounded by any evidence hardy had seen or heard aboutand hed heard plenty by now from glitskythat the ruiz murder was intimately connected to the events surrounding mayas trial and the deaths of dylan vogler and levon preslee and this of course had ratcheted up the sense that something dramatic was going to take place in the courtroom today something perhaps new evidence that would remove once and for all the townshendfiskwest family connection from the slanders of the past several months and the mayor wanted to be there for it to show her face for her niece if for nothing else kathy west didnt believe that maya had done anything wrong and she was going to make sure that the jury understood that clearly before they went in to deliberate but such was kathys gravity in the city that the mere rumor much less the actual fact of her presence again in the courtroom served also to draw in a host of the politically involved the suddenly interested the professionally concerned the simply curiousda clarence jackman police chief frank batiste us attorney jerry glass glitsky even the wheelchairbound chronicle citytalk columnist jeffrey elliot gina roake sat halfway back next to wyatt hunt ashenfaced and presumably as sleepdeprived as hardy himself catching hardys questioning eye hunt gave a short and solemn incline of his head the entire gallery sounded to hardys ear like a race car loud and thrumming at the pole the jury collectively seemed to be mesmerized by the energy level the shifting planes of volume intensity and nerves playing out in front of them at the prosecution table and since debra schiff had already given her witness testimony and it was allowed stier had brought her back in as moral support to sit next to him and the two of them were headtohead in conversation as hardy maya and the bailiff crossed in front of them and then after a few words of forbidden greeting to her family members in front of the starstruck and forbearing bailiff maya was at last in her seat and hardy was arranging his papers when the clerk entered and clearing his throat spoke up loudly ladies and gentlemen department twentyfive of the superior court of california is now in session judge marian braun presiding all rise getting three new names approved onto his witness list had entailed another small battle with braun and stier this morning in the judges chambers but in the end hardy argued that he had discovered new evidence that in the interests of justice the jury would need to hear in order to reach the correct verdict of course this announcement had aroused stiers deep suspicion and ire and hed demanded to know the substance of the prospective testimony hardy acknowledged that in the first casejessica cunninghamit was fingerprint evidence and in the second jennifer foremanstier already had had access to everything she might know since she was on his original witness list indeed she was one of the three uncalled old college friends of maya finally hardy said you know chiurco hes one of my investigators and heres what hes going to say and he handed the prosecutor chiurcos short signed statement stier grumbled for a moment that he should have gotten these witnesses at the beginning of the trial but everybody knew that this was a nonissue the witnesses would be permitted to testify but braun warned him hardy had better be sure he was talking about introducing new evidence and not spending a lot of time rehashing butthe bottom linehe was going to be able to get it all in and now his palms wet his mouth dry hardy lifted his exhausted body from his chair the defense would call jessica cunningham the bailiff disappeared out through the back door of the courtroom and returned a moment later with a young woman in a police officers uniform she made her way up the center aisle and into the bullpen where she took the oath and then moved around to the witness seat ms cunningham hardy began will you tell the jury what you do for a living please sure she turned to look at the panel im a technician in the police departments lab here in the city in that capacity do you have a special expertise i do i do fingerprint analysis identifying people by their fingerprints is that right yes and how long have you been doing that about six years for a few more moments hardy established cunninghams credentials as an expert in this field then he began to bring it closer to home did you have occasion several months ago to analyze the fingerprints found in the home of one of the victims in this case levon preslee yes i did can you tell the jury what you found of course this testimony had already been cursorily addressed in the testimony of debra schiff but now he had the lab technician herself on the stand and a completely different approach cunningham enthusiastic and professional nodded and again spoke directly to the jury well as in most locations we found many fingerprints how many separate prints in all did you locate oh maybe fifteen or so could you identify any of them yes six came back from the victim were you able to identify any of the other eight or nine a few yes but not all no is it unusual to find fingerprints at the scene of a crime that you cannot connect to any individual no and why is that because first not everyone has their fingerprints on file secondly sometimes or really quite often the fingerprints are not clear enough to match the computerized records and finally there are a limited number of databases we typically use to try to get our matches most of the time for example were trying to match a fingerprint to a known suspect and in that case its a simple oneonone crosscheck did you compare the defendants fingerprints to the remaining unidentified fingerprints at mr preslees yes of course trying to see if any of those belonged to the defendant right and just to restate it for the jury you did not find any of the defendants fingerprints at mr preslees did you no hardy threw a gratuitous look over his shoulder at stiers table where he and schiff sat in miserable proximity now ms cunningham as far as you knew back in november when you ran these comparisons did you compare the unknown prints to anyones besides the victim mr preslee and the defendant maya townshend yes the other victim dylan vogler and mr preslees friend brandon lawrence so two more people yes could you identify any of your unknown prints from the crime scene to any of those yes two of those fingerprints came back to brandon lawrence leaving you with seven unidentified prints correct correct were you able to identify any of your remaining seven latents actually we identified four of them because they were in the criminal database which is our primary tool so there were three that remained unidentifiable is that right yes good now ms cunninghamhardy closing in on ithave you had a recent opportunity to revisit the fingerprints you originally lifted at mr preslees home yes i have and when was that just this morning hardy felt some sonic energy begin to shoot through the gallery but he spoke over it and how did that come about lieutenant glitsky of homicide reached me at home this morning and asked me if i would come in early and go back to the unidentified fingerprints and compare them to a specific other single set of fingerprints from another database to see if there was a match and was there a match yes there was you mean there was a specific individual who had left his fingerprints in mr preslees home and whom this investigation had not discovered until just this morning is that right thats correct yes braun gaveled down the now nearly constant if lowpitched hum of the gallery after silence had been restored hardy came back at the witness ms cunningham did lieutenant glitsky ask you to review any other fingerprint findings this morning yes and what were they there was a partial fingerprint on the brass bullet casing that was picked up at the scene of the vogler murder a partial print what does that mean actually most prints are partial prints its rare on a forensic sample to get an entire fingerprint from somebody but this print was a smaller section even than most and can that be useful for purposes of identity often not and why is that because its incomplete certainly a computer cant read it so you have to have the known prints of an individual you have to do a manual comparison and you have to find enough points of identification on the forensic sample to compare to your known prints now lieutenant glitsky asked you to run a manual test against the known fingerprint of a single individual whose prints were in levon preslees home did he not yes did you find a match im sorry the testing is not completed as i said its a very small sample and i just havent had enough time yet hardy would have given his left arm to know the final results of this test but this was it if he was going to spring this trap it was going to happen right now before anyone got wind of what he was up to he had to press ahead all right so now ms cunningham can you give us the name whose fingerprint you identified in mr preslees home yes i can and whose fingerprint was it one of your investigators mr hardy a craig chiurco while the bailiff went to get the next witness stier asked braun if counsel could approach and at her impatient bidding both attorneys got up and walked to the bench what do you want now mr stier braun asked clearly at the limit of her forbearance your honor stier began i havent got a clue as to what mr hardy is up to this seems irrelevant immaterial and just plain a waste of time im going to wrap this up your honor within the hour two more witnesses and im done turning and hoping to provoke an already rattled stier hardy smiled sweetly i have to give you the discovery counselor i dont have to explain it to you thats enough you two braun snapped nearly loud enough for the jury to hear im tired of this bickering mr hardy youre going to call your witnesses and were going to get this thing done return to your counsel tables hardy wasted no time calling his second witness and by now as he approached the witness seat his fatigue had dissipated jennifer foreman had been another one of the usf cheerleadersfriends of maya and dylan back in the daythat stier had originally put on his witness list and then elected not to call for direct testimony late last night wyatt hunt had worked his magic and in spite of the hour had persuaded her to talk to him now on the stand and obviously dealing with a serious case of nerves she appeared not to have had a great deal of luck getting back to sleep in the intervening hours or maybe it was the fact that hardy and hunt had asked that she check in upstairs then wait at lou the greeks accompanied by gina roake so that she wouldnt come into contact with any other witnesses until she was called to the stand still she came across as poised well dressed competent and always a plus very attractive as these excheerleaders tended to be a good solid witness if hardy could direct her where he needed to go hardy stood five feet in front of her and gave her a reassuring smile mrs foreman he began you were a classmate of the defendant maya townshend at usf in the midnineties were you not yes i was were you in the same class no i was a couple of years ahead of her but you were friends were you not yes i thought so we were cheerleaders together and during the time you were cheerleaders did you also spend time with both of the victims in this case dylan vogler and levon preslee yes i did did you ever personally witness them smoking marijuana your honor stier was standing up mr hardy has promised us that he has new evidence but this is all old news and irrelevant but by now after the previous witness braun was fully engaged and inclined to let hardy go on even without a strict evidentiary base hed already presented compelling fingerprint evidence that stier hadnt been able to supply and even if the meaning of that was still questionable there was no doubt about its possible relevance the objection is overruled counselor go ahead mr hardy thank you your honor now mrs foreman should i repeat the question no did i ever witness dylan and levon smoking dope yes of course many times here mrs foreman broke a small chuckle pretty much all the time hardy let the moment of levity run its short course mrs foreman how did you meet dylan and levon we had a mutual friend in my class who everybody called paco he turned me on to them she shrugged and added to the jury if youll pardon the phrase he was kind of the leader of the other younger guys and this paco to your personal knowledge this friend and leader of dylan and levon was also a regular user of marijuana was he not yes mrs foreman youve said that everybody called this person by the name of paco but was that his real name no it was just like a street name something he thought was cool and you also knew him by his real name did you not yes and what name was that craig chiurco again hardy let the considerable tumult recede before he filled his lungs with air glanced one last time at the assembled crowd in the gallery and threw a look over to stier who looked as though the roof had fallen on him now he clearly knew what was going to happen but didnt know how to stop it or even if he should try hardy turned to the bench the defense calls craig chiurco your honor braun scowled for a second wondering about the decorum in her courtroom but eventually raised her eyes to the back of the gallery bailiff call the witness she said to the officer standing just inside the closed back door and she opened it and disappeared out into the hallway after to hardy an agonizing half minute enough time for the gallery to begin to hum again chiurco entered in his trademark coat and tie looking confident and as opposed to his bosses hardy and hunt well rested hed been waiting with bracco upstairs in the homicide detail for the sign that it was almost time and he should move down to the corridor outside the courtroom now passing up through the bar rail by the defense table he proffered a quick silent greeting to hardy who was already standing in his spot before the witness chair but hardy intent and selfabsorbed didnt look up the clerk swore him in craig looked expectantly at hardy who carefully walked him through the statement hed prepared about their discussion two nights before upbeat chiurco gave every indication that he was glad to be testifying now mr chiurco to backtrack a bit just a moment ago you told the jury that you had been assigned by your employer wyatt hunt to locate levon preslee did you not yes up until that time had you ever heard of levon preslee no to your knowledge had you ever met him no and you did in fact locate mr preslee did you not yes in a matter of hours right hardy went back to his table and picked up a piece of paper i think you told us how you found mr preslee didnt you just say that you had done a web search and found out that mr vogler was convicted for robbery back in and that he had a partner in that crime named levon preslee does that sound about right yes in other words your employer did not tell you that mr voglers partner was mr preslee no and why not do you think this was technically objectionable but as hardy had hoped and predicted stier remained silent certain that braun was not going to interrupt chiurcos expression wavered briefly a moment of indecision but hardy exuded encouragement and chiurco gave him his answer he didnt know it not at that time mr hunt didnt know mr preslees name that is right we just knew that vogler had a partner in the robbery hed committed we didnt know who it was so again how did you find that this partner was mr preslee as i said chiurco still cooperative but some exasperation breaking through the veneer i did a web search you looked on google or yahoo hardy asked that type of thing yes i dont remember precisely which one do you mean you dont remember which search engine you used yes there are a lot of them prison databases city and county records and so on and looking on one of those databases you found a site that somehow informed you about the crime that mr vogler and mr preslee had been convicted of is that right yes so you must have checked on mr voglers name first that was the only name i had so yes and then keying off mr vogler you found a related site for mr preslee correct yes nodding hardy again went back to his desk and picked up another couple of sheets of paper then came back to the witness now mr chiurco i have here in my hand a copy of the cover page of the criminal proceeding that resulted in mr voglers conviction and sentencing back in thanking his stars for glitsky and his access hardy stepped closer to the witness box would you please read for the jury the title of this case right there inside the bracketed area now with a bit of reluctance chiurco came forward and accepted the paper the people of the state of california v dylan vogler case number sc thank you hardy held out his hand and chiurco handed him back his copy and now if you please would you read the title of this other case which for the jurys benefit resulted in mr preslees conviction and sentencing working to regain a semblance of cordiality chiurco took the next sheet of paper the people of the state of california v levon preslee case number sc hardy again took the paper back as you can see mr chiurco and as youve just read to the jury these are different case numbers are they not yes obviously obviously but if these cases are indeed separate and unconnected this leads to the question of how you referenced one of them and had it lead you to the other can you tell us how you did that chiurco sat back his face set and bounced his shoulders a few times i dont exactly remember they showed up together in one of the web sites thats all i can tell you and from that you got mr preslees name and then were able to find his address and go out to his house is that right right a house where you had never been before is that correct yes a house that youd certainly never been inside right a house where police could never under any circumstances have found your fingerprints is that correct chiurcos face had gone dark now and he turned to the judge then back to hardy whats this all about what do my fingerprints have to do with anything hardy stepped closer to the witness and after the earlier two witnesses braun clearly was inclined to give him his head mr chiurco he said did you not already know who mr preslee was and that he had been mr voglers accomplice in the robbery that sent them both to prison when you received your assignment from mr hunt no i did not in fact didnt you request the assignment from mr hunt so that you could keep from mr hunt the reality of your relationship with mr preslee no i did not are you saying you did not have a relationship with mr preslee yes thats what im saying you hadnt been to his home before as a guest thats right ive already said that yes you did hardy said then perhaps you can explain the testimony we just listened to this morning from officer jessica cunningham of the san francisco police lab who identified your fingerprints inside mr preslees home chiurcos eyes shot out beyond hardy past hunt to the back door over to the side doors obviously she either made a mistake or she lied ive never been inside the place hardy moved a step closer to him are you telling the court that you hadnt seen both mr vogler and mr preslee together at bay beans west in the last weeks of their lives i dont know where you get any of this if i were to tell you there were two witnesses well theyre lying too whoever they were hardy now hung his head half turned briefly to the jury his face impassive mr chiurco isnt it true that you attended the university of san francisco here in the city between and suddenly at this gambit chiurcos back went straight his head snapped quickly from side to side hardy aware of the bass rumble behind him starting to develop in the gallery nevertheless pressed the attack mr chiurco your honor braun glared out to the gallery her gavel poised then leaned over the bench the witness will please answer the question chiurco shrugged into his sports coat yes and while you were there were you not acquainted with both mr vogler and mr preslee this time as the gallery fairly erupted behind hardy he stood locked into eye contact with chiurco while braun gaveled the crowd back into silence mr chiurco i think they were both there when i was yes and if we just heard from a witness who said she knew all of you back then testify that you were close friends of both of them would that witness have been telling the truth no answer thats the truth isnt it paco all belligerence now whos paco you are mr chiurco or you were werent you hardy kept waiting for the judge to step in to advise chiurco of his fifth amendment rights but if she wasnt going to do it he sure as hell wasnt going to do it for her this man had killed at least two people probably three and had tried to frame his client and hardy couldnt possibly have cared less about his rights chiurco still unresponsive pulled at his tie cleared his throat hardy let a few seconds pass silence settling into the room until it was complete mr chiurco he asked where do you buy your coffee all over the place have you ever bought coffee at bay beans west on haight street i might have i cant say for sure mr chiurco did you not tell your employer mr hunt that you were a regular customer of mr voglers marijuana business at bay beans west if youd like we can have mr hunt come up here and so testify the witness did not move did not speak mr chiurco i dont have to answer that question it might tend to incriminate me so youre invoking the fifth amendment only against whether or not i bought marijuana yes all right hardy said lets move to another topic do you own a handgun chiurco brought his hands up to his mouth pulled at the sides of his face all right i own a gun so what what make of gun but chiurco just shook his head thats all im not saying anything else the already heavy stillness seemed to take on an oppressive weight in the packed courtroom chiurco stared stonefaced into the space between him and hardy im not answering chiurco said again im taking the fifth hardy nodded took another step forward to within spitting distance of the witness isnt it true mr chiurco that you used that same glock to kill dylan vogler and a liquor store clerk named julio gomez during a robbery in at this the gallery fully exploded behind hardy and over that tumult finally stier found his voice again objection your honor the witness has taken the fifth she banged with her gavel again and again her voice strained as she tried to make herself heard the objection is sustained thats enough bam bam sustained now standing leaning out over the bench at the top of her voice i want order in this courtroom order and the sound of gavel pounding rang out again and again at last a semblance of silence braun still on her feet shaking with rage now asserted her authority order after order the jury is to retire to the deliberation room bailiffs clear the courtroom clear the courtroom mr chiurco you will remain on the witness stand counsel stay at counsel table the gallerys removal took the better part of ten minutes much of the crowd objecting and even refusing to move until braun had more bailiffs called in to help from neighboring courtrooms when finally the last spectator had been cleared braun pointed down at chiurco sir as a witness in this courtroom you have asserted your fifth amendment rights you need to talk with your attorney you will consult with counsel and return to this courtroom with your attorney on this coming monday at nine am but hardy still standing in front of chiurco couldnt let that go unchallenged your honor with respect thats unacceptable mr chiurco should be taken into custody now she raised her gavel as though it were a weapon thats all mr hardy how dare you try to tell me whats acceptable or not in my courtroom thats absolutely all from you and now unnecessarily banging her gavel on every note for emphasis she added you will not disrupt this courtroom further and again at last in total control the master of her domain braun looked around in a kind of stunned disbelief at what her pronouncements had wrought bailiffs she said evenly the defendant goes to the holding cell mr chiurco you go find yourself a lawyer coun sel in chambers right now its quarter of then with another glance out at the empty gallery bailiffs you may readmit the spectators this trial resumes again in precisely fifteen minutes in brauns office stier was near apoplectic talk about no evidence in spite of all of his selfserving rhetoric mr hardy presented no evidence out there just now your honor all that was just a blatant attempt to find a handy scapegoat to distract the jury ridiculous your honor fingerprints at the crime scene are evidence particularly when the person whose fingerprints they are says they couldnt be there whats your theory mr stier did chiurco loan somebody his fingerprints did his hands take a walk without him the fact is hardy said that ive presented more evidence this morning that my client is innocent than mr stier has presented in his entire case against her shes not innocent until the jury says so stier said hardy held out a hand in a beholdtheass gesture actually your honor mr stiers got it exactly backwards mayas innocent until the jury finds her guilty i think they still teach this in law school in this country braun had finally lost all pretense of a judicial demeanor god damn it no more but stier kept on mr hardy can split hairs but im confident the court understood what i was saying your honor and this testimony from ms foreman that mr chiurco maybe used to be called paco on what planet does this rise to the level of evidence the same one hardy shot across at him that you landed on when you had cheryl biehl testify im just frankly stunned that you think youve still got a case stier harrumphed to the contrary your honor since mr chiurco does investigative work for mr hardys own law firm i wouldnt put it past them to have colluded to put on this entire elaborate charade just so the jury would have to consider an alternate suspect then directly to hardy so how do you do it you give your guy a bonus when this is done for the inconvenience you put him through thats the most ridiculous and insulting accusation ive heard in all the time ive been practicing law your honor its beneath contempt hardy finally reaching his limit raised his own voice heres what i did paul i paid your police department to plant his fingerprint inside the scene of a murder and maybe on the casing from a cartridge at the scene of another murder what kind of a bonus would you recommend for someone whos willing to put themselves in prison for life braun slapped a palm down on her desk that exchange gentlemen just cost you each a grand want to go for another one hardy dizzy with adrenaline fighting to reassert his rationality the plain fact your honor as i said out there is that chiurco ought to be under arrest right now hes a danger to himself and to the public the police should be searching his stuff for spatter and preslees place for his dna we need to continue this trial at least into next week or even longer to let the police finally conduct a real investigation braun hated this whole thing she hated hardys provocative and believable theory she hated stiers entire presentation of the case the sideways involvement of jerry glass schiffs sloppy investigating the political ramifications the testimony about things that may or may not have happened as much as fifteen years before above all braun hated the idea that she might have to tell the jury that this trial might be prolonged another week or even longer there was no way she could accept a police investigation at this stage into another suspect without dismissing the charges against the current defendant well gentlemen she began in a cold fury it seems weve gotten ourselves into at that moment the first gunshot echoed from somewhere close by inside the building and they heard a woman scream chiurco didnt move from the witness stand for a short while after hed been dismissed things had happened fast but the judge had told him he could go so long as he returned to court next monday morning he heard the back door of the courtroom open behind him watched hardy and stier march solemnly past him on the way out still he didnt move at last though since the audience had returned en masse to the galleryin fact if anything with the news of the drama the crowd had increasedthe noise level was gearing up again the mayor and fisk and mayas husband came forward off their seats and maya had turned around the bailiff hovering in hesitation about obeying the judge and bringing her back to the holding cell everybody talking about his testimony what had just come down glitsky and da jackman were on their feet stretching their backs deep in discussion debra schiff over at the prosecution table sat hunched over head down fingers at her temples chiurcos boss wyatt hunt had disappeared behind some other standees everybody up and talking talking talking it was now or never chiurco got to his feet his shoulders squared face set completely within his rights he got out of the witness chair and crossed the open courtroom opening the bullpen gate he stepped into the center aisle of the gallery now clogged up with the overflowing crowd a reporter grabbed at his elbow and said something but the world had turned into a blurry tunnel that ended in the doorway about thirty feet away in front of him and he shook the reporter off moving forward moving off to his side in conversation with jeff elliot his damn wheelchair in the aisle slowing everything down hunt and gina roake at first barely noticing him except now for hunts double take as he passed and hearing as though muffled through water wyatts cryabe then louder abe chiurco getting physical in the crush pushing at someone getting people out of his way hey now from hunt an actual cry abe chiurco was so close to the door five or six steps but still others clogged the way before him blocking him as they were filing out for the bathroom a smoke a phone call gossip he was stuck and so he pushed someone else took another step kept moving but the door was open and one small asian female bailiff had come in from her post at the metal detector outside and was now standing by it chiurco tried to squeeze around a fat man couldnt move him got a sense of some activity in the rows behind him hunt pushing his own way out trying to stop him and then suddenly glitsky was standing on his chair his voice cutting through it all bailiff hold that man stop that man the judge may have ordered chiurco released but glitsky on his own had the power of arrest and with the support of clarence jackman standing next to him he had decided he had heard enough to at least hold chiurco for further questioning but that was not going to happen not if chiurco had any say about it and he did he was getting out of here pushing again now at the heavy body in front of him glitskys rasp again mr chiurco hold up bailiff she had come in from the hall to intercept chiurco as he tried to make it out of the courtroom but now the same fat man was trying to make it through the door before him and suddenly she was directly in front of him blocking his way turning around for a glance chiurco saw hunt coming at him out of one eye glitsky out of the other the lieutenant pushing his own way out of his row toward the aisle pointing at him desperation in his voice that man the last witness hold him there with the fat man still inside but pushed out of chiurcos way the bailiff was the last obstruction as she now pulled the door shut but she was so small it was no contest chiurco lashed out struck her a rabbit punch on the side of the neck and she would have gone down at once except that the fat man saw what had happened and found himself holding her up there was nothing else chiurco could do though san francisco bailiffs on courtroom duty didnt carry guns this particular hallway bailiff was armed because of her duty outside the courtroom by the metal detector now unsnapping her holster chiurco grabbed pulled out her gun with all of his might tried to push the fat man and the bailiff to one side then fired a shot into the ceiling someone yelled out down everybody get down and a woman screamed the fucking fat guy still in his way chiurco pushed again got his hand on the door and behind him heard a womans voice drop it drop the gun now and turning he saw schiff by the prosecution table now with her own weapon drawn on the far side of the bar rail taking aim at him over the ducking crowd no time to think he brought the gun up his hands together and squeezed off two quick shots textbook the inspector went down her gun clattering over the floor chiurco turned to finally get out but another blast from by the defense table exploded the wood on the door just over his head and chiurco looking left opened fired again at the big man in the business suit standing in the front row whod perhaps just fired and who fell back over the rail onto the floor by the defense table and revealed the actual second shooter the other bailiff standing holding schiffs gun over where maya townshend lay prostrate on top of her shot brother sheltering him on the tile the bailiff had his gun extended in a twohanded grip drawing another bead his hands already up in the classic firing position chiurco once again fired twice in rapid succession and the bailiff too staggered backward dropped schiffs weapon and fell and then someone out of nowhere grabbed chiurcos gun arm and chopped viciously at it the female bailiff trying again to restrain him took another swing at his face a glancing blow and now he swung his gun at her it went off accidentally as the fat man clutched at his shoulder and spun around and down to the ground next to them now chiurco only needed another step and hed be outside and free but the damned bailiff woman was holding on to his leg so he reached down got an arm around her neck and pulled her up against him holding her there waving his gun threateningly around at the room at anyone who dared raise his or her head but to get the door he had no choice he needed either to release his hostage or lower his weapon he couldnt let go of the hostage though she would attack him again he had to let down the gun which gave glitsky fifteen feet away and waiting for just such an opportunity one and only one clear shot it was all he needed citytalk by jeffrey elliot city officials are still trying to piece together how security procedures in the hall of justice could have gone so awry as to allow the series of events that last friday resulted in the deaths of four people including two law enforcement personnel and city supervisor harlen fisk and the wounding of another man in one of the citys courtrooms this reporter was present during the events that transpired and can relate that even before court was called into session that morning a palpable tension reigned in department the courtroom of judge marian braun scene of the murder trial of maya townshend both mayor kathryn west mrs townshends aunt and fisk her brother were present in evident support of the defendant and the attendant media presence as well as rumors of surprise lastminute witnesses for the defense had packed the gallery mrs townshend had been charged with the murders of dylan vogler the manager of the bay beans west coffee shop that she owns and another past associate of hers levon preslee the trial to date had focused upon evidence of mrs townshends apparent motive for these murders and experts had opined that it was particularly light on physical evidence implicating the defendant so when defense attorney dismas hardys first witness a fingerprint specialist at the police laboratory identified one of hardys own investigating team craig chiurco as having been present at the scene of preslees murder and perhaps having left a partial fingerprint on the bullet casing at the vogler murder scene the gallery grew tense with anticipation of what was to come it didnt have long to wait as mr hardy briefly questioned one other witness who established mr chiurcos earlier and previously undisclosed relationship to both vogler and preslee then called mr chiurco apparently not knowing what was taking place in court he had been waiting outside in the hallway to take the stand mr hardys questions and mr chiurcos responses grew increasingly heated as hardy tried to tie his associate to these crimes in the end with chiurco invoking his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination mr hardy accused him pointblank of these murders and pandemonium broke out in the courtroom it took judge braun several minutes to restore order rather than having her bailiffs hold chiurco for the police braun ordered him to consult an attorney and keep himself available for further examination if necessary at that the judge and the two lead attorneys left the room to confer in judge brauns chambers leaving chiurco unguarded on the witness stand a few moments later the folly of brauns decision became apparent as chiurco rose from the stand and started to make his way through the crowd that by now blocked the aisle of the gallery he had nearly made it to the back door when lieutenant glitsky chief of the citys homicide department called out and ordered one of the courtroom bailiffs linda yang to restrain chiurco but the desperate witnessnow suddenly revealed as a murder suspectstruggled with the bailiff and managed not only to disarm her but to gain possession of her service weapon and to fire it into the ceiling as members of the gallery dropped to the floor or took shelter behind their chairs homicide sergeant inspector debra schiff whod been seated at the prosecution table fired a shot at chiurco which he returned fatally wounding her in the next few seconds another bailiff rolfe hagen fired at chiurco again from inside the bar rail and in response to that chiurco got off a flurry of shots that killed both supervisor fisk and bailiff hagen before lieutenant glitsky saw an opening and fired one shot into chiurcos chest killing him glitsky has been placed on the automatic administrative leave that follows any officerinvolved shooting but the violence that could and did erupt with such tragic results even in a guarded courtroom leaves officials pondering a host of questions shouldnt courtroom bailiffs in san francisco be armed as they are in every other jurisdiction in california or on the other hand should guns even in the hands of police personnel ever be allowed in courtrooms at all is there an adequate number of bailiffs in san francisco courtrooms was judge braun negligent in affording a potential murder suspect the opportunity to escape andor take hostages above all how was an innocent woman arrested and brought to trial for two murders in a san francisco courtroom based on an investigation that could be described at best as incompetent and at worst as grotesquely negligent the evidence of maya townshends innocence was right in front of the police and the prosecution during this entire investigation yet they chose to ignore it in what the unkind might describe as the pursuit of a political vendetta in this reporters opinion it is a travesty that this case was ever allowed to be brought to trial at all actually glitsky said im enjoying the time off getting quality time with my little rat here zachary the rat in question still wore his helmet but otherwise looked and acted as healthy as any normal kid as he played with his sister in the sandbox in glitskys backyard rebonding dont kid yourself you never unbonded maybe not but it felt like it unbonded from the world yeah well they sat on the top step their usual spot looking down over the backyard and the greenery of the presidio beyond you came back just in time so i wouldnt beat myself up over it i wont i thought i told you im done with beating myself up hardy threw him a sideways glance if thats true how will i recognize you youll find something else to beat yourself up over you watch its just who you are screwed up but probably worth saving marginally in the long run thank you youre welcome but in fact hardy added not that i dont have anything better to do on a sunday afternoon but you did call i did and youre going to make me guess again if you want or i could just tell you what we found at chiurcos you mean besides blood spatter on what his shoes shoes check and a glock hexagonalbarrel semi nope but three live rounds and a cleaning kit that would fit that gun besides those i give up no wait weed youre good you want to guess how much nope i quit when im ahead weed is good enough but what else youre going to like it you want another few seconds okay a companionable silence settled for the better part of a minute until finally hardy said what else newspaper clippings old ones julio gomez right i could have got that if id have thought a little more just like you got chiurco knowing preslee no i should have seen that long before i did i mean wyatt told me all about dylan not being on google until recently so how could craig have found levon the answer was that he couldnt have no way no how especially when i realized that theyd gone to trial separately so he must have known levon before and i even knew craig had been at usf and knew dylan and was on his weed list i mean flags everywhere and i couldnt see them yeah glitsky said youre a little slow its amazing you keep getting clients i marvel at it myself still thoughhardy let out a sighwhat a fiasco at the end there i hear you though thats one of the things im not going to beat myself up over ive made up my mind probably smart you had no choice really none i know i believe you you just wonder sometimes how things get to where they are i mean why did maya even get charged and because of that harlens dead and schiff and even ruiz to say nothing of chiurco and those poor bailiffs whats that about all those victims and everybody still goes on calling it a victimless crime dont they its the crime part hardy said take away the crime make the stuff legal he looked at his friend but you being a cop and all i dont suppose thats going to be your issue is it good guess glitsky chewed at his cheek but as to how things got to where they did part of that you want to be honest was me bailing on the job worrying about zack that would have been a very small part but im proud to see youre already back on the road to beating yourself up hardy glanced at his watch you made it about fortyfive seconds a new record i think no i know it was mostly schiff and god knows she paid for it what about bracco you talk to him not since right after how is he glitsky let out a breath talk about beating yourself up he said he knew he should have stepped up said something but he wanted to be loyal to his partner cops and loyalty huh dont i know i just hope he can talk himself into staying on but im not betting on it on the other hand treya had some fun news the other night you might not have heard about shes pregnant again glitsky gave him the bad eye dont even kid think das office clarence is stepping down and shes taking over incorrect think paul stier the big ugly glitsky nodded the big nowbetweenjobs ugly at least until he can hook on with glass or somebody i dont know i think mr glass might be having his own problems lately having taken on the mayor stirring up all this shit and really coming up with squat rumors abound and speaking of which the word is that youre back in the saddle next week might be might not let me guess youre not beating yourself up over it glitsky nodded close enough tamara dade knew that craig chiurcos shellshocked and disbelieving parents had taken his ashes and scattered them under the golden gate bridge she hadnt wanted to intrude on them in their own hours of grief and besides she did not come close to forgetting that she and craig had broken up a serious and she had felt irrevocable breakup so she wasnt with the family and didnt want to be but she had her own grieving to deal with now four days after the memorial service she found herself at the pier behind the ferry building waiting in line again for the boat to sausalito she hadnt come in to work nor had she called since the day of the shootings instead four days ago shed started to come out here after her mostly sleepless and crying nights and shed ride across the bay sit alone on the sausalito jetty and watch the water then take the ferry back by about noon shed then repeat the round trip in the afternoon getting back to the city after darkness had descended today was bleak windy and bitter cold as the ferry left the protection of the shore whitecaps piled up and flung their foam across the open front deck this was where tamara had taken to standing but on this day even with her raincoat it was too wet too miserable she turned and went back inside bought a hot chocolate and found a seat at one of the boltedin tables by a window where she could look out and what imagine what life would have been like with craig wonder why they had never progressed to a committed relationship try to understand what hed done and why and what simply had happened in the courtroom none of it made any sense to her she found it nearly impossible to get her mind around the stark reality that hed murdered dylan vogler and levon preslee and apparently another liquor store clerk years ago that he had been able to live with letting maya townshend get all the way to trial who had he been all this time and how had she not seen it she didnt have any answers except that it would be a long while before she would trust her romantic instincts or even her fundamental human instincts again maybe forever she thought she stared out into the windswept graygreen whitecapped chop is this seat taken the familiar voice startled her and she turned her head quickly to verify the presence of her boss wyatt hunt after doing so she turned back to the window and her shoulders rose and fell as she blew out a long breath howd you find me im a private eye tam finding people is what i do if you dont want me to sit down ill go find another spot she turned back to him no its fine you can sit here then when he had i dont know if i can come back to work okay thats not why im here i wanted to make sure you were all right her lips turned up fractionally and she let out a dry onenote halflaugh halfsob i dont know what that means all right not anymore i cant believe craigs gone even more maybe i cant believe what craig was hunt nodded ive been having some issues with it myself so were we both just blind i dont know i suppose so although how were we going to know what did he show us that could have tipped us off i dont know but i keep thinking i should have known i should have seen something i mean i knew he was confused and he had his bad moments but he was almost always nice to me to everyone really you never threatened him thank god she let out another deep sigh so he really did do it i mean vogler and preslee i dont think theres any doubt about that tam turning away from him she looked out the window at the churning bay and at the farthest extent of vision the spectral shape of alcatraz the old deserted prison with its decrepit buildings i really dont know what im going to do wyatt about work i mean how about if you dont have to decide for a while even still i dont know its like the world is all different maybe i should be in a different field around different people maybe you should you wouldnt hate me he put his hand over hers theres nothing you could do that could make me hate you tam youve got to know that she turned back to him and tried to smile i dont feel like i know anything anymore wyatt i feel like he stole my innocence or something i just keep waiting for a break in these clouds but im not sure theres going to be one except that there always has been before no she said the clouds have never before been this thick and i really hate him for that hunt patted her hand time he said she attempted another wan smile god i hope so on the third friday after the last day of mayas trial the phone buzzed at hardys elbow in his office and he punched the button to speak to phyllis yo taking a moments immature pleasure from his receptionists exasperated sighsenior attorneys do not answer the phone informally since that causes a disruption in the forcehe checked that it was indeed fourthirty and again stole phylliss thunder when he added send the townshends right in it was both of them holding hands maya looking so radiant and lovely that he might have passed her on the street and not recognized her her hair and her cheeks glowed shed lost the weight shed gained on the jail food as well as the cellblock pallor joel for his part wore a sense of comfort a confidence and an easy smile that hardy hadnt noticed before not that thered been much to smile about over the past six or seven months but something in the couples body language toward each other spoke of a renewed connection an ease a true rapport no longer rich successful husband and subservient stayathome wife but true partners now a lot to grab from a first impression but hardy decided to believe it was true the occasionfinal payment for his legal servicescould have been handled by a check in the mail but theyd wanted to come down and deliver it in person and he was grateful for the opportunity to see them again in this setting with their ordeal behind them so he offered coffee and condolences about harlen both of which they accepted and they made small talk until they were all settled in the formal seating area closest to hardys desk at which time joel reached into his inside pocket and proffered an envelope embossed with his corporations logo feel free to open it now if youd like maya said thats all right hardy broke a small grin i trust its pretty close maybe not maya with an impish smile of her own made it sound like a dare so hardy shrugged opened the flap pulled out the check and looked up with some surprise this is um i dont remember the last time i got tonguetied its a bonus joel said maya was outright beaming now we thought dylans salary for a year would have a nice symmetry its got a lot more than symmetry hardy said are you sure this is im afraid im just a little overwhelmed this is more than extremely generous maya nodded you saved my life dismas in many ways she reached over and put a hand on her husbands knee i told him good for you hardy said and turning to joel and i bet you werent even tempted to leave her he put his hand over hers not even close i never would no matter what i dont know if she ever really believed that before but we all make mistakes huh do things were ashamed of and worse than that i know its happened to me hardy said though if youd keep that in this room id appreciate it my associates would be shocked and dismayed in any event maya said i we just wanted to thank you so much it has been such a burden for so long and now i dont have it anymore i feel like a different person joel hadnt let go of her hand the same person only happier and better she looked contentedly across at him arrête un peu in french stop a little but not too much then back at hardy with a sigh anyway if you dont mind ive got one last little thing that you could explain that i wanted to understand and just really dont if i can i will she let out a small breath why me why you what i mean with craig chiurco how did he pick me to frame i never met him i never even had heard of him and suddenly he picks me out of nowhere and tries to ruin my life i just dont understand what happened how that happened hardy picked up his coffee and took a sip he knew that it was an excellent question and that she deserved an answer but there was no certain answer craig was dead and no one would ever really know for sure hardy just hoped that the one he hadand hed given it a lot of thoughtwas good enough for her well he began heres my best guess dylan was in the blackmail business and he was a greedy man for a long time he was happy stringing you along selling his dope keeping up on his customer list but remember he also knew that craig had killed the gomez boy now the fact that hed done it in connection with a robbery they were both involved in made it a little squirrelly since technically legally theyd both be guilty of that murder whoever it was that pulled the trigger but he liked pushing the limits dylan did and what i think happened is that they were all together at bbw that day a few weeks before he got killed and dylan brought it up again and heres craig going for his private eye license straight all these years thinking his past is all behind him and then dylan ups the stakes somehow tells him what hes been doing with you maybe without any of the specific details but enough to make craig know that youve got every reason to want dylan removed too so he decides to kill dylan and all he needs is to have you show up soon after so he called me that was him i dont know for sure but dylan had a brooklyn accent which isnt so hard to mimic craig calls you late at night and makes it short and sweet saying its an emergency he cant talk about now well you came running he knew what time dylan got to the alley every day he knew hed have your gun with him in any event it all worked if you want my opinion youre damn lucky he didnt wait around to kill you too i thought of that im kind of surprised he didnt hardy shook his head two dead people and the police still left looking for who killed them too much to orchestrate he wanted to keep it simple so what about levon levon would have remembered the conversation at bbw their fight that eugenio ruiz witnessed remember so he goes to levons pulls his gun has levon call you on his cell phone and invite you over walks behind him and well you know the rest so he didnt know me at all and just did that thats what i think hardy said thats about what i told her too joel added she just said that sounded like the essence of evil she doesnt want to believe that people could really be that bad in their souls i mean she said we all make mistakes sure even terrible ones but this wasnt a simple mistake this was a conscious decision to just destroy somebody he didnt know at all hardy nodded thats right i dont want to believe that people can actually be like that she said not all of them and thankfully maybe not too many but definitely some hardy said definitely some acknowledgments it is almost impossible for me to imagine that this is my twentieth book and so my first acknowledgment is to all of you my readers who have been so enthusiastic and supportive of my work over all these years i never forget that i owe my successnever anticipated to this degree and tremendously appreciatedto those of you who buy these books pass them to your friends and relatives discuss them at work and at home take them to your hearts having such a dedicated core of readers is one of the great thrills of a writers life and i am humbly grateful to each and every one of you thank you thank you thank you this book began in an email discussion with one of my correspondents dr jack crary who had been intrigued by some of the medical issues in some of my earlier booksparticularly the effect of traumatic injury on family members of those whod suffered it that correspondence led me to abe glitskys reaction to his sons accident and got me off and running in chapter one thanks jack as the story got under way i encountered as usual a great dearth in my knowledge about what i was hoping to write about for insights into business perspectives that were foreign to me id like to thank my neighbors and fellow piscators tim lien and tim cronan these gentlemen connected me to a us attorney in san diego bruce smith who was a forthcoming and generous source on the uses of forfeiture in connection with the drug trade after the first draft was finished i turned to a very talented writer and author john poswall and a couple of other colleagues of his who prefer to remain anonymous for further insight into government prosecutions and grand jury proceedings none of my books would be what they are without the ongoing assistance and firstdraft revision suggestions of my dear friend san mateo assistant district attorney al giannini whose general expertise on all things criminal exquisite taste and refined judgment contribute mightily to the finished product like no one else al is a true collaborator in the dismas hardyabe glitsky series and my debt to him cannot be measured of course any book owes its life to its publisher and i am blessed to have worked with a wonderful staff at dutton now for the past nine books this is a fantastic group of enthusiastic bright committed peoplestarting with the publisher brian tart marketing whizzes lisa johnson and beth parker erika imranyi trena keating kara welsh claire zion rick pascocello susan schwartz and the wonderful cover artist and designer rich hasselberger saving the most personal until last im knocked out by the style taste and talents of my editor ben sevier his support in many conversations was crucial throughout the books gestation and his comments and suggestions as we approached a final manuscript were consistently pithy germaine and critical ben is the real deal as an editor and i consider myself blessed to be able to work with him my writing life wouldnt be half as productive without the load taken up by my assistant anita boone besides possessing one of the most evenkeeled and sunny personalities in the world a major plus when working with sometimes gnarly authors she is truly the right arm and majordomo of many many aspects of my life in the business of writing and i couldnt do what i do without her as many have attested the writing life can be solitary without close friends to keep perspective on the other things that are important and that hopefully help to keep the writing fresh the creativity wouldnt flourish nor would the experience be joyful and so for keeping the spirit alive heres to the perennial best man don matheson to authorbon vivant max byrd frank and gina seidl sandy and peter s diedrich md mph and my two children justine
