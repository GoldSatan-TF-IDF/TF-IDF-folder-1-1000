joseph kanon alibi chapter one after the war my mother took a house in venice shed gone first to paris hoping to pick up the threads of her old life but paris had become grim grumbling about shortages even her friends worn and evasive the city was still at war this time with itself and everything shed come back forthe big flat on the rue du bac the cafes the market on the raspail memories all burnished after five years to a rich glownow seemed pinched and sour dingy under a permanent cover of gray cloud after two weeks she fled south venice at least would look the same and it reminded her of my father the early years when they idled away afternoons on the lido and danced at night in the photographs they were always tanned sitting on beach chairs in front of striped changing huts clowning with friends everyone in caftans or bulky onepiece woolen bathing suits cole porter had been there writing patter songs and since my mother knew linda there were a lot of evenings drinking around the piano that summer when theyd just married when her train from paris finally crossed over the lagoon the sun was so bright on the water that for a few dazzling minutes it actually seemed to be that first summer bertie another figure in the lido pictures met her at the station in a motorboat and as they swung down the grand canal the sun so bright the palazzos as glorious as ever the whole improbable city just the same after all these years she thought she might be happy again a week later with bertie negotiating in italian she leased three floors of a house on the far side of dorsoduro that once belonged to the ventimiglia family and was still called ca venti the current owner whom she would later refer to with no evidence as the marchesa took clothes some silverframed family photographs and my mothers check and moved to the former servants quarters on the top floor the rest of the house was sparsely furnished as if the marchesa had been selling it off piece by piece but the piano nobile all damask and chandeliers had survived intact and bertie made a lendlease of some modern furniture from his palazzo on the grand canal to fill a sitting room at the back the great feature was the light pouring in from windows that looked out past the zattere to the giudecca there were maids who came with the house without seeming to live there a boat moored on the canal and a dining room with a painted ceiling that bertie said was scuola di tiepolo but not tiepolo himself the expatriate community had begun to come back opening shuttered houses and planning parties coffee and sugar were hard to get but wine was cheap and the daily catch still glistened and flopped on the market tables of the pescaria la fenice was open mimi mortimer had arrived from new york and was promising to give a ball above all the city was still beautiful every turn of a corner a painting the water a soft pastel in the early evening before the lamps came on then the music started at florians and the boats rocked gently at the edge of the piazzetta and it all seemed timeless lovely as if the war had never happened i learned all this many weeks later in a telephone call she had somehow managed to put through by going to the top at this time the trunk lines into germany were reserved for the military so i imagined that a general some friend of a friend had been charmed or browbeaten into lifting a few restrictions the call in any case caused a lot of raised eyebrows in the old i g farben building outside frankfurt where i pushed files into one tray or another for usfet while i waited for my separation papers i had been in germany since the beginning of the year first with g then attached to one of the denazification teams separating the wicked from the merely acquiescent frankfurt was still a mess the streets barely passable filled with dps and holloweyed children with edema bruises the phone call with its scratches and delays seemed to come from another world so far from the rubble and desperation just outside my window that its news seemed irrelevant the marchesa was quiet you hardly knew she was there darling not even a flush my room had a wonderful view her pictures hadnt arrived from new york yet but bertie a treasure and fluent was looking into it it was a call that began in what my father used to call her medias resa plunge into the middle of whatever she was thinking followed by exasperation when you didnt know what she was talking about finally i understood that she had moved to venice intending to stay which meant that my home would be there too the point of the call in fact was to say she was expecting me for christmas im still in the army well they give passes dont they i mean its not as if the wars still on and im sure you could use the break ive seen the newsreelsit looks just awful there yes camps full of corpses wheeled out in farm carts to mass graves feral kids eating out of px garbage cans women passing bricks hand over hand digging out not what anyone had expected pushing over the rhine gis rich with a pack of luckies what happens after well then she said wont it be wonderful to have christmas together its been years in a fascist country i said half teasing its not the same thing at all they werent nazis anyway all thats over its lovely here just like before i cant wait for you to see the house maybe itll snow they say its enchanting in the snow characteristically she hung up without giving me her address so it was to bertie that i later wrote to say that id be spending christmas in the hospital after surviving actual combat and the tough early days of the occupation what got me embarrassingly was a rusty nail a careless step in the debris of a frankfurt street that caused a puncture wound and required tetanus treatment and a holiday spent with amputees and boys with nervous tics by the time i finally got to venice it was february i was out of the army and the city was huddled against a damp misty cold the piano nobile as grand and formal as described was freezing kept dark but not draftless by long heavy drapes the sitting room warmed by space heaters from bertie was comfortable but the high tiepolo dining room made meals so chilly and unpleasant that my mother had taken to eating in the kitchen or off a tray sitting next to the bars of her electric fire above us the marchesa had become so silent that a maid was sent up to check as if she might be one of those birds who grow still on a winter branch then suddenly fall over what would have changed everything was sun cutting across the adriatic to seep into all the tile roofs and parquet floors as it often did even in february but the sky that winter was german cloudy and gray in the evenings near our house there was no light at all a fog would come in from the sea filling the giudecca channel streetlights were spaced far apart to save power and the calles became dark medieval paths again designed for people with torches i noticed none of thisor rather it was all so like the gray i was used to that i accepted it as natural the way things were the gloomy afternoons were no different from the weather in my head full of listless shadows an urge to draw in does anyone really come back from the war the lucky ones just keep going on to the next fight unaware that theyre breathing different air the rest of us have to be brought up in stages like deepsea divers to prevent the bends the boys in the hospital had come back too fasttheir faces twitched their eyes darted at every sound prey i slept the fog that came in at night from the lagoon would fill my head too a lulling numbness asking to be wrapped in blankets left alone sometimes there were dreamsreally ways of going back reminders of the nightmare time that was supposed to be overbut mostly the sleep was just fog opaque and shapeless just like swann couche de bonne heure my mother would say but idly not really worried for by this time dr maglione had come back into her life so she was spending evenings out unaware that when she left me with a book i was already halfway up the stairs in my mind curling up with the fog the result was that i was waking early before first light it wasnt insomniai slept deeply snug under a warm duvetbut some automatic awareness that the light was about to change the way plants are said to lift their heads toward the dawn my bedroom window faced across the channel to the redentore and i would look out into the darkness waiting for its lines to start forming as if palladio himself were sketching them in again until finally everything had definition still murky but real then i would put on my heavy wool army coat and leave the house without making a sound quieter even than the shy marchesa and begin my walk venice is often said to be a dream but at that hour when there is no one out no sounds but your own steps it is really so no longer metaphorwhatever separates the actual paving stones from the alleys in your mind dissolves the morning mist and the gothic shapes from childhood stories have something to do with this the rocking slap of boats on the water tugging at their mooring poles but mostly its the emptiness the campos and largos are deserted the buoy marker lights in the lagoon undisturbed by wakes the noisy day when the visitors fan out into the calles from the piazzale roma still just a single echo things appear at that hour the way they do in sleep gliding unconnected from one to the next bolted garden door to shadowy church steps to shuttered shopwindow no more substantial than fragments of mist the walk was always the same first down along the zattere past the lonely vaporetto stations just before the stazione marittima i would turn into the calle leading to san sebastiano veroneses church and a bar for stazione workers that was always open by the time i got there the windows already moist with steam hissing from the coffee machines the other customers in blue workers coveralls bulked with sweaters underneath would nod from their spots at the bar taking in the army coat then ignore me turning back to their coffee and cigarettes voices kept low as if someone were still sleeping upstairs even at that hour a few were tossing back brandies the coffee had been cut with somethingchicory acorns but was still strong enough to jolt me awake and standing there with a first cigarette suddenly alert to everythingthe steamed windows the whiff of scalded milk isolated words of dialectit seemed to me that id never been asleep at all outside there were a few more peoplea boy in a waiters uniform heading toward one of the hotels an old woman in a fur coat coaxing a dog to pee a priest with his hands in his sleeves staying warm all the insomniacs and early risers id never seen before i became one of them i supposed that if i headed over to the rialto i could see the fish stalls being set up and the boats unloading the earlymorning working world but i preferred the empty dream city from san sebastiano it was a straight path only slightly angled by bridges to campo san barnaba no produce market yet just a man hurrying toward the traghetto station perhaps still not home from the night before then right toward the accademia following the natural course of the streets the way water runs in canals looping finally around the museum then through the back alleys toward salute not a soul in sight again past the great swirling church and out along the fondamenta to the tip here huddled in my coat with my back against the old customs house i sat for hours looking across the water to the postcard everyone knewruskins waves of marble the gilt of san marco catching the first morning sun the columned landing stage filling with boat traffic all the beautiful buildings rising out of the water out of consciousness the citys last dream i thought at first that my mother would tire of it the way she tired of everything finally except the past but dr maglione was an unexpected wrinkle a piece of future after my father died there had been a period of melodramatic grief followed i assumed by a series of friendships but these had happened if they had happened offstage i was away at school then in the army then overseas so what i knew came from letters and these had been full of other thingsvolunteer work openings her threeweek job unpaid at the art of this century gallery and the inevitable fight with peggy guggenheim that followed then she had come back to europe not really looking for anyone and suddenly there he was not slick or too young or in any way unpleasantnot unlike my father in fact gray hair thinning at the temples quiet almost reticent and yet amused by her the way my father had been both of them perhaps drawn to a quicksilver quality neither possessed himself in any case he was here making her look brighter in love with venice not even aware the rooms were cold so i put off going back to new york unsettled not sure where any of us was heading hes not a fortune hunter you know bertie said besides if youre after money why not young money much nicer and you know i adore grace but she can be a handful anyway he had doges in his family that doesnt mean anything it does if you have them and hes a real doctor you know its not an honorific my doctor in fact and im still here i thought it was drink he picked up his glass well that too the point is hes not a gigolo so you introduced them no no theyve known each other for years since the old days when we were allwell younger than we are now the parties my god i suppose thats part of it it reminds them anyway you ought to be grateful you dont want her sitting home alone do you imagine what that would be like its the first thing that occurred to me there she was all excited on the phone and packing bags and i thought what on earth am i going to do with her in the winter no less people think theyre going to like it here in the winterthey come for carnival and wouldnt this be nice but they never do the third night at harrys you can see it on their faces bored stiff youre not its my home i know what to expect the point is grace needed a friend and now she has one shes happy and shes out of your hair youve got your life to get on withnot worry about her what are you planning to do by the way im not sure yet oh the young all the time in the world right now im enjoying venice thats all are you grace says you sleep all day no i walk all day its the only way to see the city then i get tired and sleep at night mm a sort of farmers life up and down with the birds are you that bored he said his voice still light just a hint of concern underneath not really i like it its like being on leave from what i shrugged the army everything just for a while dont stay too long then you dont want to get addicted i looked at him caught by the word as if he knew somehow about the mornings sitting against the dogana drifting the beauty of the place a kind of opiate no but i want to make sure shes all right doges or no adam they have dinner a drink chat nobodys posted the banns you know what i think i can say this because ive known you all your life before your life i remember when grace was pregnant with you he lifted his glass pointing a finger youve got a little too much time on your hands youre making trouble where theres no trouble to be madefor yourself really my advicei know who ever listens is be happy for your mother and mind your own business of course maybe thats it whats it not enough business of your own i glanced at his thin almost elfin face eyes bright and interested behind the halfmoon glasses i dont want to be introduced to anybody fix up someone else i dont fix people up he said almost sniffing at the phrase but enjoying himself whats that army slang yes you do those cozy lunch parties and you sitting there watching like a turtle a turtle listen to him he reached to a box on the coffee table for a cigarette thinking i mean it bertie i can make my own friends people never do though you know have you noticed you seem to do all right he lit the cigarette looking over the flame with an arched eyebrow well i hire them oh dont be vulgar i dont mean like that but i grinned anyway thinking of the long line of research assistants young men known to be in the house but rarely seen like upstairs maids one would think you were still twelve years old ten almost i said still grinning anyway too young for your black book oh theres bound to be someone people have sisters dont they and cousins as it happened or rather the cousins friend a connection so tenuous that by the time it had been explained we were already introduced he always does that i said as bertie walked away to join another group he says it gives people something to talk about its claudia yes she nodded watching bertie it was one of his afternoon drinks parties too late for tea but early enough to catch the sunset on the grand canal outside berties palazzo was near the mocenigo on the sant angelo side just before the canal makes its last bend toward the accademia bridge and in winter the lateafternoon light on the water was muted almost a pale pink what sun was left seemed to have moved inside to the burning fireplaces making small circles of heat on either side of the room the crowd was berties usual mixpalefaced curators from the accademia where he was attached without being officially on staff a few attractive men whom i took to be former research assistants overdressed expatriates with drinks and venetians rich or idle enough not to be at work at five in the afternoon i had seen her earlier standing alone by the window looking out of place and stranded like someone whod been promised a drink and been forgotten she was fingering her collar button an unconscious distress signal then caught my eye and stopped dropping her hand but not looking away i started over to rescue her but bertie suddenly appeared moving her back into the crowd still awkward but at least talking to people by the time he made his way to me any shyness was gone her stare frank and curious what do you usually talk about she said her voice almost flat as if the effort of speaking english had lowered it brought it down an octave anything where you learned english for instance in london before the war my father wanted me to know english but of course its difficult these past few years to speak it its fine i said looking at her more carefully now she was the first person id met here who had referred to the war at all she was thin with dark curly hair and a long neck held erect a dancers posture she had come in office clothes a gray suit with padded shoulders over a white blouse given the cocktail dresses around the room she should have receded drab against all that plumage but instead the suit with its pointed lapels gave her a kind of intensity she held herself with an alert directness full of purpose so that everything about her not just the suit seemed sharply tailored no it gets rusty rusty yes she said waiting for me to nod i need practice thats why i asked to meet you really i thought bertie yes i asked him youre surprised flattered i guess why me practically everyone here speaks english she smiled a little maybe now its not so flattering she glanced toward the room the others look i turned to follow her glancemaids passing trays everyone talking loudly through wisps of smoke laughing as the light faded behind them through the window frivolous i said she looked surprised then bit her lip smiling yes but i was going to say old and you were standing by the fire so i got elected what if im frivolous too signor howard said you were in the war so its different you were in germany in the fighting at first then a kind of cop hunting nazis for war crimes she stared now taking this in interested then you know how it was not like them she said waving her hand a little to take in the room maybe theyre the lucky ones like venice like venice you get off the train here its hard to believe anything ever happened well from germany but even here you know wartimeits not so easy no im sorry i said quickly imagining the lines the shortages i just meant no bombs you were here most of the time a true venetian not for venice my family was from rome it was my grandfather who came here your grandfather in america that would make you a founding family founding old ah no but in rome we were an old family since the empire which empire she hesitated not sure what i meant rome what with chariots she smiled yes claudia a roman name i said watching her sip from her glass easier now even the sharp lapels on the suit somehow softer how do you know bertie i dont he invited everyone from the accademia i work there his friend has a cousin who knew i heard i couldnt keep it straight then either i havent been yetthe accademia maybe youll give me a tour now that weve broken the ice there thats one she said quickly ignoring my question you can help me with that what does it mean break the ice i know to be friendly but how does it mean that like breaking through ice on a lake i dont understand it i never thought about it i said i suppose just a general stiffness when people dont know each other breaking through that but not melting the iceyou know the friendship making things warmer its breaking she looked down at her drink genuinely puzzled all right melted then but now that is would you show me around the accademia you should have a guide for that im not really an expert on the paintings im not interested in the paintings oh she said unexpectedly flustered she looked away are you in venice long a party question my mothers living herefor now anyway shes one of the frivolous people over there i didnt mean no she is frivolous its part of her charm its what everybody likes about her including you sure a son who loves his mother very italian you see how respectable so how about it some lunch hour ill help you with your english she looked directly at me why i stood there for a second not knowing how to answer why i said finally i dont know im in venice i should get to know some venetians theyre venetian she said moving her hand toward the others none of them asked to meet me she smiled dont make too much of that it was for politeness and now you want to go out with me she said trying go out you dont know anything about me i know your people go way back so thats all right and youre the first person ive enjoyed talking to since i got here but its you who are talking i grinned okay you talk no i have to go and leave me with them we turned look now its priests bertie was greeting a priest in a flowing scarlet cassock who extended his hand in a royal gesture barely moving his head standing in front of some unseen throne whos that do you know no i thought everybody here knew everybody he must be a monsignor or a cardinal something i wish i knew the difference youre from romecan you tell by the colors i dont know im a jew she said quietly oh i said turning back to her is that a problem why should it be a problem jews are not so popular not in america either i think so you dont know i said ignoring it if hes a monsignor no dont you youre not a christian im not anything not a catholic anyway but not a jew either part my grandfather miller muller changed my father was a mischling one grandfather it was enough in germany she looked at me then held out her hand thank you for the english i have to go its already dark do you see signor howard she glanced around the room hes getting the church a drink come on no one will miss us youre leaving im taking you home no its far nothings far in venice she laughed how well do you know it my mother intercepted us at the door glass in hand darling youre not going gianni will be here anyhell be sorry to miss you not too much of course he will dont be silly the army certainly hasnt done very much for your manners you say hi for me i said pecking her on the cheek i have to run this is missim sorry i dont know your last name grassini claudia grassini she said nodding to my mother how nice my mother said shaking her hand finding someone new at one of berties parties you probably think were the waxworks we have to run i said perhaps youd like to join my mother started looking carefully at claudia assessing another time claudia said of course my mother said a pas de deux did you say goodbye to bertie she said to me hes in confession she giggled oh bertie and his priests you have to admit though hes the bestdressed person in the room how did they manage do you think during the war i mean did they have coupons but by this time we were out the door walking down the stairs to the hall what was that all about i said to claudia that look between you shes a mother she wants to see if im all right you know like in the market you feel the fruit i laughed how did you come out shes not sure shes a widow for years what did he do your father have fun mostly then he got sick fun it was a different world people did that thenhave fun these people she said lifting her head toward the stairs then turning to the maid who was holding her coat you dont have to do this its a long way i can meet you at the accademia if youd really like that no i want to see where a real venetian lives a poor one you mean are you yes of course who lives like this now she said looking up the staircase to the piano nobile only foreigners we were alone at the vaporetto station huddling in the corner against the cold the fog had come in blocking out the opposite side of the canal so dense you felt you could snatch it in handfuls so what do you do here she said hunching her shoulders hands stuffed in her pockets walk see the city what does anyone do in venice meet people at signor howards you disapprove no no its not for me she stopped then turned away stamping her feet for warmth signor howard helped me at the accademia bertie likes doing that helping people but you still dont like his friends she looked up at me with a half smile do you not anymore im not sure why i mean ive known some of them for years its just that everything seems different now for you not for them no not for them its the same party i used to see them in the windows from the canalall the parties and now youre inside you think so ha brava the international set but now its like youits all different i dont care im glad you went to this one anyway well for signor howard it was hard to get work when i came back from fossoli where a camp near modena where they put the jews there were camps here you think it was only in germany yes here beautiful italy not so beautiful then when was this fortyfour the first roundups were in fortythree at the end but i went later it was a holding camp from there they shipped people on to poland she nodded so you know that no one here does no one here talks about it you i said involuntarily looking down at her sleeve as if i could see through to the tattooed numbers no i stayed at fossoli so you were lucky i said thinking of the piledup carts yes lucky she said turning to a bright light coming toward us on the water at last its so cold the boat finally visible through the mist slammed against the dock inside we found seats toward the back the windows steamy with condensation so that it seemed the fog had moved in with us there were a few other passengers tired people going home with string bags teenagers smoking in the harsh light of the cabin everything seemed public again the easy intimacy outside somehow part of the dark the boat moved slowly following the cone of its headlight the motors groaning at the reduced speed too loud for quiet conversation but in the sudden warmth we were no longer hunched over when claudia sat back and crossed her legs one came out of the coat an unexpected flash of white exposed do you live with your family i said looking away from her leg no theyre dead my mother years ago my father just last year oh i said and then there was nothing to say nothing worth saying over the engine anyway drawing attention instead we sat quietly suddenly awkward rocking with the boat the swaying movement pushing our bodies together so they barely met then pulled back like waves it was a kind of dancing a permission to touch in public aware of each other the warm skin under the coats the other passengers sat nodding to their own rhythm looking up surprised when station lights suddenly appeared then gathering their packages unsteady on their feet until the ropes were tied after san marco the boat began to empty until no one else was in the cabin but an old couple who appeared to be asleep outside everything was still suspended in the fog the lamps on the riva just pinpricks of light where do we get off i said leaning to her ear to say it so that now there was the smell of her wool and skin and the faint trace of some perfume she must have put on for berties soon i told you it was far the lido i said an excuse to stay close to her face she smiled turning to me not that far two more stops she said then she was silenced by a foghorn off to our right on some invisible ship we got off at the public gardens leaving the old couple to keep drifting out into the lagoon after a dark stretch bordering the park the calles took on the usual twists through small deserted campos lit by hooded single bulbs at each corner this was the tag end of venice neglected and out of the way soundless except for claudias heels on the pavement and a few radios chattering behind shuttered windows the fog was thinner than it had been on the water so that even with only a few lights we could see the facades of the buildings plaster peeling from some of them in large patches occasionally overhead laundry still hung to dry in the damp air as if someone had simply forgotten to bring it in you see its not the danieli she said as we walked along a misty canal but still a water view thats san isepo im just there she pointed to one of the peeling houses can you find your way back is this where you lived before no in cannaregio the ghetto its a venetian word you know that we all lived there so it was easy to find us and after when i came back from fossoli i thought no anywhere but there so i found thisthe other end of the city its far but i like it here at least i cant hear it anymore in my head hear what i said looking at her closely we had stopped by the bridge just before her building nothing a figure of speech when i see the streets there the ghetto it reminds me of the sirens here its different it looks different so the memories arent like that what sirens for the air raids i thought venice wasnt bombed no drills she looked away then back at me you want to know what it was like they used the air raid sirens so nobody would hear when they rounded us up so late all the screaming and the pounding on the doors anybody would hear it at the casa di riposohow do you say old peoples homeall the patients so much noise so they used the sirens to cover up the noise so no one would hear im sorry i said quietly embarrassed to have said anything they took all the patients even the ones too sick to move she turned away well enough of that do you have a cigarette i lit it for her studying her face in the glow of the match she leaned back against the wall of the bridge so now you know all about me where i live where i work now even my memories i dont go to harrys i live here not signor howards venice not yours either no did they take you that night later in the fall and then what happened at fossoli you want to know that too everything she hesitated then looked directly at me yes all right look how easy i say that i told no one now some stranger at a rich party and she stopped again why was i lucky one of the men who ran the camp raped me of course he didnt call it rape only i thought that every time so is there anything else you want to know i said nothing she drew on the cigarette watching me as if she were expecting me to turn away no yes why you wanted to meet me she smiled a little that too all right i dont know maybe i liked the look of you i smiled back surprised no ones ever said that to me before are you always so i paused not finding the word you prefer the old venice the masks the notes i used to want that how wonderful to look over your fan at la fenice so romantic but now its what you sayeverythings different i came back and its all different so now im like this my mother came back because she thinks its all the same she dropped the cigarette and ground it out with her shoe good night she said then she looked up at me studying my face are we going to be lovers do you think i met her stare yes you think so dont you i reached up my hand but she stopped it with hers letting our fingers touch i dont know yet maybe but not the first meeting i cant do that i leaned closer and lowered my face to hers a tentative kiss on the lips a hint of salt water then another longer this time our mouths slightly open then more taking our time until we were moving over each other open and excited and she broke away with a small gasp can i come in no its too soon go home think who i am then if you still want to wellsee each other over fans at la fenice she smiled thats right over fans do you know how to get back walk toward the water i waited while she put the key in the door when will you know i said she made a teasing face when i know you better she made a shooing motion with her hand just follow the canalyoull see the gardens on the boat back i stood at the deck rail as we moved in and out of the fog toward the lights then away again venice seemed more than ever dreamlike something not really there but once there had been sirens and dogs think who i am not just another folder on my desk in frankfurt more disturbing than that here tasting a little of salt at home staring out the dark window for the first time in weeks i didnt sleep it took hours for the room to fill up with light reflecting off the water then moving along the walls in ripples i opened the window listening to the canal sloshing against the house too late for sleepwalking but too early for open shops anything else i dressed and headed for the accademia but it would be hours before the tall doors opened i could walk out to the dogana my usual morning seat but all that now seemed to have happened weeks ago somewhere else how could anyone just sit looking i started up the broad wooden steps of the bridge over to santo stefano a coffee and a newspaper but that was idling who could sit the point was to keep going now that i had somewhere to go the sun held all the way through san marco and along the riva bouncing off the white marble and back against the water i walked faster even the air after weeks of mist and damp was sharp and dry as if it too had cleared its head and decided what to do and then like a sudden shift of mood it was over the sky began to fill with clouds again blown back in from the west and by the time i reached the funfair at the far end of the riva the shuttered caravans and childrens rides were as drab and dismal as theyd been all winter the brick towers of the arsenale glowing like kilns a few minutes before had turned gloomy i crossed the last bridge before the vaporetto stop suddenly feeling foolish still hours early the idea of coming here at all like something out of a song lyric silly in the gray light the sensible thing would be to catch the next boat back and go to the accademia at lunch hour instead i waited smoking on a bench near the floating dock not willing to waste a morning what time did the staff get to the accademia a few people were opening umbrellas i felt a light drizzle on my face and took shelter inside the vaporetto station so much for the expansive gesture sunshine and open arms now i was hunched over with a damp collar it didnt matter she came onto the quay and it was just as i imagined it would bethe same direct walk a glance up from under the umbrella a sudden stop and her surprised face unguarded absolutely still until something turned over inside loosening an involuntary smile she was wearing the same wool coat and sharplapeled suither only one and for a second i saw how she would take it off just the jacket nothing else sliding it back from her arms while she stared straight at me taking it off for me now she hurried into the shelter folding her umbrella eyes still wide disbelieving have you been here all night she said laughing a little i shook my head i get up early but what are you doing here i want you to get to know me better her face softened at this hour i thought wed better start i dont know how much you want to know she said nothing her eyes still reading my face pleased i like risotto any kind of fish she laughed do you think im going to cook for you okay well go out a rich american i live in dorsoduro my room has a view of the redentore im not going to your room in your mothers house then ill find something else im not going anywhere except to work thats why im here we can talk on the way to come here like this at this hour you must be crazy must be what time do you get off for lunch youre so sure of this yes she looked away here comes the boat i reached up and moved her chin with my hand ill tell you anything you want to know only a few people got on with us but the boat was already packed with commuters coming from the lido reading newspapers or just staring out the windows we stood away from the rain but wedged near the gangplank gate pressed against each other just like the bus i said but of course it wasnt dipping with the shallow waves even a morning commute turned into an excursion the water gave everything in venice this playful quality ambulances were boats so not quite ambulances fire boats and delivery barges and taxisall the same yet different bobbing on the water somehow looking half madeup we should have a gondola like the old days no they frighten me so unsteady i cant swim in venice nobody swims in venice where in the canals she made a face its not so unusual even gondoliers a city people rooted to pavement anyway i never learned so i dont go in boats only these she said waving her hand toward the crowd ill take you out im good with boatsthats something else to know youd be safe oh you have a gondola actually i do one came with the house but no gondolier so its up on supports theres a boat though we could take that with life jackets go and have a picnic in this weather well when its nicer and youll be here when its nicer she turned to me you dont have to do this what act like this take me on boats take me anywhere picnics like the films so romantic its not like that anymore no not for me what do you want me to talk about then what youre thinking not thiswhat flirting playacting its not serious no its supposed to be part of the fun she looked away then stepped back to let some passengers get near the rail we were pulling into salute she moved farther away not wanting to talk with anyone close by pretending to look at the church even in the drizzle the baroque curves were bright white like swirls of meringue when the boat swung out again she turned to find me looking at her now what more picnics no then what what im really thinking she nodded what it would be like you taking your clothes off what you would be like for a moment she said nothing her look embarrassed no longer direct im sorry you said no more playacting its what i was thinkingwhat it would be like she nodded slightly all right she said and turned to the rail which meant what anything but her back was to me like a finger to the lips and i said nothing we rode that way both facing the palazzos after we tied up at accademia i took her arm and we crossed the gangplank in the open square in front of the old convent we stood bareheaded surrounded by umbrellas what time do you get off for lunch one go and look at the pictures all morning she smiled some people take days and now its the best timeno ones there you can stand in front of the house of levi as long as you want a jewish picture no the last supper but veronese put in a drunk and dwarfs and the pope said it waswhat profane so he changed the title italian accommodation hypocrisy well we had good teachers she looked up at me serious it wont be like that with us will it no pretending just what it is i nodded so youve decided when i saw you this morning i leaned forward dont go to work no one oclock she said then reached up and put her hand on my chest get a room i felt a twitch like a spurt of blood my house is no somewhere no one knows us not here near the station one of those places you can afford that she said with a small smile youre a rich american i bent over to kiss her but she stopped me pushing against my chest her eyes playful later she said you can think what it will be like we became lovers that afternoon in one of those hotels off the lista di spagna that put up students with backpacks and salesmen from padua the vaporetto ride had seemed endless dripping umbrellas and anxious looks not talking the few blocks on foot worse umbrellas forcing everyone to walk singlefile in the narrow calles in the room past the sour desk clerk we were suddenly shy like the students who usually stayed there and then she slipped off her jacket with the sliding movement id imagined and hung it in the armoire and turned to me and i understood that i was to unbutton her blouse and i began fingering it feeling the warmth underneath until finally she put her hand over mine guiding it to each button so that we did it together it had been so long since id had sex at least with anyone id wanted that it felt curiously like a first timetentative and then urgent wanting to get it right but too hurried to find a rhythm we hung up all her clothes an efficiency that became a tease then a kind of ritual and when we were naked i started running my hand over her slowly wanting to touch every part of her but when i reached down she was already wet and after that we fell on the bed both in a rush without the suit she was round her skin soft but her movements were still direct the way i knew theyd be never coy reaching out to pull me into her just what it is skin on skin without nuance firsttime sex so hungry tongues and sweat and a hurrying you cant stop over too soon we lay for a minute finally not moving still together panting then she reached up and pushed my hair from my forehead i dont have to go back she said no i said feeling myself hard again we have lots of time im sorry i no no me too now we can start and this time it was slower almost lazy so that i felt her around me not plunging in and out everything slick but taking the time to feel the moist hidden skin the secret part of her afterward we lay in a tangle exhausted but not wanting to stop touching each other what did you tell them at the accademia that i was sick everyone is sick in venice in the winter my god listen to that no wonder the rain had grown stronger a real downpour now noisy against the window but it makes it nice in here i said the cheap hotel room suddenly a refuge yes and freezing she said pulling a sheet up around her no let me look at you ill keep you warm she moved closer talking into my shoulder its the first time since i came back you forget how peaceful after the perfect happiness of sex drowsy and full something you think happens only to you i feel honored i said teasing why me i told you i liked your looks thats right my looks she raised herself on one elbow and you do you like mine i shook my head your mind she looked at me puzzled until i smiled its an american joke dont worry i like everything here and here she wriggled away from my hand but stayed close did you have a girl in germany no why not i felt sorry for them you cant when you feel sorry for somebody sorry for germans they were hungry living in cellars so theyd do anythingeven make you think they liked you how would you feel dont ask me that i cant feel sorry for germans anyway i didnt go with anybody i said moving away from it maybe i was waiting i brushed a lock of her hair behind her ear ha more romantics she was running her fingers across my chest an idle examination no marks were you wounded no i pushed paper not so dangerous so you never killed anybody no germans no did you who would i kill i dont know the man at the camp maybe she stopped running her fingers and sat up turning toward the window he kept me alive i was grateful to him imagine being grateful to someone like that imagine what the others were what happened to him he was killed after the germans left maybe by partisans it was like that those first weeks she turned to me you dont mind about him no why should i mind some men she paused i saw his body dead i felt nothing after all that nothing maybe you get used to it all the killing thats the problem you think you want to kill them all where do you stop the guard who pushed the children on the train yes him then why not the ones watching why not everybody and then youre like them youre not like them she looked up at me everybodys like them no were not i said putting my hand on her shoulder and pulling her down to the bed leaning over her anyway its over yes she reached up touching my neck i wanted to know if it would always feelthe way it was with him does it she shook her head good lets make sure the afternoon went on like that stroking each other and then excited again grabbing at flesh in a kind of fury and then dozing off drugged with sex hearing the rain in our half sleep even when it was finished we kept touching lightly not wanting to arouse each other but unable to take our hands away once during a break in the storm i dressed and ran out for a bottle of wine half afraid that when i got back shed be taking her clothes out of the armoire the mood broken but she was still there sheet pulled up just over her breasts im sick remember i have to spend the day in bed she said while i poured the wine youre soaked not for long i said taking my wet clothes off and climbing back in clinking glasses so a picnic finally oh on the lista di spagna you should see the water out there well be our own island in a few hours she looked at me over the glass thats nice to say that we slept finally lulled by the wine and the steady rain her back curved into me and when i woke the sound of running water was coming from the tub there was a thin light under the door i got up and looked out the window not really late but already dark as if the waterlogged city had simply given up and turned out the lights i dont know if theres enough hot water for two she said when i went into the bathroom it was already getting cool do you mind i thought at your house thats all right ill just watch i said sitting on the edge of the tub the room was spare the bathmat just a skinny towel thrown on the cold linoleum whatever steam there had been was now gone from the flat mirror over the basin one look then im getting out she said pulling herself up and posing with her hand on her hip a kind of burlesque wiggle then folding her arms across her chest in a shiver oh this cold here i said wrapping one of the thin towels around her as she stepped out i held her for a minute letting the towel blot the water then began rubbing her dry with another one come back to bed its warm no its late have dinner no its time to go home i have to keep respectable hours for the neighbors she said slipping on her underpants and hooking her bra to be respectable youre not i said smiling she came over and put her hand in my hair i used to be i picked up my shorts all right ill take you home no not tonight she looked at me its better you stay here what am i going to do here you can watch she slipped on her skirt her face sly as if she knew this covering up would turn erotic each simple move even lifting a blouse from its hanger a secret between us her body something only we knew more ours than ever as she hid it from everyone else piece by piece she came over to the bed and looked down and you want to go on the vaporetto she leaned down taking my erection in her hand while she kissed me sometimes you know when its like this we want to think its something else but its not its just what it is thats all its enough for me what it is you understand she ran her fingers up the side of my penis then moved her hand away i nodded thank you she said for the day for the room tomorrow i said she looked at me then smiled but somewhere nearer ill have to go back to work not all day like this anything the gritti no somewhere cheap with sheets like this she gestured toward the rumpled bed so we dont care what we do i got up to follow grabbing part of the sheet to cover myself making her giggle very funny well it is though how is that so serious and then its funny you think its funny for the animals no but they dont go home early either she laughed one oclock i went over to the window and waited to see her come out below the wide shoulders of her coat as she moved into a line of umbrellas people hurrying home from work none of them turning around to look back none aware that anything had happened chapter two my mother picked that evening when my head was groggy still flooded with sex to put her foot down about dinner with gianni hes going to think youre avoiding him i waited until the last possible minute where have you been anyway looking at art art im not avoiding him im just tired youre always tired she bit her lip do this for me would you sweetie i dont want to have to make apologies again its rude aside from anything else well i cant go like this i said patting my soaked jacket everything crumpled like the sheets it occurred to me that i might even smell of it the whole sweaty afternoon i have to wash my mother sighed all right meet us at harrys ill send the taxi back and tell him to wait you wont even need the traghetto but darling quickly please all right chopchop what do you want me to wear i said looking at her primped even some of her good jewels were going to the monaco so something decent you know not the uniform please that wasnt funny at all at mimis how do you think it makes them feel it was the only thing i had at the time well not at the monaco god forbid she looked at me youre not going to be in a mood are you promise actually im in a good mood i can see the art no doubt she raised an eyebrow i can smell the wine from here go easy at harrys as long as youre doing this you might as well make a good impression hes nervous about you why because youre the only family i have you know what italians are like about families what about aunt edna she laughed darling shes what i use when i want to get out of something i looked at her what do you want to get into she turned away picking up her purse nothing i just want us to have a nice dinner she looked back i live here now you know gianni is a good friend its not too much to ask no you used to be so charming i suppose its the war it seemed such an extraordinary thing to say that for a minute i couldnt think how to answer but she had caught my look you know what i mean i knowwell i dont know thats the problem but you never say either and anyway its over thats the main thing now look at the time im going to be late hell wait she smiled that doesnt make it right she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek dont be long and no politics why what are his politics i havent the faintest idea i never ask and i dont want you to either it always ends in arguments no matter what it is besides its their countrythings never make sense to outsiders all right no politics art art her eyes were laughing full of their old spirit maybe well just talk about you i said smiling what could be more interesting mm what could she said throwing me a look then heading for the stairs below us i could hear the motorboat taxi churning water at the canal steps good thing im going first i can tell him youre adopted i was ready by the time the taxi returned it was still raining and after we rounded the tip of the dogana and headed across to san marco even the lights seemed blurry as if the city were actually underwater the campanile disappeared somewhere in an upper mist and the piazza itself was deserted with nothing to fill the empty space but lonely rows of lamps harrys however was snug and busy all polished wood and furs draped over chairs and eager american voices the bar was hidden behind a line of uniforms officers on leave my mother and gianni were both drinking prosecco their second by the look of the halffilled olive dish ah at last he said getting up im so happy you could come a polite smile genial sorry to hold you up should we just go over i gestured to the door and the monaco just across the calle no no theres time have a drink a waiter appeared summoned apparently by thought well a martini then i said to the waiter ignoring my mothers glance what is the expression gianni said out of wet clothes and into a dry martini he smiled pleased with himself yes i said look theres bertie he was at the far end of the room drinking with a woman in an elaborate hat between us was the usual crowd half of whom had probably been at his party yes we saw him earlier my mother said gianni whos he with principessa montardi really a principessa well the prince was real and she married him her father was in milk products milanese the things you know its a small city we know each other maybe too well ah heres your drink the martini was strong and i felt the heat of it right away pleasant like the warm light of the room bertie had waved the others who vaguely knew us had noticed and now we could retreat to ourselves i felt lightheaded wanting to grin still thinking about the afternoon and thered be tomorrow another room then another afternoons of pure pleasure in germany there had been an army nurse drunk at a party and one german girl who had asked for tinned meat afterward both times sad furtive closed off like the country itself now here everything was pleasuresex and buildings glimmering on the water even harrys green olives i realizedwas it only the martini that i was happy you look like the cat who swallowed the canary my mother said what are you thinking about just how nice this all is youre enjoying venice then gianni said yes very much doesnt everybody most yes i think even we do sometimes he said does it bother you all the visitors no its important for us how else could we live of course you cannot choose your visitors the wehrmacht loved us for their holidays in the spring all the tables in san marco nothing but uniforms their city so that was difficult awful my mother said automatically you have been in germany grace said i nodded whats left of it the bombs you mean the cities are gone flat so thats how it ended for them you see how lucky we are imagine venice he shuddered how long will you stay im not sure yet hes been looking at art my mother said wryly yes then you will never leave there is always more art in venice where have you been the accademia i nodded no ones there this time of year you can look at the house of levi for hours and not have to move really my mother said surprised dr maglione smiled in agreement veronese maybe the finest of them tintoretto its too much sometimes you must see san sebastiano veroneses church yes off the zattere before the maritime station my mother was now looking at me in real surprise aware suddenly that my time here was unknown to her something i did between meals so you know it i can see you dont need me for a guide he said pleasantly now grace he smiled at her he thinks im hopeless my mother said hopeless no i follow those yellow signs with the arrows and i still have no idea where i am they always say per rialto and i never want to go there no especially not there dr maglione said laughing a look passed between them so intimate that i went back to my martini feeling in the way even with my skin still flushed with it i couldnt make the leap from the damp sheets of my own afternoon to whatever time they were remembering i had not imagined anything beyond friendship a way to pass the time and yet there must have been sex maybe even with sweat and gasps open mouths i looked at him now lighting a cigarette thinning gray hair brushed back at the temples intelligent eyes but what did she see he caught my glance meeting my eyes through the smoke in a question turned up at last has he behind me bertie had put a hand on my shoulder hello bertie i said wheres your princess in the loo so i thought id say hello i hate staring at an empty table dont you join us dr maglione said no no shes quick as a bunny usually i dont know how you do it he said to my mother all those layers my mother laughed and where did you get to last night bertie said to me now you see him now you dont i didnt want to interrupt you were about to go into confession and so should you once in a while i know i dont want to be caught unawares between the old stirrup and the ground he looked at me you havent the faintest idea what im talking about do you heathen a fine job youve done grace still he went to the accademia gianni said so maybe that was his church today did you bertie said looking at me letting the phrase hang in the air would you join us for dinner gianni said polite or was he already beginning to tire seeing the evening before us in our odd triangle idling talking about veronese but looking at one another wary pretending to be a family molto gentile but youd never forgive me the boredom of her old hunting days in the piedmont you dont want to hear it i promise you what about you my mother said laughing well i have to one of lifes little crosses the husband was a peach you know funny how people findoh look sharp the inquisition been up to anything i turned to find a thickset man in a natty suit coming toward the table neatly trimmed mustache and shiny face a man who might just have come from the barbers gianni stood up frowning dottore the man said to him then a stream of italian obviously friendly he put his hand on berties arm and signor howard im sorry dont let me interrupt no no my friend mrs miller her son adam grace inspector cavallini cavallini bowed a stage gesture inspector my mother said police inspector yes have you done anything wrong do people tell you he smiled no usually i have to catch them he nodded and touched my hand halfheartedly glancing at dr maglione and he does always bertie said here at harrys my mother said no here i take prosecco offduty he was enjoying my mother you dont think it would disturb the customers i think it would make their night he laughed then said something in italian to gianni that i took to be a word of approval and bowed a leavetaking to the rest of us signora a great pleasure signor howard you are behaving yourself he wagged his forefinger teasingly me im one of the good as you know practically caesars wife cavallini smiled yes practically he said and headed for the frosted glass door bertie give my mother said interested how on earth do you know him im a foreign national you know we had to report during the war report i thought they locked you up irish passport lovey thanks to me dad so theres that to be said for him anyway convenient being a neutral just then but werent you both not here green as a clover had to be otherwise you know id have had to leave my pictures my house then what yes then what i said he looked at me sharply then back at my mother anyway they couldnt have been nicer came to the house had a drink and that was it never even had to go to the station now that its over i rather miss it the little visits oh bertie you dont mean it hes creepy you dont find him charming bertie said the police gianni smiled police are men too in america maybe its different well ill tell you one thing theyre not drinking at harrys how can he afford it aside from anything else grace dear bertie said that is exactly the sort of question one should never ask not here you mean hes my mother started eyes wide imagining i suppose blackmarket storerooms and goods hidden under raincoats bertie makes a joke i think gianni said calming her its not so expensive one drink even at harrys but imagine a policeman at my mother said still toying with it there she is bertie said spotting the principessa what did i tell you less time than it takes tofresh lipstick too shes a wonder enjoy your dinner he hurried away intercepting her at their table and helping her with her coat we must go too gianni said have you finished your drink he turned surprised to find me looking at him how is it that you know him i said inspector cavallini sometimes they come to the hospital for help medical evidence really my mother said did you ever solve anything gianni smiled not yet shall we go he leaned over to wrap my mothers fur around her shoulder i got up dizzy for a second i pressed against the table for support are you all right he asked a doctors voice i nodded just a drink on an empty stomach i forgot i havent eaten all day too busy looking at art my mother said amusing herself the dining room at the monaco was formal and starchywaiters in black tie silver serving trolleys soft flattering lights gianni made a pleasant fuss ordering us schie and polenta to start a winter specialty then took his time with the wine list i had a cigarette and looked around the rooma light crowd offseason but dressed for an evening out elegant as if they like the quails on the serving cart had somehow been preserved in aspic the room was almost as warm as harrys immune to fuel shortages there were arrangements of winter branches like abstracts of flowers ice buckets the smell of perfume at one point i noticed gianni smiling at my mother and i followed his eyes wanting just for a minute to see what he did and realized that for them the room was somehow erotic not cheap hotels and tepid baths worn sheets and bare skin nothing that had made my afternoon exciting for them the furs and perfume and rich food were part of what sex had become he was looking at money theres something i dont understand i said drawing their attention back to the table is he an inspector now yes of course and he has beeni mean he consulted you on cases so that means he was working for the germans technically at the end we were an occupied country but hes police not a doctor or a waiter or something police why hasnt he been thrown out for doing what enforcing german laws and before that fascist laws yes you can say it well who knows if he enforced them he tasted the wine the waiter hovering yes very nice we said nothing as the waiter poured but if he didnt what makes you think hell enforce new ones now gianni smiled well its a question yes but you see you make the problem for yourself i dont expect him to enforce themnot too many anyway just the ones we need to live the others we bow we tip our hat we ignore shall we make a toast to happier times yes my mother said raising her glass we clinked glassescelebrating what youre still troubled by this gianni said looking at me but if he was a police officer he must have been a fascist i mean in the party gianni nodded it was required but what was in his heart i dont know people do things to survive so we must give them the benefit of the doubt innocent until proven guilty my mother said lightly gianni smiled well innocent maybe that goes too far he looked at me i understand what you mean but how can i explain it to you to live underyou know the word tyranny is from the latin tyrannus so we have known how to live with this for a long time you bend maybe you think we bend too much but we look at history and it tells us the important thing is to survive he opened his hand gesturing and we did now with this good wine in this beautiful city all still here still beautiful its the germans who have gone we survived them too for us its a kind of strength to bend he paused when its inevitable like the house of levi i said thinking to myself what my mother said it was the last supper he changed the title because the pope didnt like it the inquisition didnt like it gianni said more nazis torture burnings worse sometimes castrating people you learn how to bend with a history like ours but that was a question of belief you think goebbels didnt believe any of them right up to the end they believed in something i dont know whattheir own hate maybe and when the inquisition lit the fires under people what did they believe to save them by killing them compared to the church the nazis were amateurs at least the nazis didnt ask you to think they were right to do it they didnt care what you thought he studied his wine forgive me no more speeches but your paintingdoes it matter what its called so long as its beautiful no you see an italian answer and veronese you know he was also being a tiny bit naughty putting all that in the dwarfs the drinking a sacred scene he knew what they would think but thats italian too maybe to tweak the nosethats right tweak of the church you can do that if you bend the germans never understood thatthey never bend and they destroy themselves why he shook his head northern people sometimes they are all a mystery all of us my mother said flirting oh you certainly a great mystery but thats because youre a woman all women are mysteries a stage courtliness the two of them practically winking at each other the polenta arrived covered in tiny brown shrimp from the lagoon funny about bertie knowing him my mother said he was careful with him did you notice ill bet it wasnt half as easy as he makes out during the war no not for anyone gianni said of course bertie has many friends i dont think it was dangerous for him irish my foot my mother said laughing to herself she glanced over at gianni her face soft not just a dinner companion someone to take charge of the wine list in germany you were a soldier gianni said keeping the conversation going g intelligence we investigated germans suspected of nazi activity ah that explains your interest in cavallini one investigator to another eh you want to compare methods he was smiling ours was mostly pushing paper around he laughed so was his i think but it must have been difficult yes surely the real nazis would lie so how do you know we dont always thats what makes it difficult impossible maybe maybe we still have to try but why the war is over their crimes arent ah a passion for justice he said nodding a paternal indulgence maybe youll be a lawyer maybe oh darling really my mother said i havent wanted to ask youve seemedat such loose ends dont rush gianni said to be this age its wonderful you dont have to decide anything not yet not like us eh he said to my mother we have to hurry with everything now speak for yourself ah you see he said ostensibly to me how she makes fun of me his hand moved slightly toward hers and just grazed it i looked away did you always want to be a doctor i said well for me it was different a family tradition one of us was for medicine and one forwell to carry the name but he died so its the end i have only a daughter youre married i said not expecting this i was she died im sorry where is your daughter bologna at the university medicine he smiled no an avvocato another one with a passion for justice how did it happen he said to my mother to have such children think of theirs would you like to see the hospital gianni said to me not an offhand invitation an obvious effort to get closer the hospital for the architectural interest it was once the scuola di san marco near zanipolo the library has the most beautiful ceiling in all of venice yes id like that i said the only possible answer even the hospitals my mother said a little dreamy finding romance in everything now the joke is that you can see san michele from the wardsthe cemetery island so they say the doctors finish you and the priests at san lazzaro bless you and the boat outside takes you away one operation door to door he winked at my mother you see how practical we can be and so it went through the grilled branzino the radicchio from trevisio the little cups of coffee and the shared plate of biscottilight aimless conversation meant to make us easy with one another a kind of wooing my mother was happy enjoying herself her eyes shiny catching the light the way her earrings did in tiny glints she made jokes laughed at his until the table seemed as carefree as one of those afternoons at the lido gianni looked at her with a fondness that surprised and then disconcerted me and i who was the object of the wooing sat wondering why they were bothering what did it matter what i thought if they wanted to make eyes at each other and play at being twenty again what could be nicer a season in venice with something to talk about later over drinks at the plaza an old friend not somebody shed picked up in a hotel lounge with a daughter at the university that respectable what business was it of mine the truth was that i didnt want to think about them at all my mind was elsewhere back at the station hotel in that perfectly hermetic world of sex where no one else existed in the warm dining room with my body loose and tired all i wanted was my own life when we got up to go to the lounge for brandy i took it as my cue to leave gianni would want to sit with my mother in the dim light and look across the water to salute letting the evening settle around them i imagined a kiss tasting of cognac a last cigarette low voiceseverything the lounge was meant for what you paid for but when i suggested going he insisted i stay for a nightcap for some reason it took a while to ordereverything seemed to have slowed down even the waitersand then we drank without saying much there were only a few other people and a piano near the door played so softly it seemed the pianist too was logy with food and drink gianni fixed a time next week for me to go to the hospital he sat back with a cigarette looking contented outside the hotel gondolas with differentcolored tarps bobbed on the tide i slouched exhausted there was nothing to do now but wait it out such a surprise darling a lawyer so sensible its just an idea i said but she waved her hand brushing it away and i saw that she hadnt actually been talking to me but to some unseen audience i looked over hearing the abstract selfamused talk of drink my mother like all her friends had a strong head but it had been a long evening since the first prosecco through giannis special bottle of soave and the vin santo at table her words were still precise but everything else about her seemed to have grown a little blurry even her lipstick was no longer fresh faint at the lines she was nestled into the corner of the settee her fur draped around her smiling in love with the world its late i said we should go oh adam she said teasing so sensible if youre tired gianni said to me dont worry i will take her home shes happy here you see maybe too happy i said to him not loud enough for her to hear there is no such thing as too happy gianni said mildly i will see that she gets home firmly a dismissal can i call you a taxi no thats all right i said getting up thanks for dinner oh youre going my mother said evidently a new idea to her she leaned forward to be kissed i bent over for a quick peck and as i stood back i stopped suddenly dismayed seeing once again what gianni must be seeing not a carefree girl this time but a woman slack with drink pliable draped against the couch her soft white throat tilted up what hed waited for all evening what came after brandy did he take a room here part of the monaco service my heart sank a little as i looked at her a physical drop when had this happened this fading into someone else while id been away not paying attention and each year shed become a little more vulnerable until all it took was a kind word and table manners someone like gianni i looked at him half expecting a leer something predatory but he was smiling blandly at ease with himself what he must be used to another of the lonely women who floated through venice away from home a little drunk easy without daughters at university and family names without anything except money to buy a little pleasure an evening out this one had come with a sonan inconvenience but now hed been charmed too taken care of and he was leaving would they come back to dorsoduro appear at coffee in the morning without even a blush all of us grown up for a second i stood there trying somehow to put myself between them its not what she is i wanted to say to him but wasnt it isnt it what she wanted too who had actually paid for dinner i couldnt remember there being a bill the sort of discreet arrangement a lady might make but how do you protect people and after all what was the harm one of those things unless it wasnt i looked down at her again wondering what bargain she was making with herself a fling but maybe she hadnt even thought about it just followed an impulse the way shed come to a city where she could read menus and street signs but whose real language was unknown to her darling you say youre going then you dont go she said laughing i smiled shaking my head just thinking oh god i held up my hand all right im off dont be too late i said imitating her you dont have to worry gianni said without a hint of guile shes in safe hands the next day i found a hotel near the rialto with cheap offseason rates and a side view of the canal the oldfashioned radiator in the room actually produced heat a luxury that winter so i took the room for a week using a chunk of my separation pay not what the army had intended precisely but in fact the room did finally separate me from the war every afternoon we sealed ourselves away behind the fake damask walls too absorbed in each other to imagine anything outside after that first day we settled into a pattern at one claudia would walk over from the accademiaten minutes if she hurriedand we would make love until she had to go back dressing and leaving me in bed i think it excited her to leave first as if the room were in a brothel and she had somehow bought my time she liked everything about the roomthe touristy murano chandelier the chipped gold paint on the sideboardbecause it seemed to her what such a room should look like a little tawdry worn from years of afternoon sex she never came to my mothers house and didnt want me to go to hers an affair was set apart from real life something you did in hotels i had never had sex with anyone who responded the way she did not just with pleasure or curiosity but the way id seen children eat in germany with a greedy determination to fill themselves up not sure they would ever eat again the afternoons were for both of us a kind of daily feast sampling and tasting day after day in our cheap hideaway room warm with radiator heat we slid against each other slick with sweat until finally exhausted we felt the world begin to come back a little then she would dress and lean over to kiss me in the damp sheets not saying goodbye but fixing a time for tomorrow when wed begin again days of it like this drunk with sex we didnt go out for dinner or have a drink at harrys or meet each other anywhere but at the hotel at first she said she had to be careful she didnt want people at work to know but after a while i realized the secrecy itself the sense of being illicit was erotic to her when she closed the door to the hotel room she could do anything away from everyone even herself then after a few days the afternoons werent enough i wanted to know where she went how she spent her time wanted her in fact to spend it with me i dont want to go to restaurants its nice the way it is but i want to talk to you to know you who knows me better than you do you think im like this with everyone i dont mean that i know what you mean i know you a little now too you like the fans the masks old venice whats wrong with that you know all the fans that was to end up here she said patting the bed so maybe we missed something skipping all that she shook her head no she pulled me down to her do you think we missed something no then its enough here all i did was ask you to dinner i said kissing her i can eat anytime wouldnt you rather do this yes but a few days later i got a chance to force the issue when my mother came down with a cold and gianni now the attending physician offered me his seats at la fenice ive never been claudia said tempted lets do it right well take a gondola ouf a gondola from san isepo with everyone at the window ill take the vaporetto then youll come i always wanted to see it la fenice do you have something to wear we can buy you a dress no you dont buy me a dress im not she turned away i can dress myself even for la fenice i hired the gondola anyway and met her at san marco then maneuvered her into the rocking boat for the short trip through the back canals youre extravagant she said you have to go this way where else can you do it pulling up to the opera in a boat you can also walk she said but smiling as the dark houses glided by surprised to see a different city from this angle under her wool coat she was wearing a long evening dress she said she had made herself gloves and rhinestonestudded slippers whered you get the shoes borrowed a friend keeps them for carnival every year very fancy vulgar she said concerned i smiled at her no fancy perfect the canals got narrower after we drifted past the hotels and began to circle around to the fenice water entrance there was no sound but an occasional snatch of radio and the smack of the steering pole hitting the water a light mist was rising just high enough to soften the lights my god its beautiful like this she said no wonder they come youve lived here all your life not in a gondola its different she turned to me you make me a tourist we turned a corner into a small lighted basin and one of those scenes that gives venice its storybook qualitya traffic jam of boats rocking against one another as people stepped up to the pavement the familiar taxi dropoff made theatrical by the water after the shadowy canals the lights here were festive openingnight bright catching jewels and white silk scarves you see its another city people like that she said a woman covered in white fur was being handed up to a footman never mind theyll all be looking at you whos that up there in the box its a box whose a friend of my mothers a rich american no venetian not rich either a doctor my father was a doctor he didnt have a box at la fenice this one had doges in the family oo la a doges box i smiled at her you dont believe me you yes maybe not him then our gondola reached the entrance and i had to help her out and tip the gondolier and her attention shifted to the crowd inside we took the stairs to the second tier and followed the number plates to giannis box every light in the theater seemed to be on making the redandgold walls glow almost burning we were the first to arrive so took the seats nearest the rail who else is coming claudia said i dont know maybe he has the whole thing here let me take your coat a minute she said reaching into the pocket and pulling out a fan then opening it her eyes lowered in a mock flirtation over the edge like this whered you get it with the shoes a carnival costume not that though i said nodding at the brooch on the front of her dress no my mothers a friend hid it hid it when i was away she went to the edge of the box and leaned forward taking in the scene like gulps of air below people were settling in and looking around nodding to one another testing their opera glasses everyone smiling expectant look at them like birds she said her eyes darting around the theater i glanced downthe dresses in fact were as bright as feathersthen over at her her dress a dark blue clinging fabric gathered at the waist would have been dull without the pin but it opened at the neck in a way that drew your eyes upward toward the face flushed and eager and her hair had been pulled back exposing her ears making her look even younger a different claudia girlish and wideeyed not the woman in the hotel room how many others were there she caught my stare and pulled up the fan again giggling having fun oh you brought glasses she said as i lifted them out of my pocket can i see please suddenly twelve i watched her as she scanned the audience theres rusconi from the accademia my god what a wife two of him do you think signor howards here no idea i said still watching her face tilted up now as she took in the upper tier where do they all come from she said you always hear its a small town but i dont know any of them maybe its small to them same people the musicians are coming she said almost fidgeting now with anticipation there was a final rustle of feathers below as the lights dimmed for the overture then the music started and i moved my chair closer to hers she was sitting erect years of table manners and piano lessons a wellbroughtup girl the back of her neck was pale and thin and when i reached to touch it with my fingers she turned with a shy smile as if in fact wed been flirting over fans the opera was cosi fan tutte and since the program notes were in italian beyond my guidebook vocabulary i just sat back and listened not even bothering to follow the story real fans and fullskirted gowns began to appear on the stage below as natural there as the giltandred wallpaper how did they stage tragedies in a room like this nothing worse than mistaken identity and harmless jealousy could happen here when claudia leaned over to whisper theyre pretending to be albanians i almost laughed out loud at the silliness of it then felt a kind of giddy release even claudia was smiling broadly almost grinning maybe the way she used to be all the time after the piano lessons the four lovers were singing an ensemble piece when the door opened behind us i turned to find a middleaged woman in a prewar evening gown trailed by a whitehaired man with a bushy furcollared coat like the cartoon plutocrat on monopoly cards everything about her was lacqueredglistening lipstick and nails dress shiny with beadwork she looked at us her eyes moving from surprise to displeasure in a second obviously put out to find strangers in her box i got up gesturing to my frontrow seat but she waved her hand in a kind of dismissal pretending to be concerned about distracting the people next to us and took the chair behind we spent the rest of act i speculating about one anotheronly claudia in all that rustling and craning of necks seemed to be paying attention to the operabut it was only when the interval finally came that we could stand and introduce ourselves in the light their name was montanari i mentioned gianni and insisted that the woman move to the front row but she was interested only in claudia now literally going over her from head to foot eyes cold and superior behind the public smile then she raised her head finished with that peculiar satisfaction of finding someone wanting claudia who had started with a polite nod moved back a little against the rail caught by the womans gaze her color suddenly draining away grassini the woman said carefully repeating claudias name as if she were trying to place her the way her eyes had judged the rhinestone slippers cheap the dress ordinary everything somehow wrong and for a second i saw it too not the young skin and high spirits that had made everything seem right before but someone found out in the wrong box there are tiny moments that change the nature of things i glanced at signora montanari the withering stupid eyes and suddenly i wanted to fold up claudia in some protective cape safe so that no one could look at her again i touched her hand at the rail asking her to read my face never mind about the dress never mind about any of it youre not just someone i sleep with but claudias color had come back and with it her assurance yes grassini she said evenly perhaps you knew my father abramo grassini the woman blinked ah abramo no she turned to me and youre a friend of giannis she said still assessing yes i said easily hes with a patient im sorry about the seat will you have a drink with us no no were meeting some people she gathered up her cloak eager now to leave please she said evidently offering us the run of the box what was that all about i said when shed left she knows im a jew claudia said dont be silly how could she possibly know she just doesnt want to share the box no she knows once you see the look you dont forget it she picked up the fan opened it and put it against her face well so much for this lets go she reached for her coat later i said right now were going downstairs and have some champagne then well come back and listen to the rest she doesnt want me here well i do would you rather please her she looked up a small smile one grandfather its easy for you but for me its notcomfortable ill sit between you come on lets have some champagne i held out my hand to her tell me the rest of the story why theyre pretending to be albanians another smile its our box i said taking her hand were not leaving in the end it was the montanaris who left midway through the second act after fiordiligi sang in the garden by the sea signora montanari had taken the rail seat next to claudia and it may be that she finally realized distressed how they must appear from belowone young her pale skin catching the stage lamps the other expensive and brittle attractive now only to men on monopoly cards or it may be this was just my idea the story i made up as signor montanari nodded off at my side but when fiordiligi finished and signora montanari made an apologetic headache motion and slipped out with her surprised husband under the applause i felt as if we had won something i moved down to the rail seat weve run them off claudia shrugged a wry smile one victory for the jews but she seemed happier now relieved and the music went with her buoyant heading into the finale as things sorted themselves out onstage something for everyone it seemed to me that we had gotten our earlier mood back frothy again like the interval champagne outside it was cold and damp and i put my arm around her as we walked you looked lovely just sitting there waiting it out like that it didnt feel lovely bitch probably a fascist too no there arent any havent you heard same thing in germany all disappeared somehow you think its funny no but i spent months chasing them so i know what its like anyway shes gone so lets have a drink the grittis right up heretheyll be open the street was filled with people coming from la fenice wrapped in coats and furs like the shuttered stores no its late all right ill take you home no she said putting a gloved hand on my chest ill go it was wonderful the opera she looked up so shall we meet tomorrow i want to go home with you why you cant wait not for that i stopped its not that what i put my hand up to the side of her neck i dont want to skip anything i want to take you to dinner out like this i want to spend the night with you see you sleep what you look like wake up make coffee all of it not skip anything dont say that she said softly lowering her head i dont want that yes you do everybody does she shook her head no i dont you mean not with me she looked up then turned away its not enough for you just to what you know i smiled something she couldnt say not even in the hotel where anything was possible a wellbroughtup girl go to bed she said still not saying it its not enough no ha since when you were happy enough to i brushed back a lock of her hair things change i want to be with you thats all no i cant she said moving my hand away i dont want anybody oh what a judge i am i see you i think yes nicelooking american they never stay they go home no problems you want me to leave she looked down biting her lip no oh its difficult explain it explain it so easy some little talk over a drink she met my eyes i dont want anything more its better for me how could it be better its better safer she hesitated sometimes do you know what i think you see another one of your cases back in germany you want to make everything all right again maybe thats why you want to be with me you think you can change what happened but do you know how it really was when people think youre going to die you dont exist for them anymore you disappear become nothing that first train none of them even looked i thought this is what its like theres nobody else then not even you so you live here she said pointing to her skin and here her eyes food whatever makes you feel alive reminds you what its like even pain sometimes just to feel it but not here now her chest nothing here you have to stay safe from what the others everybody theyll leave you alone if youre playing dead you think you can get through the rest of it if you do that but then its hard coming back you cant do it all at once just seeing things eating simple things thats all i can do not people its not like that anymore maybe yes maybe no anyway how do you know it didnt happen to you no to know that everyone wants you dead your friend didnt no he didnt want me dead he wanted she stopped then breathed out almost a snort people you know what he wanted he wanted me to like it it wasnt enough for him just to do it he wanted me to like it to like him what he could do to me he wanted to hear it so you pretended well we can do that make sounds its what they like so she looked down and then sometimes it would happen even with him i could feel it in me beginning and i couldnt stop it with that pig id feel it anywayyou couldnt take your mind far enough away it would happen and he knew he wanted it like that at first i was so ashamed and thenthen it was a way of being alive so i let it happen maybe thats worse knowing it can happen with anyone like animals so what does it matter who does it matter where food comes from its all the same it doesnt feel the same to me no no its not like with anyone else ha how many dont i said stopping her im not him no you think its so different you want me to like it too yes all right i do i like it with you so you can be happy tell your friends in new york im not him i said again holding her shoulders its different she looked down but im not im the same im the same in fossoli no what happened to you its still happening to me all those feelings the hate at first you want to kill all of them and you cant even kill one not one and then you know what happens i think you start killing yourself you have to kill someone and theres no one else stop i said placing my finger in front of her mouth without touching it yes stop she said whats the good of all this she twisted her mouth not what you expected is it such talk a girl you met at a party youre not just a girl at a party yes i am she said pretending to be light but i was shaking my head no what happened to her signora montanari looked at her dress she met my eyes a little startled then looked down my poor dress so what happened then i knew i was in love with you oh she said only a sound her head bent you dont mean that she said quietly you dont even know me yes i do everything about you right then oh all in one look youre being i know all right not everything just enough what does it mean to say something like that what it always means i want to be with you i lifted her head ill take italian lessons she smiled weakly her eyes troubled no go to america your life is there not all this she spread her hand but thank you to say that the opera even i didnt expect she leaned and kissed me on the cheek a flutter of breath its a good time to stop while its all still nice i reached for her but she put her hand on my chest again no go i cant walk away from you no all right me then she said her hand trembling she looked up dont follow im all right on my own she said then turned and started walking i dont believe you i said to her back i dont believe its all the same for you no answer but the click of her heels on the stone tell me it was the same yes the same she said not turning around still walking then she stopped her shoulders drooping a long quiet no she said finally i stood for a minute then started moving toward her gently as if she were a bird that still might be scared off i stepped around to face her not saying anything she looked up her eyes still uneasy not the same i said softly no she said the word not much more than a breath then lets go home i said stepping closer our faces almost touching youre so sure how can you be so sure about this we can get a taxi at the gritti i said putting my arms around her feeling her head fall against my shoulder is that all right a taxi she nodded resting against me to the gardens not to the house signora bassi the owner she lives there too the noise we were quiet in the taxi as if signora bassi were already listening the room was plain up a staircase at the side of the house overlooking the small misty canal and a back calle full of clotheslines we stayed quiet in the room not making love just holding each other in bed i did get to see her asleep hours later in the predawn when i usually tried to make out the redentore and wonder how i was going to spend the day now in the light from the window all i could make out was the sewing machine and a dressmakers dummy her own shape standing straight and purposeful the way she had at berties party and in some wonderful way i saw there were two of them nowthe public tailored claudia at the window and the one only i knew whod stepped out of the dummy to crawl into the warmth beside me chapter three the library ceiling was as beautiful as gianni had promised early sixteenth century he said not a boast just placing it the carving is the best in venice i think of course today its difficult to see the morning had been dismal and even the long side windows were not much helpthe library seemed barely lit but the ceiling turned the patchy light to its advantage forcing you to look at it carefully follow its intricate lines into shadow only venice could have a hospital like this a converted scuola grande whose facade was crowded with trompe loeil and marble panels the entrance hall was a soaring space with pillars as damp and gloomy as an old church filled with the ghosts of shivering consumptives but beyond it the working hospital was bright and uptodate with wards and nurses stations and xray rooms what youd see anywhere and now the old medical library which gianni had saved for last a special finale not as grand as the sansovino staircase he was saying but i think more beautiful the proportions its wonderful is it still used in theory in practice no now itsa treasure locked away i said as he closed the door and we started down the stairs yes otherwise his voice drifted off in the drafty hall where families had begun to arrive for visiting hours i feel privileged gianni accepted this with a nod then smiled good and now are you hungry i dont want to take you away from your work no no its all arranged a restaurant very near we can talk about what i wondered but gianni was all smiles and affability clearly wanting to please quite a hospital i said looking at the facade again as we came out well the scuola was suppressedi cant remember whyand so there was a big public building to use not so practical maybe for modern times but in venice nothing is practical so you adapt the facilities are good and of course its pleasant every day to see it he pointed to one of the reliefs saint mark helping antinus who a beggar in alexandria the series is saint marks life but i always think if you didnt know it could be a doctor helping the sick appropriate yes who knows maybe lombardo had a presentiment that it would be a hospital he smiled anyway its an idea what happened during the war i mean was it a military hospital no it was never a war zone here you know behind the lines its a kind of peace things keep going the hospital too there was always food in the south with the fighting it was different terrible shortages here at least no one starved we could manage we were crossing a bridge out of the campo and he indicated the houses on the other side of the canal with their running sores of fallen plaster but no paint no wood nothing like that see there no repairs not for years the city is falling apart of course the visitors for them its always falling apart they love the decay your mother thinks that dont fix it its all part of the charm well maybe its lucky for me she thinks that way at my age im falling apart too i laughed the expected response you know we have become good friends he said i kept walking not sure how i was meant to answer she has a gift for that i think a rare quality to make people happy here we are he turned toward a door no getting out of it now but what excuse could i have found the restaurant was in the little campo that faced santa maria dei miracoli in summer there would be tables outside people writing postcards and looking up at the marble walls now it was a poky room with a bar in front and just enough space in back to be intimate without being noisy gianni was evidently a regular known to the waiter you like granchi gianni said to me he says its the special today yes fine i said toying with my fork already uncomfortable wine i cant but if you like no waters fine for a minute or so we watched the waiter pour the mineral water im glad we have the chance gianni said to meet like this leaning forward opening yes thank you i said steering away for the ceiling especially i never would have seen it otherwise by the way ive been meaning to askwho are the montanaris his forehead wrinkled for a second then cleared ah in the box who are they they made an impression on you the other way around i dont think they approved they left early gianni laughed again they always leave early they come for the interval to see her friends the music he brushed away the idea with his hand ah the crabs he said leaning back for the waiter i just wondered who i began but hed moved on from the montanaris speaking before i could finish i wanted to talk to you he said and then stopped he sipped some water hesitant as if he were putting the words together in his head you know i admire your mother very much i waited very much he said again we have a love for each other this seems strange to you maybe at your age i remember it is impossible to think this happens afterwhat thirty forty to have these feelings but we do sometimes even more so we cant be so careless anymore we know how valuable to find someone youre embarrassed that im talking this way to you its not that yes embarrassed i think its my english what i want to say look the point is you dont have to say anything if you and my motherits none of my business but now yes thats what im trying to tell you it is your business now we want to marry what blurting it out as if i hadnt heard properly yes to marry youre surprised but why i said another involuntary response not even thinking why because we have a love for each other yes buti mean why not just go on as you are while it lasts you dont understand my feelings for her do you think i have no respect for her position affronted as if id stepped over some cultural divide it hasnt bothered you up to now he raised his eyebrows then softened thats what you thinki take advantage you know we are not children maybe it wasa convenience for both now its something else when was all this decided he shrugged some days ago now you dont decide all at once and she didnt tell me dont be angry with her i wanted to tell you she was a little nervous how to say it and you know its traditional he said smiling for the man to approach the family youre asking for my blessing im asking you to be happy for us its important to grace for you to be happy its important to me too this last was a question he was looking at me waiting for me to nod give some assent when is all this supposed to happen as soon as we can arrange it while you are still here and youll live here of course its my home and now yours whenever you like i know youll be in america but youll come back sometimes where we live there is always a home for you too on her money the thought always buried somewhere now flashed to the surface would they stay at ca venti no he must have his own the family house plaster crumbling untended these last few years the daughter with bills in bologna cognacs at the monaco all paid for now taken care of with the scratch of her pen across a check he was smiling at me again intimate the same easy charm that must have taken her in gray hair sober suit not even youngno warning signals at all you dont say anything im just trying toits a lot in one gulp i didnt expect you know neither did we not at first it all just seems a little fast to decide something like this i mean its only been i let it hang there waiting for him to finish but instead he smiled again only the young have so much time at our age its better to hurry and you know the wedding thats your mothers idea to have it before you go back to america she wants you tosuch an expressionto give her away the father does that well the family why not the son i shrugged good shell be pleased but it was gianni who was pleased smiling broadly and i realized that in his mind i had somehow consented given in and could now be brought into the planning there would be an engagement party a friend had offered to perform the ceremony i picked at my crab and half listened to one detail after another the whole impossible scheme already worked out discussed while id been somewhere else now there was nothing to be said and later i saw the sensible talk with my mother back at ca venti straining to stay calm the inevitable hysterics bertie would be betterone of his bracing hearttohearts i wondered if he already knew could get to her before things spun completely out of control and sense became a kind of public embarrassment gianni was ordering espresso another endless meal and talking about a trip but perhaps it was better just to stay in venice there were so many details to arrange to get the house ready for my mother repairs he wanted to make a new decorating scheme theyd discussed it might be better to go away later a long trip somewhere new what they must have talked about over brandies their new life together maybe even america gianni was saying its many years now since i was there many changes shed give a party to introduce him to her friends the whispered conversations later did you see what grace picked up in italy no longer just impulsive a figure of fun i went all the way across to california a wonderful country he had put some bills on the saucer and was standing up smiling at me and now americans in the family he said airily and as i folded my napkin trying to smile back i felt the real implications of his news rush over me like a prickling of the skin not just a folly not just one of those things all our lives changed one way or another outside the sun was shining just enough to brighten the marble on the church we started back toward the hospital gianni full of more plans i tried to keep up an eggshell politeness but my mind was elsewhere so distracted that i didnt even look at the group of gis coming over the bridge just felt the sudden hand on my shoulder hey adam i didnt recognize you in your civvies i blinked for a second taking in the breezy american voice the sound of my own life coming back joe what are you doing here seeing the sights im over in verona but they let us out once in a while still chasing rats rat files some of kesselrings boys they come up for trial next month and they left a paper trail all the way to verona so somebodys got to look you know but youwhat is it a month now two what the hell are you still doing over here my mother lives here lives here people live here for now anyway i said then stopped suddenly aware of gianni at my side oh sorry joe this is dr maglione hes who was he now exactly my mothers fiance my new stepfather looking at joes open gi face i felt giannis foreignness for the first time was she prepared for this years of not quite getting jokes living half in translation a friend of my mothers i said gianni joe sullivan lieutenant gianni said decoding the bar on his collar and shaking his hand you see people do live here a few of us sorry i didnt oh no sometimes even i think were all visitors here of course verona its different youre enjoying it there now he was charming joe second nature well enjoying it beats germany anyway you were friends in the army g bloodhound detachment sniffing for nazis happy days huh he said to me every single one when do you get out never they like my accent maybe june though memphis in june like the song says he glanced at the group behind him too large to introduce well id better push live here i wish id knowncadge a bed next time you need one tonight no thats all right we got a special deal at the bauer cant get away from the krauts huh he said grinning come have a beer if you can were there a few days nice meeting you he said to gianni he jerked his thumb toward the city behind him quite a place youve got here gianni didnt react just watched him go then started again for the hospital hes a good friend we worked together finding the nazis thats who decides he just finds them someone else decides i paused he likes to kid around but hes not as dumb as he sounds i didnt meanwell perhaps a little the world is simple for him sometimes it is simple you think so i never find it that way look at us we have lunch happy news but for you i think not so simplea little difficult even who is this man you worry about your mother yes you do its natural what can i say to make you feel easy there hasnt been time for us to become friends later i hope for now i only ask you to be happy because we are happy if shes happy fine but you are still uneasy he said watching me as we walked i just dont understand the why of it why notbe the way you are and not marry you mean why marry now so late not for children to make a family not forwhat propriety we dont have to be respectable your mother and i no one cares not even you it seems a half smile so why i wish i could tell you exactly sometimes i think to marry is a kind of insurance what for old age if one of you dies another thing i hadnt considered what if no not so pragmatic i think a way to ensure the love does not go away to make it feel permanent even if its not sometimes you know it is dont you wish this for us i hesitated embarrassed but we were coming down the bridge into the campo and gianni turned to me not waiting for an answer its late for us to be a family you dont need a father i dont ask that but your mother must have her son so you and i we must try to be friends will you do that of course i never said no but how you feel thats something else i looked away how does your daughter feel well thats next i do the warmup on you he smiled amused either by the phrase or by the idea that i was the easier of the two she will be suspicious who is this woman what does she want like you but the reverse the other side you see nothing is simple when there are two sides and there are always two at least but all of them smiling at the wedding eh he took my hand be easy everything will be fine you have my word ill hold you to that i said pleasantly meeting his eyes he nodded and turned toward the hospital i started across the square relieved to get away but when i was past the equestrian statue i glanced back over my shoulder and saw that he had stopped to look back too we stood for a minute like that turning the space between us into a mirror watching each other as it happened mimi had come to lunch at berties and was still there when i arrived adam bertie said you might have let me know theres not a crumb left no ive eaten hows grace mimi said kissing my cheek flourishing so they say she said her eyes almost twinkling have you met him yes youre just dropping in then bertie said slightly annoyed darling dont be dense mimi said too late for lunch too early for a drink he wants to chat which means ill be in the way so id better be going she turned to me maybe you can talk some sense into him hes being pigheaded as usual wont help with the ball wont even come pigheaded and youre being wicked bertie said pecking her on the cheek a ball during lent yes and theyre all dying for a break everyonell come youll see not everyone hm you and the holy father fasting at home its too ridiculous you know youre dying to come bertie smiled its a closerun thing very bad of you to tempt all right im off she gathered up her purse and gloves looking at me so whats he like im dying to know who who dr kildare oh gianni hes too old for you i said kissing her goodbye a throaty laugh flirtatious bertie ive been dismissed he must have got that from you that outthedoor charm what if i got the monsignor to come would that make a difference bertie was walking her out of the room not even the pope its a matter of principle darling arent you funny how would you know she turned at the door dont bother elenas there adam talk to him he just wants coaxing when she was gone bertie came back to the coffee table and lit a cigarette two hours and im exhausted i dont know how she does itshe must sleep the rest of the time now whats on your mind barging in like this only happy thoughts i hope very happy they think so anyway theyre getting married who my mother and dr kildare youre joking he said putting down the cigarette not just surprised but shaken thats what i thought when he told me at lunch but no death do us part surprised for a minute he said nothing just stared at the smoke drifting up marriage he said still taking it in the magliones any of those familiesyou know they dont marry out of unless theyve got a helluva repair bill to take care of what are you talking about money we can whisper if it bothers you he glanced up annoyed sit down and behave yourself whats gotten into you you dont like it either i said sinking onto the couch i can tell just by looking at you im surprised thats all he handed me the cigarette box here now lets take a breath and think a bit this would come after mimiones head just keeps buzzing why marriage theyre in love adam and theres her money oh i dont think so somehow but do you know if he were american id know a hundred things about him all those clues people carry around but herehow much does he have no idea one doesnt in italy im not sure why in france you know right away of course there is the palazzo you know hes not on the dole which they never sell just try to keep up youve been reading things of course they sell how do you think i got mine he watched me light my cigarette thats better get some color back you cant stay shocked you know but you were why dont you like him like him he said uncomfortable hes my doctor what does like have to do with it you invite him to your house he doesnt pee on the carpet adam hes a maglione anyway we were all young together your mother gianni his brother cozy he looked over his lunettes not like that grace adored your father there was never any question of that he paused do you think all the time gianni hard to imagine him he drew on the cigarette back on the lido again a long time to carry a torch dont you think all these years he said to himself what else what what else i dont know who he is what he thinks about things how would i know he had a wife who diedof natural causes he said with exaggeration raising his eyebrows he has a daughter i think whom ive never seen an old name as for what he thinks about things i havent the faintest why dont you ask him yourself after all hes going to be your stepfather not mine he stopped looking slightly embarrassed not having meant to become snappish five minutes ago you were shockedsurprised i said quickly catching his glance now youre throwing rice what exactly is it you expect me to do talk to her talk her out of it you mean no in the first place people never listen shed listen to you no he said shaking his head i wouldnt even try shed never speak to me again and shed be right but its possible its the money isnt it he looked at me not answering then lit another cigarette anythings possible he said then sighed you know its possible shes in love with him or something well call it whatever you like im not shy but shes happy so what does it matter it will when she realizes now i want you to listen to me he said very carefully he paused waiting for me to look at him if you have any sense youre going to take your qualms and leave them right here in this room he patted the cushion next to him your mother has been lonely for years and a grown son off fighting the war isnt much of a substitute which you dont want to be by the way she comes here not even sure why and now shes in love or infatuation or whatever shes in happy for the first time in years it doesnt really matter if hes in love with her or in love with her money he obviously has some regard for her the family names important to a maglione you dont give it to someone if all you want is a bank loan hell give her a life and hell make her happy whatever his motivations are and thats assuming he knows what they are do you know yours i dont want her to get hurt thats all well very nice if thats all it rarely is in my experience but never mind just pack it up with whatever else is floating around up there he said pointing to my head and put it away hell never desert her you know not if shes signora maglione and if hewell everybody goes through a rough patch sooner or later but you never know and heres a chance and shes taking it even if she breaks her heart doing it oh hearts they can take a lot of wear and tear adam dont meddle she wants you to be pleased go home and tell her youre thrilled to death i got up walked over to the windows and looked out at the loggia where you sat on warm days to watch the boats a city so beautiful even the germans agreed not to fight in it what shed have every day it might be all right you know bertie said it really might i walked back to the couch will you do something for me find out what money he has you can ask around you know everybody not his banker i dont and everything else is just gossip lets hope for the best why dont we now smile shell be watching your face to see how youre taking it i made a face well its a start he giggled to himself mimi goodness shell be cross now theres a face id like to see he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes then looked at me adam im right you know so am i and if you are whats the good of it i said nothing none at all he said quietly not for her would you find out about the money anyway and if hes poor as a church mouse then well know yes and youd be right and still wrong for her bertie sighed what a scourge children are he stood up youd better go shell be waiting to hear how lunch went smiles all around right happy families its done chapter four things went wrong with the party from the start there were no flowers to be found not even the scraggly winter asters you usually saw in the rialto market the weather had cleared and then turned sharply cold the wind rushing up the giudecca channel and through the window cracks until even the space heaters felt cool to the touch one of the power cuts that plagued italy that season hit in the afternoon plunging the kitchen into gloom just as angelina sneezing with her permanent cold was trying to arrange the canapes after i spent an hour rounding up candles the lights perversely sputtered back on but since there was no guarantee theyd stay on i spent the whole evening glancing up nervously noah waiting for rain my mother noticed none of it her skin glowed pink part bath steam part happiness while everyone around her turned slowly blue and rubbed their hands by the ineffectual heaters she looked wonderfula new dress with a sequined bolero jacket hair up every bit of her in placeand as i watched her move through the room smiling pecking cheeks i thought for a minute that everything had to be all right how could she be this happy otherwise gianni next to her in a doublebreasted gray suit was smiling too switching from english to italian and back again everybodys friend there were venetians tonight not just berties set and i had a glimpse of what my mothers world would be like nowmimi winking over her martini glass but also the formally polite whitehaired woman holding out her hand for gianni to kiss proper as a doge i wondered how long it could last the romance of it and then i looked at my mothers face beaming and thought why not forever wasnt it what everyone wanted the fairy tale with no glass slipper on her bedroom dressing table i had noticed there were now two pictures me on one side in front of a jeep in germany and gianni on the other bareheaded in the cold on the zattere one more than before not competing not replacing just one more why not be grateful hed come along to fill the extra space why shouldnt we all be happy even the party for all the cold and spotty electricity was working now except that claudia hadnt arrived no dont pick me upill come by myself youll be busy shed said but where was she i dont think we should walk in together still reluctant and now late i took another champagne from a passing tray who are you looking for bertie said hello bertie i thought you didnt go out during lent ill say my beads later i couldnt miss this you should have heard mimi hissing like a puff adder oh these ladies so she knows everybody knows grace never kept a secret in her life but do admit have you ever seen her looking so well not in years happy as a bride i said taking a sip of champagne he looked over his glasses at me and you have you been smiling nonstop i said nodding seen the ring you havent tried to bite it i laughed no its real family apparently his mothers very nice bertie said then sighed oh dear but she does look radiant doesnt she so wheres the harm now what not speeches there had been a tinkling against glass the usual rippling ssh people clustering gianni stood with my mother waiting for quiet then began speaking in italian presumably a welcoming toast received with a few ahs and general approval i just let it roll past me that indistinct liquid sound of someone elses language and looked again around the room where was she he pausedwere we supposed to applaud and then started to repeat the speech in english thanks to us for being there the reason no surprise to anyone whod seen them together the wonderful unexpected thing that had come into his life their double good fortune of which this speech was an example in being able to express joy twice in italian and english the honor she had bestowed on him their hope that all of us would be as happy as they were all said nicely charmingly every note on key more ahs raised glasses a public kiss and finally applause well its done i said raising my glass to bertie cheers god bless he took a drink now what kiss the bride he said pointing to the group forming around my mother theyre not married yet we were starting toward the other end of the room when claudia came through the door she looked slightly flushed as if shed run up the stairs and the color made her pretty more striking than her muted blue dress intended hello theres claudia bertie said surprised with whom i wonder me actually i said suddenly feeling awkward he turned to me eyes peering over his glasses assessing really he said we met at your party you remember and now youve become friends yes he shook his head what a family the guests arent safe with either of you next youll be running off with the help i smiled not yet excuse me i said about to head for the door adam he said stopping me voice lower youre not serious about this bertie some other time she doesnt know anyone in the room well no she wouldnt would she what do you mean by that oh dont snap i just meant it might not be suitable bringing her here what will grace think shell think were friends bertie sighed never mind its always talking to a post isnt it just have a care thats all you dont want things to get complicated rush into things tell her i said nodding toward my mother still hugging people bertie followed my gaze well grace his face softened with fondness shes not the type is she to look behind things well have to keep an eye out for her she was always like that you know always wanted watching so one does somehow he turned back to me but i cant take on two claudia was still near the door looking tentative when i finally pushed my way through the crowd she smiled relieved then retreated again when i kissed her not here she said its all right no ones looking but in public come meet my mother she touched her hair where is the ladies room you look fine no not for that for the toilet i laughed sorry downstairs come on ill show you but before we could move out of the room mimi came over martini glass in hand adam there you are a cheek kiss are you making a speech too im saving it for the wedding thank god for that she said then looked expectantly at claudia they nodded to each other as i introduced them where has adam been hiding you i hope hes bringing you to my ball if he doesnt ill ask you myself she said to claudia thank you claudia said not sure how to respond oh purely selfish try finding anyone under forty these days though i must say she said turning to me grace looks ten years younger ten years i suppose thats love her voice arched up i suppose maybe we should all try it except i have much good it did me she glanced again at claudia but how long have you we met at signor howards claudia said placing us bertie the old cicerone lucky he didnt match you up with a priest she said to me what can it mean all the padres in and out all day long what do they talk about whats new on the rialto just likechums hard to imagine isnt it to me they still seemi dont know something you see on the bus not anyone youd ever meet of course marian says in rome its nothing but priests everywhere but thats rome im sorry she said to claudia i hope im not no no thank god im forever getting myself into trouble you say the first thing that comes into your mind and then you see the faces not like you darling always so careful am i grace says youre thrilled i thought really or is he just being his usual diplomatic self our own little nuncio why shouldnt i be thrilled no reason in the world she said a quick return we looked at each other for a minute she turned to claudia you will come wont you to my ball its going to be very special like the ones before the war modern dressi hate period carnivals the worst those wigs all itchy and hot you wonder how they stood it oh here she comes clever grace a smile for my mother making her way toward us excuse me claudia said a moment she slid away from us and darted down the stairs adam mimi said her voice low no longer chirping whats all this ladies room shell be back no this she wagged her finger between me and the spot where claudia had stood the way she looks at you does she i said grinning dont gloat she looked at me and laughed then my mother was there and claudia was put aside there was someone she wanted me to meet mimi wanted to know about the caviar which you couldnt get in london now for love or money gianni knew a man who got it from russia somehow i smiled thinking about the old venetian trading routes evidently still going strong we had more champagne my mother was happy where was claudia i started down the stairs to check and stopped halfway spotting her over the rail there was no one else in the hall and in the quiet she was standing at the water entrance brooding looking across the moldy landing stage to the canal my mother had had the arched doorway opened and the steps lined with torches in case anyone wanted to arrive by water but no one had instead the lights flickered on the lonely utility boat we kept there and a jumble of paving stones covered with a tarp once intended to repair the landing steps but abandoned by the marchesa until some money was found in the cold claudias breath steamed get lost i said coming up to her its like a dungeon so damp i know even at low tide the steps get covered now come on youll catch cold what did she say about me mimi she likes the way you look at me oh yes well its the suit she reached out smoothing my lapel ah i said leaning over to kiss her wait theyll see she said glancing into the hall i reached over and closed the door better we kissed for a few minutes her hand at the back of my neck through the door we could hear the party going on making it all somehow like sneaking kisses in a closet then after a while the sounds receded as if we had left the house and all we could hear was the slap of water against the landing stairs and our own breathing loud in our ears almost panting the torches sputtered making shadows we dont have to stay no how can we leave they saw me we can take the boat oh yes on the lagoon in the night just follow the channel markers i said still kissing her she stopped pushing me away and breathing deeply then smiled youre the one who wanted me to come i leaned my face into her neck i dont know what i was thinking well stay here until the torches go look what they do to your skin i said taking her chin and tilting her head so that her neck was caught in the light golden bertie says youre complicated no you she said arching her neck as i kissed it you make it complicated i was happy in the hotel everything was simple now look she pulled away smiling we have to see mama am i all right she said touching her face smeared i took out a handkerchief here blot then youre perfect see if theres anyone out there think how it looks coming out of the boat room i laughed but peeked first then motioned her forward to the stairs either we had become accustomed to the torchlight or the electricity had finally come back at full strength but the piano nobile seemed brighter than before the big chandeliers blazing my mother saw us over giannis shoulder and smiled breaking away from the group darling at last i was wondering where claudia you know my mother and this is dr maglione i said but i saw that she knew him too her eyes went suddenly wide in recognition then closed down her whole face twisting she glared at me accusing as if i had set a trap then turned back to gianni breathing heavily someone recovering from being kicked the moment was onesided gianni smiling broadly didnt know who she was how nice you could come my mother said playing hostess but claudia ignored her moving closer to gianni and speaking italian her voice low her mouth still twisted in a kind of sneer gianni stepped back as if the words were a physical assault and answered her in italian quick and sharp assassino she said louder and then assassino almost yelling people nearby turned my mother pale looked at me frantically but gianni had started to talk again so fast that the words went by me in a blur you thought we were dead claudia said in english all of us dead who would know but not all not all assassino she said again this time quieter with contempt i looked at her facesomeone else unrecognizable now it was gianni who raised his voice upset caught somewhere between scolding and fighting back the people around us had begun to look uneasy the foreigners not understanding thinking theyd blundered into a scene of volatile italians the italians embarrassed shocked by what they were hearing i tried to follow helpless assassino claudia said again then murderer and for an odd second hearing both words i thought of giannis speech two languages gianni answered then stepped forward to grab her elbow clearly intending to take her out of the room the touch just a graze triggered something in her she wrenched herself away from his hand and reached up to his face clawing at it shouting at him again he grabbed her wrists and pulled her away leaving scratch marks on his face i heard a gasp he held her for a moment like that hands up in the air away from his face letting her body wriggle but holding her hands still until finally she spat at him and shocked he dropped her hands no one moved i saw the spittle gleam on his cheek the stunned faces around us claudia heaving a hysterical intake of breath she looked at me her eyes filling with tears and then around aware for the first time of the rest of the room the appalled guests gianni hadnt moved assassino she whispered one last time then she let out a sound a kind of whimper and turned to the stairs she started to run the darting movement like a signal to everyone else to come back to life out of the stopped moment the room noisy all at once with talk what in gods name but what were they saying my mother was daubing giannis face with a handkerchief adam i dont understand your friend shes your friend gianni said to me shes a crazy woman my god look at you my mother said does it hurt no no i looked toward the stairs but the crowd had swallowed her up cutting me off its a jewish matter an italian said translating for another guest what jewish matter why gianni her father its a confusion well yes it must be i suppose but what confusion i looked at gianni now surrounded then started pushing through the crowd adam i heard my mother say but i was moving frantically now down the stairs claudia i shouted but when i got to the bottom no one was in the hall except one of the maids standing in front of the makeshift cloakroom with claudias coat over her arm she glanced at me alarmed then toward the open door i raced down the hall and grabbed the coat outside there was no sign of her just the dark back calles of dorsoduro but she wouldnt go to salute a dead end i headed toward the accademia trying to pick up the sound of heels anything going faster at the corners where there were little pools of light at foscarini i looked left toward the zattere then i saw a figure in the other direction running past the accademia to the vaporetto stop claudia i yelled but she didnt even turn around determined simply to get away i ran toward the lights of the floating dock the coat flapping in my arms the boat was loading almost done but it was going in the wrong direction up the canal not down to san marco and home shed wait for the right one but she didnt she looked over her shoulder and ran up the gangplank the last one on before the crew pulled it back and caught the ropes i could see her take a seat in the glassedin section hunching into herself now what shed get off on the other side of the canal and head back but the next stop was still on this side not far just past san barnaba at ca rezzonico impossible to outrun a boat but the vaporettos were slow and lumbering even slower in the dark and this was the part of venice i knew best my sleepwalking streets and what was the alternative i ran to the end of the campo the calles here were fairly directno long detours to go around dead ends i raced across the bridge over the rio san trovaso heading to san barnaba no one was out and my shoes echoed in the empty street the sound of a chase desperate so that when i did pass one old woman she moved to the side frightened and i realized that what she saw was a thief running with a stolen coat my lungs began to hurt a little gulping in cold air but it would be only minutesall the time in the world later to catch my breath calle tolettashops closed sealed off with grates another bridge even a few steps now an effort finally the open space of san barnaba a yellow light slanting out of a bar window i swerved right and down the calle to the landing the boat was already there motor idling noisily as passengers got off one of the ropes was tossed back i was going to miss it again no one more passenger a woman with a string bag taking her time i was running so fast now that if they pulled away i might actually hit the water unable to stop but here was the gangplank clanging under my feet i grabbed at a pole to break my momentum and took a few deep breaths one of the uniformed boatmen said something to me in italian which i assumed meant theres always another boat she was huddled at the far end of one of the benches looking out at the canal so she didnt see me come into the passenger area didnt even turn until she felt the coat on her shoulders she started then hunched back into herself go away she said dont be silly youll freeze i sat next to her draping the coat around her the boat moved away from the dock what the hell was that i said still breathing heavily the scene pushed out of mind during the run now came back in a blur go away she said again thats who you want me to meet people like that like what why murderer who did he murder my father with a nod of his head that one a nod gianni gianni she repeated drawing it out yes gianni i saw him do it him you didnt know no how would you know you dont know anything any of you you come with your moneyah venice why to look at pictures so how would you know a man like him thats who your mother meets a murderer but thats all over yes lets give a ball like the old days ha did i ruin the party no have some champagne lets just go on like before such a nice man a doctor who cares what he did all in a rush snatching at the air for words trying to keep up with herself stop it i said taking her by the shoulders behind us a few passengers looked up curious a lovers quarrel a thief with a coat nothing was what it was she twisted away leave me alone go back to america take him a souvenir of venice no one will know him there ha he thought no one would know him here were supposed to be dead and then one comes back they say that you know when you least expect it a party and here comes death pointing the finger so thats me now brava oh look at your face you think im crazy you dont know anything about it for you its all nicekisses la fenice mama and her nice friend maybe its better not to know to be so lucky stop it i said calmly holding her still she shook my hand off and gathered her coat im getting off we had rounded the lower bend in the canal and were pulling into san toma the rialto lights up ahead in the distance i took her hand holding it down sit i want to know what what happened tell me about the nod she looked at me slightly puzzled you said with a nod of his head how in the hospital your father was sick yes sick dying but they didnt want to wait why wait for god when you are god the jews werent dying fast enough for them who who the germans their friends they searched the hospitals sometimes there was an informer griniyouve heard of him no he used to help the ss in the nursing home even they took them out on stretchers but not this time this time there was only your friend he pointed out my father to them that one he said with the nod over there so the ss took him you know how he knew my father told me later from medical school they were both at medical school so he knew him and you were there she nodded did he point you out too no i did myself my father told them i was a neighbor to protect me she paused not his daughter a visitor maybe they believed him i dont know maybe i could have walked out hidden somewhere but how could i do that just leave him sick and they find you in the end always so you went with him she nodded and all for nothing when we got there they looked at himwho wants a sick jew let the germans take care of him so another train and i saidimagine how foolishill go too someone has to take care of him and they laughed dont worry youll go later at that time the head would send only the hopeless cases and the children the germans wanted everyone but he kept the workers back to save them maybe to bargain later i dont know later everyone went unless you were special she stopped then looked up so you see it was for nothing they just put him on another train i always wondered did he die on the train he was so sick hes on the list at auschwitz but maybe he was dead when he got there who knows nobody can tell me for sure nobody came back not from that train no one thats what he thought none of us would come back no one would know but i know we were passing under the high bridge a dark space between the wavy lights on the water and where do i see him meeting mama so i ruin her party oh such behavior terrible and shes with a man like that my god she thinks she knows who he is none of you know what are you doing here all of you i said nothing letting the words drift off like vented steam she lowered her head you should go home no i said not now she looked at me then turned to the window oh and that solves everything what do you want to solve nothing i dont know nobody pays do they in a few days itll begone gossip poor man i heard about that girl she must have been crazy and everything goes on nobody pays not those people yes they do in germany people are starving everybodys paying you think its the same hunger no they wont pay not the murderers thats how it is now everybody pays but the murderer and here signora mimi is planning a ball and the murderer is going to marry a rich american no hes not you think id let that happen because of this she shook her head it wont make any difference hell explain some story and shell believe him and even if she doesnt believe him its better to forget no put it in the past easier youre not being fair i dont have to be fair he pointed at my father at me you be fair he didnt point at you no she said quietly i did she looked out the window then back at me so you can feel better when you see him at dinner he didnt point at me just the sick old jew im not going to see him at dinner i said evenly stop shell thank you for that claudia said and then she did stop folding back into herself again staring out the window we were almost at san stae we should go back ill take you home no one more stop whats there my old house i thought i would never go there again but tonight i want to see it she turned to me you want to see venice ill give you a tour not the accademia this one i said nothing pulled along by her mood unsure where she was going now no one else got off at san marcuola so we were alone in the empty square near a dark silent church and a few streetlamps she asked for a cigarette you know my father would never allow it a woman smoking in the streets and here so close we started walking north into cannaregio gloomy long canals and workers houses he would have been ashamed imagine of this think of the rest of it what it would have done to him talking to the air to herself we passed a shop with hebrew lettering this is the ghetto almost the edge in the beginning you had to live on the island where the campo is its easy in venice to separate people one island three bridges at night they put chains across to keep everybody in except sometimes they let a doctor out if a christian was sick my father used to say no wonder the jews liked medicine it got them out of the ghetto but that was the middle ages until napoleon she said playing tour guide then you could live anywhere of course most people stayed here nearby it was what they were used to you see the buildings at the end how high they ran out of space in the ghetto so they had to build on top nowhere else do you see buildings like thissix stories seven so many stairs we turned off the main street into the narrower calle farnese where we were shielded even from moonlight forced to rely on a corner light and a few slivers coming from the shuttered windows here she said stopping about a block before the bridge you see up there those windows my aunt lived on the other side my mothers sister they used to talk across like cats my father said we stood there for a few minutes looking at the house and seeing nothingordinary windows like all the others a door flush with the street around us a smell of canal debris and damp plaster a cat ran past then disappeared into a shadow a drab back calle but claudia was seeing something else her eyes fixed on the dark walls as if she were looking through them to the rooms inside her own past family dinners homework radio how different could it have been then the changebackdoor patients unofficial curfews her aunts window shut tight what happened to her my mother she died when i was eight oh my aunt in the roundup the first one with the air raid sirens she looked at me yes with the sirens you remembered you can see in a street like this how noisy it would be an alleyway every shout an echo come see the rest she led me over the bridge onto the island and through a passage so low i had to duck my head we came out into a larger campo with a well in the center an enclosed patch of faint moonlight entirely surrounded by the builtup houses walled in you see there those windows five in a row that was the synagogueout of sight but a visitor could find it by the windows five for the five books i looked up involuntarily counting the windows then turned slowly taking in the whole campo dingy and peeling a tree with spiky winter branches not a hint of warmth anywhere the coldest place id seen in venice it seemed utterly deserted as if everyone had gone away leaving a few lights on by accident when was the roundup oh dates all right she said adopting a guides voice dates you know italy surrendered in fortythree the king surrenders september mussolini he goes to salo and of course the germans come in so now here its the occupation new jewish laws much worse now we are enemy aliens my family here since rome now were aliens the broadcast waswhen end of november i remember they came to jona then for a list he was head of the community and the germans asked him for a list of the jews living here two thousand i think everybody a good manmy father knew him what could he do yes tomorrow he told them and that night he warned us then he killed himself so he was the first but now we knewrun hide if you can like rats you see over there she pointed north to a long gray building prisonlike the nursing home they couldnt run some couldnt even move so they were easy to arrest you see without the list it was harder they had to take who they could find like your aunt she wouldnt run you have to imagine midnight the sirens people screaming pounding on doors she couldnt move the fear was too strong she shrugged so they took her she scared herself to death but you hid from the germans germans no italians they used us to do it our own carabinieri police some fascists maybe thats why they waited till it was darkmaybe they didnt want to be seen later it was ss more efficient with the police it became a farce they took everyone to collegio foscarini but there were no facilities nothing so people came with food they would throw food through the windows for the children ten days like that a public embarrassment so to casa di ricovero and they release the sick ones they didnt understandno one could be released so the ss came and arrested them again a farce but finally the train after that it was mostly ss with their informers grini he would take them through the hospitals even the mental hospital it wasnt enough for them if you were crazy you had to be dead she folded her arms across her chest hugging herself rocking a little youre cold of course we didnt know they would go through the hospitals we thought it was safe there we were on the lido then hiding but not hiding a vacation flat someone found for us empty you know the neighbors pretended no one was there we still had a little money how much longer could it go on it was just a matter of time if we could wait it out but then my father became too sick to stay there he had a friend at the hospital from the old days he thought it would be all right use another name who would look in the critical wards what for they were already on their way to san michele almost dead she lowered her head but they did look she stretched out one arm that one dr maglione you think i would forget that face never and then tonight one look and i was back in that ward but this time champagne everyone smiling and i thought he got away with it they all did they got away with murder not all of them she waved her hand dismissing this theyll never pay whos going to make them pay you me a scratch on the face thats my revenge a scratch and for that which one of us do you think will no longer be welcome in your mothers house its my house too no hers what do you think were all going to be friends if i saw him again i would do it again spit and spit i cant help iti dont want to help it i want to kill him no you dont she lowered her head no then i would pay so they always win she moved away glancing up at the tall buildings look at this place who gets an eye for an eye all dead its like a tomb now i dont even know why i came to show me yes to show you what they did we stood for a minute looking at the silent campo peering into the dark passages as if we were waiting for whistles and the stamping of boots to break the stillness you know what he said to me my father when they took him for the train god will never forgive them but he was wrong theyll forgive themselves maybe not oh yes its one thing you learn in the camp what theyre like ask your doctor how he feels not even embarrassed and then one night at a party somebody points a finger you know what id like to keep pointingwherever he goes all his parties his hospital just keep pointing at him until everyone knows she shrugged except what difference would it make its just what some crazy girl says and who believes her she looked down who would believe her i would she turned away flustered yes why maybe she is crazy making scenes i put my arm around her come on we cant stay here all night she glanced up at the buildings again stalling look at it no one left maybe we should leave venice go somewhere else rome just like that yes why not and who pays you it doesnt matter about the money and then one day youre gone and it does matter why would i go everybody goes i held her by the shoulders not me dont you understand that no why i dont understand why why you think theres a reason maybe that morning on the vaporetto i dont know why maybe the way you scratched giannis face i liked that she smiled slightly and leaned her forehead against my chest muffling her words and thats your choice someone like that mm forget about this i waved toward the dark buildings i cant i nodded i know but let it go now for a while come with me she was quiet for a minute close to me then nodded but not to dorsoduro you understand that ill never go there again yes you will he wont be there where have you been all night ive been worried sick my mother still in her silk wrapper was having coffee in the small sitting room curled up in the club chair next to the electric fire her hair was loose just brushed out her face pale with not even the usual morning dusting of powder an ashtray with a burning cigarette was perched on the arm of the chair the wisp of smoke rising to mix with the steam from her coffee although i can guess bertie said youve become friends with that girl really adam shes obviously a neurotichadnt you noticed shes not a neurotic well call it whatever you like shes obviously something have some coffee what a spectacle i mean you like a party to have a littlebut not quite that much giannis been wonderful about it but of course its embarrassing the worst part is that since shes your friend he cant help but wonderwell you know which is ridiculous i said you looked as stunned as anybody but you might give him a call you know talk to him a little you dont want him to think did he tell you why she did it apparently she thinks he caused her fathers death of course doctors have to deal with this all the time you know somebody dies in hospital and whos to blame anybody will do reallydoctor nurse anybody so he doesnt know who she is doesnt have the faintest she must have seen him at the hospital andwell you know when youre in that state she looked up adam i hope youre putting an end to this im sure the poor thing needs help and its very sweet of you but you dont have to be the one to do it they have people for this i mean for all you know she could be deranged murdered her father really they were at medical school together who gianni and her father he knows who she is she was reaching for her cigarette but stopped surprised by this and he murdered her father i suppose she said finally sarcastic no he handed him over to the ss so they could murder him they were rounding up jews in the hospital her father was too sick to move gianni handed him over so what does that make him an accessory in her eyes it comes to the same thing thats a terrible thing to say especially when its true dont be ridiculous gianni wouldnt do such a thing is this what shes going around saying she was there she saw him well darling not exactly the most reliable source considering then ask him of course im not going to ask him why would he do such a thing what possible reason could he have i shrugged maybe he was an antisemite a collaborator maybe he was just a sonofabitch he handed a sick man over to a death squad what does it matter why my mother looked at me for a second then stubbed out her cigarette taking her time and gathered herself up out of the chair balancing the cup over the ashtray adam i want you to stop now i wont have that tone and i wont have any more of this last night was bad enough you seem to forget it was my party my evening that got spoiled i didnt ask for the extra dramatics so all right lets put that behind us not your fault if shesbut now its over i wont have you saying these things about gianni i wont not even if theyre true theyre not how do you know because i know him hes a wonderful man so was goebbels to his children before he poisoned them is that supposed to be funny is it this girl have you lost all your sense is gianni supposed to be a nazi now maybe its not her maybe something happened to you in germany yes i met a lot of people like gianni wonderful and they didnt think twice about putting people in boxcars adam what is the matter with you she said her voice finally distressed the matter is you wont listen not to this i wont not anymore im going to have my bath she put down the cup and started to move away from the table this isnt germany you know why because its beautiful she stopped and turned to face me i dont know why youre doing this trying to ruin everything im not trying to ruin anything im trying to help you you almost married this man she looked at me i am marrying this man you cant you cant marry someone like this are you that far gone she tried to smile her eyes moist yes im that far gone have you been listening at all a man like this a man like what dont you think i know what kind of man he is no i dont think you know him at all youve just rushed into this like you rush into everything else except this time it might be harder to get out not to mention more expensive oh she said with a small gasp deflated what a hateful thing to say im sorry i said quickly seeing her eyes fill but she waved me away no one can hurt like a child she brushed her hair back rallying is that what you think well darling im sorry to disappoint you or him for that matter but really im not doris duke isnt it too bad of course ive told him that but if you like ill tell him again so he can be absolutely sure what hes getting all right i didnt mean yes you did youre full of meanness today im not sure why maybe you dont want me to marry anyone i just dont want you to marry him neither would you if youd stop and listen for two minutes oh just him but the thing is darling no one else has asked me mother so well do this ill tell him again im not rich its not about the and if he still wants to go aheadjust on the off chance that hed like me for myselfwill that make you feel better she stared at me for a second then turned to the door good now can i have my bath after she left i just stood there not knowing what to do follow her and keep arguing for what more tears and stubborn indifference past listening what claudia had predicted the last thing id expected i picked up the coffee tepid now and slightly bitter and finished it then stood looking at the wall the light from the water outside moving on it in irregular flashes out of rhythm jumpy hed tell her some story a hysterical response to a hospital death who would say otherwise were there hospital records another name shed said not even a paper trail i walked over to the window on the side table there was a new picturenot the jaunty zattere one on the dressing table but gianni in a more formal pose seated at a desk with papers in front of him for signing i picked up the photograph and looked at his eyes half expecting to find some peering intensity visible evil but of course it was only gianni how easy had it been for him to point signor grassini out a struggle routine something hed done before in the habit of informing there wouldnt have been only one i looked again at gianni at his desk papers to sign there was always paper somewhere almost without thinking i slid the picture out of its frame and put it in my pocket more reliable than memory sometimes the paper of a crime chapter five i caught the traghetto that crossed the grand canal to the gritti and then headed toward san moise a few days joe had saidmaybe he had already gone but the bauer still had a sullivan registered and while i was using the house phone to call him i spotted him at breakfast in the dining room facing the rio late start i said going up to the table late night you just caught me sit but dont expect too much he rubbed his temples wishing away the hangover thanks i took a cornetti from the bread basket in front of him eat something it helps did i call you or did you call me i called you i need a favor too late i go back to verona at fourteen hundred thats where i need the favor he raised his eyebrows over the coffee cup could you run a check on somebody see what youve got hiding in the files italian i took out the photograph isnt this the guy from the other day you always run a check on your friends hes not a friend bad boy i think so whatd he do cooperated with the ss rounding up jews he wouldnt be the first they insisted you know i dont think it was like that i think he helped adam for chrissake if i had a nickel for everybody who i know frau schmidt telling on the neighbors this is something else hes a doctor old family he had a choice army no probably too old maybe too smart so so what else this stuffit usually doesnt happen just once you know its part of who you are fascist maybe but not only that i mean what the hell the mailman probably had a party card did he work with the germans what did he do sort of thing you might turn up in your files might he looked again at the picture you have a name i took out a pen and started writing he may have used another thats why the picturein case somebody might spot him somebody like who come on joe we worked the same street you must have somebody just looking at pictures to see what he can see an old partisan maybe somebody looking to get even joe took a sip of coffee is that what youre looking to do i met his gaze over the cup he wants to marry my mother jesus adam were not a fucking reference bureau if you dont like him hes a bad guy i just want to know how bad look let me explain something to you this isnt frankfurt the setups different here were not trying to punish anybody the italians are supposed to be the victims the good guys we dont keep those kinds of files on them and the italians they dont want to know they settle things privately its what theyre good at since fucking rome some fascist prick set up a partisan ambush they dont bother with a trial they just stick him with a shiv some night and go about their business you see mussolini in the dock just strung him up at a gas station they dont want us running trials here they take care of their own so what are you doing here then german trials the germans want trials or maybe we want them to have them anyway they do and when the evidence is here we have to come get it kesselring did a lot here before they transferred him back just wiped people out so things get lost in germany we find something else here it doesnt matter where he did it as long as he did it its the germans were after not your mothers boyfriend he put the picture back on the table so lets see that means youve got the german army fileswhat they didnt take they take much some and youve probably got that crossreferenced with the salo government filesliaison reports anyway ss nobody kept files like they did we know that so what do we have the army worked with italians so thered be sheets on them there secret police reports for sure ss would have their own little black book of informers somebody like gianni theyd probably give him a file all his own wouldnt they joe raised his eyes again yes in other words the german files have got practically everything we want to know about the italians wouldnt you say except what they said to each other and all i want to know is what he said to the germans what they had to say about him an italian civilian were not here for that theyre our friends yeah well so are the germans now were not supposed to use the files this way what are you talking about thats all we did youre not in the army anymore and hes italian were not supposed to jesus christ joe the old man is lying there in a hospital bed and this guy fingers him in a hospital bed how much protection is he supposed to have joe said nothing for a minute then pocketed the paper and photograph all right all im saying is this isnt frankfurt we may not have anything if you dont you dont ill bet youve got a herr kroger our assistant for whom the files were a series of live wires running from connection to connection the whole a wonderful bright web in his brain soriano joe said nodding signora pretty good too put her on it shell know right away if its worth a little sniffing i dont want to tie you up with this joe grinned no just use my best snoop you dont change he patted the pocket with the photograph you really love this guy huh what if i come up dry there has to be something a man whod do thatits never just once and youre sure he did there was an eyewitness and youre sure she was the old mans daughter oh she was joe said looking at me then shed know yes she would i said staring back joe sighed and put his napkin on the table well this was fun just like old times you have a phone here on the paper ill come to verona if no you dont want to come anywhere near me its not frankfurt remember anyway im not as much fun as i used to be can i ask you something this guy does he know that you know i looked at him surprised that this hadnt occurred to me then nodded of course he knew claudia would have told me some fucking wedding joe said i walked back taking the wide swing over the accademia bridge then sat for a while in the campo san ivo there was a shaft of sun in the square and some bundledup old people sat on benches with their faces turned to it at the end of the campo boats swept by on the grand canal where my mother had come to be happy so special it seemed not just outside the war but outside time but that had been another trick of the light like the hypnotic movement of the water nowhere was outside and now everything here would be gianni every detail a daily reminder gothic arched windows flowerpots on terraces the view from the monaco lounge shed be miserable and stubbornly shed refuse to go the leaving itself could be easy my mother had always lived a gypsy life of suitcases and shortterm leases a few days would do it bertie could deal with the house mimi could make the public excuses and shed be out of it if shed go i saw her face for a second as shed turned from the door this morning wounded by me every word a kind of betrayal what would it look like now knowing id asked for his file but what was the alternative if hed lie about the hospital what else would he lie about what was the point of finding out later when she was already trapped crushed by the disappointment of it the sooner the better she might listen to bertie a calm meeting moving her gently from point to point until she saw it was just a question of making her see i got up and started back to the house wed both apologize wed tiptoe around it shed ask what claudia had actually said what shed seen wed talk but when i got to the house shed already gone out a fitting for the dress angelina said she left a message i went over to the table and took the paper out of the silver dish dont forget to call gianni it read as if nothing had been said at all claudia wasnt at the accademia so i walked toward the rialto and then on a whim went to the library and spent a few hours leafing through a bound volume of il gazzettino the first roundup had been in december but claudia hadnt been taken until laterfall after a few months hiding on the lido i started with july piecing together bits of italian until word blocks began to fall into place the way menus become familiar giannis name never came up but why would it claudia wasnt there either or abramo grassini not even the word ebreo no one had combed through the hospital looking for victims no one had been transported august nothing had happened la serenissima had survived the occupation doing what it always hadentertaining visitors the violinists in san marco would have played waltzes not many photographs only the occasional officer in gray in the background taking coffee september the war was happening somewhere else troops fighting in the south only partisan bands in the veneto a train derailed near verona a munitions depot blown upcowardly acts designed to thwart the italian war effort had the typographer set this with a straight face communistinspired probably milanese the communists in fact were behind everything the real threat more insidious than the advancing allies or the protective germans the monsignor called for peace an end to criminal acts but even the partisans were somewhere else at the other end of the bridge across the lagoon in venice nothing happened i started to close the book letting the pages fall on one another backward through the summer and suddenly there he was same face receding hair i stopped and flipped until i came back to the photograph not gianni the older brother gustavo paolo lorenzo known as paolo dead in the war gianni had said but not exactly in the front lines according to il gazzettino a car accident near asolo where he was staying or livingmy italian wasnt nuanced enough to tell odd to think of any venetian in a car much less dying in one is that why gianni had given him a better end i looked at the photograph againgiannis eyes spaced wide over the same high nose a subtly different mouth the whole look older not quite as personable had they been close i read through the obituary looking for some sense of their lives together but the article was respectful and dull a long genealogy a list of charitable associations but evidently no profession only second sons had to think of it the lucky older brother whod lived on what was left an ordinary conventional life the only hint of flair had been a youthful enthusiasm for auto racingand the piece did not say but implied look where that had led no other passengers in the wreck mourned by his many friends and colleagues at four claudia still wasnt back at the accademia shes not here a secretary said in italian and when i looked at my watch with a teasing raised eyebrow and said some lunch she said no she is no longer employed here since when i said but she pretended not to understand and shrugged so i went back out to calle pisani and stood for a minute waiting as if someone were going to come out and explain it to me why would she quit jobs were hard to get for a panicked second i wondered if shed gone to rome after all taking off like a startled bird still surprised at herself an afternoon train a note pinned to the dressmakers dummy but that wasnt like her i thought of her that first time at berties party as straightforward as her suit and then with gianni her hands at his face no strategic retreats no notes shed be at home looking out the window at san isepo she wouldnt have left not alone i started for the vaporetto then stopped and headed back to my mothers to pick up some clothes i had only a few things at claudias and i wasnt just staying the night anymore angelina surprised me with a message to call joe sullivan i hadnt expected to hear back for days and i didnt want to take the time to call nowit could take up to an hour just to get throughbut since claudia didnt have a phone there wasnt much choice the phone had one of those elaborate receivers you saw in old movies and the sound was usually scratchy but for once the lines were free you rang a bell with rosa he said who signora soriano herr kroger ah what kind of bell she knew the name now shes running around trying to put things together i wish you could see her fucking purring like a cat with a ball of yarn knew his name how company he kept not that that means anything lots of bad company in italy these last few years hard to avoid and he didnt no but its hard to say you ever hear of the villa raspelli no its a kind of rest home over on lake garda some bankers house they made it into a recovery center for ss brass nice your man must have made a few house calls there rosa remembered the name he was an ss doctor dont run away with yourself he was a doctor the patients were ss how exactly that fits together i dont know i can guess what else has she got i didnt say she had anything but if there is shell find it like i say shes purring its a beautiful thing to watch a few days okay she wants to give it to you personally which means she wants a trip to venice but what the hell if anybody deserves but why does she think theres anything i dont know she just said villa raspelli and then went down the rabbit hole the way she does she finds anything ill have her call this number always good i looked at the phone the only one i had access to yes meanwhile dont start packing for nuremberg okay sit tight thanks joe i owe you not yet you dont i mean hes a fucking doctor who else do you call when youre sick but they called him joe not anybody him i heard nothing for a minute just some breathing over the line why do you think that was i said again silence then a small sigh maybe hes good at what he does uhhuh i said turning my head toward the door where my mother was standing cheeks still red from outside she gave me a tentative smile and crossed the room to the drinks tray he speak kraut joe was saying i dont know i said distracted that might explain it krauts like that speak the language and if he doesnt this time he didnt even bother to answer ill have her call soriano dont forget i wont thanks joe whos joe my mother said as i hung up her back to me fixing a drink at this distance she seemed small her shoulders as narrow as a girls who was joe an investigator a rat chaser someone who knew about gianni an army buddy i said in venice thats nice in verona still want one she said turning i know its early but the fitting was hell nobody ever says how exhausting it is just standing but wait till you see itso pretty its got beads along here she said drawing her hand along an imaginary neckline oh but you dont care a bit do you half the time you dont even notice what people have on whats in the bag she nodded to the small satchel id packed with clothes moving out her voice light her eyes fixed on mine no just a change ah she said we never talked about the nights away the unused bed i was simply out late did you call gianni offhand as if it were an afterthought no darling i wish you would it would mean so much to him she put down the drink and walked toward me think what its like for him what whats like she sighed well you i suppose i wish i knew why youve taken then listen to me please its important weve had this conversation i think havent we then lets have it again adam i dont care what happened a long time ago a year year and a half i know him now you think you do people dont change she looked up at me her eyes softer you dont anyway so stubborn what a stubborn little boy you were always going to set things right always so sure even in the sandbox what sandbox you never took me to a sandbox she smiled well how would you know anyway i remember seeing you in a sandbox i suppose some child had taken a toy or something i dont know and there you were on your high horse all three feet of you pointing its not fair its not fair just outraged well it probably wasnt fair i said smiling a little now too probably she said she reached up and brushed the hair back from my forehead but youre not a little boy anymore and nothing is fair nothing in this world theres onlygetting along i took her hand moving it down from my hair were not talking about something that happened in a sandbox i said people died because of him you think that yes she put her hands on my upper arms then talk to him let him explain mother come to dinner i looked at her disconcerted a social occasion to iron out the wrinkles no i said pulling away then stopped caught by the hurt expression in her eyes anyway i cant i said yes i forgot she said nodding to the bag tomorrow perhaps a hostess taking in a polite excuse no not tomorrow either really adam she said with a nervous giggle hell think i looked at her not saying anything we cant go on this way she said its important to sit down at a table together like a family yes like a family you know youre all i have she said quietly then she turned away her voice changing back to neverland again well another day goodness look at the time id better run a bath you wont be too late tonight will you darling ignoring the satchel not too late i said ignoring it too it was dark by the time i got to claudias and she was in fact staring out at san isepo just as id imagined youll go blind i said flicking on the light everything okay i put the satchel near the bed she said nothing smoking and staring out the window i went by the accademia they said youd left quit no dismissed she said after another minutes silence in the fire isnt that right fired i said automatically what happened my services are no longer required signora ricci told me the director didnt bother coming down he had signora ricci do it but why why do you think a word in the ear its so different in america whose ear the directors i suppose anyway someones so now its begun but so quick now whats begun to get rid of me now that ive exposed him what else can he do kill me like my father hed like that but now its not legal you think gianni had you fired i know it ill talk to him i said angry no it doesnt work that way he wont know anything about it no one will but ill be gone then how do you know it was him i saw his face when she turned away from the window and put out the cigarette im embarrassed to tell you it wasi dont know just something i did not thinking i just went where to the hospital signora ricci told me to leave and i knew not the end of the week leave today i knew what it meant who else would do this make me go away thats what he wants now no moreincidents i thought he can do this make trouble for me just by picking up the phone but i can make trouble for him tooi know what he did so i went there all the way to campo zanipolo and then i thought what am i doing im going to run into the hospital theyll think hes right a crazy but what do you do take your purse from the desk and thank signora ricci and just disappear thats what he wants so what did you do nothing i just stood there by colleoni on his horse i didnt know go stay what and then he came out not alone with two others out of the hospital and they cross the campotalking you knowand suddenly he comes near and he stops it was all there in his faceno surprise he knew why i was there expecting it even and you know what else a fear he was afraid that i was waiting there for him i wasnt another two minutes and i would have been gone but he didnt know that remember i said how i should do that just be there at his parties everywhere he thought i was what did you say nothing i just looked at him and him nothing just a look but it was there in his face and the others the men with him they dont understand it at all why hes staring at this woman by colleoni who doesnt say anything to him either just a look and when they start again i hear one of them say who was that and he says nobody and one of them turns back to look and i could see hes thinking so why did he stop but how can maglione explain it so its the beginning he wants me dead gone anyway i saw it there in his face in one look i said trying to coax her out of it yes one look i know ive seen it before maybe youre overreacting i said gently no the same you know how i know because it frightened me the way it always did like a knife at your throatso close when so now hes afraid of me just the sight of me and im afraid of him we know each other maybe it would have been better if id never found him now how does it end i went over to her you go away and live happily ever after ha leave so he wins no you do just forget about him look what it does to you just passing him in the street youre all what nerves she shrugged no im better now she looked out the window again and how is he i wonder claudia i know forget it all rightforgotten she brushed the air with her hand but im still out of work no job nothing dont worry about it i said coming nearer ill take care of you like a whore no i said turning her around lifting her chin with my finger to make her smile like a mistress oh theres a difference mm more expensive a small smile yes how much she said playing back i kissed her whatever it takes any pricehow nice for me she said how about dinner at the danieli she pulled back smiling so thats my price a dinner at the danieli why not you dont get fired every day in the end we settled for a drink at the danieli the big gothic dining room was almost deserted quiet as a church waiting for tourists and spring waiters stood near the wall gazing toward the lobby the few diners spoke in whispers nobody was celebrating anything we had a prosecco in the bar and slipped back out to the riva the moon was out and the air was sharp we held hands going over the bridge to san marco still happy to be out of the hushed dining room ill talk to bertie i said maybe he can do something no anyway i dont want to go back there where then we were strolling past the empty cafes i dont know maybe ill go to murano and make glass maybe quadris she said pointing to the frosted windows somebody must do the dishes not tonight i said looking in an old woman in a fur coat nursing a drink two men at the bar we went under the arcade and out of san marco past the back basin where the gondolas tied up guidos was a small restaurant cozy in the winter with windows overlooking the rio fuseri and a long antipasto table filling the far end of the room in the summer it would be filled with foreigners sent by the big hotels with walking maps but now it was only half full romantic with shaded lamps and a pleasant murmuring of italian claudia saw them first i was handing the coats to a waiter near the door the eager maitre d hovering nearby and felt her grab my arm giannis back was to us so it was my mother who looked up startled for a second then smiled darling what a surprise look gianni its adam she stopped finally taking in claudia her eyes darting nervously to the rest of the room uneasy i wish id known she said in her social voice she motioned her hand over the table only big enough for two but maybe they can move one gianni turned in his seat then got up slowly hesitant not sure how to react it was as claudia had said a kind of fear but of what an awkward moment in a restaurant her face had hardened and she was glaring at him for a few seconds nobody moved not even the maitre d waiting to see how we wanted to be seated adam gianni said you brought her here why do you do this annoyed but keeping his voice even so that no one around us heard anything unusual in it he looked at claudia what do you want he said almost pleading exasperated from you nothing she turned gripping my arm more tightly lets go darling my mother said drawing it out so that it was like a hand reaching over insistent she looked around the room again then at me a signal to behave its no trouble about the table now her voice reached gianni stopping the unguarded look on his face and bringing him back too he stared at claudia for another second and then nodded to my mother trying to please her or deciding that the only way to deal with the situation was to pretend it wasnt happening yes join us he said a little unsteady still not sure but gesturing graciously to the table i can recommend the polenta if you like that now even a polite forced smile with you never claudia said her voice low nearby the maitre d waited gianni looked around no one was paying attention we were still just a group of foreigners saying hello but perhaps you would rather be alone with your friend he said to me oh darling this would be such a chance to talk things out my mother started then stopped caught by giannis sharp glance the first time i had ever seen him look at her this way grace he said cutting her off is that what you want i said to talk about things old times before he could answer claudia said something in italian her voice still low but edgy even the sound of it unpleasant giannis face clouded the couple at the next table looked up adam dont my mother said please she lost her job today i said to her then looked again at gianni want to talk about getting it back why gianni my mother said what are you talking about tell her i said to gianni claudia said something more in italian rapidfire too fast to catch giannis face darkened again enough he said in english first the father now your job everything that goes wrong in your life you blame on me why you made the call didnt you i said tell her i nodded to my mother then put my hand on claudias back ready to go listen to me gianni said before i could turn almost in an undertone just english to the rest of the room we are almost finished we will take our coffee elsewhere sit over there with your friend in a few minutes well be gone no scenes do you think i would stay in the same room with you claudia said to him in english i am sorry for your confusion he said deliberately a misunderstanding some other time we will discuss it darling do please stop my mother said i dont know what this is all about gianni doesnt even know her i told you is that right claudia said to him you dont remember me shall i describe it for her adam you can see what shes like gianni said take another table people are beginning to look you dont remember her i said go to the table he said in a hard whisper thats right you forget things you dont remember her father either your friend from med school do you remember the villa raspelli your friends there i found somebody today who remembers you adam really my mother said but the rest of it faded only a sound in the background because at that instant i saw giannis face shift not just a scowl a narrowing of the eyes but a look of such pure hatred that for a second i couldnt breathe trapped in it the way a victim must feel just at the end he wanted me dead in that one look i saw that everything claudia had said was true that he was capable of it what i hadnt seen in the photographs or behind the smiles over a lunch table the eyes of someone who could kill steadily without hesitation just getting something out of the way and then it was gonethe eyes blinked adjusting themselves i remember the villa raspelli he said staring at me then shifted again and bowed an elaborate courtesy im sorry you cant join us perhaps another time he sat down turning his back to us the effect was to make people look at us wondering why we were still standing there oh adam my mother said quietly dismayed ask him about it over coffee i said to her since he remembers sit down she said almost hissing no were leaving i said turning to the puzzled maitre d for our coats you dont want a table the maitre d said flustered sensing a moment gone wrong i shook my head im sorry i said taking the coats tomorrow since this made no sense to him he just stood there watching us go everyone watched in fact except gianni in the street i gulped some air then helped claudia into her coat and pulled up the collar guidos had an antique lantern over the door and we stood in its light for a minute breathing streams of vapor in the cold air never mind i said theres another place near la fenice he thinks im following him claudia said but it was gianni who followed us suddenly opening the door coatless and stepping into the lantern light who told you about villa raspelli he said what does it matter who why dont you tell me about it you think you know something you dont know anything but ill find out more fairy tales he said looking at claudia why do you stay in venice with your bad memories or you he said to me go home you are making trouble here for no reason go live your own life leave us in peace you sent me away once claudia said do you think you can do that again me i dont send anyone but you could arrange it like that claudia said snapping her fingers yes like that gianni said nodding a kind of threat easy not so easy this time this time we dont go like sheep we know more melodrama why do you listen to her such a scene is that what you came out here for to tell us to leave town he looked at me steadily then sighed no for your mother to make peace peace im a patient man but not a saint she wants that but youwhat do you want i wish i knew not peace to make trouble maybe between us so i will tell you something you will not stop this marriage you will make your mother unhappy but you will not stop it do you think i would let these stories get in the way of that she will leave venice he said indicating claudia so will you and your mother and i will live here if you have sense you will go back and sit and talk to her apologize for making a scene he looked at claudia you i dont care what happens to you im sorry for your trouble but now its enough craziness leave me alone go away where would i go to fossoli again you didnt think anyone would come back but one did he looked at her cool absolutely calm then turned to me dont do this again it upsets your mother tell her about villa raspelli then see how she feels and what would i tell her i was a doctor doing his duty he narrowed his eyes in the same menacing stare id seen in the restaurant you think you know you dont but you will not stop this marriage he brought his hands up to straighten his tie and i watched fixated as he tightened the silk large square hands a sharp pull on the fabric for an instant oddly i saw my mothers soft throat in the monaco lounge imagined him putting his hands around it not in violence not some improbable tabloid crime but strangling the life out of her choking her spirit bit by bit until only a gasp was left he looked at me with his hard eyes and i realized he was capable of this too a different killing with no one around to interfere he glanced back through the glass of the door your mother is waiting what will you tell her that you are embarrassed and she is mad he said glancing toward claudia the truth the truth claudia said the truth is that you sent me to die sent me to be a whore he patted his tie then looked at her weary no thats something you did yourself chapter six bertie refused to help at the accademia you overestimate my influence i couldnt not now anyway i wouldnt she may be the most wonderful thing since sliced bread but shes been terrible for you just look at this mess grace all weepy and gianni snorting around like a wounded bull and for what some whim of yours shes telling the truth i dont know that and neither do you youre just thinking with your pants its one thing in the army thats all anyone thinks about but youre not in barracks anymore so much for a civilizing influence he waved his hand toward the city outside his long windows and if you ask me the sooner you get yourself out of her clutches the better her clutches her charm then i must say shes the most unlikely siren he said pronouncing it sireen for effect still he put her in a camp bertie her father died he did himself dont split hairs rather important hairs dont you think not if hed done it to you oh adam first hes after graces money now hes working with the ss does he look like ss to you this is all mischief why does everyone want to protect him bertie peered at me over his glasses nobodys protecting anybody nobodys proven anything either i will how may i ask i still have friends in the army meaning meaning they like to know who kept company with the germans they keep lists testimony bertie looked at me for another minute his face slack with surprise he got up and walked over to the window well isnt that lovely what do you intend to do put him on trial he didnt do anything according to you never mind according to me keep me out of it i can tell you now that nothings going to come of it but tears and more tears adam for heavens sake let them be theyre going to marry whether you like it or not so let them get on with it you dont think id let him marry her well as you keep failing to grasp he didnt ask you and you havent accepted the invitations are out you know help me bertie shes your friend he sighed and opened the window to his balcony outside the winter sun was bright on the grand canal noisy with boats what does she say about all this nothing she refuses to talk about it she spends all day getting her dress fitted so i heard what mimi shes in a perfect snit about it the dressmaker none of her friends can get a lookin and theres the ball coming up he turned and smiled at me i know all very silly and here you are still fighting the good fight he opened the window wider oh how i wish youd go thats what gianni said he cant wait to get me out either not just you all of you even grace shes a darling but look at her now everything all fraught you make everything so messy all of you i hate it no you dont you love it oh for five minutes gossip you think so i dont really im selfish i suppose its wrong but i cant help it now look at that he said waving at the view down the canal did you ever see anything so beautiful the first time i came here i knew it was all i wanted in my life to see this every day just be part of it and then you all come charging in making messes right and left in a way i think i preferred it during the war nobody came except the germans well yes all right the germans he said the phrase taking in more and now you want to bring it all back god knows why things happened here bertie you cant make them go away just because they spoil the view thats where youre wrong they will go away nobody wants to live with them over and over why do you they did this and they did thatyou dont even know who they are you just know who you want it to be i dont like this adam any of it i dont like what youre doing neither will you in the end ach he stopped out of steam and closed the window his eyes glancing over to see how i was reacting will you talk to her i said calmly oh and say what you might reconsider darling your son thinks hes himmler shell listen to you you keep saying i dont want to be listened to i want to be left alone with your view yes with my view he came over to the coffee table and lit a cigarette all right all right getting married youd think once would be enough for anybody theyll find it bertie evidence its there somewhere he looked at me lets hope not the next day claudias landlady asked her to leave an official from the housing authority had come to inspect there had been reports of immoral behavior thats you claudia said with a wry fatalistic smile youre the immoral behavior he cant do this she shrugged venice is famous for denunciations you can still see some of the boxes where they put the notes for the doges five hundred years ago well for me this week she cant just put you out she was frightenedan official coming here so i have till the end of the week at least its better than the accademia not the same day he asked if shed seen my residency permit so theyre going to make trouble about that dont you have one everything was taken at fossoli so get another you were born here theyll have records yes in the end ill get it but meanwhile she opened her hand to show the weeks drifting by hes not going to get away with this stay here ill be back she touched my arm ill go with you not this time my mother wants us to talk so well talk i zigzagged my way past the arsenale and through the backstreets of castello toward the hospital over the bridge at san lorenzo to the questura side where a few policemen were loitering in the sun with cigarettes not yet ready for their desks inside did it only take one call here too maybe the policeman wed met at harrys ready to do a favor san zanipolo and its dull red brick then the vaulted reception room of the hospital following the guards directions down the stone corridor to the doctors offices not running but walking so fast that people noticed thought maybe i was hurrying to a deathbed i brushed past the nurse in the outer office and opened the door without knocking gianni was sitting behind the desk in a white coat his pen stopping halfway across a form when he saw me i want you to leave her alone i said the nurse rushed up behind flustered dottore she started but gianni waved her away gesturing for me to sit what have i done now he said scaring the landlady is that your idea of a joke charging claudia with immoral behavior i dont doubt it he said a woman like that doesnt change i made inquiries about her after the party when she made such a spectacle of herself i thought maybe she was deranged shes not deranged no a whore do you know what she was at fossoli where you sent her do you know what she was did she tell you yes yes the camp mistress this is the woman you bring to your mothers house she was forced no one forces a woman to be a whore a man like that at the camp do you think he would have kept her if she didnt please him no one had to force her you really are a sonofabitch arent you i said quietly oh now names i try to help you show you what she is and you call me names just call off the dogs gianni the police or the housing authority or whoever the hell you called this time for your information i didnt call anyone another of her fantasies who else would have done it gianni who else a landlord finds a new tenant he gets rid of the old one it happens all the time leave her alone i see she scratches my face in public waits outside the hospital like a beggar makes scenes in restaurants but i am bothering her just call them off shes not leaving venice she has no permit i smiled grimly at the slip something you just happened to know he glanced away i told you i made inquiries its not for me to decide its a legal matter not if i marry her i said not even thinking just returning the ball he looked up at me genuinely shocked you cant marry her why not my mothers marrying you a woman like that it would be a disgrace think of your mother its impossible what a piece of work you are i said slowly you send her father to die she ends up in the camp raped and now shes a disgrace not fit to enter your house you did it and she pays not anymore i dont know how you live with yourself he stared down at the papers not saying anything always her father with you over and over you think you know he finally said what dont i know he pursed his lips then turned and stopped turning back a kind of physical indecision you still see his room on your rounds lower your voice he said darting his eyes toward the anteroom i dont care who hears you got away with it you can live with it he put his hands on the desk as if he were stopping his body from moving coming to an end yes i live with it you want to know that day i thought it never happened come he took his coat from the rack and started out not bothering to see whether i was following there was some quick italian to the nurse who nodded uneasily at me and we were in the hall where are we going i said out of here i will tell you something that never happened outside he turned right on the fondamenta dei mendicanti and began walking along the canal then stopped as if he had changed his mind an ambulance wait orderlies were carrying a stretcher off the boat stepping carefully from the deck to the receiving room door gianni went over and asked them something presumably whether he was needed i stood looking at the boat waiting everything by water even the sick claudias father must have come this way on a boat from the lido she would have stood here watching as they carried him in another one for san michele gianni said dead almost some morphine thats all you can do now pray if you believe that then san michele he started walking again shoving his hands into his coat pockets do you know how many dead ive seen when i was young i thought i would be helping people making them better you know the nice doctor with the cough medicine the way a child sees it thats what i thought it would be medicine but no death seeing it happen waiting for it ive spent my whole life in this building he said motioning with his head toward the long brick wall i know when someone is going to die what are we supposed to do we help even when we know it wont help we dont kill them we dont make that decision god does if you believe that maybe its just the cells giving up but not you not if youre a doctor i never wanted to kill people i wanted to save them and then sometimes you have to make a choice what choice i said quietly we were walking slowly now almost in time with the waves of the canal hitting the stone walls i said i would tell you something that never happened now this once and then i didnt tell you it never happened we never talked of it if you say we did i will deny it and by the way everyone will believe me you can never prove what happened but we must make a truce you and i for everyone not a peace you dont want that but a truce before you ruin your mothers happiness and your own life with thatwell she is what she is you think i made her that way no that i dont have to live with just her father yes i have to live with that im not proudthis thing that never happened are you proud of everything youve done well at your age its still possible not at mine im a doctor not assassino he was dying i knew he was dying nothing in the world was going to change that that doesnt mean you had to help you knew him abramo yes he was like herdifficult always looking for the slight but no matter he was dying i had to make a choice so i did you cant save the deadonly the living so was i wrong i knew what would happen to him but im not ashamed even now it was the war you had to choose the living choose how by reporting jews they were not there for the jews for someone else i dont remember his namemaybe i never knew it anyway it wouldnt have been real you know cln i nodded partisans so someone fighting for italy that meant something you know i wanted to help a man not sick wounded bullet wounds you couldnt hide that how could i lie about bullet wounds they would have found him they had a photographthey knew who he was and then what how long has he been here dottore you never reported this a partisan they were attacking germans then it wasnt just sabotage railroad tracksthey were actually killing them so if you were caught the germans would make an example there was no way to hide him in that hospital i had to get him out somewhere else i had to make them go away even for a little get enough time to save him so i gave them someone else we were at the end of the fondamenta facing into the wind coming off the lagoon on the water a covered funeral gondola bounced on the waves heading toward the cypresses another one for san michele thats some choice i said looking out at the water yes he said a terrible choice but not difficult he was dying the other man was living how else could i save him and yourself he looked at me yes myself its true it would have been bad for me if they had known i helped but you know at the time i wasnt thinking about that of course you wont believe that either you want to judgeone thing or the other but it wasnt like that good and bad together how do you judge that you do thingswell how can you know what it was like villa raspelli you think i wanted that how do you think it felt putting my hands on them giving them medicine men like that so you dont look at the uniform you dont see it then you can do it if its just a man so was grassini a dying man so i played god yes a sin thats what you wanted to know now you tell me somethingwhat would you have done i stared at the lagoon choppy in the wind and it seemed for an instant as i watched it move that everything in venice was like its water shifting back and forth why didnt you tell her this i said finally what difference would it make to her her fathers dead i had a part in that yes do you think she wants to know why what reason would satisfy her im not making excusesit happened but you its different i want you to know what happened happened or rather it didnt happen not now why you think this is a time for explanations now its revenge settling scores i have a position here these accusationsantisemite collaborator always something sticks however it was do you think people want explanations no theyre like you they want black and white but if you helped a partisan not everyone would love me for that even now collaborator communist its dangerous to take sides here this one that one and someone is against you no matter what you do so i do nothing nothing happened i go on with my life i dont want the war again he looked at me for a minute then turned toward the fondamenta i must go back anyway now its said maybe it makes a difference to you maybe not i dont know i thought a soldier youd know how these things were what happened then its hard to judge now do i still live with it yes but shall i tell you something a little less each day maybe thats how the war ends a little less each day until its over not for everybody no not everybody he said it never ends for them you talk as if its her fault no but not mine either i didnt make the war he said nothing for a few minutes looking toward the houses across the canal the same patchy plaster and shutters wed seen that day going to lunch before anything had happened you know what ended it for me he said suddenly when your mother came back i heard her laugh and it was a laugh from before the war and i thought yes its possible to have that life again and we do i wont let anyone take that away now not that girl does she think she can bring the father back i did what i did there was a reasonat least for me it was a reason now you know it maybe its still not enough for you but maybe its enough for a truce thats why i told you if its enough to make a truce what do you mean by truce an end talk like this it can make trouble for me i want her to stop he looked directly at me i want you to stop you mean you want me to leave he held my eyes for a second then nodded after the wedding rosa soriano was blond and stocky the weight i assumed a matter of inheritance because she took nothing with her morning tea not even glancing at the rolls and jam the bauer had laid out for breakfast she had a heavy persons surprising grace her thick fingers barely touching the cup lifting it in a delicate arc only her walk was clumsy an awkward shuffle still new to her her body pitching forward but held back by the stiff leg she dragged along from the war she said when she saw me looking at it a german souvenir when she sat down she breathed out a barely audible sigh of relief and brought the leg under the table the dining room was warm despite the rain spattering on the terrace but she had wrapped a shawl over a heavy jacket a huddled almost peasant look in a room walled with damask joe had said shed wanted the trip so i apologized for the rain but she looked at me blankly as if she hadnt noticed it she had come ready for businessa folder with papers and a notebook were at the side of the table my mother was german she said when i asked how she knew the language so that explains the hair she shrugged italians are blond too but not many speak german so it was useful my mother said it would be maybe not this way working for the americans joe said you recognized his name the name yes not his his brothers his brother paolo yes she said patting the folder him i know well but the other she shook her head then gently put down the cup then joe asked me and ha i thought another maglione maybe that explains it explains what the brother paolo was often at villa raspelli they kept a record of the visitors every day so we only have to look at the sheet to see who was there and then i couldnt understand it his name was there after he died how i thought maybe the records made a mistake but how do you make that mistake a ghost signs in so i look and the writing is different only the name is the same g maglione g paolo gustavo his first name that would be the name on any document so of course the germans but i dont understand he wasnt a doctor well villa raspelli wasnt a hospital itshow do you say casa di recovero i dont knowrest home recuperation center i guess so recuperation you know an officer is wounded maybe tired of the war he goes to villa raspelli he looks at lake garda breathes the good air he eats he gets better maybe he has to practice walking maybe the arm is like this she made a gesture to indicate a cast but no one is dying its casa di recovero not a hospital a club for butchers she said her voice suddenly bitter but then why did gianni go there she looked over almost delighted pleased with me that is an excellent question a doctor from venice from the big hospital why not someone in verona i have the records there were no serious illnesses there in this period and you know if it was serious they moved them out to a real hospital this was der zauberberg a place to rest but a doctor comes from venice so why i said nothing waiting of course it is an excellent excuse doctors do go there maybe not from venice but they go to make the checkups how is the cast you know no one would think it unusual if he went there but you did because i know what it was like he wasnt needed still there he is not once several times she pulled out one of the sheets and pointed g maglione not a ghost as i say an excellent excuse if you were meeting someone no suspicion at all you meet the ss at quadris everyone notices you meet secretly someone finds out but at villa raspelli no one questions it youre a doctor maybe someone has asked for you take a black bag all out in the open wonderful wait a minute back up his brother went there he wasnt a doctor well paolo didnt need an excuse they were his friends you know about him only what i read in the papers a playboy she nodded yes racing cars then more games the order of rome you know that i shook my head a club for boys like him young fascists rich stupid for the new empire ha abyssinia what did they care about abyssinia an excuse to get drunk be stupid together harmless and then not so harmless the germans began to use them of course it was the duce at salo but really the germans used them how to inform to help fight the communists for someone like paolo thats all you had to say the communiststhat would be the end of everything wouldnt it better to make a bargain with the devil so they did over drinks at the villa raspelli yes many times he was a favorite therehe must have been good company still a playboy and of course there was the work to discuss no more abyssinia now he was saving us from the communists a hero for italy for the church he wasnt the only one like that you know there were lots of heroes and now they answer for it she placed her hand on the folder as if it were the prosecutors case but not him no he answered earlier a car crash she took a sip of tea calm no he was killed i thought it went off the road it did after i looked at her surprised do you know that yes she said simply i reached for the coffeepot something to do while i took this in but gianni i said he wasntwhat was it order of rome no i only knew about the brother thats why im here to talk to you about this one well he wasnt that like paolo i mean not a playboy not stupid either i cant imagine him joining anything he likes to keep his hands clean not too clean isnt that why you came to us that was something else not the order of rome in his own way he i looked up from my cup he told me he did it to save someone else who was in the hospital at the same time a partisan she lifted her head in surprise then tipped it to one side thinking a partisan she said quietly turning it over another minute she pushed at her sleeve an absentminded gesture moving the heavy cloth back until a splotch of white appeared new skin without color i watched fascinated as she rubbed her finger over it idly scratching another souvenir of the germans there was more of it running up under her sleeve how large had the burn been the old skin blistering coming off in peels then hes lying she said finally startling me i looked up from her arm her eyes were certain not even a hint of doubt so that suddenly i had to look away ashamed somehow of feeling relieved oddly elated are you sure the partisans in the veneto were communists does he seem to you a man who would help the communists but not all americans why is this so hard for you yes communists or people fighting with communists it comes to the same who else was fighting the fascists not just at the end and when the nazis ran who else was there to chase them hunt them down were you there i said trying to imagine it she nodded of course a communist my parents were i was named for rosa luxemburgmy mother was her friend in berlin so she had to leave after they killed her and my father was then in milano she stopped well my parents thats for another day but not you not when i work for the americans she poured another cup of tea then looked up this matters to you just curious so you were a partisan yes like everyone now then not so many why do you think i do this work i dont forget what it was like what the others did the magliones both of them its the logic follow the dates she said patting the folder again paolo we know a bastard but his brother no record paolo is killed by partisans and now the brother appears on the guest list and not before no i checked after paolos death so now theres another maglione at villa raspelli why the logic is they appealed to him help us avenge your brother does he say no then why go back not one visit several and you dont think he was treating anyone no but at first i thought it could be i only knew about the brother not this one what he does how he feels that we have to guess and then you tell us hes reporting jews to the ss a doctor reporting jews you know this for a fact the daughter survived she saw him do it good she would be willing to testify to this yes i said hesitant wondering where she was going but so we have a link now he helps the ss with the roundups what else does he help them with hes not at villa raspelli to give aspirin i think its the logic but not the proof i said no not yet but ill get it she said scratching her arm again excited proof of what after paolos death of course there were reprisals this man was nothing to them not really but now hes an excuse make an example for the partisans show them what happens when theywell you can imagine its the end theyre desperate and they were always butchers so now theyre like crazy men torture terrible things and it works they begin to get the partisans pick them off always its communist uprisings theyre putting down not the resistance and once its very luckythis time a whole group a house and they burn it with people inside an atrocity and the question is who betrayed them but how could gianni no one betrayed them not that way someone led them to that house its possible not even deliberately not even knowing i looked at everyone in that house i made their files who would do it no one her voice had gotten stronger rising toward the end so that one of the waiters looked over thinking we were having an argument you were in the house i said yes not everyone died i was burned but i lived its strange you know because now im always cold you would think she put both hands on the table anchoring herself so i know who was there but who did they follow who did they know to follow someone here she said nodding at the folder and now you tell me something very interesting you pray for them to make a slip i think maybe he made the slip to you but i need your help how the date i need the date when he gave them the jew when the ss were there in the autumn yes but when exactly do you know she would i guess good when i get the hospital records i can match the dates to the names i looked at her puzzled why what slip she smiled slightly a man whose brother is order of rome who visits ss who reports jews this same man tells you he does this to save a partisan how would he know how would he know a man was a partisan i said nothing not just the lie the kind of lie the man told him i said weakly taking his side to see how it would fit who would tell him do you know how we lived other peoples names identitieseverything was secret we trusted no one and then you tell a man like that with his sympathies but how would they know his sympathies then you would not trust him unless you knew not with a life you would not tell him but somebody must have yes she said lowering her head someone must its possible the ss if they already knew help us make the trap watch him tell us when to follow of course its possible it was someone else and he tells the ss his new friends but in the end they know who helps them if the partisan was there at all maybe he just made it upsomething to tell me such a story to make up she said a man who wasnt there its more usual yes to take the truth and bend it a little easier to answer questions if you have to anyway no matter well see if he was there there were two people in that house from venice she looked up and one of them had been wounded i didnt know he had been in the hospital he wouldnt have said to protect whoever helped him but i know when he came to us so we match the dates i know what name he used what name did maglione tell you he didnt remember ah she said a patient without a name then i find out who did maglione see at villa raspelli i look at them their files and somewhere theres a connection if were lucky someone alive a witness the germans talk nowthey like to tell us what their friends here did you see not just us it was the war the italians were no better she nodded were very close now she sat back pouring more tea and for that i have you to thank it never occurred to me to track the brother and then one day joe tells me he was reporting jews its like a chain one thing to another but you were the start i looked out the rainy window uncomfortable youll give testimony yes and the daughter you intend to put him on trial intend hope it depends what we can prove you can prove he gave up abramo grassini she shook her head well you know that was the law to turn over the jews and the proofwhose word im sorry i dont say its right i say what is but the one thing leads to the other so its a help with you of course its different a credibility for you to testify against him what he told you but its hearsay hell deny it she leaned forward let me tell you how they work these trials the victims are dead so what do we have records of course she held one up a court exhibit circumstances sometimes a witness its difficult we have to show the chain the daughter knows something you know something a german knows something another we make a chain of circumstance she put down the folder sometimes a chain of lies he lies to the daughter he lies to you why and then you see the chain and you pull it she moved her hands in a tugging gesture and you have him but technically these are special trials the technicalities are different its not the cinema a murder trial its about murder no reputation maybe even social justice theres always that hope but not murder then theyll get away with it they did get away with it she said quietly so that the words hung over the table theres no retribution after youre dead but people dont know and that they wont get away with she sipped more tea watching me over the cup youre worried no i lied suddenly seeing the tribunal table my mother in the makeshift courtroom gianni glaring at me from the stand but i dont like throwing mud in public either if its just mud i saw it in germany nobody comes out looking goodyou get just as dirty she put down her cup yes she said a quick nod of agreement but ill still need you there she looked over at me it wont be just mud and if you cant prove it well i think i will and its important to have these trials otherwise otherwise what the partisans find their own proof afterward i crossed back to the dorsoduro side uneasy feeling things spinning out of control all id wanted was to get my mother out of a mistake now it was something else how could i testify against him it would be terrible for everyone and justice for whom rosa was right about that anyway he had already gotten away with it a little past san ivo a canal was being dredged a dirty job saved for winter when no visitors were here to see wooden planks dammed each end so big rubber hoses could pump out the water leaving a floor of mud just a few feet down where workmen in boots were shoveling muck and debris into carts the mud covered everything spattering the workers blue coveralls hanging in clots on the canal walls just below the line of moss giannis great fear mud would stick if someone dredged it up i thought of him on the terrace at lake garda having drinks with the men whod ordered the trains id met them in germany men still unsure why they were being accused but those were the ones in cells worn and frightened out of their protective uniforms awaiting judgment the others in the street just went about their business so ordinary there was no way to know no haunted looks no furtive tremor from unwanted memories the crime hadnt stuck to them they had gotten away with it free to walk around even marry a rich woman they smiled over the dinner table nobody knew and that they wont get away with rosa had said asking for help but a trial i imagined the courtroom me on the stand claudia on the stand and i knew my mother wouldwhat break no she was more resilient than that but a body blow leaves a bruise you survive but not quite the same she had survived my fathers death with a stray look of sadness that never quite left her now those first years bright for my sake she worked hard at making us happy putting part of herself aside as if it were something she could stow away in a closet for later but of course it was gone spent on me and now thered be another blow leaving her bruised and reeling again harder this time to come back already weakened never expecting it to come from me shed get over gianni but not that not a trial but then hed get away with it again i watched the workmen sliding in the wet muck in a few days theyd be finished the garbage and the smell gone and the water would flood back the surface a mirror again dazzling so that when you came to it around the corner you felt you were stepping into a painting i stared down at the mud unable to move as if my feet had actually sunk into it still trying to find a way out chapter seven mimi was lucky in everything but the weather il gazzettino was already calling the ball the first important social event since the war the one that would restore venice to her place in international society people were coming from london there had been a gratifying squabble over invitationsour marchesa upstairs not one of the lucky ones went to visit her sister in vicenza peggy guggenheim said she was coming from new york and then didnt which allowed mimi to use her name in the columns without having to put up with her a generator was found to keep the palazzo blazing with light if there was a power failure the food arrived on time and then it rained she had planned on a spring evening one of those first mild days softer in venice than anywhere else but the air stayed cold and it rained off and on all day the special torches at the water entrance on the grand canal had to be covered an awning set up footmen with umbrellas would help guests from their boats to the door but inevitably clothes would get wet the photographers had to be moved indoors away from the entrance shots with san marco in the background all this my mother learned in a series of phone calls that got more frantic as the afternoon wore on finally mimi insisted that my mother go there to dress like bridesmaids my mother said she says my hair will be a mess otherwise can you imagine a little rain but she was helping angelina with the garment bag carefully smoothing out any folds in the long skirt shes nervous i said she wants company mimi doesnt have nerves she just cant stand anyone making an entrance easier to have them already there well i dont mind to tell you the truth it does frizz up when its like this she said touching her hair anyway id rather see everything giannis always late and you cant say a word because its always medical at least this way i wont miss anything darling would you call the hospital and tell him to meet me there at mimis i couldnt get through before hell probably be pleasednow he can be as late as he likes without someone harping at him but not too late i cant dance by myself would you all right i said we were still living in the temporary peace of pretending nothing had happened im taking angelina but you can fend for yourself cant you mimi had already borrowed the rest of the staff for the day it doesnt matter im going out i wish youd change your mind everyone in venice is dying to be there and you go to the movies were not going to the movies well wherever youre going i cant imagine wanting to miss this you know mimi if theres one thing she she stopped midstream asked angelina to take the garment bag away then turned to me its that girl isnt it you dont want me to bring her to mimis do you well not ifbut i thought all that business was over and done with gianni said it was he said youd talked i looked away she doesnt have a dress well you can borrow a dress thats not a problem some other time what other time a thing like this shed probably enjoy it you know anybody would i dont think gianni would ask him if he doesnt mind then she looked up at me im so glad things are better i knew if you would justwell im off shell be calling again funny how her lines never go down dont forget the hospital and id ask him about the girl he might surprise you all right oh look its starting up again poor mimi she giggled well it is unfair you know we used to come to venice for the beach you never saw a drop one week to the next and now look an hour later the phones were clear and i reached gianni in his office but i didnt ask him about claudia and i didnt tell him to go to mimis instead i said my mother wanted him to come for her earlier than theyd planned and where was she now at the hairdressers of course easy lies after another twenty minutes of busy signals and scratchy connections i got the hotel where id moved claudia and left a message that id be a little late then there was nothing to do but wait the house growing quiet around me not even the faint sound of maids slippers in the back rooms the rain stopped then started again a light drizzle that covered the giudecca across the channel like a scrim i stood at the window looking at the redentore and thinking what to say i wanted it clear in my mind so that it would come out as easily as a white lie about the hairdresser one chance to make him believe me finally put an end to it be careful about everything even eye contact still what choice would he have it was a while before i realized the room was getting darker no more umbrellas on the zattere just people hurrying home with packages a few calles away mimi and my mother would be looking into mirrors finishing their makeup while the maids stood by with their pressed gowns mimis palazzo was just up from the dario so the vaporettos stopping at salute would see the lights coming on the chandeliers in the great front rooms reflecting out on the canal you could walk there from anywhere in dorsoduro in minutes but everyone would want to go by water and be seen it occurred to me that gianni would probably have a boat too and i went downstairs to open the water gate and turn on the lights in the murky entrance where claudia and i had kissed that night same gondola up on its storage rack the pile of paving stones under a tarp the utility boat bobbing outside near the mossy steps if wed followed the kiss just left the house instead of climbing the stairsbut we hadnt i left the connecting door open and put on the lights in the hall once a single room that ran the length of the house water to calle off it were some smaller rooms we never used presumably old offices or receiving rooms now just extra work for the maids good enough however for a conversation it was already dark upstairs why bother with the chandeliers if i was about to leave too no need to be politea few minutes not even a drink i lit a cigarette and sat waiting in one of the chilly side parlors where was he now that id decided what to do even convinced myself it was right any delay seemed to stretch out the time make it seem even longer than it was i looked at my watch always late my mother had said i began to fidget impatient picking at the fraying upholstery on the arm of the chair maybe shed called him after all told him to go to mimis and maybe he was just late i got up and walked toward the water entrance again moving to keep warm no sound of rain outside mimi might be lucky after all the street bell made me jump the sound bouncing off the marble floors jarring in the quiet house another ring insistent to make angelina run for it he had his finger up to ring again when i opened the door adam he said surprised he looked toward the dark stairs wheres your mother am i so late he glanced down at his watch no she went over earlier to hold mimis hand but you said i wanted to talk to you ah he said noncommittal still at the door i opened it wider he was dressed formally white tie everything crisp and shiny even in the halfhearted hall light the shirtfront glowed i had never thought of him as handsome before but formal clothes brought out the best in him the slickedback silver hair bright eyes smoothshaven skineverything looked dressed up stage romantic when he reached into his breast pocket i almost expected to see a silver cigarette case but it was only a pack not yet opened so im not in the doghouse he said pulling off the cellophane she says its terrible how im late youre expecting someone by boat he looked toward the water entrance the dark canal beyond i thought you might hire a gondolafor mimis i dont hire gondolas i have a gondola anyway i prefer to walk he lit a cigarette peering at me as he closed the lighter what did you want to talk about i want to make a truce i thought we had a truce a new one different ah he said marking time he gestured to the staircase you want to talk here it wont take long anyway you dont want to crease your tails all right he said displeased so heres the way this one works youre going to leave my mother end it ill take her awayhome if shell go anyway not here you wont see us again he sighed what a nuisance youve become like a child i can get her away in a week maybe two and when am i supposed to do this tonight at the ball he said toying another scene will your friend be there for the drama this week i said steadily tomorrow why not maybe you realized tonight it can never be two different worldsyou figure out what to say it wouldnt be the first time would it he looked away not rising to this and started walking slowly toward the water entrance and why would i do this because im going to do something for you he turned dont do anything for me i dont want anything from you youll want this im going to save your life he stopped staring at me what are you talking about your trial my trial he said toneless waiting i moved toward him you know none of this would have happened if you hadnt started with the first lie your old friend grassini you didnt expect itit was all of a sudden her coming at you so of course youd deny it anybodys first instinct but then you kept lying about it now why was that strictly speaking it wasnt even illegal and you wouldnt have been the only one but here you are just her word against yours and everybody happy to sweep it under the carpet and still you get all excited ride it out no you try to get rid of her make her go away at the time i didnt think i was ashamed for you i thought this is how anyone would feel to have this known but you were never ashamed of that your reputation would have survived it others have but you had to get rid of her now why was that this is so hard for you to understand talk like that no thats not it you didnt want people talking at all looking into it grassini meant nothing to you but think what else they might find once they started looking into things that you had to stop he picked up an ashtray from the hall table and rubbed out his cigarette really he said finally what makes you think so because i did look into it you did i nodded with some friends in the amg they do fieldwork for war crimes trials you scoop up a german youd be surprised what else swims into the net his eyes widened what else a brother who ran errands for the ss and got bumped off by partisans a whole series of cozy dinners at villa raspellino stethoscopes just you and the boys in black they have records they also have the germans cant stop talking it seems dont care a bit what happens to their old italian buddies happy to help out see once you start looking into things why are you doing this he said his voice quiet stunned the earlier smooth polish gone to make a truce i said to get rid of you you hate me so much all

you theyre preparing the case now check with the hospitalsee if anybody called about the records first week in october but its not true he said pale now you want to know something i dont give a shit i think it is true and if this isnt something else will be one way or another theyll get what they need theyre good and you were so closegetting away with everything except claudia came back he stared at me not saying anything his eyes still wide the problem is they want me to testify testify to what our little hearttoheart about the partisan for one thing it gives the story a certain heft not to mention its a confession about claudias father which isnt going to win you any friends in court you cant prove any of this he said panting a little a trial they cant prove anything well they might in fact id bet on it on the other hand anything can happen in court ive seen it you might get lucky but either way itll be a circus you dont want me on the stand and i dont want to put my mother through it so this time you really get lucky no trial you just go away no betterwell go away all you lose is the money bastard he said trying to control himself keep your money i will i guess the usual thing would be to buy you off but i figure youre getting a great deal anyway you go on as if nothing ever happened of course i cant say about laterthis kind of stuff has a way of coming out but i can stop it for now and thatll buy you time then who knows things change stop it how ill get them to close the case i can do it i guess its obstructing justice in a way but ill do it thats the truce i dont want a trial i looked at him and neither do you marmocchio he said almost under his breath a rumbling sei uno stronzo cazzo not very nice i guess whatever it is you shit no you know sciocco fool you are a fool ive tried everything with you then try this well go away and your troubles will be over my only trouble is you crazy maybe thats it still crazy from the war maybe it affected your mind you

me on trial like a criminal no its a farce you will be the one with the bad name not me a shame to your mother saying liesand then wheres the proof nowhere no proof you cant prove anything well see thats the thing they dont necessarily have to prove it what he said stopping not the people i talked to anyway they prefer itprofessional pride but sometimes with the right guy its enough just to say what they know go public with it somebody else figures out the rest old partisans maybe then they take care of it their own way he had paled again i told you i wanted to save your life they did it to your brother they wouldnt think twice about doing it to you not once they know i looked at him you dont want this trial its lies he said quietly then you have nothing to worry about you dont understand anything herewhat these people are like i thought they were friends of yours the one you helpedhed speak for you wouldnt he or was he in the house that burned you not finding the word sputtering of course they didnt know about your other friends over at villa raspelli what are you going to say that was i shook my head its a great cover until the germans talk you know how they are keeping track of everything reports to berlin duplicates here verona i guess everything that happened all their little hopes and dreams their friends i stopped you dont want this trial theyd knock you off before you were halfway through i dont want any part of that not that you dont have it coming but im not going to be the one to do it make the truce youre threatening me make the truce cazzo make it yourself he said throwing up his hand as he brushed past me so that it accidentally caught my shoulder i reacted by flinging up my arm to push it away a flicker of motion but enough to trigger an alarm in his head i didnt even see the hand come up just felt it on my chest as he pushed me back in a fury banging my head against the wall dont you dare raise a hand to me he said panting holding me let go i said seeing only the blur of his white front his hand coming out of a starched cuff then his face clearer now eyes glaring at me you think i wouldnt do it bah he loosened his hold then dropped his hand and make more trouble so you can run to mama thats right i said staring at him you like someone else to do it even better when its official when its the right thing to do go to hell he started toward the door smoothing back the sides of his hair then turned i warn you we stared at each other a standoff broken suddenly by the front doorbell for a second neither of us moved not yet jolted out of ourselves then i stepped away from the wall fix your tie i said brushing past him cazzo he said spitting it but he went over to the mirror to adjust himself public again i opened the door to claudia looking worried her hair a little scraggly in the moist air so you are here she said the lights are out upstairs didnt you get my message yes but its late she stopped seeing gianni in the hall oh ha the whore gianni said now everything is complete the cazzo and his whore a perfect couple shut up i said why is he here claudia said to listen to nonsense now i go claudia looked at me what nonsense nothing i said drawing her in just a little talk talk gianni said nonsense youre right i said turning to him he was elegant again his hair back in place it is nonsense why bother i dont want a truce either not anymore no what do you want i want to nail you i want people to know at my socalled trial thats right at your trial im looking forward to it what trial claudia said what are you talking about more drama for you gianni said you like so much to make scenes now you can tell everybody where your bed was at the camp all your special privilegeshow you earned them he wants you to tell everybody he wants people to know stop it i said my lawyer will ask the questions i guarantee it at this trial you want claudia moved from the door backing into the hall he followed her with words you think i dont know about you someone attacks me i ask questions i find out vanessi the man at the campyou think he would keep a woman out of pity no and not once months not forced a mistress someone who liked it who liked him maybe no claudia said softly so an actress maybe still acting he turned to me this is what you want a wonderful witness the camp whore stop it i said no it doesnt stop once it starts how can you stop it hold up your hand like traffic you think i wont fight back you make this trouble and then you think you can stop it no not when you like so you shame her and it doesnt stop there until everybodys dirty then what nothing you will win nothing i dont have to win i said i just have to let them see you he stared at me again for a minute im not going to let you do that he said finally understand that never his voice was low and steady the same calm menace id heard in the restaurant and i felt a prickling it had already started beyond fixing now any polite truce thats what you think i said never he repeated his voice still low go home im not leaving her not with you you dont know how it is you dont know anything a fool like the father just like the father he saw nothing under his nose still nothing saw what i said feeling clenched as if his hand were pushing me again you think its the first time with your mother you know nothing the fathers son another fool a snap in my head like the click of a safety shut up i said just shut up both of you fools each word like a prod with a stick shut up i said my hands springing up without my being aware of it pushing him back away from me the shove caught him offguard so he staggered before he could catch his balance his weight pulling him back toward the wall his head hitting the edge of one of the sconces adam claudia said somewhere out of my line of vision gianni put his hand to the back of his head then looked at it streaked with blood i saw the white of his dress shirt his blank expression the smeared hand everything utterly still and then the blood seemed to jump alive as he lunged for me i reared back keeping my throat out of reach so his hand struck my chest then we were both falling his hands now pounding at me wild the smell of blood claudia yelled something cazzo gianni said punching me i had never fought anyone hand to hand combat had always been a few kilometers away even across a field now i could feel his breath on me that close i rolled away not thinking instinct protect your eyes get up now no pattern to it a blur slaps and grabs and sudden bursts of pain i pulled at his shirt the stiff white front to draw him closer immobilize his arms but he pushed me away landing one hand on the side of my face i felt a dull burning and moved back one of his shirt studs had popped out opening up a patch of hairy skin in the evening clothes suddenly primitive what was real underneath i looked at the furious eyes the disheveled hair and saw that he was right it wouldnt stop now his hand caught me again my ear went hot stinging and i punched back until both of us were wrestling close in falling to the floor again in a heap pulling each other down the hall trying to find a position any kind of advantage then his grip loosened and i grabbed a chair pulling myself up away from him in a second he was on one knee then pitched forward pounding me in the side a throbbing ache that didnt go away that would bruise stop it claudia yelled following us whore gianni said as if he were punching her too finishing all of it i grabbed at him again pushing but he was ready this time and instead caught me and knocked me down i dodged a kick sliding away from his foot then scrambled up and moved back toward the water entrance the sound of my own breathing loud in my head he followed arms reaching out implacable the moving line at bayonet practice no time to hesitate do it i jumped at him my fist aiming at his nose and smashed down he howled weaving a little his hands to his face looking up at me in shock i backed away there were red spots on the shirtfront now then a longer drip blood running out of his nose stop it claudia said grabbing his arm he brushed her away a gnat and started toward me implacable again but he was slower this time obviously in pain all right i said panting enough a man my fathers age not a soldier already slowing down bound to get hurt my fathers age his friend in fact betraying him too not the first time i held up my hand enough but he was looking down at his ruined shirt bright with blood not hearing me dazed and then shaking excited everything about him ready to move and maybe just then i wanted it too that rush of blood he looked up at me a quick glance then before i could move he rammed his head into my stomach knocking me over i landed with a thud on the pile of paving stones poking up bluntly beneath the tarp so that for an instant winded all i could feel was a spasm of pain then my head fell back too as he jumped on me hands on my throat stop it stop it claudia was hitting him on the back trying to pull him off but he was oblivious lost in his own adrenaline strength tightening his hands on my windpipe i choked i could feel the blocks against my back then the wetness of the tarp everything smelled of damp the slick steps the canal i tried to wriggle out of his grip punching his sides but the hands didnt budge and now began to shake me banging my head against the tarp i looked into his face and found no expression at all just a kind of strained exertion as he kept his hands in place beyond him there were dim lights the gondola up on its support rack claudia flailing at his back her face frantic now she pulled on his collar yanking his head back and i saw absurdly that the white tie was still in place but then i was choking again beginning to feel dizzy without enough breath to shove his body off mine claudia was shouting still pounding on his back but i couldnt make out the words indistinct behind the pulse in my ears and the faint wheezing coming from my throat then suddenly a look came into his eyes hesitant a question to himself and i felt the hands loosen a quick rush of air i lay still waiting for him to lift his hands away and he was blinking as if waking still looking down at me in a kind of surprise unaware of the shadow over himclaudia her face pulled tight a paving stone in her hand now raised high then smashing down on the back of his head his eyes went wide a grunt then he fell on me pinning me under dead weight everything stopped no sound at all but the soft lapping of the canal against the steps his head had fallen to the side of mine and i listened for breathing anything then the stone slid off his back onto the floor a thunk and i felt blood oozing down his neck thick still warm i pushed at him gently at first then with a heave until he rolled off turning onto his back claudia stood looking at him shaking oh god i thought her voice was shaking too i got up and bent over with my hands on my knees the air still coming in ragged gulps how long had it been one minute two like a flash of light one flash and everything was different he was going to claudia was saying no he was going to stop but before i could say it claudia made a sound a kind of frightened yelp hes not moving is he moving i looked down eyes closed a small pool of blood under his head but not spreading if his heart were still pumping thered be more blood wouldnt there oh god now theyll i shook my head rubbing my throat with my hand no it was a fight no no she said a wail theyll say i killed him i did kill him theyll send me all in a rush like blood pouring out she had folded her arms over her chest holding herself a protection as if someone were already there to take her away i looked up catching her eyes the fear in them and felt it too a queasiness in the stomach both of us in a helpless free fall using our eyes to hold on i was still breathing hard excited and the fear was like another surge my skin warm with it stronger even than sex but like it too connecting us because we both felt it her eyes were shiny with the fear letting me in closer than wed ever been theyll send me she said again feebly almost to herself and i saw what she had already imagined how it would look the engagement party a public attack then the private killing driven to it nothing else would be believed i looked down at gianni again not moving then back into her eyes frantic the way theyd been standing over him with the stone raised for me we have to get him out of here i said out of here but theyll knowhe came here nobody knows that nobody knows you came here either nobody we have to get him out out she said vaguely meaning how the tarp i said stepping away from his body to reach the edge of the covering well wrap him in this two pieces one would never be missed oh god claudia said not moving well have to use the boat the boat claudia said dully we cant carry him through the streets we have to dump him in the lagoon theyll find him not if we weight him down here give me a hand with this but theyll look theyll ask questions we never saw him quick i said gesturing at the tarp youll be in trouble too for me the police i went over and took her by the shoulders still trembling under the coat i need you to help me move him to get him on the tarp can you do that she said nothing for a minute just looked at me nobody will know i said then let my hands slide away from her we need to roll him over onto the tarp theres blood she said quietly take his feet i said still looking at her then she nodded calmer almost herself again she stepped to the other side of the body and bent down to grab his legs i looked at him again shiny leather shoes white tie already dressed for burial i crouched down and put my hands on his shoulders ready to push okay when i say a groan faint enough to be a sound out on the canal then an almost imperceptible twitch in his arm another groan louder this time and claudia made a little cry her hands to her mouth and jumped away oh god she said hes not dead a stiff body no longer pumping blood it had never occurred to me to check now i leaned over him listening my fingers touching the side of his neck but what were you supposed to feel a pulse any movement at all if he were alive thered be breath i put my ear next to his mouth for a second nothing then the faint gagging sound again i looked up at claudia our eyes meeting across the body alive to have her arrested sentout of the way ruin everything i felt a slight movement in his shoulder and looked back down eyes still closed a blotch of red on his shirtfront just dead and now alive again unstoppable no expression on his facemaybe the way it had been nodding at the hospital sitting on the terrace at villa raspelli calmly leaning over my mother touching her soft throat not the first time unstoppable about to get away with all of it get us out of the way i looked up at claudia again the same shiny eyes and then grabbed his shirtfront and began dragging him to the steps adam she said but what i heard was the scrape of his clothes across the stone floor another whispered groan the back of his head left a smear of blood behind unstoppable i dragged him over to the steps then kneeling pushed his head into the water and held it there forcing it down my arms clenched shaking do it a whimper from where claudia was standing i felt the wet creep along my legs nothing moved in the water then a few bubbles appeared rising out of his mouth and the body began to twitch maybe an unconscious reaction a last gasp not thrashing for life just a series of twitches i held his head under by the throat hearing my own blood in my ears watching the bubbles how long then suddenly his body shook and his eyes flew open and i felt they could see me through the mirror of water knew it was me leaning over him with my hand on his throat choking him until the water finally rushed in and forced out the last bubble i held him for another minute until nothing moved at all then stood up slowly my arms dripping with water his eyes were still open rigid now not focused on anything i took a deep breath and for a second expected the fear again the free fall in my stomach but what i felt dazed was the ease of it a matter of a minute to kill in the war we always wondered if we could do it stick the bayonet in and now i had with no more effort than it would take to nod i turned to claudia but neither of us said anything i could hear a ships hornthe moist air in the lagoon was probably thickening to fog easier to hide i nodded at the wall switch get the lights we dont want anybody claudia glanced down at gianni his leather shoes sticking up incongruously on the water stairs then went over to the wall with only the lamps from the indoor hall we had to work in shadows i looked across the canal to the neighboring buildings a few upstairs lights the rest of the windows dark no one seemed to have noticed anything even the marchesa was away i pulled the boat around i laid out the tarp then dragged gianni up to it by the feet hearing thuds as his head hit the stairs i pitched him forward so that he was sitting up then started to take off his jacket struggling with the arms what are you doing we have to wipe up the blood i dont want to use anything here they might miss it thats it okay use this then well throw it in with him she hesitated for a second not understanding then looked at me dismayed i nodded she waited another second staring then shivered and took the wet jacket and began mopping the floor around us as i moved him onto the tarp we threw the jacket over him and weighed it down with paving stones then rolled the tarp over and tied it at each end with some rope i found near the water gate i didnt think anyone could see us in the halflight of the room but we worked quickly making sure the blood was gone then lugging the heavy bag toward the steps here let me steady it well just slide him in claudia was sweating her face flushed from the lifting and when she looked up waiting for me i felt the closeness again not fear this time something more intimate in it together i was lifting the rolled tarp over the gunwale when the phone rang we froze two phones ringing one upstairs one in the hall looking for him drawing attention to the house i stood still as if any movement might be seen through the water gate eyes peering around the edge of curtains curious about the phone when it stopped i realized i had been holding my breath i took up the tarp again on two i said and she lifted with me and he was in the boat rocking from the sudden movement i steadied it with my foot and reached out my hand to help her in she stopped a small panic in her eyes i cant swim she said do you want to stay i said she glanced quickly at the dim entryway then shook her head and stepped in clenching my hand until she sat its cold youll need a coat she said motioning toward my jacket wet at the sleeves no time i said untying the boat and pushing off into the canal well have to use the oars until we get farther out the motors too loud as we floated quietly toward the zattere it occurred to me a stray thought that nothing ever changed in venice muffled oars a body taken away in the night i looked across at claudia over fans at la fenice the rain had left a heavy mist over the water when we reached the giudecca channel there were a few distant shafts of yellow lights from boats and a much stronger wind that cut into my wet sleeves i lowered the small outboard motor into the water and jerked hard on the starter cord a sputter not much more than a grunt how long since it had been used was there even gas in the tank another pull why not just dump him here the giudecca was a deep channel not one of the shallow city canals but too near the tides that flushed out the city could flush things back in i imagined gianni stuck just a few feet underwater in a side canal waiting for the dredgers better to get him out into the lagoon even if it meant rowing but that would take hours i pulled on the cord again a louder sputter as if it were choking on itself adam i turned a vaporetto had pulled away from its stop on the giudecca and was heading across toward us its headlights growing brighter through the mist i pulled the cord again the pilot would see us not run us down and then be curiouswhat would anybody be doing out at this hour in the cold a witness i let the cord sit for a second not wanting to flood the motor then yanked it a louder sputter almost catching lost under the noise of the vaporetto the light was closer i yanked again a small cough then another settling into a series of spitting exhaust noises as the motor came to life hold on i said then let out the choke and swung us away from the approaching boat into the dark close enough to feel a lift from its wake i had no idea where to go except away from the city somewhere beyond the lights the open sea past the barrier islands was too long a trip and in the dark too dangerous the lagoon itself was a maze of currents and shallow wateryou heard stories about visitors who ended up stuck on an unexpected mudbank you were only safe if you followed the channel markers i turned at the tip of the giudecca and went behind san giorgio maggiore putting the island between us and san marco it was darker here the thick mist broken only by tiny marker lights a few bobbing on buoys the others on those fence posts the venetians use to outline their water roads if other boats were out theyd be here too hugging the safety of the channel but what choice was there in the mist without even starlight to drift away from the markers would be to circle in complete darkness with a dead man in the boat i glanced down at the rolledup tarp the first time id even thought about it a dead man would the blocks be enough to hold the body to the bottom or would the tides dislodge it what if they never found him at all i moved the boat out of the main channel keeping parallel to it the markers in sight boat traffic might churn up something from the bottomthis distance could give it a small margin let it lie undisturbed the mist was gathering in patches now almost fog i squinted afraid of missing any of the markers behind us san marco had disappeared just a vague light source without definition claudia was bent over in the prow looking down arms wrapped tightly around herself and i realized that it must be cold that i should be shivering in my damp jacket and instead felt flushed still excited the boat trip somehow just an extension of the fight not yet over i saw my hand on his throat underwater the eyes come open what id never had to do in the war kill a man i swung the boat away from a buoy that seemed to have come from nowhere pay attention think later now just get rid of it this was far enough somewhere between the city and the lido what if he washed up on the beach where theyd met i idled the engine but it stalled gave another cough and then went quiet suddenly without the throb of it the silence around us had the quality of mist opaque opening up slightly for the faint bells on the buoys there was just enough light from the marker to see her face staring at the tarp then looking at me adam if we do this the body its a crime we cant explain she looked away unsure how to finish it is a crime i killed him she glanced back at me her eyes suddenly fierce no both both of us she said her voice steady and i thought of her that first afternoon in the hotel near the station opening a button i looked across at her for another minute not saying anything then nodded hold on to the sides keep the boat steady she placed her hands on either side i knelt forward took up the front end of the tarp and lifted it over the edge it didnt matter where you grabbed it it was no longer a body just something heavy wrapped in tarp pushing the boat down with its weight claudia shifted to the other side as if she could counterbalance the slide it wont tip i said dont worry and then before it could settle i heaved up lifting the back end with a grunt and swinging it around until its own weight was pulling it over and all i needed to do was push then quickly right the boat as the tarp plunged into the lagoon there was a splash rocking the boat for a few minutes we just sat looking over the side as if the body would bounce back up again but then the ripples died down and the water was smooth all the way to the buoy just a gentle lap at the side of the boat i looked around no other boats claudia was still staring at the water so she said i didnt say anything suddenly tired as if the adrenaline were draining away a kind of anemia how long before we knowif its down its already down what do we say we have to think what to say nothing we never saw him but theyll ask where were we i pulled the cord grateful the motor started right away not wanting to talk i hadnt thought beyond the body getting rid of it but of course we werent rid of it people would ask the police would be called we would be part of it you called him at the hospital when did you see him last where were you the body was only the beginning now i did feel the cold the wet air hitting my face in little stings then harder ones as the mist turned to rain again almost as cold as germany the terrible sharp wind and people fighting over pieces of coal you didnt think about anything except staying warm not bodies not what you were doing there just getting in out of the cold the black water streamed past the side of the boat pelted with rain wed be coming up to san giorgio soon i slowed the boat unable to see more than a few yards ahead claudia hunched down under her coat shivering folding herself up against the rain i followed the markers still looking around for other boats but who would be out now no fishermen no water taxis only someone who didnt want to be seen hidden by the emptiness of the lagoon i wiped my eyes feeling the cold rain seeping down my neck the shocked alertness of a cold shower no longer caught up in a blood heat what were we doing a body wrapped in a tarp dead not an accident i saw the tarp sinking dragged down by stones deliberately made to disappear what explanation could there be now claudia was rightwe had to think what to say theyd look for him he had a daughter doges in the family why would a man disappear theyd hear about the engagement party theyd talk to claudia and somehow it would come out somehow only people like gianni got away with murder i felt queasy again but she hadnt hesitated both of us there was a sudden burst of rain in my face it was really coming down now sheets of it mimis party would be chaos the trip back was longer and by the time we reached the giudecca channel we were soaked through my fingers frozen on the rudder i killed the motor when we were almost at the zattere letting the boat bob for a minute then rowing back under the footbridge to our canal the sound of the rain now covered the plash of the oars i didnt have to let the boat drift claudia lifted the coat off her head and looked around its okay no ones out i said i wont go back to that camp she said as if she hadnt heard me another conversation no never no matter what its not there anymore claudia i said quietly that one another any of them ssh i said no ones going anywhere i put a finger to my lips then pointed at the lighted window across the canal i used the oar to swing around to our gate catching the mooring pole and tying the boat before i helped claudia out she was shivering her lips moving involuntarily i helped her up the stairs then closed the grilled door on the canal she was standing near the pile of paving stones staring at the tarp i looked down to where the blood had been just a streak of wet now come on lets get you dry i said taking her arm she was still looking at the tarp what are we going to do a bath youre freezing no i mean what are we going to do she motioned toward the pile i know what you mean a bath then were going to go to mimis she looked up what ive been thinkingits the safest thing we can do hundreds of witnesses when anyone asks we were at mimis are you crazy we can do it people will be late everythingll be a mess in the rain we go in the back then were in the ballroom dancing thats all anyone will remember dancing she said shocked after we just i took her arms i know what we just did and now were going to mimis i cant we have to i said still holding her otherwise where were we how can we go she said nervously like this what do we wear borrow something of my mothers i couldnt claudia i said gripping her now there isnt time ill run the bath well pick something out itll be all right it has to be but my hair its all wet she said putting her hand up to feel it your hair she stopped hearing the absurdity of it everybodyll be wet i said come on we have to hurry she didnt move we can do it i looked toward the tarp we cant let anyone know and were supposed to smile after this she shook a little yes as if nothing happened i took her shoulders again because nothing happened she looked at me then nodded still shaking all right hot water come on leave the lights i want to check later if theres any blood we missed oh she said stopping she looked back toward the steps her face slack you all right i said softly she nodded its justi forgot about the blood chapter eight there was only enough hot water for one bath so we took turns while i was drying off near the space heater claudia went through my mothers closet her head wrapped in a towel her skin flushed from the warm soak youre young that already puts you ahead wear anything to a party like this its easy for you if it still fits i said picking up my jacket from the bed i havent worn it in three years thats nice she was holding up an evening gown with a scalloped neck as creamy and soft as lingerie its from before the war here let me help she slid the dress over her head its loose she said this much i pinched in some fabric at the back we can pin it youll look wonderful oh wonderful she said flouncing out her damp hair everyone will see its old theyll still be looking at you thats all we want look at all this powder everything how can she have so much i left her at the mirror patting her face and went to dress hurrying even managing my tie in a few minutes then i headed downstairs to check the water entrance running a flashlight along the edge of the tarp there were a few dark splotches of dampness on the stone floor possibly from our dripping clothes but nothing that looked like blood one more check tomorrow in the daylight what else the ashtray in the hall not even a trace when i got back to my mothers room claudia was still at the dressing table putting her hair up we have to hurry theres nothing else i can do with it she said ignoring me this way it doesnt matter if its wet i saw the white back of her neck like a girls then looked into the mirror as she blotted her lipstick the room was warm now close with the smell of perfume and powder you look beautiful she met my eyes in the mirror then looked down suddenly upset i cant do this all the time thinking she stopped then reached for another tissue and raised her head to look at me again where are the pins it needed only two which i covered in the back with the sash the shoes were more difficultwe had to stuff wadded tissue into the toes to make them fit so claudia said standing in front of the mirror smoothing the skirt its okay almost i went into my mothers closet and pulled out the false panel in the glove drawer that hid her jewel case you had to lift the top tray of rings out to get to the bigger pieces i took out a necklace i cant wear shes not wearing it i said fastening it behind her neck she wont mind she fingered the stones just gazing into the mirror for a minute my god are they rubies i dont know garnets maybe anyway they suit you your coloring ready but she stood there still looking then made a wry grimace all my life i wanted to go to those parties in one of the palazzos with jewels and nowlike this mimis groundfloor layout was similar to ours a long hall stretching from the grand canal to a calle flanked by old offices and storerooms converted tonight into cloakrooms and little parlors as id expected there was a crush at the water entrance a swarm of flashbulbs and dripping umbrellas and harried maids running back and forth most of the maids were new borrowed from friends or hired for the evening and none of them recognized me we were just part of the crowd in evening dress streaming in from all directions handing over wet coats adjusting hair in powder rooms stamping our shoes dry on the marble floor in the confusion of arrival with everyone talking at once and music coming from upstairs no one noticed us we might have come in at any time i glanced up to see if mimi was on the stairs receiving but she had evidently already joined the party better still at the top of the stairs was a landing an anteroom before the main sala a place to catch your breath and gather your skirt and for a moment we stood there dazzled mimis ballroom was one of the grandest in venice as large as the rezzonicos and tonight every inch of it seemed alive with light the center chandeliers were electric but the walls were lined with sconces holding real candles hundreds of them backed by mirrors so that the effect was watery constantly in motion the nighttime equivalent of sunlight reflected off the canal at the end of the room the high windows tapered to gothic points but the walls themselves were rococo paneled arcadian scenes framed in gilt moldings of swirling plaster waiters passed trays of champagne women glanced at themselves in mirrors after the dark lagoon the bulky tarp splashing over the side of the boat i felt we had stepped into another worldnot this one maybe the one the room had been meant for not real even then adam you did come mimi after all standing guard at the door her hair swept up was sprinkled with jewels not a tiara but tiny diamond pins bits of starlight could she see it on my face washed now but still somehow streaked with his blood i felt my hands shaking and dug my nails into the palms we could do this had to hours ago i said nodding toward the crowd below and youve brought miss grassini claudia said yes i remember so glad she said shaking hands her eyes sweeping down to take in claudias dress she turned to me how nice you look out of uniform a raised eyebrow i thought you didnt have evening clothes grace said you couldnt find and then i did i hope its all right darling dont be silly im desperate for young people half the men here seem to have canes when did we all get to be such an age she paused youre supposed to say you didnt i lifted my head focusing digging my nails in again you didnt charm itself isnt he she said to claudia and so quick i dont suppose youve brought gianni no isnt he here i said not looking at claudia not yet i dont know how grace puts up with it i wouldnt hed be late to his own funeral claudia moved involuntarily catching mimis eye well a doctor she said yes but at this hour oh dear she said looking over my shoulder toward the stairs count grillo i never thoughtthe stairs i turned to see a whitehaired man making his way up slowly gripping an attendant with one arm and the banister with the other maybe i should have him carried but so embarrassing my god when i think how he used to an old flame how he used to dance dont be fresh go and be conspicuous maybe you can get the orchestra to liven things up a bit she turned to claudia well talk later im so glad you came you look lovely she moved over to the head of the stairs ernesto how marvelous no dont hurry oodles of time a waiter came by with champagne theyre going to start wondering where he is claudia said looking at her glass she shuddered suddenly like someone caught in a draft cold she shook her head im nervous i dont know why not before not even in the boat and now here a place like this have some champagne oh just like that champagneas if nothings happened i want people to see us having a good time i said spreading my hand steady now toward the ballroom he wont be missed for hours hes a doctor theyre like that things come up i put down my glass on a little table so lets be conspicuous dance she looked up at me biting her lip its my fault all this i held up my arms ready to dance and now for you this trouble what if you had never met me i took the champagne glass out of her hand yes what if i said then put my arm behind her back and moved her into the room the orchestra in formal cutaways was playing why do i love you but slightly offrhythm as if they were sightreading more familiar with strauss than a twenties show tune not that it mattered the dancers were moving at their own pace peering over shoulders the music just an excuse to look around at one another everything gleamedjewels the huge mirrors even the long parquet floor polished probably for days i thought of byrons famous party when they threw gold plates into the canal so you can dance too claudia said miss hills dancing class we all had to go the boys hated it and the girls they liked to get dressed up she glanced around the room so nothing changes look at the clothes is it all right the dress perfect ha perfect the poor relation not too poor i said putting a finger to the necklace off to the left i caught a quick flash of light stronger than a candle jewels if my father could see me she looked away frowning maybe it was for him what happened for him but at that moment my face suddenly warm i knew it wasnt not for him not even for claudia id wanted to do it i wasnt in the cold boat anymore unable to think id wanted to do it even now i could feel the odd excitement of it my arms shaking as i held his head under whats wrong claudia said nothing just a little warm dance over therei want them to take our picture another flash went off and now the heat drained away from my face as if my blood were running back and forth like the tide in the lagoon adam what are you doing here my mother was standing with a couple at the edge of the dance floor i leaned over and kissed her cheek i decided you were right so we borrowed a dress your idea remember my mother was taking in claudia giving a surprised glance at the necklace then she smiled extending her hand not missing a beat claudia how nice i hope you dont mind my mother waved this away wonderful what being twenty years younger can do for a dress its perfect on you and i saw in her smile that she thought some other bargain had been struck an end to the trouble our coming a promise of smoother days ahead more precious than rubies her face beamed with a kind of warm relief oh but let me introduce inspector cavallini signora cavallini inspector claudia started not expecting this but the cavallinis half turned to the dance floor missed the flicker in her eyes signorina grassini isnt it my mother went on ive become so bad at names and my son of course you know i think you met at harrys there were the usual nods and handshakes something to fall back on while i collected myself yes i remember i said quickly a signal to claudia i hope youre not on duty tonight only as an escort he said smiling its my wife who brings me signora cavallini nodded accepting this she had the grave long face of someone invited for her family connections well if gianni doesnt get here soon you will be my mother said ill have to send you out to find him ah if every woman did that when the man is late the police would never sleep adam you did call him yes at the hospital i told him to meet you here hes probably around somewhere its a mess downstairs we were here for ages before we found you claudia looked away no its not like him well it is like him but not this much if you see what i mean excuse me would you turn this way please the photographer stepped back onto the dance floor motioning with his head for us to stand closer a flash went off and there we were evidence claudia and i standing next to the police for one wild moment i wanted to laugh caught by the unexpectedness of luck perhaps you would not worry so much if you were dancing cavallini said may i after a nod to signora cavallini he led my mother out to the floor leaving us to make small talk with his wife it was a pity about the rain but the ball was lovely the way venice used to be so much food of course it was easier for foreigners when even this ran out i looked at my mother chatting happily while she danced and i felt queasy again signora cavallini whose english was poor must have been as bored as we were because she led her husband away before he could ask for another dance they drifted into the next room where supper would be served later picking up glasses of champagne along the way my god what a country even the policemen go to balls imagine at home my mother said how does mimi know him his wife i think of course with mimi you never know she casts a pretty wide net look at them all she said waving to the room and she was so worried they wont come out in the rain well theyd come out in a monsoon youll never guess whos here celia de betancourt i thought the war really must be over if shes back venezuela all this time imagine the boredom of it who darling you remember you were fascinated by her when you were little on the beach she would just tan and tan i made a helpless gesture well anyway shes here still brown as a berry too of course its sunny there i suppose thats her over with mimi remember i looked across the floor at a woman in a strapless taffeta gown her dark neck entirely covered in diamonds thats some necklace the jewels are past belief i think even mimi was stunned they said the war would put an end to all this and just look i hope its all right claudia said touching hers about the necklace my mother said nothing for a minute her face soft and pleased then put her hand on claudias its lovely isnt it adams father gave it to me awful to think of it just sitting in a box somewhere its nice to give it some air like a pet i said you know what i mean whats the point of having them if you dont wear them anyway she said to claudia im glad you did she turned to me her eyes moist you look so like your father in those clothes so like he loved to dress up you know parties while you werewhere i thought then felt dismayed for thinking it so handsome well she said and then making a connection known only to herself you know its not like him not really im worried its all very well that policeman poohpoohing saying men are late but he wouldnt be late for this what did he say to you just that hed see you here its not that late i said glancing at my watch hell be here suddenly i wanted a cigarette anything to steady the jumping in my stomach but i called his house he left hours ago maybe he stopped for a drink somewhere a drink and then fell into a canal i suppose my mother said dismissive tonight of all nights the inspector didnt seem to think oh i know what he thinks some woman why else would a man be late a little stop along the way i wouldnt put it past him he practically winks at you when he talks but thats not gianni she put her hand on claudias again i hope adam explained things what hes like he wouldnt hurt a fly you know he wouldnt know how claudia moved her hand looking away anyway youve come to dance and im just fussing and ruining things off you go ill wait here like penelope with my weaving she made a shooing motion with her hands toward the dance floor the orchestra had switched to a piece of generic ball music lilting and sweet without being recognizable as anything in particular something to talk under as we danced people were passing back and forth between the ballroom and the food tables next door balancing little plates of hors doeuvres what are you going to say to her claudia said when wed moved away from the edge nothing but if they never find himthink how it will be for her never to know if they never find him well be safe shell be what all right frantic waiting for some word the phone to ring how long before a disappearance becomes painless just a mystery i looked at claudia we cant say anything you know that dont you we cant she nodded ill get her to go away somewhere maybe mimi she wont leave now shell look for him she cant look forever itll pass i said weakly not even convincing myself we stared at each other for a moment not talking just moving our feet in aimless circles to the music then her eyes grew shiny and she turned her face away oh she said a moan cut off turned suddenly into a kind of nervous giggle that caught in her throat she pitched her head forward onto my shoulder to stifle it steady an unexpected shaking we have to get through this i said then well be all right cant we leave now everybodys seen us if they find the body theyll try to fix a time of death people have to think we were here all night how would they find it you said hed go to the bottom in the lagoon if they find it oh god and then what then we were here all night having a good time i pulled her hand to me bending my head to kiss it then saw my own fingers and froze there were little rims of rust under the nails no blood when id clenched my hands earlier had i dug them in so deep i opened my hand no marks on the palms his blood where anybody might see it if he looked closely enough cavallini hadnt noticed shaking hands but what if we met again i might be lighting a cigarette bringing my fingers up the rims suddenly visible unavoidable the smallest thing could give you away i turned claudias hand over spreading it let me see no youre all right what she said startled clutching her hand ill be right back i said letting my arms fall have some champagne right back turning away not even waiting to see her expression explain anything time enough later the nearest mens room was on the other side of the stair landing unmarked but guarded by a footman placed there to direct ladies down the hall inside another servant was acting as washroom attendant turning taps and handing out towels count grillo stood in front of the toilet bowl still supported on one arm his pee a trickle that barely made a sound as it hit the water i dug my fingernails in again waiting when he finished flushing and then slowly buttoning up i stepped forward to take his place but nothing came out i was too anxious now even to pee but i had tootherwise why had i come and then the attendant turned on the tap the sound of gushing water like a cue and it was all right i slumped a little my breath spilling out too count grillo took forever to dry but finally shuffled away i rubbed my hands around the bar of soap lathering them keeping my back to the attendant my knuckles were raw not broken but scrapedwhat happened to hands in a fight i ran one nail under the others and dug at the dried blood more soap when i rinsed there was just enough blood to stain the water a thin pale stream i stood for a minute staring at it light rust like something that might have come out of an old water pipe there all along shaking hands with cavallini with scraped knuckles and blood under my fingernails but he hadnt seen hadnt thought to look and now it was too late the red running into the soapy water then out some ancient drain to the lagoon safe prego the attendant had leaned forward holding out a hand towel the word loud in my ear had he been close enough to see it didnt have to be cavallini anybody just one glance at the basin the eye drawn to the unexpected stain momento i said quickly turning my shoulder to block his line of sight what if any of it had stuck to the porcelain but i couldnt wash the bowl not with him standing there i lathered once more then rinsed holding my hands out for the towel but keeping the water running a last chance to let it wash away the attendant reached over and turned off the tap not looking at the water busy now with the towel taking it from me and putting it in the hamper involuntarily i looked down at my hands pink from all the soap and water but no more rims no evidence when i looked up i found the attendant staring at me his eyes a question mark i dropped my hands folding the rough knuckles out of sight he kept staring and for a minute feeling chilled i thought he had seen was trying to decide what to do but then he held up a clothes brush and i saw that he was just waiting for me to turn around so that he could dust me off make the rest of me as clean as my hands an hour later we called giannis house again this time using claudia to speak italian non in casa my mother said thats all i can get out of them well i know hes not at home claudia took the phone and spoke rapidly for a few minutes but learned nothing more hed left the house on foot before eight dressed for the party did he say he was going anywhere first no he said he had to hurry he was a little late the hospital knew even less hed left at the usual time for home yes and he hadnt been back no he was going to a big party my mother now fidgeted genuinely worried as if claudias italian should have produced different answers but its ridiculous she said no one just vanishes no claudia said so he must have a reason i looked at her expecting to see her eyes dart away but she met mine evenly no longer skittish her balance restored somehow by having to lie to my mother or maybe the lies were becoming real to us what had really happened maybe he did fall into a canal my mother said you think im joking bertie says it happened all the time during the war in the blackout several people died funny isnt it the only war casualties no bombs just people falling into canals where is bertie anyway he always comes late always he doesnt dance you know he just turns up for supper and a good look around maybe thats it maybe hes coming with bertie gianni why would he do that theyre not chums really no somethings wrong i know it seriously what should i do i dont know where else would he be with friends darling instead of me somethings happened maybe you should talk to inspector cavallini claudia said i looked at her but she ignored me concentrating on my mother yes but what do i say i dont want to ruin mimis party ask him to call the questura if there has been an accident somebody in the canal anything like that my mother hesitated frowning theyd report that wouldnt they she nodded thinking to herself and turned away touching my arm absentmindedly as she left youre sending her to the police i said watching my mother head into the other room claudia shrugged he wont do anything but maybe hell remember that we went to him before anything was wrong inspector cavallini indulging my mother made the call to the questura nothing had been reported no accident no body stumbled over in a dark calle he asked someone to check the hospitals for anyone brought in with a heart attack a stroke anything sudden but venice had been quiet huddled in out of the rain you know shell make it worse he said drawing me aside his voice confiding manoftheworld a man stops somewhere sometimes its difficult getting back maestre perhaps somewhere on the mainlandmany go there and then a delay the train is late so the arguments often this happens a part of life he wouldnt go to maestre in white tie he was in white tie cavallini said looking at me i suppose so i said quickly they said at the house he was dressed for the party i just assumedanyway too dressed for maestre somewhere in venice then a visit its usually the case or someone sick a medical emergency perhaps he said dubious but then he would call yes i dont know maybe hes sick himself then someone will find him meanwhile make your mother easy maybe sick yes but maybe delayed a simple matter ah signora miller he said as my mother came up nothing has been reported so i think its a matter for the patience but theyll call you here if anything yes i asked them to do that dont upset yourself i think next youll hear the apologies thank you my mother said still frowning concerned then mimi was with us grace ive been lookingis anything wrong no no my mother said brightening dont tell me he still hasnt shown its maggie and jiggs you need a rolling pin theyre all stinkers arent they have you had supper she said to the rest of us theres lovely food im going to borrow grace for a minute she took my mothers arm come on ernestos in a pout and you always know what to say to him she was moved off a boat in tow and we were alone with cavallini again thank you for doing all this im sorryat a party he shrugged these things happen shell be angry yes when he comes yes he gave a sly smile yes another night would have been better an old hand at slipping out i wondered if he kept a girl in maestre in a small flat near the factories for visits dance i said to claudia eager to get away the orchestra looser and more confident finally upbeat was playing cole porter it was the music everybody had wanted what theyd flirted to on the lido and the floor was crowded soon the older guests would begin to drift away or settle themselves with plates of food but just now the whole room seemed to be dancing moving back and forth in flickers like the candles the stairs were empty everyone who was coming had already arrived how long before even cavallini became alarmed he was watching from the edge of the floor a knowing smile still on his face knowing nothing and i realized then that no one knew not anyone in the bright crowded room and the secret carried with it a kind of perverse pleasure no one knew we were a couple dancing to night and day that was allsomething for cavallini to gossip about later with his wellborn wife not too much longer i said all right claudia said preoccupied she moved with the music for a few more minutes then said what will she do shell go back to ca venti she wont stay here not with mimi but we dont have to wait we should do what we would normally do can we eat something first its terrible i know but im so hungry food had been available all night passed on trays and anchoring long tables in the next room but now a new buffet had been set up a lavish late supper hot in silver chafing dishes with waiters to carry your plates to a table there were glass bowls of caviar and carving trolleys of roast veal fruit arranged in pyramids it was in its way more opulent than the ball itself as if rationing had never existed imaginary even in venice which had had an easy war it was disturbing to see so much food you go i said to claudia i want a smoke first i went over to the balcony windows facing the canal lit a cigarette and almost at once became nauseated the queasiness id felt all evening suddenly lurching in my stomach it might have been the close room the sight of the rich food the smoke on an empty stomach but i knew it wasnt just what was left of the nervous energy that had started when id pushed him against the wall everything up and down the freezing rain in the lagoon then a ballroom hot enough for bareshouldered gowns pushing his head down in the water my fingers still streaked with blood everything in me pumping willing me to do it then polite evasions the puzzled hurt look on my mothers face i opened one of the windows and gulped in some air it was surprisingly cold like the air in the lagoon stinging on my warm face below a vaporetto heading to salute was passing mimis water entrance still busy with lights and boats tied to the striped poles gondoliers waiting on the dock with cigarettes cupped in their hands a murder had been committed and no one knew i took another breath then drew on the cigarette again steadying myself he was gone this is what it felt likenot remorse but a grim satisfaction and this tension in the stomach no going back a constant tremor on the surface of your skin alert because all that mattered now was not getting caught getting caught my stomach lurched again and i found my shoulders shaking my body heaving not bringing anything up just gasping for air he wasnt going to come late id choked the life out of him the last breath how could it not be in my face a red stain my shoulders moved again somebody would see id give everything away out of control adam whatever is the matter bertie said to my back are you all right i tossed the cigarette and gripped the window frame willing my shoulders to be still nothing escaped bertie i nodded keeping my back to him i just felt funny for a minute some air i drew some in making a point funny i looked down again at the men on the dock the rain had let up you could hear the music coming from the ballroom it might be hours before anyone asked for his boat one of the gondoliers passed a bottle something to hold off the damp no one knew i took another breath and forced my mouth into a smile so that it was in place when i turned too much wine probably taking out a handkerchief to wipe my forehead avoiding his eyes hm bertie said still staring you sure but when i nodded he let it go is that where youve been hiding at the bar no in plain sight i said then stopped disconcerted by his white shirtfront almost a duplicate of giannis i smiled again dancing by yourself no claudias here ah he said flatly i thought you werent coming and miss this ill have one of those he said glancing back at the room while i got out another cigarette no you wouldnt want to miss this mimis had her ball hasnt she i dont suppose people will talk about anything else for months extravagant my god even for mimi celia de betancourts here did you see she cant get over it and you know theres no one richer than a south american forty of them own everything or something theyre lining up at the trough i said gesturing to the food tables claudia seemed to have been swallowed up in a swarm of gowns an old man with medals on his chest an operetta figure was pointing to chafing dishes as a waiter filled his plate well the food bertie said i dont want to think where she got it all flown in someone said but it cant be legal not all this rosaries for days thats what it would cost me the church doesnt seem to mind i said pointing with my cigarette to a heavyset priest filling his plate ah luca he said well the church takes the world as it finds it ill say i said watching him spoon cream sauce over his plate then looked away still not sure of my stomach its only the next you know that concerns them poor luca its a weakness all that hunger maybe he should see real hunger the kind in this world adam if youre going to start im leaving here of all places you cant be serious in your nice formal clothes eating mimis caviar oh dear he said catching a glimpse of the priest wolfing down a bulging mouthful a comically greedy moment i made a sound trying to laugh who is he one of your monsignors no no just a father now a maglione before i turned a relative a cousin i think its impossible to keep track here they branch and branch just assume everyones family and youre safe why do you want to meet him no i was just curious a priest in the family ah of course and now yours i hadnt thought of that i knew wed get you a priest somehow well if he is a cousin lets ask gianni i shook my head hes not here what do you mean he said looking up sharply hes late dont be ridiculous its nearly midnight hes not late well he hasnt turned up we asked the police to checkyou know if any accidents had been reported we who grace i nodded she talked to cavallini hes here yes the wife bertie said an absentminded response dotting i s he seems to think gianni stopped off somewhere on the way got delayed somehow stopped off where to see somebody a lady friend an old venetian custom according to cavallini bertie stared at me are you out of your mind do you think gianni i dont know bertie but hes not here somethings wrong bertie said serious cavallini called the questura they checked the hospitals nothing and grace is putting a good face on it she doesnt want to ruin mimis party oh these ladies and hes probably lying in an alley somewhere bertie for gods sake sick of course it would never occur to you at my age its the first thing you think of happen any timejust walking down the street you feel a little queer and he gave a small shudder to finish the thought well youd better get your mother home she wont keep putting a good face on it but we dont know theres anything wrong i said hearing myself genuine of course theres something wrong he puffed on his cigarette thinking has there been any trouble between them between who gianni and your mother he said stressing each word dont be dense i dont think so i said thrown by this an unexpected idea well it has happened before you know cold feet at the altar still not at the biggest party of the year he simply wouldnt ah luca the heavy priest had lumbered over there were introductions the maglione connection established but i scarcely paid attention jittery again wondering if bertie would notice then two more minutes of aimless chatter but where is gianni father luca said finally out of conversation ive been looking for him he was called to the hospital bertie said quickly a shame really to miss a party like this yes very splendid such food not since the war just the thought of it seemed to send him back to the table youll excuse me i think a little coffee before i go why did you say that i said to bertie what do you want people to say if they start wondering they wont talk about anything else and mimill never forgive her have some sense even so you ought to take her home you act as if its some kind of scandal not yet anyway i cant ive got to get claudia home he had another puff brooding lovely for her at least what do you mean that hes gone missing not exactly her favorite was he he studied me you werent best fond either missing you talk about him as if he were dead i said evenly hes not dead my voice steady not a waver all right all right never mind here she comes he nodded toward claudia carrying a plate looking pretty i must say he peered at me over the tops of his glasses calmer i hope thats all over really he said neutral and with everyone waiting for a rematch he was already reaching out for her free hand claudia so pretty signor howard she said tentative not trusting the smile youve just come late yes i know mimis already scolded me but im not the only one i gather no claudia said looking directly at him how is it at the accademia bertie ignored this staring frankly at the necklace not even pretending to hide his curiosity its wonderful wherever did you get that he said claudia touched it adams mother gave it to me she caught his raised eyebrow for the evening and rubies no less you can always tell yes its beautiful it was so kind well its all in the family isnt it bertie said putting out his cigarette in an ashtray he looked at me im glad to see everyones getting along so well id better see what i can do about grace you two enjoy yourselves ill get her home he lifted his hand in a little wave as he left he thinks somethings wrong i said claudia looked up from her plate heaped with food what did he say nothing dont worry he doesnt know anything just that somethings wrong oh she said putting the plate on the table not hungry she shook her head eat something you cant put down a full plate people will notice she shook her head again and i picked up the plate and forked some veal why would he think that why not something is wrong he just doesnt know what i was eating quickly now almost gulping the food down no longer nauseated surprised to find that i was hungry did you see the way he looked at me someone from the back rooms not someone who wears necklaces hes just jealous how can you laugh i dont know i put the plate down i dont know how im doing any of it but suddenly it was easier i felt another surge warm and full of food a primitive wellbeing filling up with life again after hours of empty dread all right one more dance to show you off then well go yes she said eagerly if hes not here by now whatever happened must have already happened while we were here she looked at me unsure but followed me back to the ballroom bertie near the door with my mother was leaning over to talk quietly presumably arranging to go the floor had thinned out but was still lively you know what he was thinking claudia said looking at bertie what is she doing here that type ha looking for a rich american and you found one i said smiling that was safe now too something i hadnt thought about before my mother protected i glanced toward the door she and bertie were talking to mimi heading for the stairs thats better i said you want them to see you smile she looked away then danced closer putting her head next to mine trembling again what kind of people are we to smile now dont now ive done everything i thought before it was everything but now theres this too i pulled back to face her think what he was i said she didnt say anything i had said one dance but then it became two another my mother had disappeared and with her any talk about gianni we drifted with the music i could feel the heat of her through her dress maybe this is what happens after i thought every sense stronger than before as if wed taken some extra portion from the dead food touch just being alive in germany after combat the troops were ravenous rapes happened then relieved not to be dead proving something around us the beautiful room spun by in slow circles claudia had put a hand behind my neck pulling us close so that everything smelled of her we were no longer pretending with one eye to the others when we left the crush for coats and umbrellas had begun so that we were lost again in the crowd no one noticed us leave no one looked at the time we avoided the boats and walked back through san ivo the way gianni would have come earlier the calles were nearly empty just the occasional umbrella bumping into ours in the narrow passages claudia was quiet leaning against me when we reached san polo she stopped under an arch near the hotel here she said reaching behind and unclasping the necklace take it you dont no its hers what if something happens if i lose it if you lose it i said dubiously she held it in her hand looking down at it so no more cinderella theres no rush she pushed the necklace into my hand listen to me we cant do this i knew when he looked at me signor howard tomorrow everybody asks questions the ball thats finished now and who do they question how do i explain all those things that night everybody saw me with him my job all those things where is he and whos the one to suspect me the easy one who else even if they dont find him without a body they cant whats the difference its still me and then you stop it i said grabbing her dont talk like that no one is going to suspect anything her eyes were darting i put my hand to the side of her face as if i could stop her thoughts by touching it theyll come for me theyre not going to come for you yes they will theyll come her eyes were wide staring at me no they cant they can never get you yes i put a finger to her lips never dont you see you were with me i moved the finger slowly along her lip then rested it on her cheek ill be your alibi she started to shake her head turning it into my hand but i held my finger there so that her eyes couldnt move away and youll be mine i said well be safe she stared at me for a minute more then lowered her head theyll come she said barely audible i brushed my hand down her cheek no i said as quiet as she had been no i said again a murmur then suddenly a door slammed someone leaving the hotel and she jumped startled and reached for me oh a muffled sound no louder than the water dripping in the passage she pulled me close to her turning her face away from the light holding on to my coat until we heard the footsteps grow fainter in the campo heading off toward the rialto its no one i said my mouth close to her ear but she was holding me even tighter her arms around me then one hand behind my neck bending me toward her kissing my face in a kind of rush tasting it oh i dont care she said still kissing me as if the slam of the door had been a shot and she were running away from the evening from whatever was going to happen i dont care clutching me to her i felt her breath and then my mouth was open too moving down to her neck excited both of us panting the promise at the end of the evening everything finally letting go feeling the flush in my face again we cant i said my face in her hair stay with me she said moving her neck so i could kiss it again i have to know whats going on there tonight no stay she said kissing me what we would do thats what you said she pulled me closer until i knew she could feel me against her already hard a party and then you didnt come up moving now pressing into me is that what we would do i said kissing her again yes she said her hands on me holding me dont you want to all evening every sense working up to it spurting blood the bundled tarp splashing into the dark water my mothers dressing room warm with powder the white skin at the back of her neck the hotel clerk will say we were together she said claudia i know i know how can we do this after and i still want to i want to she said her breath on my face again i cant stay all night i said my voice sliding away skidding i have to get back we have to be careful yes careful a little while then she pressed her face against my coat before they come nobodys going to come my mother was still up when i got back coiled in a chair near the space heater a full ashtray on her lap youre a sight she said raising her eyebrows as if she could see through the rumpled jacket the loose collar to the rest of me still sticky i stood in the doorway to the sitting room surprised to see inspector cavallini on the couch at this hour his presence was beyond the call of any duty was he waiting for me the body already found questions raised i thought someone should be here he said answering whatever he saw in my face so signora miller would not be alone courtly to women a man who visited maestre a brandy snifter was on the table near the couch im sorry im late i said any news nothing my mother said something terribles happened signora we dont know that he said gently of course it has what else could it be whats awful is not to know cavallini looked at me with an open palm of resignation ive sent a man to dr magliones house he will call if he comes home he wont somethings happened my mother said no word at the hospitals anywhere no so a great mystery but let us hope with a simple explanation the best thing now would be to sleep he said turning to my mother sleep she said her face was pale but not splotched with tears just in retreat her eyes distant the way they had been after my father died days of it not crying away by herself i dont see what were waiting for why cant you trace his movements he left the house we know that for mimis unless he forgot and came here no i was here until we went to mimis but darling i called there was no one here inspector cavallini looked up from his brandy oh that was you i said quickly somebody called but i didnt answer darling you might have picked up it rang and rang i mean even in the shower i was busy i said my voice a little clipped nervous but inspector cavallini took it for embarrassment his eyes amused over the glass busy my mother said signorina grassini was here as well perhaps cavallini said yes well i still dontoh darling she stopped flustered really getting ready for the ball cavallini said having fun with it yes anyway he didnt come here well he must have gone somewhere my mother said somebody must have seen him you have to ask signora at three in the morning who should i ask cavallini said you understand my hands are tied in this what is there to investigate we tell everyone to listen for the accidents a sickness but thats all we can do it is not a crime to miss a party even such a party what do i do my mother said officially do i fill out a form not tonight cavallini said putting his empty brandy glass on the table tomorrow i will make more inquiries so we see and you signora please some rest if i need you to help me help how you are his fiancee yes so who knows him better yes my mother said vaguely till tomorrow then he said taking my mothers hand make yourself easy thank you ive kept you so late he made a small its nothing gesture ill see you out i said leading him to the stairs you have some pills for her to sleep tomorrow will not be pleasant what do you mean i said we were walking down the stairs then through the hallway where gianni and i had fought without thinking i glanced up at one of the sconces as if it might be dripping blood but everything was in shadow kept dim by nightlights shes right a man like thatwhy would he run away he wouldnt so why is he missing he left it open a question that answered itself lets hope not i said opening the door for him reaching up to the old handle then quickly dropping my hand moving the raw knuckles behind me yes we can hope meanwhile some sleep i think you too he turned in the doorway the maid she doesnt answer the phone my hand went farther back as if it were moving on its own yes oh you mean tonight they all went to mimis to help so you were alone in the house well not alone i meant you and signorina grassini yes why im sorry to ask before in front of your mother i know how it is an opportunity yes how do you say the mice play when the cats away yes he shook his head amused then patted my arm to be such an age i leaned against the door after id locked it looking down the hall my forehead sweaty one slip was all it took i needed to go through everything tomorrow with claudia exact times when she had left her hotel how long it had taken to get here the rest was safe playing while the cat was away you dont have to wait up my mother said hes right you know theres nothing we can do tonight you should get some sleep i know i just want to sit for a bit she was picking at her gown the black velvet skirt now flecked with ash im frightened i know he could be hurt dead yes she looked up well thats a change anyway cavallinithe mans impossible every time i say something he just tuttuts and pours another brandy i said could be and now im supposed to help how i dont know where gianni goes what he does its funny isnt it you know somebody and then something like this happens and you dont i mean i know him who he is but the details her voice trailed off i reached into my pocket pulling out the necklace and handed it to her here before it gets lost yes she said looking at it you know i never thought what a night for a robbery everyone at mimis no one home perfect wouldnt it be she paused her eyes still on the necklace youre serious about this girl yes she sighed not the best time to talk is it i cant think about anything i know of course it doesnt matter what i say really she reached out her hand to cover mine you know that im always i leaned over and kissed her forehead it can wait get some sleep huh but adam if itsi dont know what ill do youll be fine youre always fine im not always fine you know she said looking down at her lap not always i stood there for a minute uneasy not knowing what to say then she patted my hand well look at the time off to bed do you want a pill no i dont want to miss anything she said without irony all right i said flustered im going to have a bath darling youll wake the maids a short bath i leaned over to kiss her forehead again dont sit up too long as i left i lifted my head toward her thats some dress a faint smile acknowledging the gesture it was all right in the end wasnt it mimi couldnt take her eyes off it she nodded a wry grimace hm but i didnt wear it for her no i said meaning i know im sorry whatever she wanted it to mean more an embrace than a word there was enough hot water for a soak and everything that had happened began to drain away as my head grew logy with steam every part of me ached with a different exhaustionmy shoulders from rowing and lugging the tarp my legs from the party my back just from being on edge but it was going to be all right my mother would be all right too though she couldnt know that now i washed away sweat whatever else my skin had picked up clean while the cat was away who was to say otherwise i looked at my hands again no rust but i grabbed the brush anyway and ran it over my nails pulling the skin back to get the bristles in under the rims back and forth scouring until they were pale i sank against the tub relieved it was gone id caught it in time what else i closed my eyes for a second back in the dim light of the downstairs hall seeing everything again the brocade chair id used to pull myself up the sconce where hed hit his head the smug face over the white shirtfront i sat up eyes wide open the smallest thing could give you away i got out of the tub quickly and toweled off and grabbed a robe no time to dress the maids would be asleep anyway i went down and crossed through the piano nobile no light was coming from the sitting roommy mother must have finally gone up down the main stairs grateful for the carpeting steps that didnt creak the marble in the hall was cold on my bare feet i walked over to the door of the room where id waited reconstructing hed had his cigarette here but id already cleaned the ashtray id backed him into the wall thereexactly which sconce i took a handkerchief and wiped both looking for any smears flakes of blood what if one of the maids came then hed pushed me here i walked slowly trying to move with the fight in my head to the spot where hed lost it where the shirt stud had popped out a tiny thing not even thought of until the bath but lying here somewhere waiting to give us away i got down on my hands and knees and felt along the dark floor under one of the side tables it might have rolled might be anywhere every inch if i had to theyd know it was his i patted the floor in front of me if i turned on the lights someone would get up come down to investigate and then id make up something else and someone would ask about that andan endless spiral of detail easy to slip up i moved my hand in front of me barely touching the marble hovering over it like a mine sweeper the stud must have rolled until it hit the wall i ran my hand along the edge of the room then stopped thinking id heard a sound upstairs i held my breath for a minute listening but there was only the water lapping outside the faint creaking of the boat pulling against its rope yes wed been near this end the stud popping out of the shirt maybe with blood on iteven more damaging i kept feeling my way along the floor carefully sweeping around the table legs the crevices where it might hide forever until they found it and then there it was round smooth metal the gold warm even in the dim light i snatched it and looked at it the smallest thing i went to put it in my pocket then decided to keep it in my hand to feel it until i could get rid of it in the deep water off the zattere then everything would be all right again i put my left hand up to my forehead surprised to find that i was sweating again even with my feet cold on the floor but my whole body was awake and i knew then what it was going to be like even when it was all right a wariness that took over your life what happened to animals who either killed or became prey chapter nine il gazzettino had two full pages on mimis ball mostly pictures of women in gowns and couples standing together but nothing about gianni cavallini however had started his investigation already up while the rest of venice slept in gray and hung over from the night before his men badgered giannis household staff questioning them over and over to hear what theyd already heard dr maglione had left before eight dressed for the party he went in the direction of santo stefano presumably headed for the accademia bridge he had been in good spirits policemen made some random checks of the canals along the route but no body had been spotted no suspicious object had bobbed to the surface giannis daughter had been called in bologna and bewildered asked if she should come right away and was told to wait until they had more information his assistant at the hospital was asked to go through his patient list to see if there was anyone he might have stopped to visit in a small city like venice only a few calls from the questura were necessary by midmorning everyone knew gianni was missing the police had now begun questioning the hotels the hotels my mother said why on earth would he go to a hotel she was back in the chair beside the ashtray looking haggard under her fresh morning makeup its a procedure signora cavallini said we always ask the hotels for everything that happens in venice he stopped putting down his coffee its not for him you see but you must prepare yourself for thisif there has been a crime there are two people to look for not just the victim there is the other so anything suspicious crime my mother said whose imagination up till now had ended with a heart attack cavallini spread his hands we dont know signora perhaps he saw a crime a burglary and then someone had to but were there any burglaries i mean surely that would have been reported not as yet cavallini said he looked at her his voice soothing we dont know i sipped my coffee trying not to show any expression hotels burglaries no suspicion at all the desk clerk would confirm what claudia said the time she left the time she came back with me who later was seen by cavallini himselfa perfect circle i had expected to spend the day in a void dreading any knock on the door but now i saw that cavallinis personal interest gave us a peephole at the questurawhat they were doing what they were saying looking everywhere but here when he left promising to report later i took a few minutes to look over the water entrance maybe a film of blood had stuck to the canal steps like a bathtub ring maybe some stains had soaked into the marble but everything was clean even tidy the paving stones piled neatly under the tarp no smears on the damp floor nothing on the boat outside washed by rain one of the cleaning women would do the entrance hall today swabbing down the marble floor wiping away every mark every trace i went back upstairs you dont have to stay my mother said feet up under an afghan now that cavallini was gone of course ill stay no dont i know you youll moon around and treat me like bone china and im not you know i wont break somebody has to answer the phone oh god its going to start isnt it all the friendly little calls and we cant not answer she said shooting me a glance what if its the police so i spent the rest of the day at home making cups of tea while my mother retreated into herself she made no pretense of passing the time by reading playing cards she was waiting she would walk over to the window then back absorbed in a world of her own not even hearing the phone she smoked and drank tea thanking me in a voice so abstracted it was almost a monotone like that of someone whod taken painkillers and become vague i fielded mimi and bertie and everyone else who called an afternoon of them all eager for news sniffing drama she thinks hes left me my mother said when celia called walked out on me so far from what celia or anyone was thinking that for a second i wondered if she had in fact taken pills i looked at il gazzettino again mimi with stars in her hair the man she called ernesto evidently someone important not the picture of us with the police but cavallini would remember it which was all that mattered when exactly had my mother called while we played and someone else rowed out to the lagoon inspector cavallini stopped in at the end of the day in time for drinks but had nothing new none of giannis patients had heard from him no accidents had been reported imagine my mother said her voice flat you can just disappear i didnt know it could be so easy im sorry i must ask do you have any thoughts yourself signora something he might have said to you my mother was shaking her head anyone who might have wished him some harm i glanced up but his eyes were on my mother not even taking me in of course not why would anyone in this life every man has his enemies why do you think its someonewhy not a stroke because we would have found him by now a man falls in the street he would be seen so of course the possibility is that someone put him somewhere where cavallini shrugged the usual place in venice is the sea i went over to the drinks table an excuse not to look at him i heard the tarp splash in the sea but then yes its difficult we cannot dredge the lagoon a canal yes but not the lagoon its too big we have to wait for the sea to give him up give him up my mother said quietly you mean his body cavallini said nothing after he left i made two drinks but my mother waved hers away angelina had lighted a fire and my mother sat next to it staring listening to the sound of the burning wood the phone had stopped the servants sensing a kind of illness had gone silent in the other rooms i sat pinned to my chair unable to break the quiet feeling it like a weight around me pressing my mother kept staring at the fire her eyes dull i knew it wouldnt always be like this that it would pass but while it was here the terrible quietness between us i felt it squeezing worse than giannis hand on my throat at dinner we sat at the same end of the long table the cook had made a risotto dotted with shellfish but my mother only picked at it barely sipping her wine still talking to herself somewhere else finally she put down the fork and lit a cigarette instead adam she said that business at the party i looked up you know when claudia she stopped waiting to see if i was following i nodded its because she thought gianni had worked for the germans you said i nodded again waiting thats what you did in the army investigate people like that yes and you thought so too because she said no because he did all claudia knew is that he reported her father she took this in without moving wanting to see it through so if its true she hesitated there would be this hate she didnt hate him enough to my mother looked at me puzzled then waved this away darling not her the others inspector cavallini said who wished him harm and i thought well if its true there might be peopletheyd wish him harm but that was the war i thought all that was over i mean who goes around now she paused taking another sip of her wine hes the last you know his brother was killed in an accident no he was killed by partisans for collaborating with the germans she flinched what a lot you know i had his file pulled you investigated his brother and gianni i thought we should know she looked down flustered busying herself putting out the cigarette you had no right to do that adam no right mother she raised her hand to her forehead i know i know but the point darling she said taking a breath controlling herself is that if he did those things or people thought he did by mistake or something then they might have a reason she drifted off letting me finish yes if they thought he did i said making it easier it just doesnt seem possible somehow that he would you know ive known him my god all my life almost all my life people change yes but they dont really she looked down at her glass he was in love with me you know even then and you i said staring across me oh no i was in love with your father i was you know and then i came herei dont know why really i wasnt looking for himand there he is and hes still in love with me all those years its funny the curves life throws at you she raised her head did he really do that work with them yes i think so maybe he had to they forced people didnt they i said nothing but that would be a reason for somebody to its possible she thought about this for a minute then started brushing the tablecloth a nervous movement oh whats wrong with me here we are burying him and we dont know anything he could be in a hospital somewhere anything yes i said squeezed again almost out of breath its just if hes not she stopped her hand looking at the table i dont know what im going to do she went to bed early or at least went to her room i saw the sliver of light under the door heard the creak of the floorboards until finally it was quiet there too and i imagined her still dressed lying exhausted on the bed the fire in the sitting room had died down and i sat in the cold wanting to go out but feeling i couldnt leave how long would it take to get through this being with her lying to her was worse somehow than what had happenedthere was no end to it and no going back i thought of her after my father died holding herself together for me youll feel better soon he wouldnt want you to be sad youll have to take care of me now all the lies for my own good when i woke i was hunched in the chair cramped and the light had begun to come in the electric bars of the space heater glowing orange had been going all night an extravagance but the room was still cold the damp seeping in i switched off the heater and went to the window to see the sun come up behind the redentore my old earlymorning view it was going to be a nice day shiny after the rain a walk nobody would miss me if i went out now id be back in time for the morning vigil but at least with some air in my lungs i crossed over to the san marco side away from the house and mimis and the last two days the sun was already filling the great piazza i went behind the basilica taking the route to santa maria in formosa not going anywhere in particular just going through the campo then stopping in the streetif i kept going this way id reach the questura where cavallinis clerks might still be looking through the patient lists i turned left instead through the narrow calle and over the bridge to zanipolo past the equestrian statue of colleoni where claudia had stared at gianni a few people were going into the hospitalnurses maintenance men none of them looking at the rows of arches along the facade the mosaic gianni had pointed out charming a visitor along the fondamenta an ambulance boat was delivering a patient to the side door just as one had when wed walked here gianni explaining why hed had tolying and then i was at the end nothing but the open lagoon and the chimneys of murano in america you could walk and never stop never run out of land but here you met yourself within minutesa bridge a canal then abruptly an end water or a blind alley i looked at the ambulances moored on the quay what kind of doctor had he been there must have been a time cramming for exams when it had been about saving people being on the side of the angels do no harm and a few years later he could condemn someone with a nod what had happened in between but doctors in germany had taken the same oath and then nodded and nodded killing everybody maybe nothing had happened just opportunity a matter of degree think of him young on the lido betraying my father or saying he did i stared at the water he was off there somewhere to the right and here at the hospital everywhere i looked you could walk all day and never put him behind you cavallini was waiting on a chair in the downstairs hall when i got back signor miller youre out so early i stopped hesitating how long would every question sound like an accusation i couldnt sleep yes its understandable he said getting up your mother shes very tired i think raising his eyes toward the stairs indicating that theyd already spoken theres news i thought i would come myself a courtesy the telephone its whats happened a body has been found what how the rope slipping out of its knots rocked by the tide what if the tarp were still there a match for the one in the water entrance why hadnt i got rid of it but then someone would have noticed youre surprised a body you mean hes dead yes he raised his eyes again ive told your mother so at least now she knows id better go up no shes resting the girlangelina is with her maybe now she can sleep i was waiting for you waiting for me i said feeling a tingling along my skin yes i thoughti dont like to ask your mother but its a formality we cant reach the daughter you see another early bird perhaps theres no question i thinkthe same description in evening clothesbut its necessary for the formality what is to identify the body it should be family but you are almost a son and its not good to wait the condition of the bodyhe has been in the water you dont mind all right i said not knowing how to refuse you know him couldnt you just no no i am police it must be someone else you understand for the formalities and now the crime report crime report yes he was killed how do you mean i said maneuvering through this someone who didnt know inspector cavallini made a smashing gesture with his hand a blow to the head so they tell me i havent seen the body yet well go together to san michele ill call the questura for a boat would you open the canal gate the canal gate i repeated vaguely looking toward the damp room the steps where id dragged him yes i said catching myself all right just let me run upstairs for a second see if shes all right to get away even for a minute you can phone in there i pointed to the room where id waited the other night thank you and for this help im sorry to ask you he was killed i said again because i should be dumbfounded yes you mean not by accident no by murder i stared at him no longer acting the word itself like a jolt what it had really been youre sure it couldnt be a fall no not according to san michele of course i will look myself but whoi mean where inspector cavallini shrugged we only know where he was found in the water you said yes the lagoon a fisherman only this morning the body was caught on a channel marker otherwise he opened his hands so he could have been put in anywhere far from here not anywhere you know there are channels in the lagoon like rivers the tides follow a path you can see on the charts this was the major channel from san marco behind san giorgio out to the lido usually that would mean this side of venice but its more likely that a boat took him so the murder itself could have been anywhere a boat i said my head spinning with charts and currentsthis much already known before the body had even been identified and then theyd find out the rest yes because of the distance from san marco its unlikely it would float that far in a day well but this is all early a speculation first we must see the body to make sure my mother was sleeping angelica indicated with a finger to her lips worn out by the waiting and now able to go into full retreat i washed my face and held on to the sides of the basin until my hands were still looking in the mirror to see what cavallini would see maybe thats what he wantedto watch my expression when i saw the corpse some sly police trick the smallest thing could give you away but this was being jumpy why should he suspect anything wed been photographed together when i got back downstairs he was already at the canal entrance walking by the tarp looking up at the gondola i felt a small tremor in my hands again then steadied myself you dont use the gondola he said no i opened the gate my back to him on the canal the rowboat was bobbing idly at its mooring post ah youre an oarsman he said spotting it well not in this weather i said quickly i havent been out yet maybe in the spring why say that what if somebody had seen any contradiction would be suspicious two things to explain its very fine this one cavallini said pointing to the gondola old i looked down at his foot almost touching the tarp it came with the house i said of course the lucky thing about venice is that you dont really need a boat you can walk anywhere he nodded distracted lifting up the edge of the tarp used to looking over a room yes so many boats at ca maglione and yet he chooses to walk maybe they were put up for the winter too i said raising my eyes to the gondola no no all in use so hed already checked many boats he said taking pride in it a tour guide praising a landmark ive seen them my wife you see was a cousin of his wife oh i said not knowing what to say what connection he felt this gave him the endless genealogy of venice he was running his hand over the paving stones yes a very old family everyone in venice seems to come from an old family i said still looking at the stones where was the police boat well not all my family you know were simple people still venetians educated but not magliones and then he had been counting the boats in giannis garage an inlaw invited for tea i saw him for a second as he must have beenyoung the curious eyes over the mustache smiling at the longfaced girl moving up youre making some repairs he said letting the tarp fall back the owner we lease the house you see those stairs he pointed to the waters edge i turned my head slowly almost expecting to see a streak of blood how the sides are weak you should make the repairs soon in venice ill tell the owner yes of course the owner he said suddenly embarrassed excuse me i forgot you would be leaving i looked at him blankly after the wedding the police launch had a motor so loud that we would have had to shout over it so we made the trip without talking backtracking up the rio dei greci to the questura then out past santa giustina to the open lagoon san michele the cemetery island was the first thing you could see from this side just across the water from the hospitalhadnt gianni joked about that the low brick mausoleums lined with dark cypresses we were met at the dock by some of cavallinis men who steered us away from the graveyard paths to the morgue i pushed my feet one after the other as if we were wading there seemed to be no sounds not even birds a funeral quiet inside it could have been any hospital building white plaster and tile except for the smell so heavy and cloying that not even disinfectant took it away we were led down a corridor by a man in a white coat with a clipboard he stopped at a heavy double door and said something in italian to cavallini he wants to know if youve seen a dead body before yes how many now stacked in piles left in fields by the side of the road just left waiting for someone to cart them away mouths open limbs missing at first you stared shocked and then you stopped looking five years ago it had been possible never to have seen the deada grandfather maybe lying on a bier now you couldnt count how many you know for some its difficult we paused just inside the door stopped by the cold the body was on a gurney covered with a sheet his feet were sticking out not tagged as they were in the movies just naked and exposed what would he look like after a day in the water eyes still open staring at me but it was cavallinis eyes that would be open watching every move just walk over to the table now an attendant pulled back the sheet drawing it down and for a terrible second i thought he would keep going until we saw all of him his genitals like an unwelcome glimpse in the shower without a towel they had removed his clothes so there was only skin pasty and bloated from the water the hair on his chest matted like bits of seaweed someone had closed his eyes or maybe it was part of the general swelling the puffy blur of a face not peaceful just inert pale lips that gray that only the dead have not even a color a warning not to touch i took a shallow breath trying to ignore the chemical smell in the room gray awful skin pouching at the sides you can identify him cavallini said i nodded you must say for the record this is giancarlo maglione yes and you must sign a statement but for a second i couldnt move i stared at the body not gianni anymore just a body utterly still separate now something left behind like molted skin we always forget what it means becoming nothing how long had it taken a minute two water displacing air and now irretrievable how did the workers here stand it day after day seeing the gray bodies the terrible reminders all that we left the frightened egyptians thought wed come back for our bodies if we kept them ready with pots of barley and hunting scenes painted on walls signor miller cavallini said touching my elbow but we never come back this was all there was gray skin and fluids to drain id taken the rest and then gone to a party but hadnt he done the same how many times except he never had to see them afterward signor the doctor said yes i said raising my head its gianni you would sign over here he was leading me away signaling to the attendant to cover giannis face we went over to a desk where he handed me a clipboard and a pen a long form as elaborate and unwieldy as lira notes now what i said to cavallini as i signed now they make the autopsy for the cause of death i thought he was hit on the head another formality in the case of a crime to be precise you know it wasnt this he said tapping the back of his head the doctor says drowning but now he has to say officially drowning why would he say that the water in the lungs if he had already been dead you mean someone put him into the lagoon alive i said appalled forgetting the bubbles now imagining him struggling in the tarp fighting his way out they may have thought he was already dead you know basta he hit his palm with his fist a hard smack then in the lagoon but it was the water that killed him of course to the law it will make no difference are you all right maybe a little air i said outside warmer than in the morgue i lit a cigarette im sorry im not usually squeamish its different when its somebody you know yes its not pleasant for you i know still a great service to me anybody could have yes but since its you now there can be no question about an investigation i looked at him trying to make this out no question of an accident he said taking out a cigarette of his own but it wasnt you said no you saw the skull in the back not a fall but how much better for everyone if it had been so maybe a temptation to whom he shrugged poor venice the war finally its over and they start coming back the visitors not soldiersyour mother her friends its good for venice you look at the buildings and wewell maybe we look at you a little but no one comes if theyre afraid if there is crime a murder not in venice but now look who identifies the bodyone of the visitors who sees its not an accident so i have my investigation i drew on my cigarette my stomach sliding again but surely you would have yes but now i can be certain something that involves the international community the questura will want to act to solve it men whatever i need and we will solve it i hope so cavallini reached over reassuring and patted my arm well find him dont worry i nodded feeling the weight of his hand i know its a loss for you but youll help me me you knew his character with a maglione sometimes its easier for foreigners than for our venetian families but i hardly knew him i mean your wife must have no a blood tie only not a friendship but you your mother he let it drift waiting for me to pick it up well yes i said well do anything we can of course i paused do you have any idea who he withdrew his hand shaking his head no its early for that first we get the facts from in there he jerked his head toward the morgue then we look at the life who profits you think its someone who knew him why not a robbery he smiled a hit on the head grab the wallet push him in the canal but he still had the wallet also his watch what thief leaves a watch no some other reason so who profits you see how lucky i am to have you me in a murder you look at everyone him him what motive who profits but with you its the opposite no profit a great loss after the wedding perhaps i would have had to suspect you too but now you are the only man in venice i cant suspect a trap another step through the looking glass why not i said quietly why not who throws away a fortune he would have been your father yes i said waiting my voice neutral your father cavallini repeated one of the richest men in all of italy i looked at him then caught myself and turned to the water before he could see my face chapter ten giannis funeral service was held at the salute so close to mimis that it seemed a grimmer version of the ball with the same crowding at the landing stage people being helped up the broad steps all in black this time with hats and veils the waiting gondolas stretched up the grand canal as in a canaletto filling up the canvas all of mimis guests and more enough for a state occasion when the funeral boats arrived a cortege of bobbing hearses people lingered on the church steps to stare at the coffin draped with flowers we had become part of a news story a violent death an old family the foreigners who drank at harrys across the campo people watched from windows claudia hadnt wanted to go i cant you go ill stay here she said gesturing at the rumpled bed we were always together now a kind of hiding making love in her room wanting each other even more because no one else was part of the secret a new intimacy sometimes we went out for walks and talked about it the only ones who knew but mostly we stayed in sex another way of talking something else we could say only to each other when she held me afterward her fingers would move over my shoulder making sure i was still there and i would put my arm around her as if i were folding her up in a cape making the world go away both of us safe no we want them to see us how can i sit there what will people think that youre part of the family cavallini already thinks it he thinks were giannis family almost anyway ha he asked if his wife could call on my mother like something out of yes she said impatiently very venetian the old manners and you trust that youre going for her sake hell expect it hed notice if you didnt my god his family am i going crazy i put my hands on her shoulders just this then well go away leave venice she reached up grabbing my arm you think they know something i shook my head no nothing then why because were the only ones who can give us away nowif we slip say something so the sooner we leave she looked at me silent for a minute yes the only ones she said finally then she turned away out of my hands but first this am i supposed to cry too just as long as cavallini sees you with the family but in fact there was some question about where to seat us the ushers led my mother to the front the widows pew and then stopped short placing us a few rows behind on the right my mother dryeyed behind her veil seemed not to notice still enveloped in that eerie calm that had settled in after cavallinis first visit but someone must have told the ushers decided on the protocol it occurred to me then that i had no idea who had arranged the funeral taken care of all the details that only seem to happen by themselves a full mass at the salute a gondola banked in flowers a reception at the ca maglione all organized down to where to seat the almostwidow i looked at the front pew just behind cavallini and his wife sat next to the priest from the ball presumably a row of relatives but in the front itself there was only an old woman leaning on a girl who must be the daughter finally arrived from bologna or had she been here for days ignoring us going about her fathers business i noticed then that the church was divided the faces i recognized from berties on our side venetians on the other my mother separated from the family by an aisle i stretched my neck trying to see the daughters face but she was looking straight ahead to the high altar where the priest had appeared with upraised hands we stood and the backs of the relatives now hid her from every angle music echoed through the vault under the dome as the pallbearers brought the casket forward when we were sitting again i felt claudia rigid against me staring at the coffin i put my hand over hers and looked past the altar hoping to draw her attention away to the left was the sacristy with the titian ceilings but they were lost in the space distant and dim while the coffin sat right in front of us inescapable down in the first row the daughter had bowed her head the service took hours i had never attended a mass in venicefor me the churches were poorly lit galleriesand the spectacle of it took me by surprise busy altar boys in white surplices latin chants and candlelight hundreds of people answering in unisonthe whole vast church seemed to be in movement except the women on either side of me claudia still rigid my mother simply quiet looking vaguely at nothing in particular at one point cavallini turned his head slowly as if he were counting the house caught my eye and nodded but otherwise we were left to ourselves nobody stared more interested now in the theater of public grief the eulogy in italian was long enough to cover giannis entire life a choir sang people streamed down the aisle for communion who were they all patients neighbors there seemed beyond the formalities to be a genuine sadness in the room or at least a somber reserve what had he been to them a friend or just someone with a doge in the family respected out of long habit or maybe a dinner companion at villa raspelli drinking the last of the good soave dont forget what he was i looked down toward the daughter did she know a law student after all not a child but maybe he was still papa affectionate at home people saw what they were supposed to see cavallini thought gianni was rich what any poor cousin would think having even less but the daughters grief was real enough her shoulders were moving now shaking with discreet sobs the only person in the great church actually crying the old womanan aunt the nanny put an arm around her i looked away outside there was confusion people loitered on the steps waiting for a cue were we supposed to follow out to san michele i remembered my fathers funeral the long line of black cars lights kept on heading slowly toward long island here they would be gondolas another ordinary ritual made fantastical by water or was the burial private by invitation everyone looked at the daughter climbing now into a gondola away from the boat with the casket thin her face still indistinct behind a veil but perfectly erect a girl from a good convent school her gondola headed up the canal toward ca maglione cavallini came up to us and took my mothers hand in a silent condolence then nodded to claudia standing at her sideexactly what id wanted him to see is there a burial i asked looking toward the hearse gondola yes but not here the country house theyll take him there and then tomorrow the family he let the rest explain itself today its for venice the country house yes on the brenta its very well known for the giorgiones oh i said surprised he never mentioned it yes he did darling my mother said her voice flat you just didnt listen she had turned to cavallini thank you so much youve been kind again about what they were not you know evidence and of course giulia agreed after you asked no no she agreed she has them for you he looked at me photographs of sentimental value for your mother not evidence but something hed looked over going through giannis things already on the case grace a gloved hand appeared out of nowhere along with celia de betancourts eager voice how awful for you she nodded toward the logjam of boats at the bottom of the stairs youre not going back to the house she said somehow making it ordinary a dusty ranch not a palazzo on the grand canal yes his daughters there you dont mind if i take a rain check do you all this she waved her hand to the church behind us i feel done in she paused catching up his daughter youve made up theres nothing to make up shes been at school thats not what bertie says he says she i looked up curious but my mother was patting her hand stopping her celia i cant not today she looked down not today oh sugar celia said distressed this mouth i dont mean anything by it you know i wouldnt i know my mother said patting her hand again not for the world youre old friends cavallini said a polite intervention since the bronze age celia said herself again glancing at him she hugged my mother dont mind me i just get funny in church everybody being so good you know signora miller cavallini said hes waving to you its your boat yes thank you so you took down the gondola cavallini said to me no its hired the marchesa doesnt want us to use hers just the other boat maybe i said when the weathers better making a point of it consistent but cavallini seemed not to have heard busy now with celia may i offer you a ride somewhere he said courtly making celia smile god would you just across im going to swim to harrys if i dont get a drink soon a long morning he said his voice pleasant but his eyes just for a second flecked with disapproval i looked around for his wife but she seemed to have gone ahead on her own leaving cavallini to the foreigners you permit he said taking celias elbow suggestive but i saw that the point for him was the flirtation itself nothing more a game to distract there hadnt been a girl in maestre either and hed already gone through giannis papers what did she mean about giulia i said to my mother nothing just some idea of berties about the engagement you mean she didnt approve i didnt say that she just didnt come to the party a cardinal sin in berties book of course you can imagine but didnt she darling ask her gianni never said so you were the one he was worried about she stopped on the stairs lifting her veil and staring for a minute across the water you know children never like things to change but they do we joined the flotilla of boats heading up the canal to giannis house claudia fidgeting beside me restive wanting it to be over the sun had come out the early venetian spring that had eluded mimi making the buildings shine scrubbed fresh by the rain at ca maglione footmen lifted us onto a floating dock between striped mooring poles like mimis ball again without the umbrellas a long staircase lined with candelabra led up to the piano nobile the usual venetian layout the ballroom was not as pretty as mimis but just as large done in red damask and heavy gilt chairs like a version of la fenice everything gleamed spotless how large a staff did it take to keep it going i thought you said he had no money claudia whispered to me looking around i didnt say broke but in fact the room made me uneasy it was not what id expected no frayed upholstery no chipped pieces nothing needed repair the war might never have happened a long table had been set out with plates of biscotti coffee cups and thin glasses for vin santospare but appropriate a reception not a party people spoke softly near one end giulia was being kissed by an old man just a movement to the cheek hands placed over hers when he moved back she turned to the next in line so that her face was toward us i stopped she had the kind of delicate features that went with the convent school posture but her face soft and composed was slightly long the one trace of her mothers family otherwise she looked exactly like gianni the same wavy hair broadset eyes she was wearing a black dress with a small white bow at the neck and for one awkward second i saw gianni in his cutaway arriving to take my mother to the ball even the same quizzical look in his eyes the look at least was real i realized i must be staring and turned away theres giulia my mother said come and meet her later i said i want some coffee you go theres nothing wrong is there you look all white no i just need some coffee eager now for her to leave youll be nice she said looking at me a question you know you were almost brother and sister yes almost whats wrong claudia said to me when my mother left she looks just like him claudia peered down the table at her she was greeting my mother now not with a kiss but polite the eyes a little all his features no i dont see that the eyes yes his eyes were like that she looked away then reached over and picked up a coffee cup what a pair we are standing here talking about his eyes a man we she took a sip of coffee still looking down ill have to say something to her she was leading my mother out of the room i looked around who are they do you know any of these people from the newspapers il bel mondo claudia said what did the eulogy say a humanitarian a savior of men christ my mother was back in the room carrying a brown envelope of sentimental value so another meeting father luca was leaning over the table to pick up a biscotti a very different occasion he said sadly looking at it as if he were referring to the food yes very different a beautiful service though he nodded father prato he said always excellent a professional appraisal he bowed to claudia who acknowledged it then glanced away uncomfortable he will be buried tomorrow i said making conversation in the country not at san michele yes of course the country all the magliones are buried there i didnt realize he had a house there he looked at me stupefied as if this were too absurd to answer yes he said finally they always preferred it there not gianni he loved venice but the others he waved his hand always this love of land well you can see how lucky it was for them poor venice the trade declines what do the families do buy more ships but the magliones land and now the other families are gone how many of these are left he said indicating the palazzo in the family not a hotel not a museum still ca maglione its because they bought land its an irony yes a house in the water still here all because of land how much do they own he looked at me again you mean exactly i dont know these are private matters family matters im sorry i didnt mean it that way just in general its a farm a farm but signor miller the magliones are the largest landowners in the veneto surely you knew that no i said disconcerted yes from the brenta he started spreading his arms then stopped well considerable property of course giulia the first wife also had property near ferrara he paused his firsthis wife i should say now she will be the only one he placed his hand on my arm i am so sorry for your loss i looked at him then nodded a silent thankyou i wish id known him better something to say surprisingly this seemed to move him he gripped my arm tighter your mother shes its hard for her father luca shook his head in sympathy to lose a man like that and think of the family always taking care of everybody paolo everybody even as a child you could see itthe head of the family but i thought paolo was older yes but gianni was the head even then boys well we were all boys and now a tragedy a tragedy so much evil in the world now more than before bertie said coming up behind him i wonder luca i have to drag you away hello claudia he said his voice cooler what a surprise he met her eye for a second then backed away turning to me instead i promised luca a proper lunch you must be famished he said to him glancing at the table shes the mothers daughter isnt she he sighed be lovely to pay a little attention to the living but this is traditional oh im sure its perfect just right the mother was like that too and you never had a decent meal in her house signor howard the priest said oh i know very bad of me anyway come to lunch adam you ought to get grace home its a strain a thing like this she seems all right mm its all this holding herself together i dont like much better to collapse with a good weep and get it over with much better in the end father luca took my hand if you ever want to talk i knew him very well bertie threw me a what are you up to look then turned to the room arent people extraordinary i followed his gaze to the crowd in suits and black dresses idly talking sipping coffee youd think hed had a heart attack it was giulia finally who found us smoking out on the balcony pretending there was more sun than there was youre adam she said simply extending a hand i introduced claudia who moved back against the railing suddenly skittish but giulia nodded graciously there was no sign of recognition the engagement party scene apparently not known to her another relief something already fading no longer gossiped about i saw you looking at me before she said im sorry its just you look so like your father you think so most people think my mother well i never knew her no she said suddenly embarrassed well the eyes maybe everyone says that but her eyes had none of giannis sharpness they were soft almost hazy as if she had just taken off glasses and were trying to focus you went to san michele she said her voice flat so that for a second i wondered if she resented it felt it was an intrusion the police asked me yes she said quickly i am so grateful to see him like that she stopped herself i gave your mother some pictures from his youth they knew each other then beforebefore the others yes so its a romantic story i didnt know he never told you she looked down we didnt talk about it no well maybe he tried she lifted her head cleareyed no longer soft or unfocused you know its not easy to say this i disagreed with him about this marriage i thought he was bewitched i smiled to myself a word never used in conversation despite the perfect english foreign after all but now i meet her and i see i was wrong not the fortune hunter an affair of the heart fortune hunter i said thrown by the unexpectedness of it im sorry i dont know how to say it you know with my father there was always that danger so it was natural she paused a mistake i apologize to you no i just meant but what did i mean that she would appreciate the irony that it was the other way around i put out my cigarette stalling i wish wed met earlier yes i apologize for that too of course i had examinations but that was an excuse really anyway i didnt come so that was the last thing he said to me good luck with the examinations she looked out at the canal where a vaporetto was passing catching the faint sun on its white roof youre going to be a lawyer i said bringing her back to somewhere neutral she smiled in italy a woman no they let me studywell because of my father but in the courtroom they wouldnt like that so much this to claudia who gave a thin smile back so what will you do oh it was to work with my father like a son you know he used to say that to me youre my son so its a good thing to know law to run the businesses my father used to trust everybody and of course they cheated him so now his son is there a lawyer they dont cheat so easily not soft gianni telling me exactly what would happen at the trial hed never have she stopped smiling shyly im sorry its boring to talk about this no i said automatically businesses not just land we should go in its getting cold claudia said folding her arms across her chest and starting for the door giulia glanced into the room still filled with people yes they cant go until they tell me how sorry they are its the form over and over how sorry who was the woman with you in church my grandmother giannis mother i said a nervous twinge in my stomach a child killednothing was worse not just killed no my mothers shes the only one left now i opened my hand to indicate after you expecting her to follow claudia through the door but she hesitated wait she said a moment i dont know how to say it i want to talk more will you come to see me yes if youd like its strange you know but theres no one else i mean were not family but we might have been so it happened to you too this death deathmurder she said murder she said again they wont even say it no one else will care the way we do youre the only one i can ask ask what for your help my help to find the murderer i stared at her but the police ouf cavallini filomenas husband that one hes still the police theyll never find out theyll look and then theyll stop but you wont i said quietly never she said her voice giannis again sure i cant im the son she looked at me and you the way she looks at you claudia said later in bed like a sister ha jealous i said smiling at her no careful one slip you say but whos talking the priest then the daughter i thought i would scream i thought wed never leave i smiled again but my mind was elsewhere in the polished high room with the gilt furniture not a fortune hunter but we did she said putting a finger on my chest bringing me back so its over yes the largest landowners in the veneto everyone saw us that was the point i said everyone saw us at the ball when i got home my mother was looking through the photographs the brown envelope next to her on the couch i turned on a lamp and went over to the sideboard to make a drink want one she pointed to her halffilled glass on the end table you know i dont remember wearing my hair this short she said peering at a snapshot but i suppose i must have what businesses did gianni own oh darling i dont know a little of this a little of that wines he was always talking about that why giulia mentioned the family businesses i was just wondering what they were they own part of a bank i expect thats what she meant and bits of things he said it was safer that way spreading out your chips she looked up not munitions if thats what you mean he wasnt that no i didnt mean that just curious well the wines he used to mention he said there was no such thing as a bad year during the war so much demand but i think it was more a hobby really the rest was through the bank but he was rich darling what a question whats this all about cavallini said he was one of the richest men in italy well the family they always had pots but he was the family after his brother you mean yes i suppose but darling you knew all this anyway what does it matter now it doesnt i guess i said sipping my drink but you knew well of course i knew he always had money i dont know how much exactly i didnt ask to see his bank balance im not peggy joyce yet i didnt say that you might as well she looked away i admit i thought about it well who wouldnt but i was fond of him you know i really was it wasnt just the money i hesitated taking this in i didnt know it was the money at all i thought you were in love with him i never said that she snapped annoyed i said i was fond of him though why any of this should matter to you now i havent the foggiest she put the photographs aside unfolding her legs restless i must say you pick your moments ive just buried the last husband im likely to have and you want to talk about his finances accusing me of i dont know what all right so were crystal clear i was never in love with gianni ive told you this i was in love with your father but gianniwell after all these years i never expected that and then there it was and yes i thought well this is lucky everything will be all right now but i was fond of him i never deceived him about that she said her voice finally breaking she reached for a handkerchief now look i get through the whole funeral and now i start to puddle i stared at her my mind racing connecting dots what do you mean everything will be all right now what oh the money thats what we were talking about isnt it anyway thats gone now it really doesnt matter how much he had does it i wont see any of it she sniffed into the handkerchief so what you have your own well go back to new york but she was shaking her head its not going to stretch there i can do it here why do you think i came you can still live here you have no idea what new york is like now just the simplest things stretch i said looking at her trying to follow what about dads money ive been living on it im still living on iti never said anybody was starving she moved away i dont know how much you thought there was those last years when he was sick it just went through your fingers all the nurses everything it goes and every year theres less so you have to be careful look i can do it its just i can do it better here and i thought well you have that little trust from your grandfatherand you were always so independent anyway im not going to be a burden you dont have to worry about that but new york just eats it away you get worried you just keep hoping something will turn up and something did yes something did she looked at me i didnt plan it i went to paris not here i know but the way you look so i came and it was lucky and shall i tell you something we would have been happy we would have taken care of each other he wanted to marry me so much why i dont know but he wanted it we would have been happy it wasnt just the money i was fond of him she fingered the brown envelope on the couch then turned to me but you never saw that always so she cut herself off then shook her head you made it difficult adam you really did we didnt deserve that either of us her voice dropped finally out of steam and she moved toward the door what shall i tell angelina are you in tonight yes all right not for me i hope she said i dont want that adam i dont mind being alone her shoulders moved a small shrug anyway id better get used to it almost casual making peace no i said trying to reassure her with a look something will turn up she nodded smiling weakly twice after she left i went over to the couch and picked up a few of the pictures on the beach with her short hair in a group gianni as a teenager grinning then as a young man sitting with people in cafes posing in san marco in a racing car with his brother in front of the hospitalall smiling giulia must have raided the family album to find gianni as my mother would have known him young unattached even in the later pictures his wife was missingat home or maybe just outside the frame smiling happy exactly the man my mother described not the one i knew but they must at some point have been the same when had everything turned inside out if it had my face felt warm as if my mothers words were stinging it all id wanted to do the start of everything was to protect her but hed been rich not after her money not even thinking about it i dropped the pictures my hand shaking a little what else had i been wrong about i tried to think what his face had looked like when he hadnt been smiling when he had been reaching for me in the hall malevolent or just angry frustrated maybe claudias landlady had wanted the rooms back maybe the accademia was cutting staff maybe id killed the young man in the photograph imagining hed become someone else held his head underwater until the life went out of him because i had got everything wrong not just murder murder for no reason at all i sat for a few minutes more my chest suddenly tight taking in gulps of air then went over to the phone and placed a trunk call to rosa soriano chapter eleven well now you have your answer rosa said tapping the newspaper lying on the folder next to her we were at the bauer again at the same breakfast except that sunshine had replaced the rain outside una cospirazione comunista she smiled a little shaking her head giannis funeral took up half the front page with a big picture of the casket being carried down the salute steps the veiled giulia just behind held by the elbows for theatrical effect a scene ready for la fenice why communist why not a political killing very convenient you dont scare the tourists and you get to blame the communists for something else you see it says here rumors in other words they dont know but now people have the impression the communists did it but why would they want to an old venetian family a doctor a savior of men everything thats goodnaturally theyd want to get rid of him she pushed the paper aside who knows why as long as they did so now theyre like gangsters even worse than people thought she sipped her tea its not a political city you know whatevers good for business she smiled when the allies came infrom new zealand did you know venice liberated by new zealandthey were still serving german officers at quadris not in uniform civilian clothes they hated to leave one last coffee so the waiters kept serving that was all right it was after when the partisans acted for the crimes all those years people shot that was terrible worse than the germans you see how it says here about the brother she tapped the paper again a tragic family again this violence so they make the connection another killing like the brother partisans again now communists the same thing to them but maybe it was a partisan she looked at me over the rim of her cup but didnt say anything you said they acted on their own sometimes if the trials she was nodding yes it was the first thing i thought when i heard like il gazzettino she said giving a wry glance at the paper but now you dont a feeling only why now so late she took the cup in both hands warming herself you see when the germans left there were killings like this a season of bad bloodavenge this one that one you know this happens a part of war but then it stops its enough and the way he was killed what do you mean so clumsy like a thief with the partisans it was a bullet a military action not a crime oh such a look you think its the same its not the same to them these are not criminals soldiers they were fighting for their country but the wars over so why now its only for us she said waving her hand back and forth between us that the war doesnt end with our files for the others its late she paused but also too early you know when i said they act they find their own proof its for justice because i couldnt do it with this she placed her hand on the folder but there hasnt been any trial they dont have to make their own justice yet its too soon maybe someone didnt want to wait maybe but theres no talk of this you know i have many contacts old colleagues she said raising an eyebrow almost conspiratorial no one says anything she sighed but whats the difference now he got his justice anyway you found the proof proof the fire the house she looked away the house no no proof the dates dont work what the man who was in hospital moretti he was released october fourth thats the date you found yes its too early the raid its not until the fifteenth why would they wait and he doesnt come to us a week in verona a safe house there i thought at first it must besuch a coincidence moretti in the hospital if he had just come from venice but no first to verona if they tracked him why wait for someone else to come to the house i said faintly no one else came couriers people who had been before none of them were in the house when the germans attacked none were picked up later so who were they waiting for of course maybe theres something in the german recordsyou know in all the confusion some are missing but still why wait its not characteristic the dates dont work i stared at her gripping the edge of the table stepping into the outer swirl of an eddy you mean he might not have done it i mean we cant prove it for a trial except its not a question of that anymore hes dead but how do we know i stopped one thought tumbling over another what if he didnt do it if not the house something else he was a collaborator no isnt that why you came to us in the first place he was what he was but what exactly i said mostly to myself she looked at me surprised i mean we should know now that weve started but hes ended it signor miller hes dead the file is closed i cant investigate the dead theres no time for that but he was killed well now its a police matter she paused thats whats troubling you you feel guilty i looked at her yes i know she said i know what you think we open the file start looking and someone hears aha so its maglione he thinks and he decides to act on his own because we started this she put her hand across the table not quite touching mine we cant blame ourselves for this i make files thats all the files dont kill people maybe it was always going to happen maybe this is the justice anyway its done she moved her cup aside finished but if a partisan killed him wouldnt you want to know she looked straight at me and what bring him to trial no my justice doesnt go that far and how did he know because we started this then its our fault too so we all killed him thats what you want to think but what if we killed the wrong man i said shaky finally there near the center of the eddy she stared at me for a moment then put both hands in front of her fingers touching making a point signor miller hes dead if he did terrible thingswell its good yes if he didnt hes dead anyway what do you want me to do get proof and condemn him in the ground or no proofthen what rehabilitate him make a good reputation for him in il gazzettino hes already a hero what more can he want let it go now close the file but then well never know if he did it its so important to you this she said what do you want to prove that he deserved to die i looked away for a second seeing again the gray skin on san michele pasty and inert lieutenant sullivan said it was like this with you rosa said personal in germany every case had it been is that what joe had thought folder after folder i hate to walk away thats all yes but there are so many others the point is to make a trial to make it known theres no trial here she said putting her hand on the file not anymore it doesnt matter to me how he died theres no trial she was silent for a minute waiting then began to gather up her things case closed but i have to know i said the words jumping out of me trying to hold her in her seat she looked up at me startled want to know i said correcting myself i want to know what he did so do you its not personal with me signor miller i dont have the time it was at that moment everything swirling again that i saw cavallini a glimpse over rosas shoulder circling into my line of vision across the roomthe mustache then the side of his face then his back sitting down i craned my neck looking around her was he meeting someone no alone at the bauer talking to the waiter now opening a paper why not at work at the questura unless he was at work keeping me in sight the one man in venice he could trust look i said dropping my voice as if he could actually hear it across the room all im asking you to do is keep checking the german files there has to be something and i dont have access you do that and ill work the rest from this end work what ill finish that i said pointing to the file the hospital the times how it happened i hesitated the other members of the group not to nail them i promise you if it turns out dont promise me anything if it was a partisan it stops here you wont know nobody knows except you she said tilting her head slightly as if another angle might explain things then why do it why because there had to be a reason for the bubbles in the water but why else something i could say that she could believe over her shoulder the waiter was pouring cavallinis coffee because it wasnt a partisan you dont think so and neither do i no we cant stop now youve already done the spade worknow youre just going to give it a pass an atrocity everybody knows about there should be a trial signor miller hes dead she said her voice weary but her eyes intrigued assessing me think of something quickly cavallini would turn in his seat any second make an elaborate show of coming over rosas help lost for good id never know but not everyone is whoever killed him isnt not a partisan she said slowly no and if i find him i said nodding at the file then youre back in business so its worth a chance she had leaned forward her whole body listening back in business well theres always somebody else isnt there always but nothing ever came out then all of a sudden youre investigating gianniyou know something youre getting close so if you were the somebody else it might be a good time to get rid of gianni i said rushing now believing it myself the way it should have happened another collaborator who set up the raid i opened my palm an offering your trial and then before she could say anything could you get me a list of everyone you talked to who knew you were doing this because there had to be someone who knew about gianni who could tell me besides you and lieutenant sullivan everyone at the hospital whoever you talked to it had to be someone who knew this was happening that you were opening the case but they might have talked to others i know well follow it as far as we can oh we i told you i you just work on the germans ill take care of that i said reaching over for the file you know i cant its allied property joe would do it for me and me when they ask me files get lost misplaced even the germans lost files i said it happens and then they turn up again you want to know what happened too dont you she raised her hand letting the file slide away then pushed up her sleeve and scratched the white skin on her arm we both want to know i kept looking at her as i pulled the folder toward me and youre going to do this all by yourself one man talk to all these people in italian how i cant take the time i know we made a deal just work the german side but you cant i glanced over her shoulder again the one man he could trust not even an idea an impulse grabbing at anything unable to stop now the eddy in control yes i can im going to get the police to help we had to pass cavallinis table to leave the dining room so there was no avoiding a meeting he sprang up when we got near as if hed been waiting ah signora soriano they said you would be here he took her hand waiting for rosa not me you know each other i said who said i would be here i telephoned your office ah looking for the communists she said pointing to the paper in front of him mischievous you know i cant help you with that i dont know any no one does cavallini said smiling back sometimes you know i think we make them up rosa looked at him sometimes you do but theyre useful no she nodded to the paper some coffee you can join me he offered a seat no its impossible im late if id knownits important you came here to see me i dont like to interrupt he said motioning toward the table where wed been what is it rosa said direct not the communists he said picking up the paper the victim you have so much information about our venetian citizens i thought perhapsyou know we have to look everywhere in a murder case ha so this is your help she said to me come due gocce dacqua whats the english not drops of waterpeas two peas in a pod i said not really following both of you so interested in maglione she said to cavallini then pointed her thumb at me talk to him you know im not allowed only if lieutenant sullivan but you can tell meis there a file she kept her eyes on him away from the folder in the newspaper under my arm a murder case signora all right ill look she said evenly but now i should go youre finished with me its not an interrogation cavallini said smiling theres a difference with police she said but pleasantly easing her way out ill call you she said to me good luck this with a move of her eyes to cavallini so you know the famous rosa cavallini said as she left she works for a friend of mine why famous during the war in the resistance brave like a man the germans never got her a communist you know she says not he shrugged they all say not so why good luck the peas in a pod we both asked her about gianni ah he said noncommittal look you said on san michele that i could help maybe i can this is what i did in germany with her boss the armys not going to talk to youthey like to keep things to themselves but hell talk to me i can find out what they have so there is a file yes why but maybe he already knew because i asked them to start one he looked at me for a moment then at the waiter gathering up cups i must get back but its so nice today perhaps youd walk with me part of the way outside we stopped in front of san moise the rococo stone dark with grit even in the bright sun you asked for this investigation yes didnt you know i said probing your mother mentioned something he said casually known all along take nothing for granted then you also know why he nodded the incident with signorina grassini i think several have mentioned this why i felt warm a rush of blood had he been asking about her running through his checklist rumors and times i left the hotel and who had seen what but the engagement party had been bound to come up it had happened and so had the ball when wed spent the evening with him having our pictures taken just move the party off his checklist away from claudia an embarrassment for you and for her now i said starting to walk the narrow calle feeling suddenly like a tightrope keep your balance and dont look down you know when something terrible happens you look for someone to blame anybody and gianni was there when they were taken you dont always think you justthen later you realize its a mistake you cant blame someone personally of course gianni was nice about it i suppose for my sake so they made a truce the same word hed used when he lied to me on the fondamenta maybe a word that was always a lie in the end they were both relieved i think but you asked your friendlieutenant sullivan to investigate him i wanted to reassure her that gianni was all right that shed made a mistake and did it reassure her yes i said looking at him because i didnt tell her what they found he was quiet for a minute thinking then stopped we were near the turnoff for harrys standing next to one of the stores shoes and handbags and cashmere with harrys at the end of the calle my mothers venice but you want to tell me he said a question not a request his eyes slightly apprehensive i remembered the broad smile that first night at harrys pleased to see gianni yes but only you it wouldnt be fair to his daughter to my mother for that matter nobody has to know not yet theyre only suggestions not proof suggestions what suggestions he said calmly that he was working with the germans that he betrayed partisans you believe this i dont know what to believe people have to do things in wartimeits hard to judge so maybe yes but the point is that if he did then theres a motive why would anyone want to kill gianni but if he betrayed them or if they thought he did he was nodding to himself yes there were such cases rosa knows this and yet she runs away when i ask she doesnt want it to be a partisan thats your idea that it was a partisan we started walking again past the jewelry stores and into the deep shadow of the arcades you know signor miller everyone worked for the germans we dont like to say now but what could we do this was an occupied country even the police worked for them not like this like this he repeated waiting there was a suggestion that he was an informer for the ss there was a raid an atrocity a fire so you know about it i thought it must be that with rosa just then we came out of the arcades into the bright open piazza that exhilarating first moment when the space of san marco dazzles even cavallini stopped looking across at the campanile and the domes of the basilica it seems impossible doesnt it that such things could happen he said where its so beautiful i glanced at him surprised look at this he said genuinely moved and in fact the piazza was spectacular flooded with spring light the sun flashing off the gold mosaics the pigeons swooping up and around in the soft air imagine he said to be a maglione in this city he turned to me i hope youre wrong signor miller so many years and then a disgrace like this on the name i hope im wrong too for my mothers sake yes forgive me he said we started to walk across the piazza i forgot what this would mean to her i was thinking of my wifes family an indulgence do such things happen who knows better than a policeman of course youre rightwe must know im grateful to you for your help maybe we can help each other yes i can find out what joe sullivan haswell rosa really but if we want to take this any further there are hospital records to check and id need your authority for that my authority but the allies have all the authority you need for war crimes but now hes dead theyre not interested in trying a dead man what would be the point so its a police matter your case my case he said to himself as if he were trying out the phrase he looked up at me a faint grin under the mustache and you want to be the dr watson the partner its not usual such an offer just an assistant if it would help oh i accept i accept an experienced investigator for you its like old times maybe more germans no no trials this time i just want to know whether he did it i looked at cavallini and then well know why he was killed unexpectedly he extended his hand i am so grateful for your help at the questura do they want this to know why with you its a family matter they say to me you see you can understand that but the others they just want it to go away for everything to be normal the tourists will be here soon around us as a kind of live illustration the waiters were putting out more tables at florians even one days sun an excuse to start the season in a few days the musicians would be back playing waltzes and everything would be the same i watched for a second uneasy even the whitejacketed waiters carrying chairs suddenly surreal i was supposed to be one of the people sitting down for coffee reading an english newspaper writing postcards not lying to policemen who were grateful for my help will you come back to the questura i cant now i said anyway id better call joe get you the file after id read it first decided what to pass on so we can start yes thank you he said but the idea seemed to darken his mood again a reminder i remember the incident of the house very well those were the worst times near the end i dont know why i shrugged the losers are desperate and the winners arent accountable yet so its open season it was the same in germany at the war crimes commission most of the cases were recent war crimes he said sometimes i think everything in the war was a crime i looked at him surprised again and nothing thats the problem its war so it doesnt count well now its over he said taking one last look at the piazza still filling with chairs now it counts chapter twelve are you crazy claudia said maybe but this way we know everything theyre doing help them what are you going to do help them catch us the closer i get the more they look somewhere else im making them look somewhere else no digging a grave two not just yours pacing now drawing smoke in tight gulps as if she were angry at the cigarette too we want them to look somewhere else you dont want them coming back to that party back to me you mean back to either of us i said looking at her either of us and now they wontbecause youre there maybe they ask themselves why does he do this look i was a kind of cop something like this happens in my family they expect me to take an interest not your family close to me then they expect me to help cavallini asked me giulia asked me oh giulia the pretty sister now not a sister so theres a convenience stop what do you want to do make it up to her ill find out who did it ha not as difficult as she thinks claudia maybe you want to show her what he was like heres your father ss you think shell thank you for that your little sister are you finished she turned her back to me you said we would leave venice we will oh but not yet not until its too late i put my hands on her and turned her around listen this is how it works i show cavallini what gianni did i prove it so its the logical answer the only place he looks not here not at you not at me some partisan someone gianni betrayed and when there is no partisan but theyll think there is maybe dead maybe still out therethey dont know exactly we never find out but we know who it has to be the kind of crime so theyre satisfiedit couldnt be anyone else and maybe its just as well they cant get him that way nothing has to come out about gianni no scandal no disgrace all covered up like his brother all they want is an answer to what happened something plausible they dont want to open anything up nobody wants to know she was silent for a minute then moved away carrying her cigarette to the table only you she said putting it out you want to know dont you i want to be sure sure of what you want to use the police to prove he was guilty why so that it was right for you i want to lead them somewhere else no she said shaking her head youll lead them back to us the closer i am to them the safer we are she looked up yes unless they use you we stopped then too tired to go any further but the argument went on in different ways a general prickliness that began to seep into the days claudia had found a job in a lace shop near san aponal you dont have to work yes i have to what do i do sit and wait besides after the accademia maybe they think i have a grudge no job so its better no one suspects you maybe i want to do it anyway what else sit with your mother waiting for her to guess so we saw less of each other busy being careful in public i went through reports at the questuraa staff member to translate a desk that wasnt officially mine but was always availableand claudia made a point of not asking where id been one night leaving her hotel i realized that wed made love because we were expected to as if our comings and goings were still being monitored even sex now part of an airtight alibi something noted for a file on sunday the weather was still fine and we went to torcello an excuse to get away the vaporetto wasnt crowdeda few families going out to burano and two american soldiers in eisenhower jackets who sat inside with halfclosed eyes out late the night before the military had been a light presence in venice during the occupation and since the official changeover in december soldiers were even less visible more like tourists passing through than conquerors in germany it had been rubble and jeep patrols and lowering your eyes when a soldier passed keeping out of trouble here in the close quarters of the boat the burano families stared openly curious as if they were sizing up customers i thought of the germans finishing coffee at quadris now the allies who might like a little burano lace to send home surprisingly however the gis got off with us at torcello i looked at the sluggish canal the lonely marshes beyond and wondered if theyd made a mistake but after a quick glance at a map they went straight toward the piazza claudia hung back letting them go ahead no one else was around somewhere on the island on one of the farms a dog barked otherwise it was quiet no summer insects yet just the wind moving through the reeds by the time we caught up with the gis they were standing in the piazza a worn patch of grass looking as melancholy and lost as the shuttered buildings around it theres supposed to be a restaurant here one of them said locanda you know where that is i pointed to the closedup inn across from us thats the one harrys runs yes but only in the summer i said its too early well shit he said then dipped his head toward claudia an apology to a lady they didnt tell you i never asked i just heard about it shit he looked around the empty island whats the rest a ghost town no people live here farms its just a little early in the season youre welcome to have some of ours i pointed to the picnic bag thats okay well just catch the next boat thatll be a while you check the schedule he shook his head then grinned never thought to look we opened the wine and shared out the salami sandwiches sitting on the steps of the greek church claudia slightly away from us uncomfortable they were on furlough trying to see something worth seeing before they headed back to stuttgart it was the usual service talkwhere id been stationed where they were from when their separation papers were coming through and i cant wait he said i mean i cant fucking wait they can keep the whole thing he spread his arm to take in all of europe then remembered claudia and dropped it embarrassed instead as if it would explain things he pulled out his wallet and showed us a picture of his wife joyce head tilted for the camera blond ordinary holding a baby in her arms a boy claudia said he grinned back jim junior havent seen him yet just this well but soon yes theyre sending everybody home now we saw it in the newsreels she said all the boats thousands of waving soldiers the skyscraper shot then running down the gangplank arms open you from here he said intrigued by her accent maybe the first italian hed met he looked around what is this place anyway it was the first venice where it started so what happened the canals silted up malaria too i think he gave her an ill bet look anything here to see i mean you came out and you knew the restaurant was closed the basilica is very old eleventh century the original was seventh claudia said the mosaics are famous but she was losing them they were already looking away uninterested and you know for walks right he said nodding walks a smile just a trace of a leer and here we are in the way he brushed off his trousers standing up but you dont want to see inside tell you what you take a look for me i never know what im looking at anyway well just go wait for the boat let you be its a long wait not in this sun i could just soak it up after germany he grinned fucking sunny italy huh they took a photograph of us then headed down the canal path to the pier turning once to wave so thats who comes to ciprianis claudia said amused not usually i said leaning back a favorite of berties before the war i wonder how they heard about it oh how do people hear about anything somebody tells them yes i said lazily closing my eyes and who tells him somebody else and him i said playing i dont know maybe cipriani i smiled letting the thought drift then sat up taking a cigarette out of my pocket so who told gianni i mean how did he know she looked at me blankly rosa said he wouldnt know a partisansomebody would have to tell him not the ss if they already knew why use him somebody else maybe ive been looking at this backwards how do you mean backwards weve been tracking what happened after and were getting nowhere but what about before i bent over lighting the cigarette then saw her confused expression look the only one in that house whod been in hospital was a man called moretti if there was a connection to gianni hed be it but he was discharged more than a week earlier so where was gianni all that time theres nothing to prove he was involved at all so maybe he wasnt claudia said calmly no proof i said not listening a few visits to villa raspelli but if he did know about moretti how did he know maybe thats what we should be looking for the link before and if you dont find that either i exhaled some smoke then we cant prove he did anything he gave them my father but theres no proof he did no she said only me i didnt mean just my word and now he cant answer so how can you prove it maybe i made it up the camp too maybe its all in my head i didnt mean i said again but she was gathering things up finished with it lets see the church i put out my cigarette still thinking and followed her inside santa maria assunta had been built before churches became theatersthe walls were austere and the air was damp we could see our breath in little streams venice was still primitive here the island a mud bank with reeds again the world full of mystery and fear but then there were the mosaics at the end cold and glittering spreading over the chancel in an arch of colored light people would have knelt here on the rough stone floors dazed you see the tear on her cheek claudia said pointing mary crying its unique we studied the apostles for a while then walked slowly back to the west wall and the big mosaic of the last judgment the afterlife arranged in tiers a medieval sorting out with hellfire on the bottom dying wasnt enough for the early christiansthere had to be punishment too claudia stood before it with her arms folded across her chest working her way down through the levels of grace to the figures on the lower right engulfed in flames so this is what happens after she said but they didnt want the jews to wait they burned us here the chill of the old stone followed us out into the piazza not quite as sunny as before we took one of the footpaths leading away from the canal waving to the gis who were still waiting on the dock for the burano boat why are they laughing they think were going parking parking kissing in a car people drive somewhere to be alone america she said everyone has a car will you like that youll have to learn to drive an unexpected thought jarring because i had never imagined us beyond venice anywhere outside her room drive she said maybe jarred too here no one does except giannis brother i thought who had actually pushed him off the road maybe a connection something to ask rosa we passed the farm with the dog then turned onto a path that led down to the water a cleared patch of dry land that looked back through the reeds to the campanile in summer lovers would come with picnics now we pulled our jackets tight against the wind it was only after his brothers death that gianni had made the house calls to villa raspelli younger but head of the family father luca had said his brothers keeper so youre thinking again she said why is this so important to you i dont want to be wrong i turned to her then its just personalsomething i did for myself she stopped in the path he was trying to kill you i looked over the reeds his eyes hesitating about to stop then the slippery stairs my hand underneath getting cold as i held him there my breath ragged what she said no i wanted to do it i said finally i wanted to do it she came over to me you know what he was if he was i was wrong about him and my mother he was never after her money never anyway it turns out there isnt any no she said then started to smile raising her hand to brush at my hair so its lucky i found the lace shop i was wrong i said not letting go she brushed my hair again it doesnt matter now it doesnt change anything of course it matters why so you can blame yourself and then what for you its like the mosaic she tossed her head toward the church always a judgment there is no judgment no one is judging no one is watching she stopped dropping her hand no one is watching then we have to i said oh like he did she said annoyed moving away play god of course a doctor theyre used to that arent they then he plays it with my father bah she waved her hand but thats not enough for you how guilty does he have to be before its all right she walked to the end of the clearing where it was sunny and faced the water using her back to put an end to the conversation i went over to her not saying anything thats jesolo she said pointing meaning nothing not expecting a response i took out my cigarettes and offered her one waiting for her lead but she seemed to enjoy the silence turning her face to the sun then squatting down to test the ground for dampness sitting and lying back i sat down next to her this is better all week in the shop never any sun she said i stretched out leaning on my elbow to prop up my head as i looked at her you dont have to work there i said going along i mean with your english theyre always looking for translators joe would hire you in a second for the army no not even yours not carabinieri either or police no uniforms she glanced over i dont work for the police one of us is enough i turned and lay on my back squinting at the bright sky in the distance was the faint sound of a boats motor maybe the gis vaporetto whats wrong i said all week its not cavallini not really what i dont know she paused im worried about what im telling you they dont know she shook her head not that its different between us at first it made us closer and now already were quarreling she turned to me you cant change it what it is you want to make it better nothing makes it better i know but you keep thinking maybe its in your head she lay on her back again nothings different between us i just want to know about him thats all its important she closed her eyes another way of turning her back and said nothing for a few minutes then sighed not much louder than the moving reeds they have sun in georgia she said where that soldier lives nothing but so hes happy there but not you she said thinking aloud you dont want to go home im happy here no something else those men on the shipin the film remember so excited its over for them she turned opening her eyes but not for you i said nothing remembering rosa wagging her finger between us both of us still with files maybe it takes an ocean and then its gone she said oh i want i looked over at her what what what do i want she said to herself i want to be joyce the girl in the picture make curtains wait for the ship feed the baby she stopped her voice drifting off think how wonderful not to know about any of it not any of it and thats the life you want i said teasing joyce no she turned anyway i cant no babies so thats something you should know she said her voice tentative waiting for a response oh i said finally trying to sound easy do you mind about that no no another pause this time waiting for her i got rid of it myself in the camp i knew that if he found out hed send me and there was no one to help so i did it myself thats why i looked at her for a minute not saying anything then she moved to brush off a blade of grass pushing at her sleeve and for an instant i saw rosas arm again with its jagged patch of white visible scars reminders but what about the others the ones you couldnt see years of them nobody unblemished now i reached over and touched her hand i dont want joyce so its lucky for me she closed her eyes but now theres this maybe you enjoy it being police but its both of us theyll catch why do you have to know i held him under claudia me what if for a minute she didnt say anything then she took a breath when it happened i thought you did it for me so they wouldnt take me i thought my heart would stop imagine someone doing that for me everyone else wanted me dead and you she moved her hand away and sat up but now it has to be something else i dont even know what you cant change what happened whatever he was say you did it for me isnt that enough yes i said quietly but you still want to know i sat up looking straight at her i saw the body what he looked like after i cant explainits different when you see what it really means i dropped my head it wont take long nobody suspects i ran my hand over the grass how else are we going to live with this she smiled slightly giving up a movement of the lips not really a smile at all oh how you can live with anything anything what was paolo like paolo a puppy bertie said why paolo all of a sudden we were having coffee in santo stefano a chance meeting on my way to ca maglione where giulia was waiting with giannis papers the sun was bright enough for umbrellas at the cafe tables but the air was still cool bertie was wearing a threepiece oystercolored suit perfectly pitched like the weather somewhere between winter and summer i dont know about him about any of giannis family for that matter now you want to know it might help who your friends at the questura i hear youre thick as thieves is this an official visit he said his voice rising slightly like an arched eyebrow i smiled im just trying to help it was giulias idea oh giulias idea the fair giulia he looked over at me then tilted his head his eyes beginning to twinkle no its too penny dreadful still having fun i admit its a little novelettish but think how suitable well dont and grace the dogaressa after all he giggled bertie oh i know i know very bad its just a thought anyway youre otherwise attached as we know thered be that to contend with wouldnt there his voice casual claudia still an inappropriate affair to him unaware we were joined by blood now our hands streaked with it yes there would i leaned forward serious bertie tell me something what happened at the accademia me why ask me because you know i dont always you know better not to venice is a very small town you dont want to be telling tales out of schoolpeople dont like it tell this one he looked at me then nodded i dont want any reactions please its not perfect the world not even here he glanced around the sunny campo the terracotta planters sprouting bits of white the first spring flowers some attitudesnot very nice but they just dont go away overnight either and at first of course no one thought to ask thered never been any you know not in the curatorial department he let it hang awkward and took a sip of coffee are you trying to tell me they fired her because shes jewish i didnt say that bertie said quickly and i dont want you saying it either i merely said they didnt think she wassuitable i thought of the montanaris just a look who didnt oh what does it matter all right old buccati if you must know hes nearly ninety at that age all youve got is old ideas whatever they are mostly he just naps away the afternoon like an old tabby but this time he pricks up his ears and makes a fuss and of course it is buccati so they cant very well say no what a tear even me if you please because id recommended her which i only did because emilio asked i thought a cousin and then not even that i had no idea but how did he hear buccati hear what about her well who didnt after that awful scene but gianni didnt say anything gianni adam what are you talking about i thought gianni might have had something to do with it what at the accademia gianni never looked at a painting in his life i doubt hed ever been inside much lesswhat do you think he was prattling away to old buccati what for to get her fired well i wouldnt have blamed himso unpleasant that business at the partybut no no nobodys even suggested it this was buccatis own particular nonsense and what a mess im sorry about the girl of course but think of me and the staff nervous as hens now that they see what hes really like so you dont think it was gianni i said partly to myself no i dont he said steadily and i would have heard i finished the rest of the coffee thinking he showed me some frescoes once i said and adam im having a little trouble following you said he never looked at pictures but he knew these where at the hospital well the hospital and ca maglione im sure he knew every wall and id still bet hed never been inside the accademia adam he was a doctor theyre all a bit home counties really arent they he was a very conventional man he wasnt really interested in he waved his hand to take in the city you know this but he loved venice as property not asthis extraordinary thing no eye none he was just a conventional man he paused putting down his cup except for grace i suppose ive been thinking about it sincewell sinceand you know shes the one thing that doesnt make sense in his life he does his work he cares about his familyoh that dreary wife the marriage must have been a penance everything what it should be except for her maybe she was this for him he said waving his hand again at the campo this whole other side that must have been there i never saw it but it must have been dont you think mad for her even years later i think she was the only idea he ever had aboutwhatever it was that was missing i looked out at the square the faded red and melon plasterwork warm in the sun this extraordinary thing youre a romantic bertie he smiled oh i dont know maybe i just like a good mystery story its the ultimate mystery isnt it people not who done it who they are of course youre one of the done it people you and your friends at the questura somebody done him in well yes but who was he thats what i want to know heres a man ive known forwell if i did anyway who wants to know his doctor and it turns out i didnt sometimes i think were all little mysteries whirling around he moved his finger in a circle and none of us has the faintest clue about the other think of it gianni in love i didnt know he was capable of it but i suppose he was then murdered what could he have done to make somebody want to do that thats what theyre trying to find out are they well good luck cavallini couldnt catch a fly he shook his head and you such nonsense youd be better off getting grace out of here mooning about with mimi and celia and probably getting sloshed if i know my celia talk about the bad penny turning up oh i know he said seeing my look her hearts broken but it so happens i dont believe in broken hearts he peered over his glasses im not that romantic what she needs is a change but here you are playing father brown what a world how do you know cavallini i had to report during the warall the neutrals ive told you this all present and accounted for you know makework actually he was nice about ithed come to me of course that was right up his street hes a policeman who likes a canal view maybe hes better than you think hes talked to everybody ive seen the reports oh ive heard the poor servants over and over i suppose one conked gianni on the head in a fit of pique he cant be serious hes just being thorough the house the hospital hes doing the patients now hell probably get around to you any day i said teasing as a suspect i smiled as someone who knew him but why should it be anyone who knew him a thief wouldnt because it wasnt robbery he still had his money on him his watch really bertie said then looked over at me what else all we know is what it wasnt and if it wasnt robbery then it was about him somehow who he was i fiddled with my coffee cup your little mystery we need to know more about him such as anything paolo for instance tell me about paolo oh were back to paolo but he didnt count for anything awful thing to say isnt it but he didnt simply didnt matter but gianni was upset when he died everyone says so i said trying it out do they bertie looked away thinking i suppose he was family after all that was important to him probably more than paolo was really but now that you mention it he did take it hard went all quiet and monkish for a while but they do that here so they were close only in the sense of paolos being there all the timewere talking about the early days now he was always around you know at the beach parties whatever like a puppy you said yes whatever gianni wanted hed fetch it it was like that but he was the older brother well whats there to that im an only child and ive always been sociable anyway he didnt seem to mind he looked up to gianni he reached over to the cigarettes on the cafe table and took one out is that what you want to know i cant think why so gianni was distressed when paolo died well yes bertie said striking the match and cupping it at the end of the cigarette why wouldnt he be awful way to go a crash like that so young and so typical i must say so careless although of course one didnt say it you know there are rumors that it wasnt an accident bertie looked at me through the smoke not saying anything that he was killed by partisans and and if he was there might be a political angle to this murder too giannis murder oh both now very il gazzettino of you is that the line youre taking down at the questura did he ever say anything to you about paolos death no he didnt bertie said tapping the end of his cigarette his voice prickly and if he had i wouldnt have listened i dont listen to rumors either political angle i dont listen and i dont know all i want is to be left alone i have no politics none im the most neutral man in venice and its very wrong of you to go on about it badgering people even cavallini didnt do that and that was during the war i wasnt asking about your politics i was asking about giannis i said quietly he leaned his head back reprimanded or surprised at his own reaction well how would i know he said because you do i said looking at him he made a face peevish well as a matter of fact i dont oh adam what politics gianni didnt have any politics he just blew with the wind we all did the only party he ever cared about was the maglione family that was his politics his brother worked for the germans do you know that i nodded and so did gianni he looked away then put out his cigarette and picked up his hat from the table im sorry to hear that he said finally but its got nothing to do with me he lifted a finger and its got nothing to do with you either watch you dont make a mess of things all this huffing and puffing shall i tell you something you will never understand this society this isnt even italy its venice nothing has been real here since napoleon nothing but it happened anyway he worked for the germans he was killed it happened not where i live he stood putting on his hat and looking out onto the square you see this its like a jewel box beautiful and nothing gets in and youre the jewel i suppose he smiled you could do worse anyway its what i like just the way it is as far as im concerned paolo was a slowwitted boy who drove too fast gianni was a perfectly respectable man who gave the most boring sunday lunches you can imagine once would do it and thats all if they werent i dont want to hear it politics murk you want to make everything murky well i dont not here giannis papers took no time at all his businesses were all in the hands of managers and giulia his heir had already been to their offices looking through the accounts i thought it could be someone afraid of being caught everybody took a little during the war to survive but not enough to kill how much was that i wondered but let it drop not really interested in the businesses anyway but the personal papers were disappointing tooa neat drawerful of bank statements and house accounts another of official documents birth death and accreditation crowded with elaborate seals some hospital paperwork a few letters none revealing a small pile of receipts a program from la fenice clipped articles from professional journals put aside for a rainy day a blameless life anybodys we sat at the big mahogany desk in the library a dark room that backed onto a side calle away from the canal giulia had turned on the desk lamp making the polished wood gleam the house was as perfectly waxed and still as it had been after the funeral maybe the way it would always be now a convent quiet but did he keep everything here i said rummaging through the deep bottom drawer yes i think so and the albums over there on the shelf where i found the pictures for your mother maybe you should see the rest what are you looking for i dont know him people he knew theres an address book she said bringing it over for a few minutes we looked at it together flipping pages thats a patient that one she said and so i assumed were the others and friends and dinner partners and tradesmen all italian but what had i expected extension numbers at the villa raspelli checkmarks and combination letters a coded secret life i closed the book any diaries anything like that she shook her head no only the maglione books from the old days she pointed to a shelf behind her scrapbooks and oddshaped journals some bound in leather others in gatheredtogether yellowing folios a few boxes meant to look like books for stacks of letters bound with ribbon they kept everything for their history it must have stopped with him i closed the drawer well my uncle did the notes i remember him writing my father was too busy for that but letters there must be some letters your mother no they never wrote or theyre gone she looked over at me beforei never thought about it they didnt love each other maybe thats why we looked at the photo albumsstiffly posed grandparents then the maglione childhood gianni and paolo in sailor suits the usual then the book from which she must have got my mothers picturessunny days on the lido in wet wool bathing suits groups lolling in front of changing cabanas which is your mother they didnt meet till later look luca before he became a priest a plump boy with a grin years from piety i dont know this one standing next to gianni thats my father i said oh she looked up at me yes i see it now its strange our parents together like the same family but not the same my father was squinting into the sun but both of them were smiling a day at the beach a casual snapshot no hint at all of anything to come their lives twisted together but wheres paolo he was always taking the picture i think she said smiling no here the tennis one my father didnt like tennis so maybe it was his turn with the camera i took the picture out of the album and brought it nearer looking at it closely no hint here eitherno order of rome no politics none of berties murk he was standing against the net in tennis flannels and a white sweater with a chevron neck his arm draped over the shoulder of another player both of them holding their rackets at their hips its sad to look at them giulia said moving away everyone so happy does that make sense i nodded what was he like paolo uno vitaiolo you know always for the pleasure tennis those cars of course when i was a child i thought this was wonderful another child you know and then and then i wasnt a child anymore she turned facing me he was a fascist youre surprised i say that i know today no fascists we were all in the resistance i think we even believe it how do you mean fascist fascist he liked mussolini he liked the parades dressing up all of that he was on committeesyou know they liked him because of his name of course no one listened to him but it made him feel important to go to meetings and after the tennis so not so serioushow could paolo be serious and then its the war and everythings serious hes too foolish to see what is happening to us that its a catastrophe he thinks the king will save us make peace with the english king because hes a king too imagine the foolishness of it well and after that after that the germans and paolo he supports the salo government against the cln the partisans it interests you italian politics it confuses me yes she said but at the end its not difficult if youre with salo youre with the germans so paolo was too sometimes i think it was good that he died before it was a disgrace to the family even for my father it was too much paolo was his brother so thats something sacred to him but it wasnt the same between them the germans thats something my father would never forgive i looked over at her expecting irony but she seemed utterly sincere guileless they had a fight a distance maybe a fight i dont know i was at school and of course i wouldnt speak to paolo then you know the students the way we felti was too angry with him maybe ashamed too my own family so i didnt speak she came back to the desk and looked down at the picture and then after he died i remembered him like this when he was so nice my father too i think so quiet days like that you know whatever he did still a brother what about your father his politics she smiled was he this was he that nothinghe wanted to survive them thats what he used to tell me stay out of it keep your head down so of course we would quarrel you know at that age he was afraid i think that i would get involved in the resistance so many of the students did you no i wanted to of course everybody did but in the endi dont know a coward maybe too much a lady my friend used to say my mothers daughter so maybe she was right but not your fathers oh a little bit i think secretly he admired the resistance too but he was afraid of it for him it was simplethe family venice the churchwell maybe that was for my mother he believed in those things and what was the resistance maybe a threat something else to survive so he kept his head down no sides she turned at a soft rap on the door an even quieter opening ah maria she said thank you not surprised the maid in a starched linen collar and apron carried a coffee tray to the table in front of the reading chairs the cups and pot lay on a white doily also starched as if it had been meant to match her uniform shy smiles and murmurs in italian part of the ceremony of getting the tray on the table ill pour shall i giulia said at once dismissing maria and taking up the pot in her hand poised her mothers daughter i sat on the other side of the low table it was the funeral all over again nothing extra everything as it should be sure of its own taste even her dress i noticed was suitable black without any purple frills a discreet mourningmourning because i had held his head under now we were drinking coffee polite but it must have been hard in the war not taking sides i said she took a sip then held the cup in her hand thinking of course in the end you do its your country i didnt have the courage maybe but i had money so i helped with that we were alike that way keep your head down but do it anyway no sides but he helped the partisans he told you that maybe as plausibly as hed told it on the fondamenta but why she shook her head then smiled well i didnt tell him about the money either but i know he made it a question of medical ethicswhats the right thing to do you know they do this in the law school too so its good training for me but this is his way of telling me a man is brought in with a gunshot wound a man you know the law says you must report all such wounds but you know that the only way he could have been shot is in the fighting a partisan if you report it the government will kill him if you dont maybe it goes badly for you for helping a traitor the man begs youhelp me dont give me up what do you do and what did he do i said quietly we agreed that the first obligation must be to save the man even if hes a traitor but if the government itself is illegal and who decides that yes who you see how it goes on he liked these questions well i liked them so he would ask and how did it end this one what did he do oh he said you can make it complicated if you like but the simple fact is if you know a man you cant give him up so i know he didnt i put down my cup what if you gave up someone else instead someone else to save the first your friend if you gave up someone in his place she looked at me for a second then down at her cup what makes you ask this its a question he once asked me and you think she said stirring her cup still not looking up this was his way of telling you something for a minute we were quiet still enough to hear the clock do you think he did that she said finally sitting up straight braced i hesitated then sat back moving away from it i think it was just a question its a terrible thing yes why would he ask that as a moral dilemma maybe an impossible choice but you cant choose someones death she was looking at me now her face longer more severe like her mothers again thats murder sure admitting no exceptions i said nothing kept quiet by her stare then her face began to change no longer as properly arranged as the tray and i saw that she was distressed waiting for me to say something he wouldnt do that she said you knew him do you think he would do that i think it was just a question then why something may have put it in his mind something that actually happened the story about the partisanwhen did he tell you that when last year she said composed again interested after the war i said confused no i mean the year before fortyfour when he came to see me i remember he told me at lunch when was this exactly autumn october maybe why did it come up i mean why do you think he told you she smiled a little shaking her head maybe to make me like him always we were arguing then so maybe this was his way of saying you see papas not so bad im on the right side too but he never actually said hed done this no but that wasnt his way he never talked about himself maybe he thought it wasnt dignified he was private a maglione my mother was like that too secretive no private she said making a distinction to herself i never knew what he was thinking but what does a child know all those years here we are in this house a family and i never knew she leaned forward placing the cup on the tray maybe a little secretive a doctor has to be you learn that you dont talk about your patients i used to ask him things and hed say thats not my secret to tell always somebody elses secret i wont tell id say and hed wag his finger like this she said demonstrating so that i looked up seeing gianni you know the old saying she lowered her voice becoming him two people can keep a secret if one of them is dead she paused so i didnt ask and then it turned out he must have had one of his own what do you mean he was murdered do you know why no so its still his secret i sat back looking around the room to avoid her gaze well its safe here theres nothing else files at the hospital his real life was there i think she said her voice wistful not here there was an awkward pause i should go i said getting up maybe therell be something in the patient files thats next he seems to have erased himself everywhere else yes he was good at that he didnt like to keep things i smiled glancing around the old library virtually an archive oh this was paolo poor paolo papa erased him too threw out his books you know he was always writing in those books appunti for the family history and papa said they were rubbish well what did he expect mazzini from paolo but you know now it just stops unless i write it i suppose she said her voice diffident as if she were talking to herself suddenly alone wait paolo kept notebooks and your father threw them out not all just the ones with his activities what will people think later he said it was an embarrassment for him but where are they she gestured toward the shelves paolo kept them here she looked at me puzzled it was his house yes i forgot but you all lived here of course the family all during the time they yes there was an agreementno political talk at dinner i imagined them sitting at the starched table private talking politely each one whirling in his own mystery can i see them yes of course she said walking over to the shelf im sorry i thought my fathers papers it didnt occur to me these are paolos she ran her hand along a line of leatherbound spines the books werent histories so much as diaries the kind a fourteenyearold might write full of underlinings and exclamation marks the world a theater with himself luckily at center stage even with my poor italian i could understand giannis reluctance to have them fill the family librarys shelves but here they were not all of them thrown out why not i skimmed through a few trying to get a sense of why these had survived innocuous but here was mussolini a trip to rome with friends to hear a speech dinner afterward at the edena time capsule mix not embarrassed here at any rate by the fascism or paolos comments the speech had been inspiring rome itself a new city a nightclub after dinner had featured somalian dancers venice now seemed a backwater dowdy i flipped pages less exalted excursionsa drive to asolo dinner in a villa the maglione history now mostly idle days committee meetings just as giulia had said recording it all for posterity the war somber fourteenyearolds thoughts on what it would mean the albanian fiasco the allies in sicily and then it stopped gaps here and there before then nothing after a war with no germans at all but why the earlier gaps what else had gianni culled out giulia had been hovering next to me reading as i flipped no doubt taking it all in more quickly but what do you see she said i dont know nothing i guess can i borrow these just the last few you want to read them i want to see where the gaps are look here for instance he just ripped the pages out so why here and not there but before she could answer there was another rap on the door and this time maria was carrying an old telephone with a long cord her eyes wide with apprehension polizia she whispered pointing to me then plugged the cord into a jack behind the desk had cavallini tracked me here i picked up the phone and then must have registered the stunned dismay i felt as he spoke because when i hung up giulia said my god what is it whats happened cavallini i said my own voice an echo hollow theyve arrested somebody for the murder chapter thirteen the questura was like giannis hospitalfunctional even ordinary inside cavallinis office could have been anywhere a room with a desk and a phone and pale green institutional walls there was a large map of the lagoon along with a few photographs of cavallini shaking hands with various officials but it still felt scarcely inhabited as if he had just moved in waiting for a new paint job today at least it was crowded with peopleassistants delivering telephone messages two policemen standing near the door waiting for orders and a tall man in a suit conferring with cavallini stroking his chin in thought i saw all this in a blur my mind still numb with dread signor miller cavallini said smiling good my superior wants to meet you the tall man turned to me i have told him how it started with you we shook hands with a few polite words in italian then he rattled off something to cavallini so everyone is very pleased cavallini said i thank you for this he put his hand on the beige folder rosas file of course its a question of police work too he said directing this to the tall man who smiled blankly clearly not following the one helps the other una collaborazione at this the other man nodded said something more in italian and left dipping his head toward me almost a bow as he went out the door the two waiting policemen followed him you see very pleased so again i thank you but who did you arrest i said moretti he said patting the file again rosa shows us where to look and we find him i leaned forward holding the desk but hes dead you mean he didnt die yes he died thats ita vengeance killing the son you think morettis son killed gianni why but signor miller its as you say the connection is the house what happened there i didnt know this but once you look but rosa never said no but shes not a policeman you know he said with a little smile almost smug still she suspects and shes right one man in that house was in hospital his doctor maglione he held up a light blue folder in illustration and maglione is working with the ss she makes this connection but he was released days before they so she goes to see his son she is an old friend of the father how long was the father in hospital when did he leave did the boy see himalso carlo like the father and of course he wants to know why and she tells him she suspects maglione of betraying his father and what happens he becomes agitato its my fault he tells her i killed him why because he went to the house so maybe they followed him and rosa tells him no you were there before people never followed you he was a courier for them you see imagine using a child that way a communist of course the boy too no he tells her this time he was also bringing medicine for his father from maglione a trap so now its his fault and rosa tells him its foolishnesshe cant blame himself for this they already knew somehow but shes troubled she hadnt known about the medicine you see how do you know all this some from him some from her so she leaves he said picking up the story and hes still agitato an unstable boy anyway according to the neighbors police work collecting gossip like a noose the fathers dead and hes to blame no somebody else somebody still alive this is a boy who worked with the partisans someone who acts what could be more natural so he had a motive i said but that doesnt a strong motive very strong its as you predicteda political crime but also a personal one he walked out from behind the desk a courtroom gesture enjoying himself of course were hoping for a confession and its possible this kind of caseso much remorse ive seen it before its a kind of relief for them he glanced at me amused signor miller such a face were police not ss we hope for a confession we dont torture we ask questions and if he doesnt confess cavallini shrugged its still a very strong case he has no alibi no i said weakly sitting down to hear the rest no the night of the murder where is he out for a walk in that weather you remember that evening the rain and where did he walk around along the riva then hes not sure where who walks like that in venice tourists no one saw him no one then the cine except the ticket girl doesnt remember that doesnt necessarily no not necessarily he said looking at me so you act the defense good we need to think of everything but no one sees him thats the point so his word only next his profession he works on one of the delivery boats from the stazione marittima not just to venice also the outer islands so familiar with the lagoon he paused even in fog he sat on the edge of the desk and after the murder what does he do we have witnesses to this his behavior drunk in the bar he goes to with the newspaper he keeps reading it and drinking for once justice he sayswe have a witness to this what are you talking about the witness says he deserved it he deserved it the boy says a toast to justice and then what tears unstable you see more than one saw this the newspaper i said almost to myself so this was after the body was found not before cavallini looked at me uncomfortable for a second weighing this then decided to ignore it yes after it was found celebrating but why would he do that draw attention that way why would he be happy they found the body wouldnt it be better for him if they never found it cavallini sat back a twitch of annoyance in the corner of his mouth nevertheless that is what he said a toast to justice of course really to himself we have witnesses to this he said again then paused its not always the logic that rules the head in these cases a boy who blames himself then who killsyoure surprised he gives himself away it just doesnt make sense but it will dont worry we will make a case i looked up at him held together by nothing except his will but convincing a solution to everything delivered by cavallini to a grateful force youre troubled he said i shrugged not knowing what to say swirling again a case any defense lawyer could pick apart but would he who was the defense what were trials like here it wasnt america maybe a different set of priorities with carlo moretti whoever he was satisfying all of them giannis killer but why cavallini said it was you yourself who suggested the motive you said it would be someone exactly like him and it is its just i stopped my heart sinking someone exactly like him you yourself suggested it he waited frowning a little surprised now at my reluctance and why should i be its justyou know to prove it in court youll have to prove that gianni did betray them an informer all of that itll have to come out ah cavallini said i see but signor miller its a case of his murder but can you prove it about gianni what id wanted in the first place just to know well as to that we only have to prove that moretti believed it a doctor prescribes medicine the boy delivers it his father is betrayed because he is followed perhaps not but he believes it so he acts he paused dr magliones reputation need not be in question only moretti questioned it he met my eyes an explanation that was also a bargain perfect in every way justice done a familys honor held intact a promotion for him a kindness to giulia to my mother gianni a victim like paolo yes i said thinking and what if he was wrongif we were wrong how do you mean for the sake of argument i said getting up what if gianni didnt do it it explains the gap he treats moretti he releases moretti nothing happens a weeklonger ten days he prescribes medicine why if he wanted to betray moretti why not do it earlier why wait what if the son is wrong what if gianni never meant the father harm cavallini got up and walked back behind the desk then he killed him for nothing another pause signor miller i am confused do you think dr maglione was innocent after all it was you he let the words drift his eyes simply curious the way theyd been at the water entrance asking about the boat no no i said quickly but if we cant prove it then its very difficult to prove the motive well thats for the lawyers he said dismissing this and you forget there is still the confession would that satisfy you he smiled again a kind of tease it was like this in germany always the proof not always i said but in capital cases i stopped what happens in italy to the boy if hes guilty execution i looked down suddenly winded the air rushing out of me execution how hanging shooting an innocent boy worse than murder i caught my breath aware of cavallinis stare then we have to be sure dont worry signor miller we will be ah again he said as the telephone rang all morning its like this excuse me a complaint hed make later to his longfaced wife a man of importance i picked up morettis blue hospital folder and glanced at the form while cavallini talked a fake name but presumably him date of admission release address and personal information also presumably fake an attached chart with what looked to be blood pressure and temperature readings diagnosis and report in longhand giannis familiar signature on the bottom the attending nurse blood type everything except what had happened iniezione antitetanica injection against tetanus well there would be still looking for the proof cavallini said hanging up this is him how did you know the name the boy told us he said almost amused whats ferita puntura bullet wound no ferita da pallottola puntura is puncture its very close but not the same not reported i held the folder for a few seconds taking this in you dont report someone you know and he hadnt unless he had lied to giulia a bullet would have to be reported to the police you know cavallini said even now its the law and if you dont usually its a question of the medical license then under the germans who knows so he would have reported it to his friends in the ss but if he told the ss why falsify the police report it came to the same thing in those days didnt it cavallini nodded stiffly not sure whether to be offended if it was a bullet he said it had to be how else would he know moretti was a partisan what does the son say this is important if he knew it was a bullet wound and knew gianni didnt report it hed think gianni was helping plant any doubt some confused opening morettis son might use why would he think gianni betrayed him he didnt until you and rosa suggested it cavallini said calmly not even raising his voice no louder than a door closing i felt blood draining from my face cavallini sighed signor miller how you worry what if what if why not a simple answer a man betrays his victim is avenged it has happened a million times before what do you want to prove that the boy is innocent i looked up the inescapable other questionthen who is guilty i dropped the folder on the desk and walked over to the window below in the rio san lorenzo a freight boat passed loaded with bottles maybe a boat just like young morettis someone who knew the lagoon even in fog i just dont understand why he didnt report the bullet wound its a detail yes i mean it would be terrible if we were wrong yes cavallini said and for morettis son he murdered a man for this imagine if it was a mistake i turned my stomach churning again but there was no sense of accusation in his voice no sense that it even mattered morettis son had murdered gianni the rest was details dont worry signor miller he said confident we will learn everything now that we have him he flipped open the folder on his desk as if having it there were proof something tangible is that him i said nodding at the photo on top yes the usual bad picture so dark he shook his head our police photographer but we cant let him go his wife is he handed me the photograph wild eyes and uncombed hair the scowl of a mug shot guilty just being there but something more exactly the same eyes the shape of the nose i imagined the hair brushed over the face clean and smilingthe same boy in a vnecked tennis sweater his arm over paolos shoulder the son then so moretti was someone gianni knew but what did it mean someone you knew you wouldnt turn over not in a moral question anyway but someone had i started to speak then caught the sound in my throat would it make it worse for moretti another connection for cavallini to use against him i looked up to see the inspector watching me hes just a kid i said my voice suddenly distraught i stared again at the picture everyones solution to the crime yes but not a child a man making a legal distinction you know its often like this in police work people like to help catch and then he made a snapping noise with his hands they realize theres also the punishment thats more difficult for them the cold feet you say yes he said still genial sticking his chin out so that for a half second he looked like paolos hero in rome not a joke in the end either he took back the picture hes young yes but think of the crime think how gianni would feel grateful i think for your help before i could answer cavallinis door only half shut swung open and his secretary came in arms held out being pushed by rosa who was screaming in italian ah rosa said spying cavallini moving the secretary aside and wagging her finger theatrically he yelled back but she cut him off flinging her hands now there must have been some physical resistance in the outer office because her cardigan usually wrapped tight seemed a little disheveled and her hair was spilling out of its tidy bun oh you too she said seeing me switching to english what a pair what a pair how can you be part of this give me that she reached over for the beige file cavallini put his hand on it its property of the allies not yours she said and now evidence in a murder case basta what evidence she turned to me you see how they use everything we investigate maglione not some poor boy and now they use that because hes communist anything to discredit the communists where is he i demand to see him hes being questioned he has a lawyer ha picked by the questura wonderful let him pick another then dont worry he will my god what a fool you are always the same the father was a hero the boy was a hero while you werewhat keeping order for the germans and now you want to destroy him take everything he says and twist itno worse everything i say it was to help get maglione why because he has to know she pointed her thumb at me so i help and now you want to use that against an innocent boy shame but then when were you ever ashamed innocent boy cavallini said scornfully yes innocent of course innocent how do you know because i do ah and thats his defense no wonder you came how did you know he was here by the way oh you think maybe someone here told me good start the search a communist in the questura yes that must be it youd better look everywhere under the desks do it to your ownsee how they like it she turned to me you see what theyre trying to do you think this boy killed maglione no he agrees with you cavallini said mischievous hes been trying to convince me the boy is innocent rosa stopped thrown by this but he hasnt cavallini said with a small smile for me be careful what you say here rosa said to me its not justice here politics nothing changes she looked at cavallini when can i see him make a request cavallini said while hes being questioned his lawyer only one hair rosa said to him if you touch one hair she turned to me and youyou know what maglione was theyre the same and now you work with them is that the purpose of your visit cavallini said mockformal to criticize the police rosa raised her head no to warn you oh to warn me i know you what a coward you can be you want to make the communists look bad go ahead but not with this boy you know me too you think i survived that house to let you have morettis son i warn you i will fight you with everything except your own evidence that fights for me evidence can change but not the truth cavallini said pompous actually raising a finger the whole conversation a series of gestures a visible squaring off truth youre a fine one che cosa succede qui a policeman said he had stopped at the door the secretary trailing behind niente niente cavallini said then to rosa this behavior is for the streets not the questura you want to see the prisoner make a request the prisoner hes formally charged hes answering questions cavallini said not answering hers so then wait for his lawyer already sent for already sent for she said anticipating him tell him to hurry cavallini said smiling again we are expecting a confession any minute bah rosa said flinging her hand there was a noise in the outer officemore people including the man id met earlier cavallinis boss when i looked at cavallini i caught a flicker of anxiety a worry perhaps that hed be blamed for the commotion come on rosa i said taking her arm to my relief she nodded and moved with me to the door then turned one last time to face cavallini remember she said not one hair outside on the fondamenta she stopped for a second to look across the canal to san lorenzo i gave her a cigarette a peace offering surprised to find my hand shaking still rattled i didnt know i started but she cut me off with a wave theyre going to charge him no theyre not they cant prove anything he didnt do it trying it out wanting to believe it myself youre so sure she said looking up at me but not waiting for an answer anyway when did they need proof this bunch as we neared the bridge claudia ran toward us from the calle side of the building glancing nervously at the police guards in front she was clutching her open coat as if shed left too quickly to button it thank god youre all right she said touching my arm yes fine what cavallini called looking for you he said they arrested somebody she looked again at the questura its okay calm down they didnt arrest me i said trying to make a joke of it and signal her at the same time meet rosa the introductions were offhand not much more than an appraising glance each of them too distracted to be interested in the other but who a boy his father was in the house with the partisans but how can they think hes got a motive i said quickly looking at her and he cant explain himself a motive yes we did that for him rosa said grimly he never even thought about maglione until i talked to him so now its our fault but he didnt do it i said yes and whos in there rosa said jerking her thumb toward the building what are you going to do claudia said quietly were going to find out who did do it i said to rosa ignoring claudias stare but who a phantom a better story no im finished with this business look how it is already they dont want anyone else hes perfect for them so now the lawyers will have to save him not the file clerk she said pointing to herself help me do what find out what happened none of it makes sense gianni faked a medical report why risked his license for moretti maybe saved his life does that sound like gianni to you anythings possible she dropped some ashes and rubbed them with her shoe tell me about moretti was he a communist a patriot and a friend of giannis brother she looked at me not surprised to hear it but surprised i knew i saw an old picture but he was a communist she shrugged many came from good families with them a matter of conviction was he involvedwhen paolo was killed she pulled on the cigarette saying nothing rosa dont ask me this for chrissake why not it was during the war what does it matter now it would matter to the son hes already heard enough let it go its the past why it would make him a hero wouldnt it a hero do you know what that meant in that kind of war its not the army everything is permitted its good to lie to kill and then its over and its the opposite yes claudia said unexpectedly rosa looked at her not sure how to respond then back at me im not going to tell his son all right tell me she dropped the cigarette and took a few steps toward the canal wrapping her sweater tighter paolo was a fool but he was careful maybe people were careful for him so to get him they had to trick him moretti knew himan old friend as you say he set him up you want to know the details whats the difference he betrayed him he helped to kill him paolo trusted him so it started with him then why would gianni help him he didnt know who was going to tell him moretti but thats right he kills his old friend and then lies to the brother to save himself not the way a hero acts i told you it was that kind of war anything was right who else killed him who was also in the housebesides moretti also in the house just one she said looking straight at me i held her eyes for a second then dropped my gaze to the pavement thinking so theres no other connection and moretti leaves the hospital and nothing happens gianni helps him a wonderful man but it has to be him somehow well now theres a life at stake i have to help the lawyers i leave the doctor to you why fake the report i said moving absentmindedly in a small circle start with that you start i have to go now wait what about the attending nurse i just remembered she signed the report too so she must know something please i need someone who can talk to her in italian rosa was quiet for a minute shifting on her bad leg physically wavering i speak italian claudia said breaking the silence rosa looked at her then nodded brava she said starting to move away you talk for him rosa claudia glared at me ill talk to the nurse she said her words deliberate like a hand on my arm let her go maybe we can get him out rosa said gesturing at the questura before they charge him without even looking at us she headed for the corner barely limping now in a hurry why did you do that she would have stayed if yes claudia said and then what more detectives you dont want her help not now the police have somebody so why are you still looking thats what theyll think why is he doing this and then they look at you but rosa doesnt you think shes your friend but nobodys your friend now the police her its the same one slip thats what you told me at least its over with cavallini this business he doesnt need a partner anymore i nodded reluctant no i have to do it without him no you have to stop they have somebody now what reason can there be for you but i was only half listening thinking of cavallini strutting behind his desk chest puffed out we cant just walk away we cant let this boy she reached up touching my arm yes walk away before its too late i looked at her surprised you dont mean that i said quietly you cant she turned her head letting her hand drop claudia what happened with gianni that was one thing but thistheyll hang him but they cant prove he did it we know they cant prove it they may not have to they might convict him anyway theyll try they wont want to admit they made a mistake not now they just solved the case she looked down at her foot moving it something to do while she took this in so now we have what we wanted she said finally her voice distant a perfect alibi she looked at me better than the party even better than that now someone else did it she walked away toward the canal until you show them he didnt claudia he could die i stopped caught by the sound of some policemen coming out of the door behind us their shoes clumping on the pavement voices loud claudia didnt turn just kept staring down at the canal water as if not moving would make her invisible when we heard them cross the bridge to san lorenzo she spoke without raising her head so it gets worse she said another one unless we help him and then what then who did it and now you want me to help you what catch myself well find them someone else someone else she repeated who could have done it another possibility just so long as its not him we need to make a story something so close to what really happened that they can believe it just make a little change the way gianni did remember walking along the fondamenta making the truce ah now like gianni she said her voice tight i looked at her then let it go but we have to know what really happened she turned from the water we already know what really happened i mean at the safe house its in cavallinis head now its too late to use anything else he thinks moretti has a motive but who else would and the nurse is going to tell you a piece anyway if i can talk to her at the hospital claudia didnt even bother to translate on my own i might have managed some kind of conversation helped by gestures but claudia and the duty nurse spoke in a rush that swept me aside unable to pick up even the occasional word it was easier just to lean against the glass front of the nurses station and watch them speak i thought of moretti lying upstairs with his puncture wound the nurse would have had to know now this one was writing something down motioning with one hand giving directions the one we want just retired claudia said in the high gothic hall a great friend of magliones he was that kind of man with the nurses i dont know i never thought so but then so much else had been wrong and who sleeps with retired nurses young nurses yes so maybe its just this ones idea she nodded back toward the nurses station she thinks they were lovers because he helped her find a place to livewhat else could it be after all those years together devoted to him what does she get two rooms in castello put away somewhere so he can marry his american typical the man does as he likes while the woman she stopped shaking her head and maybe she thinks the nurse didnt like it who would have a better reason to kill him she reads magazines we had left the hospital and were walking across the campo past the equestrian statue and who dumped him in the lagoon shes not that far still with the romance they worked together for years and not a hint only now when shes old and he helps her and this one believes that were there rumorsother nurses of course not he was a saint claudia said her mouth turned down a saint a savior of men yes she said still grim except my father we followed the directions through several back calles of hanging wash to a house whose plaster front had peeled off in patches leaving irregular pockets of dark brick like dalmation spots anna della croce was on the second floor up a staircase that smelled of cat and listed to one side when we rang the bell we could hear a series of locks being turned as if the room had been barricaded against the rest of the sagging house then the creak of the door a pair of eyes peering into the stairwell it was only after claudia mentioned giannis name that the door swung open for a second no one said anything adjusting to the light then claudias eyes widened and her whole body went rigid with surprise voi she said softly the woman looked at her wary again che cosa volete what is it i said to claudia its the same nurse the one with my father look she has no idea no memory at all im someone new to her she watched them take me away but she never saw me before it meant nothing youre scaring her speak italian the woman had drawn closer to the door stepping slightly behind it as if it were a shield imagine nothing to her claudia said her voice almost dreamy claudia i said touching her shoulder ask her about gianni she looked at me coming back then smiled wryly yes thats right something shed remember scusi she said turning to the woman reassuring her with a spurt of italian that i couldnt follow but that got us through the door we went into a tidy small room filled with porcelain figurines claudia still talking we had gotten the address from the hospital she was so nice to see us it had been a tragedy about gianni and then i lost the thread again i was given a straightbacked chair with upraised arms and a velvetcovered seat formal the kind thats kept for visiting priests the nurse sat primly on the edge of the daybed a severelooking woman in her sixties who still seemed to be wearing a starched uniform her eyes sharp and suspicious even now on the lookout for sloppily made bed corners i could see that she would never have spoken to me but claudia another woman had somehow put her at ease tea was made an excuse for small talk to find out why we had come whether we could be trusted this time claudia did translate first paraphrasing their conversation then finally with nearly simultaneous answers so that it felt as if we were all really talking shes worried about her pension but i told her its to solve the murder so thats different because he was a saint she nodded the best man she ever knew would this hurt his reputation and i said no now everyone would admire him for this so it was a bullet wound yes she helped him remove it just the two of them he said he would take the responsibilityhe didnt want her to get in any trouble always thinking of others you see but of course she wanted to help him so they took out the bullet and cleaned the wound and then she dressed it so no one else would know not even the other nurses then they made out the report had he done anything like this before no but he knew the man a family friend and dr maglione told her i cant refuse him i have to help but no one has to know he came into the hospital with a bullet wound and no one else knew this involved a longer answer filled with what sounded like medical details you couldnt tell the wound was shallow not much blood but of course the bullet had to be taken out maglione saw him right awayand after all people knew was a bandage except for anna she said nodding to the nurse why would moretti take the risk i said to myself if it wasnt serious going to a hospital the bullet still has to come out you need a doctor and this one he knows she says they were friendsmaglione liked to talk to him about what a shrug she assumes old times they hadnt seen each other in years no they wouldnt have but the risk the nurse was shaking her head at the memory of it she was worried the whole time but with him it was always the patient when he found out moretti had left he said it was too soon it needed more time but he discharged him no he left in the night like a thief in the night hunching her shoulders stealthy because he was so grateful the germans came one day and he saw that it was a risk for maglione how long before someone found out so he left in the night he didnt wait but the medical report they had to say discharged what else escape then everything would come out so he was discharged and she signed it and that was the end until now i went over to the window a view across the calle to another window shuttered so gianni couldnt have had him followed i said wrong about this too moretti had gone without giannis even knowing then the report had been faked to protect him all witnessed by a sharpeyed nurse theres no doubt about this any of it you dont want me to ask her that shed be offended the germans who were theresoldiers or ss ss they were looking for jews and did they find any claudia looked at me but translated the nurse nodded lowering her head there was nothing they could do the germans knew grini maybe the informer that was his specialty hospitals and mental homes but he wasnt there that day no but they knew dr maglione was helpless he used to say the germans are like wild animals you have to be careful with them if you frighten them theyll bite you cant get too close for a minute no one said anything the only sound in the room a teacup clinking on its saucer anything else claudia said i shook my head i thought thered be something something shed seen oh and shed tell you she sees what she wants to see she started again in italian calm almost in a monotone so the nurses reaction seemed all the more abrupt a shocked expression head jerked back what i said i told her someone said gianni helped the ss that he pointed out jews claudia she was there wasnt she see what she says a flood of words angry i waited watching claudia whoever said that it must be his imagination the doctor would never do that she might not have seen it i said quickly she saw everything else its not the same i said he wouldnt want her to see that i saw it the nurse still angry was looking from one of us to the other listening to the volley in a foreign language shed never admit it now anyway ask her when this was when the germans came claudia said something in italian october fourth when claudia and her father were taken when moretti was being protected just as everyone had said exact an excellent witness the story everyone agreed on except for the nod i looked at claudia the other witness i moved in the chair stuck why would the nurse lie the fake report had become a badge of honor her war story helping gianni do the right thing so we had to assume he had she said something in italian her eyes on me she wants to know how you knew about the bullet wound tell her gianni told me ah the nurse said i told her youre the american womans son claudia said explaining the nurse was taking me in now somebody in giannis world not just a foreign voice she wants to know if she can talk about this now its no longer a secret not anymore better tell her the police might ask no surprises they both got up as they spoke the meeting over she wants to know who did it i shrugged the police think young moretti the nurse turned to me speaking italian forgetting for a second to go through claudia she says why would they think that dr maglione saved his fathers life tell her we dont think he did it either thats why we came i said one more blurred halflie i looked around at the shelves of knickknacks the rooms he had helped her find not enough to buy anyones silence even assuming there was silence to buy and why would there be she still thought he was a hero and shed been there are you finished claudia said i nodded feeling deflated finished with no next place to go and still no way to connect gianni to the house we said goodbye a thousand thanks most of it by rote my mind elsewhere then claudia spoke in italian and the nurse stopped taken aback i said to her do you know you look familiar to me claudia said what are you doing leave it claudias eyes flashed i want her to remember i rememberwhy shouldnt she the nurse studied her for another minute then shook her head she says maybe from the hospital so many people come and go its hard to keep track she looked down her lips in a forced half smile so many people come and go and id know her face anywhere we started for the door the nurse still talking she says its like that in the hospital claudia said airy now the nurse prattling so many people after a while you dont notice she looked at me so thats all it meant for her maybe she wasnt there i said right then i mean no she was in the ward or do you think its my imagination too could it have been a question so faint it was almost unnoticeable like a hairline crack in porcelain do you yes it must be the doctor would never do that she said playing the nurse again she turned to her and said something in italian without translating but it must have been asking whether she was sure baiting her because the nurse squinted at claudias face again then shook her head claudia we didnt come here for that no to make sure he did something else its not enough what he did but maybe he didnt even do that she didnt see it so how do you know asking something else her voice angry all of it still alive to her not yet just a white splotch of skin real more accurate than memory because you said so i said calmly she turned away embarrassed so that my eyes went to the nurse at the door watching us closely maybe the way shed watched things in the ward not really understanding what they meant people coming and going by the way i said ask her if she was there when the son came for the medicine what medicine the nurse said that he sent to moretti why would he send medicine to moretti there was no infection i looked at claudia my head suddenly light for pain maybe she brushed this away with her hand then in the war who had such medicine there wasnt even enough for the ones who were suffering moretti hadnt had any in the hospitalonly at first to take out the bullet after that no he didnt need any but dr maglione sent him some claudia said to her the boy said so no its impossible he didnt need medicine he didnt need medicine i said wanting to be sure no i told you anyway how could dr maglione do this the man left in the night dr maglione didnt know where he was no i said following the thought right to the house but his son did chapter fourteen carlo moretti may have been legally adult but he looked years younger smooth and wideeyed barely adolescent features that must have given him a useful innocence in his courier days now they made him seem childlike a frightened boy waiting to be taken home rosa was finally allowed to see him that evening and cavallini improbably allowed me to go with her maybe as a kind of unofficial watchdog for the questura she had brought the new lawyer and most of the time was spent going over what the police had said to him and what hed replied the lawyer took notes the boy glanced at me from time to time but his attitude was more bewildered than suspiciousi was no more surprising than anything else that had happened no the police had not used any force just questions had they promised him anything no but they said a confession meant a more lenient sentence if it came early before physical evidence was collected prints bloodstains they wanted to know about his boat given giannis probable route on foot moretti must already have had it waiting where theyre looking for witnesses rosa said to put you on that boat but surely there was someone who could verify that you hadnt taken one out the lawyer said you couldnt just take a boat no it was easy enough they werent guarded at night if you did it carefully you could get out to the lagoon and no one would know i looked away did they ask you whether he was dead when you put him in i said rosa and the lawyer turned to me cause of death i said the official cause was drowning how do you know this the lawyer said beginning to write on his notepad cavallini told me when i identified the body check the coroners report yes the lawyer said its an interesting technicality maybe useful the actual cause what difference does it make moretti said his voice sullen listen to me rosa said everything makes a difference its going to be all right no its not he said looking down weve found a witness she said for that night you should have told me the lawyer said surprised the man with the umbrella rosa said still looking directly at carlo you remember he offered you an umbrella when you were walking in front of the londra palace by the statue of vittorio emanuele the man with the umbrella carlo said numbly not understanding yes he remembers the time exactly how wet you were if you think youll remember him she said tapping her finger on the table he glanced at her in recognition then shook his head it wont make any difference its what you used to saydont get caught once they have you that was different that was the war rosa said moretti shrugged all the answer he could manage talk to him rosa said pointing to the lawyer every detail so he can help to find another technicality moretti said what does it matter to them theyve already decided they want to put me in prison no rosa said suddenly stern a kind of slap they want to kill you thats the punishment he stared at her his face pale all the defiance seeping away then rushing back in a flash of panic as she pushed back her chair and stood so talk to him where are you going he said talk to him now hell tell you what to say ill be back tomorrow she reached over and put her hand on his listen to me you didnt kill your father they did do you think i would let them do this to you he lowered his head and if it was my fault i was in that house too do i blame you i blame them no more just talk to him she placed her hand now on the lawyers shoulder then motioned for me to get up come she said shooing me away with her too many ears the abruptness of it surprised me so my question seemed blurted out did he give you the medicine himself or did someone else moretti looked at me for a second as if he were readjusting a dial going back to an earlier program he did so you knew him no id never met him but i knew my father had been in the hospital so i wasnt surprised he called you himself yes come to the hospital tell your father i have his medicineyou know as if he thought he was at home in bed so i went and he gave me the pills does he have any fever he said no tell him one more week with these as if i knew all about it so i said all right and i took them and that was that and you took them to the safe house next to me i felt rosa stir annoyed that i was going back over this no i didnt know exactly where he was i thought verona but then when he wasnt there i tried the house was he surprised to get the medicine yes he said it was nice of the doctor to worry but he felt fine maybe somebody else could use it it was hard then to get anything even aspirin but there was no label on it so we didnt know what it was for how could we use it no label no thats when i thought you know he knows what my father is he doesnt want it foundto be connected did your father take any yes one to see what it was he said he felt the same it wasnt the medicine that killed him not that way not any way rosa said putting her hand on his arm again are you finished she said to me and then you stayed the night i said still trying to make a picture no never there back to verona not venice not with the curfew i had to leave the house after dark so there was only enough time to get to verona to a safe house there yes and youd done this before many times rosa said he was the best yes carlo said except this time rosa was still angry when we left the questura what are you trying to do make him crazy you can see he blames himself and how do we know they followed him do they come while hes there no the next morning no another day so who knows maybe a tip maybe they already knew then why did gianni send his father medicine he didnt need she looked away stymied a fine thing we did you know a boy who blames himself for one thing sometimes he takes the blame for another ive seen this a confusion in the mind she was quiet for a minute folding her arms across her chest as if she had caught a chill you know that if its true it strengthens cavallinis hand it gives him a case he already has a case thats why its important to know what really happened there if its connected its too many ifs nowtheres no time for that just inventing witnesses why not the police are inventing a case i said nothing for a few minutes we pretended to look at buildings as we crossed over the bridge to santa maria in formosa its the only way it makes sense you know i said finally if he was followed yes she said half aloud as if it had been pulled out of her what happened to the house in verona it was betrayed not then she said quickly later everything was betrayed eventually she thought for a second why did they wait another day to see if he went anywhere else when he came back to venice they knew hed delivered the medicine so it had to be that house or verona and it had to be the house or he wouldnt have gone therejust stayed in verona so they came she stopped looking away from me toward the far end of the campo you know what they did first they poured the gasoline and then they were all around the house with machine guns so if you came out they shot you then the matches so you had a choice run out to the guns or stay inside and of course people stayedat least you had a chance nobody was burning yet but then the smoke got you and after that you burned i looked down at her arm but you got out she gave a weak smile im afraid of fire i ran into the guns and they missed no they shot me twice they left me for dead so thats how it happened she turned to me he knows this carlo he knows how his father died and if it were you who led them there how would you feel i dont even know what im supposed to be looking for claudia said we were in giannis office at the hospital going through a stack of blue folders anything that happened that week how do you know anything did it must have otherwise its a contradiction he takes in a partisan swears his nurse to secrecy fakes a medical report he saves him why set up his son because moretti escaped he didnt know where he was i shook my head then why not send up a red flag right away no i think he meant to help him he never changed the report he brags to his daughter tries to make himself look good for helping the resistance days go by over a week and then all of a sudden he sends the boy out with some phony medicine so hell be followed that parts rightit has to be so what happened in between something happened and youre going to find that here she said touching the files i want to know everyone he saw that week anything that might explain it there was a tap on the door frame the night duty nurse stood just outside with a coffee tray an excuse to see what we were doing dottore she said some coffee youre working so late she placed the cups on the desk glancing at claudia had she been listening but the desk outside was empty the nurses station farther down the hall was there anything else we wanted staring openly now at the folders as she left so now youre the dottore claudia said they call everybody that no only the stepson she said smiling to herself they all know she thinks you look like him she thought the old nurse killed him too i sipped some of the coffee we need to be him for a week i said rubbing the arms of the chair as if just touching his things could put me in his place everything he did something happened that week with the patients she said picking up a folder i dont know heres his calendar meetings at the hospital mostly then the appointmentsim crosschecking those with the medical files did they really show up what happened i looked over at her an appeal you know how to look at these youre a doctors daughter she took the appointment schedule and began shuffling through the stack to pull out files its crazy what youre doing she said an hour later the nurse came in with more coffee claudia was smoking her feet propped up on the edge of the desk and folders in her lap and for a second i thought the nurse almost scowling with disapproval would protest but she merely raised her eyebrows at me the new dottore and sniffed claudia unaware just kept turning pages absorbed in giannis medical day when she reached over for her coffee she kept her eyes on the page and i said lighting a cigarette signaling a break so many ulcers gastrointestinal a good specialty in the war the bad food the fearthink how busy so he was good she nodded yes you would think what i said leaning forward to get her attention no germans they had their own well in the army but a specialist thats different maybe he wouldnt see them you didnt refuse the germans if they asked but they didnt would they see a local doctor the soldiers no but the officers you have to remember what it was like its not a camp its venice they sit in san marco take a gondolawhat everyone does in venice parties with venetians too how do you think my father survived getting rid of their babies at least it was safer for the girls a real doctor they werehere restaurants everywhere its their city so if you get a stomachache why not go to the doctor but they dont why not i dont know you asked me what do i see and i see hes the only man in venice who never sees germans clean hands at least in public and in private he saves a partisan i said another dead end a partisan she said dismissively no he saved a friend i stared at her the words clicking into place like cylinders in a lock paolos friend i said another click tennis sweaters arms slung over shoulders because he was paolos friend wait a minute i said reaching for the phone what but then he sends young carlo to where moretti had to be i asked the hospital operator to put me through to the bauer rosa had just come in and given the slightly groggy tone in her voice must have had some wine at dinner do you never stop she said just one more thing the group who killed paolothere was someone else besides whoever was in the house hes dead dead how i mean in the fighting no the germans captured him they killed him which means they probably tortured him she was quiet for a second its possible but it doesnt matter he didnt know about the housewhere it was anything he was never told it was a protection for us and him it couldnt have been him but he knew who killed paolo signor miller hes dead when he was capturedany interrogation files no of course we looked for that how long was he kept we think two days they hung his body in verona in piazza bra remember who the commanding officer was the german there was a silence so long that i thought i had lost her yes i remember she said finally like here bauer what happened to him he went back to germany with the other butchers hes alive i dont know any files here on him no destroyed not that it mattered to us he wasnt an italian casehe was already in germany anyway maybe its good i dont want to know what they did to marco what good would it do now hes dead and he didnt know about the house so youre wasting your time marco you have a last name a pause soriano now it was my turn to wait your brother my husband and he didnt know where the house was try something else she said hanging up before i could say anything more claudia whod been watching said nothing waiting for me to explain instead i got the hospital operator again and asked her to put me through to joe sullivan in verona the call took a few minutes but the connection was clear weve got a trial tomorrow and im down one investigator now you i need a favor from me send rosa back and then well talk you werent supposed to fucking steal her shes here on her own business a small favor what army still have a priority line to frankfurt i need to call germany so pick up a phone come on the civilian linesll take days i cant patch you through from here no you make the call get schneider in frankfurtremember him and and ask him to run a check on bauer ss out of verona probably hauptsturmfuhrer level you dont have to call schneider i know bauer a real sweetheart but you dont know his files rosa said they were destroyed rosa said he captured her husband so she took a personal interest he was quiet for a minute she wasnt supposed to do that hes out of our handsfrankfurts problem do they have him is he still alive no idea whats your interest anyway the files here were destroyed but the ss duped everything for berlin so maybe copies are still around doubtful or better yet bauer himself if hes facing trial hell want to do anything to catch a break like tell you all his secrets which one in particular he interrogated her husband the husband told him who killed paolo maglione so who did bauer tell you want to explain this to me when you have more time just ask schneider if he can lay his hands on the filesstart with september im not sure when they captured him soriano interrogation rosa know about this no she doesnt want to he was tortured then they strung him up in the street jesus i know but before they did i think he talked which opens up another can of worms right is there going to be anything for us once you open it im not sure thats why im asking because youre not official anymore you know you want the army to do all this for some private deal think of all ive done for them fuck i waited its not a big favor joe ill tell rosa you miss her fucking drowning here and ive got to waste time on this its a good deed i promise you yeah the last time you checked on somebody the guy ended up dead maybe we can do the same for bauer tell schneider where he can reach me okay if he comes up with anything there was a growl for an answer and a click on the line i glanced over the desk at claudia still immersed in a folder what makes you think he told them anything she said without looking up if he was tortured by ss they all dideven things they didnt know and bauer told dr maglione thats the way it makes sense gianni saves an old friend of the familyhow could he not and then finds out the friend killed his brother it explains the aboutface it didnt matter to him whether or not they were partisansthat just made it easier to get someone else to do it for him keep his hands clean his new friends at villa raspelli including bauer im betting it had to be that way were close now she said nothing then closed the folder i didnt know about signor howard im sorry bertie what he didnt tell you he has cancer i looked at the blue folder in her hands other peoples secrets no he never said anything she tossed the folder back on the pile i stared at it for a minute something real not part of a story for cavallini living in his jewel box not wanting to be disturbed does he know he must god what do i say she shook her head nothing he would have told you if he wanted that giggling about giulia at the cafe but discreet about anything realhis assistants his death do you want to do more claudia said her voice weary lets finish she took another folder so you can make a story we have to do you know what i think she said looking up when it started i thought you wanted to prove that he was a bad man that it made some difference to you but now its she stopped what its not for the police this story its for you you want to believe it that someone else did it chapter fifteen mimi gave my mother her farewell lunch party no one called it thatcelia was going to paris to buy clothes and had asked her alongbut all of us knew i think that she wouldnt be back they would take a water taxi to the station after lunch slightly tipsy and in a week or two shed call to have the rest of her things sent on and leave me to close up the house she had run out of reasons to stay i had counted on her usual resiliency but instead shed turned listless and vague bertie said the trip would do her good and in fact she seemed to rally at lunch laughing with mimi her voice rising with some of its old buoyancy but there were sidelong glances too private moments when her mind went somewhere else it was a large party too large to seat everyone in the dining room so people passed down the long buffet table and then stood in small groups or huddled around the tea tables that had been set up all over the piano nobile i spent most of the time watching bertie expecting him somehow to look different tired thinner but there were no signs yet that anything was wrong his illness like my mothers sadness was locked away somewhere not for public display whats this i hear about the police arresting somebody he said to me morettis son you must have known him no the father i mean he was a friend of paolos oh that moretti well a long time ago childhood practically but they didnt stay friendsyou never saw him around no he became a communist really paolos friend he smiled faintly then shook his head and his son killed gianni why he thinks gianni betrayed his father to the ss gianni you dont actually believe that do you the police do oh nothing they like better than a good vendetta and how is this one supposed to have started i dont know paolos death probably paolo again he said his voice resigned all thats supposed to be over and look how it goes on somebody i knew in germany said it would be interesting to follow one bullet see where it finally stops you think it ends in somebodys body but really it keeps going the people he knew the way it changes things on and on poor paolo and he was so goodlooking he said as if he hadnt been listening not a thought in his head but so goodlooking he glanced over his glasses back with me no it doesnt stop does it look at gianni it didnt stop with him your mothers a wreck clothes with celia the new collections theyll probably have to roll the two of them off the train and the lovely giuliawhats to become of her one of the vestals i suppose keeping the flame going you of course have already lost your mind our little policeman still i suppose if youve caught him i didnt say i thought he did it i said the police did oh he said interested wanting to hear more but what more could i say i looked at bertie his lively eyes suddenly wishing that we werent talking about it at all that everything was back to the way it had been before i tiptoed around everything i said i wanted to talk about his being sick what it would mean is that why he wanted us all to go away so we wouldnt see when all the gossip would be beside the point not worth the effort but he was staring at me not that sick yet waiting for an answer theyve made their usual leap to the wrong conclusion is that it i didnt say that hm now you even sound like them never mind ill ask cavallini myself if i can pry him away from mimi hes here just made a beeline for our hostess you dont think he suspects he smiled to himself no not possible celia yes i wouldnt put it past her but mimi anyway it was her party when would she have found the time i heard that celia said behind us wouldnt put what past me just about anything darling bertie said kissing her cheek ready for the train its hours come have a drink i never see you wait she fingered the lapels of his jacket smoothing out his back collar there adorable sugar you look more like jiminy cricket every day how ill miss you bertie said adam go say goodbye to your mother while were all still standing instead i went to find cavallini talking to mimi something wrong i said oh they want to grill everybody again so youll tell them cavallini said nodding to me as he spoke to her yes yes but after lunch you can see ive got a houseful of course after lunch dont tell your mother mimi said to me its the last thing she needs what is starting all this up again who was where when i thought youd got him we like to be certain cavallini said blandly telling me with his eyes to be quiet till later then he bowed to her signaling me to follow what i said as we headed for the stairs walk with me a little somethings happened a witness somebody saw moretti i said imagining rosa leading him into the questura no somebody saw dr maglione we went out the calle entrance and walked away from the grand canal as if we were headed to my mothers house saw him where on his way to the ball come ill show you its important where we turned right on the fondamenta venier bordering a canal so still it seemed to have no outlet there was the faint stagnant smell of wet plaster she was there he said pointing up the window looks to the bridge from san ivo so its busy here she likes to watch the people of course what she says is that she just happened to look out i followed his finger to the window then to the bridge a few people were walking down its steps the way gianni would have come turning right at the end toward my mothers house and she saw him yes in his formal clothes thats what interested her she knew there was a big party she wanted to see the clothes you understand the importance of this now we have a time and where before we knew only that he left his house then what it could have been anywhere now we have him seen here shes just telling you this now shes an invalid she practices the economies a friend saves the papers for her and then she reads she says the delay doesnt matteranything important she hears from the street they must have talked about gianni being missing yes but not what he looked like for that she had to wait for the papers so now we know he came from accademia through san ivo along here and then at the end left to signora mortimer he turned facing the point where the fondamenta split his eyes fixed in mimis direction as if he were actually following gianni listening for footsteps but they would have echoed off to the right on their way to ca venti without thinking i looked toward the calle hed really taken then realized cavallini had noticed and was now looking with me thinking unless he was going somewhere else i said forcing it out waiting to see his response he kept looking for another minute working it through then shook his head but you called him at the hospital yes go to signora mortimers where else would he go from here i thought you know maybe a stop at the incurabilia doctor after allbut he would have turned earlier in san ivo no if he came this far he was going to signora mortimers just as you said now the question is where was the boat the boat the boat is important there had to be a boat to take him so far into the lagoon if he was killed hereright after the woman saw him it would have to be but i dont like to tell her thatthen the boat was also here there is only this canal and that one where it connects its lucky this part of dorsoduro so few anywhere else in venice he spread his hands indicating a web of canals but here they fill in the old canals so its just this one and what would happen when they turned up nothing another idea just down the street in the opposite direction i had to move him away but he could have been put in a boat anywhere i said its possible but if hes already hit they dont like to drag him far somebody sees he paused of course its possible he is killed after he gets into the boat after yes and i thought but where is that likely to happen signora mortimers boats coming and going morettis waiting with a messagehes needed urgently so he gets in the boat and thats why you want to talk to the servants again yes everyone at the landing stage although i will tell you frankly i doubt it was that way very risky for moretti to show himself to so many people its more likely that it happened here he said pointing back down the fondamenta after the corner i think where its quiet but that would depend on whether he found somewhere for the boat he smiled at my expression i can see youre not a venetian its not so easy to tie up in this districtlook so few spaces so we talk to peoplewhat was free who was gone and if were lucky someone saw then we have him he looked down the canal again toward the turn to mimis where gianni must have gone i will tell you he said smiling some in the questura will be surprised there have been discussions they dont think moretti did it i said alarmed unaware that any doubts had been raised had they already started looking elsewhere well its more accurate maybe to say they would prefer someone else the kind of trial this will mean once the newspapersthey want something simple not a show trial so theyre suspicious of you of me making these trials this is what you did in germany yes they dont want that hereit brings shame to people look at rosa shes italian and she makes this trouble for italians but youi say to them its not for trials its personal with him like me rosa thats something else but you dont want to make trouble look how careful you were about moretti be sure be sure so now maybe we can be sure we find where he kept the boat he shook his head its a gift this woman now we know when he was last alive and we know where to look i dont suppose theres any chance she made a mistake old woman anybody in formal clothes no no sharp eyes you know how they are these women once she saw the picture she knew she identified signorina grassini too what i said involuntarily like a twitch in the funeral pictures at salute thats how i knew the eyes were sharp she said she saw her the same night right here coming from san ivo like maglione half an hour or so later and thats rightits as you said so i said oh she was going to the party too no no she says not dressed up at all normale so that was accurate because she dressed at your house you said he looked at me the faintest hint of a question thats right a dress of my mothers yes i remember very beautiful and the necklace well he raised his hand glancing up at the building so an accurate witness maybe watching now who knows he went on to san ivo and i started back along the narrow stretch of pavement where gianni was supposed to have been attacked and bundled into a waiting boat what would happen when cavallini didnt find the boat when there were no more old women with sharp eyes i looked to my right up the calle but our house wasnt visible from hereyou had to make another turn go deeper into the maze there were no straight lines in venice maybe if you lived here long enough your mind began to work that way too seeing around corners making leaps out of sequence until you arrived at the right door but cavallini had turned left to mimis the logical route i looked down at the gray sluggish water my stomach turning he wouldnt stay there though the servants wouldnt know anything the boats would all be accounted for it was personal with him and now he had something to prove at the questura hed see finally that it was a dead end and turn around to look somewhere else i got back just as celias bags were being put into the taxi my mother was standing at the water entrance with bertie and when she turned and hugged him for a second i thought i saw him wince pressed too hard maybe where he felt sensitive i wondered if hed told her yet but the embrace had been quick fleeting two friends at the station not someone who thought it might be the last then he said something and she laughed and they were back in their own time again cocktails and patter songs before the war just in the nick my mother said seeing me i thought id miss you she kissed my cheek dont get into any trouble dont buy any clothes i said back all right she said smiling a little trouble celia says i havent given paris a chance not really she says i left too soon so you might stay for a while well well see its odd here for me and the trial theyll want to take my picture and why i have no position really im just someone he knew she said her voice drifting a little dont worry about anything ill take care of the house you know all the papers are in my desk i dont know why im talking like this weve got the house through spring and ill probably be back in a week its justwell whats here now she touched bertie on the arm except me pals she said in stage cockney youll miss your train bertie said giving her another peck have fun just dont try to keep up with celia and no cinq a septs please its unseemly at our age yours you mean she said laughing then she looked around swiveling her head to take in the line of palazzos across the canal it is so beautiful isnt it then she was hugging people and getting into the launch with celia waving to friends and settling in beside the stacks of luggage leaning out the side of the boat for a last look as they headed up the canal i turned to bertie whose eyes surprisingly were moist and youll be next i suppose he said not yet thats right he said airily turning back to the house otherwise engaged he started walking again you stick ill give you that where is she by the way i thought shed be here playing daughter couldnt shes working working where in a shop a shop he said adam really shed left the shop early however called back to the hotel when i got there she was already packing moving things from the wardrobe to the bed stopping in between to look out the window her movements anxious and darting a cigarette was burning in an ashtray on the end table half forgotten in the rush whats going on the police were here back again about that night you think cavallinis a fool maybe not such a fool but i just saw him it couldnt have been him another one then whats the difference they know something she went to the window and peeked out why come again the same questions what time did i leave they know i walked over to her taking her by the shoulders calm down its not that they dont know how do you know are you inside their heads now just listen they turned up someone who saw gianni that night thats what i came to tell you an old woman she also saw you saw me on your way to the house at exactly the time you said theyre just checking with the hotel to verify her story nobody suspects you of anything they just want to make sure it all fits her shoulders tense under my hands softened a little yes yes calm down she went over to the night table and picked up the cigarette she saw him where where she saw you san ivo out her window shes an invalid watches the street then they know where he was going its also the way to mimis depends which way you turn oh so he turns one way and i turn another you believe that they believe that and when it occurs to them that he could have gone the other way like i did she started walking to the wardrobe then turned back her pacing like visible thought it wont he went to mimis you came to me thats all there is to it no not all theyre looking again theyre looking at me who hated him who follows him to your houseyes thats all the woman proves that i was there too who better but you were with me yes doing what how long before they see it another move to the window still anxious listen to me i said quietly lowering my voice ive been over everythingthe hall the canal gate the boat every inch everythings been scrubbed theres nothing there no evidence at all nobody saw him nobody can prove he was there except us so maybe theres another invalid nobody except us all we have to do is keep our heads oh and im losing mine is that it she went over to the wardrobe turning her back to me its me theyre asking questions about not you theyre just making sure about her i said calmly thats all they dont suspect you she kept her back to me staring at the wardrobe then reached in pulled out a dress and carried it over to the suitcase on the bed yet and now what come home with me she shook her head my mothers gone shes not coming back i cant she looked up i cant stay here in venice today i thought its getting closer oh i know what you say but i cant help it theyll find out somehow if i dont leave now ill never get out so maybe its true they dont suspect but how much longer and then were trapped here what do you mean leave now i said the only phrase id really heard now just get on the vaporetto and go to the station unless theyre watching she said jerking her head toward the window but then at least id know i cant leave now no she said going back for another dress then folding it into the case she tucked a toiletries bag into the side then looked around the room suddenly bare just a few hangers dangling in the wardrobe look how easy it is when you dont have anything remember how we left san isepo not even an hour you can pack up your whole life and leave and go where it wouldnt make any difference you know i said trying to keep my voice emotionless youd have the same papers if they really wanted to find you they would i know but then its easier to run where can you run in venice its a prison here and theyre always looking and who knows maybe someday they ask the right question what if he turned the other way she stopped then closed the lid of the suitcase today it was like a warning if i stay here but if you leave without me theyll wonder no theyll be happy for you a woman like that a puttana what else would she do thats the way it is with them stop it then come its our chance now before its too late and leave moretti to them you could do that she walked over to the window today its him then something else and we stay and stay under their noses she gestured out as if the police were lurking beneath a tree in the campo this catandmouse waiting to be caught she turned maybe thats what you want to be caught there are people like that they want to be caught i said nothing waiting it out but i dont she looked away then busied herself closing the wardrobe and checking the bathroom her silence itself a kind of apology when she came back to the window she looked up across the roofs of san polo to the campanile of the frari and now its going to rain she said weary a last straw come and sit i said moving the suitcase but she stayed at the window looking out if i dont go now itll be too late ill get caught in the rain she paused listen to me what difference does the rain make im talking with my nerves no sense no ones going to get caught i said evenly as if i were stroking her arm but im afraid you youre not afraid of anything yes now im afraid all the time she said facing me moving away from the window her hands so jittery that she folded them under her arms holding herself to stay still of what exactly she began pacing again but near the bed in tighter circles everything that ill say something she stopped in front of me no that youll say something she lowered her head im afraid youll say something i looked up at her stung and for a minute neither of us spoke everything fragile even the air all right i said finally then marry me what a husband cant testify against his wife isnt it that way here too they could never use anything i say for a second she froze then her shoulders twitched that peculiar shudder that moves between laughing and crying unable to settle on either she sank down onto the bed next to me wonderful she said marry somebody to keep him quiet to protect yourself no i said reaching over and brushing back her hair for all the other reasons the usual ones the usual ones she said looking down at her lap with us after this the usual ones but also just in case just in case brava i dropped my hand i just meant youd never have to worry she stared at her lap for another minute then got up turning to me no and then neither would you is that why you want to she went over to the night table and lit a cigarette her eyes avoiding me a wonderful marriage because were afraid of each other you know what i mean just the way i always imagined it she went back to the window blowing smoke and staring out letting the quiet settle over the room i was right she said finally now its raining where did your mother go paris so you want me to come to ca venti yes why not i cant stay here she smiled wryly i was going but you can still get a train if you want i said staring at her you can do whatever you want she came over to the bed and put her hand in my hair oh no strings no no but its too late for that isnt it were tied now with this thing no matter what so why not ca venti maybe its my fate what is you i never thought when it started she took her hand away but that was before we waited until the rain stopped not saying much then took a vaporetto to accademia and walked the rest of the way home in the downstairs hall she hesitated for a moment looking through to the water entrance and i saw that she was imagining gianni there again his head on the steps but then angelina appeared wanting to take her suitcase asking her where to put it making us feel oddly as if we were checking into a new hotel without my mother the house seemed even larger than before and instinctively we avoided the big reception rooms staying in the sitting room with the space heater at one point claudia wandered out to the room where the engagement party had been but it was empty and gloomy barely lit and there was nothing to see not even in memory she fiddled with the radio for a while the static somehow like our own strained jumpiness then made drinks when we werent talking you could hear the clock dinner was roast chicken and a creamy polenta nursery food and afterward we sat with a fire and listened to the house quiet down footsteps in the upstairs hall running water then nothing when we made love later i thought of how it had been after the ball the clutching everything unexpectedly exciting now it was more like having too much to drink a grudging pleasure that made it easier to sleep we stayed in my room claudia curled beside me just what wed always wanted we both slept fitfully claudia tossed next to me restless and i drifted in and out sleeping and then lying on my side with my eyes open making out shapes in the dark room nothing was wrongwe were safebut my eyes stayed open my mind picking over things at random moretti who had to be saved somehow cavallini searching the canal for the right mooring claudia in the hotel room anxious looking out the window to see if they were coming to get her i turned onto my back and looked up at the ceiling and the faint moving reflections of the moonlit water outside it was back again the uneasiness of those first weeks waiting for the sun to come over the redentore but that had been the dread of being suddenly at loose ends a kind of decompression this was a formless worry claudia moved next to me rolling to her side not formless i saw her again in the hotel room turning to me and then neither would you id always thought of it one way me reassuring her safe as long as i held her but of course it had to work the other way i was only safe as long as she held me and now she was frightened ready to run off sure they knew afraid i would say something afraid she would say something she moved again rolling farther away and i slid quietly toward the edge slipped out from under the blankets and tiptoed toward the closet grateful that the marchesa had scrimped on the squeaky parquet floors a luxury for the public rooms here on noiseless carpet i could get my clothes and leave the room without a sound i stopped at the door checking but claudia hadnt moved i dressed and made my way to the stairs not even aware of the dark everything familiar from the sleepwalking nights but why would she say anything for that matter why would they believe her i had lost a fortunethe one man in venice cavallini didnt suspect unless he wanted to nothing was predictable you met a girl at a party and the next morning on a boat you have the first clear idea youve had in months i thought of her as we pulled into salute intrigued the start of it then looking out the hotel window for shadows lying in the same bed now afraid of each other but these were fourinthemorning thoughts irrational gone in the daylight like mist burning off i turned the door latch carefully making only a click as i stepped into the calle nobody was going to say anything it was breezy on the zattere and my head felt clearer wide awake now across the channel the giant brick stucky factory loomed over the gardens of the giudecca there were shouts and clanging sounds up ahead at the warehouses behind the maritime station the city would be awake soonbakers the first dogwalkers everything normal i would check in with cavallini maybe rosas lawyers had managed to get moretti out if we could just get cavallini to back away the boy might not even be tried a case any defense could fight a trial nobody wanted then we could leave go anywhere claudia liked i went into the workers cafe opposite san sebastiano feeling better nobody would say anything the barman nodded as if it had been a day not weeks since id last stopped in and handed me a coffee still foamy on top i stood at the window looking across at the church veroneses church the dreary stone facade then the riot of color inside she must have been standing outside the steamy door for a few minutes hands stuck in her pockets before i noticed the movement in the corner of my eye she was biting her lip not sure whether to smile pleased with herself for having found me but slightly embarrassed or maybe waiting for me to be pleased then someone opened the door and she was in anyway standing next to me i thought you were asleep i said i thought you were coffee she shook her head then glanced around taking in the other customers in their blue coveralls and caps what is this place it opens early i come here sometimes whats wrong nothing i couldnt sleep thats all how did you find me i looked out the window i saw you on the zattere i didnt know what to think i went for a walk i paused i was coming back she looked away i just didnt know where you were going i was worried i held up the coffee cup sure she shook her head again and i finished it come on i said guiding her with a hand on her back a few of the men turned amused making up their own stories i didnt want to be alone in the house she said outside explaining but it wasnt the house its so stupid to be like that she said shaking a little just as she had in the hotel youre cold theres only the coat she said drawing it closer i didnt have time to dress i glanced at her once it would have been fun nothing underneath our secret in the cafe something to laugh about when we got back to bed warming ourselves now i thought of her throwing it on racing down the stairs making sure of me come here i said folding my arms around her youll freeze she let her head fall against my neck so that i could feel her breath quietly shaking like the rest of her im sorry she said then tipped her head back and i saw that there were tears the shaking stronger claudia she took a breath nothing its nerves ssh i said moving her closer its the cold thats all she rubbed her face against my coat i didnt want to be with anyone again remember i told you at la fenice i was afraid of that and now im afraid when youre not there so the joke is on me yes she wiped her eyes no joke i said lifting her head im not going anywhere no so its what you wanted you wanted us to be together dont you oh me she said brushing the question away another tear she looked up youre still so sure yes i said suddenly filled with it a certainty you could touch seeing her face at the water gate her eyes looking at me as we moved the tarp and after at the hotel clutching each other no one else no doubt at all yes and at the nurses i saw your face you thought for a minuteyes you didis it all a story something i made up the hospital the camp what if shes what i had thought just for a minute why would i make it up but you thought that claudia im not going anywhere she looked down so we can watch each other no i said she raised her head waiting im not going anywhere i said again she looked at me then nodded a kind of concession her eyes moist again no we cant not now it doesnt matter why does it its the only way were safe thats not i said but she was leaning into me away from the wind off the zattere i know its all right she said her voice muffled so come home she turned crooking her arm through mine something shed done a hundred times before and suddenly i felt as if we had been snapped together i looked down at the arm curved around mine like a link in a chain tied now chapter sixteen claudia and i were married at a magistrates office in a ceremony that lasted less than fifteen minutes mimi and bertie were the witnesses and because there was no party no real wedding they insisted on taking us to lunch afterward at the gritti i had called my mother and told her not to come and after a squeal of protest i think she was relieved not to have to make the trip wed have a proper celebration later she finally agreed but why the rush claudia wore an offwhite silk dress with a coral belt that we bought in the calle frazzaria off san marco and bertie somehow miraculously found a corsage of hothouse flowers that set it off like a giant tropical brooch a man took souvenir pictures after we signed the registry and we are all smiling in them it was not the wedding any of us would have imagined but venice made up for the missing bridesmaids the weather was beautiful warm enough to eat outside on the grittis floating dock with all the canal traffic going by we joked that salute gleaming across the water with its marble icing was our wedding cake and youre already here for your honeymoon bertie said think of them all pouring out of the station all swozzled and cranky before they even begin well cheers he lifted his champagne glass auguri what do you suppose they do mimi said bertie sputtered smiling mimi dear during the day i mean you dont want to look at tintorettos on your honeymoon do you gondola rides i said with accordions what does signora miller want to do bertie said tipping his glass to claudia signora miller she said trying it out it is now isnt it mm bertie said im a witness it started with you you know i said your party you introduced us i wish youd introduce someone to me mimi said oh no bertie said holding up his hands anyway as i recall adam you introduced yourself bold as brass and now look yes i said looking at claudia pretty with her flowers the bright sky behind her signora miller doesnt want to do anything she said as if bertie had been waiting for an answer shes happy to sit right here she looked over the blue midday water to the palazzos on the other side one of the traghetto gondolas was weaving its way across graceful as a dancer on point i could sit here forever yes bertie said following her gaze wouldnt it be nice we finished the wine talking idly then bertie excused himself and a few minutes later i followed in the mens room he was leaning on the marble counter dabbing his face with a cold towel everything all right yes certainly why wouldnt it be he looked at me in the mirror then blotted his face again i mean are you in pain a longer stare now in the mirror then a resigned look away somebodys been reading medical reports he wiped his hands on the towel its all right now it wont be soon does that answer it no talk to me he shook his head theres no point if youve read my file then you know everything i know i dont know what it means it means enjoy the beautiful day outside i intend to and that doesnt mean going on about things that cant be helped or things thatwell things so let me enjoy it please i mean it adam and not a word to grace either rushing back on trains and making me a cause i know just what shes like bertie no he said putting his hand on my arm now lets not ruin the day its supposed to be the happiest day of your life he looked up at me hers anyway did you get another opinion yes ive been through all that gianni was a perfectly competent doctor you know whatever else you may think he was if he was he turned away find anything else in his files i shook my head just you serves you right snoop he threw the towel in the wicker hamper underneath the sink better go before mimi comes in after us dont think she wouldnt he started for the door then stopped i almost forgot here he took an envelope out of his breast pocket and handed it to me for the happy couple bertie i know i shouldnt have but i did now put it away before youknowwho sees it i stepped closer and put my arms around him surprised a little when he hugged back all right all right he said breaking away touched its not a funeral its a wedding such as it is so lets have a drink and if youre good ill get mimi away and you can have the day to yourselves it took two drinks but then they were gone taking their conversation with them we sat quietly for a while in the sun rocking on the wakes of the passing boats the waiters paid by bertie had disappeared inside is there anything youd like to do i said see tintorettos she kept facing the water squinting a little against the sunlight id like to see my father she said finally would you mind i shook my head waiting not knowing what she meant but its so far to walk these shoes do you have money for a taxi i patted my jacket pocket were rich bertie gave me a check where but she was already getting up and walking over to the landing platform a bellman helped her into the motorboat then i followed both of us sitting back against the cushions as the boat headed up the canal the motor was too loud to talk over so we watched the city go by under the accademia bridge past the turn where ca maglione stood brightened now with pots of geraniums on the balconies then up the busy stretch to the rialto the water crowded with delivery boats the view from berties window what would happen to the house i wondered one of the assistants perhaps unseen but devoted there in the end while the rest of us were kept away berties real life whirling in its own mystery we got out at san marcuola and walked the rest of the way to the ghetto claudias high heels clicking loudly on the pavement away from the canal the streets became somber and dingy and people stared openly at our clothes the corsage almost startling here then up the narrow calle where her aunt used to gossip window to window and over the bridge ducking our heads in the low sottopasso to the open campo as stark as before the trees just beginning to bud she stood for a minute looking no one passed us the only campo in venice that seemed lifeless left behind i always say ill never come here again and then i come back she said we went over to a bench in front of what had been the old peoples home she sat for a minute with her back against the wall then leaned forward and took off her shoes mama mia these shoes what mama mia i said grinning a real italian ha like the others she said rubbing her foot at signor howards speaking english you dont know real italians i married one didnt i she stared at the campo i dont feel italian here something else they didnt think we were italian when they came for us she sat back frowning why do i come here its always the same maybe thats why no its foolish but at the gritti i thought what am i doing here my father cant see me here but he can here no thats why its so foolish but i wish he could i thought today i wish he could see me this dress these shoes married just to show him i am alive he never expected to see that she paused well did i i never thought id leave that place and now flowers she said touching the corsage so maybe i came to see myself all dressed up show off to the neighbors i lit cigarettes for us maybe you will see somebody you never know she shook her head the empty campo its own answer then pointed across to one of the tall buildings thats where it would have been the wedding see the windows on the third floor there and then after a party somewhere big with everybody he liked parties would he have liked me i said just making conversation she shook her head smiling no no no laughing now a private joke why not youre not jewish part she waved this away americans its different how its different she turned a new idea and now me im american too yes passport everything everything i forgot about the passport she said now i can go anywhere almost worth getting married for he would have liked that anyway you know for him that generation america was like a dream she looked again at the synagogue windows he would have made a big fuss introducing you all the relatives i kept looking at the campo saying nothing well she said moving somewhere else in her mind are you sorry it wasnt like that me im supposed to be dead sometimes at the gritti its easy to forget then i come here and i see it again she opened her hand to the square were all supposed to be dead not married dead she paused and now whos dead the man who killed him so thats one thing i did for my father he cant see that either i said no but im glad im glad it was me it wasnt you i said quietly yes both of us do you think theyd take one of us without the other i glanced at her suddenly back in the registrars office nobodys taking anybody no well she said getting up dropping the cigarette not today anyway such talk on a wedding day of course its not that kind of wedding is it she said nodding toward the windows again where the relatives would have been what kind is it she ground out the cigarette with her toe our kind we walked toward the station intending to get a taxi back and in a few minutes were on the lista di espagna crowded with people just off the train lets go back there she said pointing to the hotel on the side street where wed first made love do you want to do you yes not your mothers house there the desk clerk raised his eyebrows at claudias corsage as if we were newlyweds from maestre whod wandered into the wrong place but he gave us a key claudia was playful on the stairs backing me against the wall on the landing the way wed been that first time too eager to open the door but the room was different stuffy in the back and we had to draw the blinds against sun this time not the cold rain that had made us feel hidden away illicit when she took off her clothes first unpinning the flowers i thought of her unbuttoning her blouse that day the jolt of it before anything happened before we were different she felt it too i think that sudden moment of everything being different because she looked for one second as if she might dart away but then she stepped over to me naked and pressed herself against me and that was the same again different but the same we made love in a kind of rush grabbing so that our minds were free of everything but what was happening to our skin you could feel it being pushed away every thought crowded out by physical excitement gathering speed until sex was something happening to us not in our control at all when she came a ragged burst of gasps in my ear the sound seemed dragged out of her involuntary and then i was coming too almost surprised by it as if id been caught in some unwilled convulsion i stayed in her afterward not sure it was over then finally rolled off blinking at the ceiling returning still not thinking about anything the way shed once described it something to prove youre alive just feeling it when shed told me it could be anyone as long as you could feel it now she was leaning over me propped up on one arm touching my face we still have this dont we she said not waiting for an answer bending down to kiss me youre all red i said reaching up and running my hand over the tops of her breasts still flushed as if she had a birthmark she smiled a little feeling my fingers her eyes on mine you should marry me okay we could spend our wedding night here we could i said my fingers still tracing a line across her chest for a second she gave in to the stroking closing her eyes then she opened them again and stared down at me youre not sorry i shook my head turning my hand over brushing her with the back of it ill marry you again i said would that do it she nodded for all the other reasons for those i let my hand drop then reached up with both arms and pulled her to me kissing her and for a while it really was the same again but different we tried to sleep lazy after sex but the voices from the lista di espagna funneled into the calle seeping through the window like dust and neither of us really wanted to stay instead like real honeymooners we took a gondola winding through the back canals until we lost our sense of direction content to watch people crossing bridges over our heads moving at their land pace while we drifted below sometimes they stopped to look at us pointing at claudias corsage so that mirrorlike we became part of each others scenery by the time the gondolier got back on the grand canal the sun was setting the water gold and pastel and he threw out his arms in an ecco gesture as if he had arranged it for us a wedding gift after the gritti lunch it seemed extravagant to go out but the house in dorsoduro felt confining filled with ghosts and claudia said she wanted to do something american so we ended up going to lucilles just behind campo san fantin the club had opened during the occupation a little piece of home and the customers were still mostly soldiers on leave from bases in the veneto or attached to one of the allied offices that hadnt yet packed up and gone it had the borrowed pretend quality of places like it in germanyamerica till you walked out the doorand most of the locals avoided it when we got there it was only half full the band was finishing its first set so the house lights were down the other customers just shadows in the smoky darkness at the table next to ours everyone was in uniform drinking beer lucille the colored singer who fronted the place was doing easy living trying to pass as billie holiday with a flower in her hair the soldiers next to us stared at claudia when we sat down someone approachable the kind of girl who went to jazz clubs and for a second i stiffened then laughed at myself a cartoon reaction thats my wife lucille finished and through the applause i heard one of the soldiers say heynot flirting trying to get our attention hey he said again remember us moving his finger between him and his friend the island that was closed jim and mario torcello claudia said smiling yes youre still here last day one of them said hey let us buy you a beer claudia held up her left hand wiggling her ring finger ask him she said nodding to me what did i tell you one said to the other then leaned forward taking me in thats great when today today fucking a the gi said then dipped his head in apology to claudia congratulations he signaled the waiter then moved his chair closer half joining us at the small club table we shook hands i have to tell you i knew it i said to him what else would they come out here for i mean with the restaurant closed we cleared out remember i remember claudia who seemed to be enjoying herself shook hands with both of them mario she said calabrese my grandfather ah she said pointing to herself romana the beers arrived hers in a glass she lifted it to them salute she said smiling the party we hadnt had at the gritti so they sent you here you speak italian two words maybe my father didnt want us to he stopped afraid of offending and just then lucille stood up again this time for a comic sexy version of the frim fram sauce flirting with the audience coating each word with innuendo claudia tried to follow it taking her cues from jim and mario who laughed at all the right places but inevitably her reactions were late one step behind foreign whats chiffafa she asked mario as we applauded a vegetable he laughed its just jive he said almost shouting the band had started playing without lucille so people talked above it the small room noisy he pointed at claudias wedding ring so does this mean youre going to the states what do you think will i like it like it youre gonna love it its the states yes which one are you from i sat back watching not really listening new york had everythingthe big shows everything it never stopped not like here where they rolled the streets upwell canals rolled the canals up jim laughed trying to picture this then both soldiers turned to claudia to tell her about things she had to see things shed like because they liked them gi talk america now a movie to them shinier than anything theyd ever known and why not i smiled to myself enjoying the breezy descriptions claudias face as she listened pretending to be wideeyed the sort of girl they might want to take back themselves there were more drinks mario asked her to dance if it was all right with me youre a lucky guy jim said stuck with me now want us to clear out no shes having fun i said looking at her on the floor doing a foxtrot with mario some place huh like being home i looked at her again my chest suddenly tight my wife of course wed have to go back sometime but even in this ersatz version in san fantin she seemed out of place america was about easy happiness chiffafa as casual as picking up a girl in a club i thought of the look in her eyes that afternoon as she had stared across the empty campo what would she do with it there her old life pretend it didnt exist like bertie until it started to grow inside her mario finished with a surprise twirl so they were laughing as they came off the floor when her laugh stopped suddenly cut off we all looked at her then followed her gaze toward the back of the room see a ghost jim said no no sorry she said sitting down its nothing but my eye had caught him now too the mustache neatly brushed sitting against the wall in a doublebreasted suit on the town a woman was with him her back to us and i tried to look away before he saw me not signora cavallini maybe a friend from maestre lucilles was a kind of maestreno one his wife knew would come here i felt embarrassed as if i had opened the wrong door by mistake hes coming over claudia said i turned expecting some version of a man of the world wink an elbow nudge but instead he was smiling delighted signor miller so you like the jazz too all the young people it seems he said waving his hand toward his table where the woman had turned to face us giulia for a second i simply stared too surprised to move then she was nodding and i had to nod back she was dressed for a night out lipstick and earrings no trace of mourning to see cavallini in a place where no one would see them but neither of them seemed disconcerted by our being there cavallini was taking claudias hand greeting her please youll join us oh but claudia fluttered spreading her hands to jim and mario clearly unnerved by the idea of sitting with cavallini thats okay mario said we were just having a beer you go sit with your friends i mean what the hell your wedding day how cavallini said claudia and i were married today i said to him he looked at me speechless for a moment then fell back on form taking up claudias hand again with a flourish signora miller my very best wishes he said the english sounding curiously like a translation he turned to me so you didnt wait for your mother we didnt wait for anybody we just thought it was time yes i know how that is everything for the family and really you want to be alone i thought of his wife an unlikely candidate for elopement and now here we are more people but at least have some wine with us to celebrate he glanced at the table of beer bottles that would be nice i said shooting a look at claudia cavallini extended the invitation to the gis too but they begged off so it was just the four of us at the little table in the back giulia what do you think married today cavallini said waving his hand at us then summoning the waiter for more chairs yes giulia said to me taken aback and then for an instant a look that was more than surprise a question mark a change of plan so thats wonderful you didnt tell anyone ah no secrets from the questura cavallini said joking you see how we find you out even here i laughed but claudia barely managed a smile when the chairs were brought she sat at the edge of hers as if she were afraid of accidentally touching cavallinis leg it was an awkward table giulia talked about jazz popular at the university because it had to be clandestine almost a link with the allies cavallini asked about the wedding finally the bottle arrived and cavallini made a toast to our future yes the future claudia said edgy and what will it be cavallini said pleasantly claudia shrugged you dont know but women always know theyre the ones with the plan the men he opened his hand all of us feckless america i suppose she said it depends on adam ha already a wife my wife too everything depends on me as long as its what she wants he said raising his glass to claudia i glanced quickly at giulia surprised hed mentioned his wife maybe not a girl from maestre after all you could leave venice giulia said you know i thought i could and then at university i missed it terra firma nothing moves i missed the water not everyone likes the water cavallini said maybe its different for signora miller he nodded at her new name when you cant swim how do you know that claudia said offguard im sorry he said genial its not true no its true but how do you know you asked someone that no no signor miller mentioned it we were talking about boats he said you didnt like boats only the vaporetto shes getting better i said jumping in today we took a gondola ride and she wasnt nervous at all so you think im always the bloodhound cavallini said amused your men were asking questions at the hotel i said explaining checking times my men he said blushing a little as if hed been accused of being clumsy any news about the boat i said moving him away from claudia no its very difficult he sighed but not tonight tonight the bloodhound is not official just a wedding guest the bride will permit me a dance he held out his hand smiling so claudia had to raise hers and get up before she could think of any excuse not to she glanced at me then let cavallini take her elbow following him to the dance floor like someone being led away for questioning giulia took out a cigarette and waited for me to light it you really like jazz i said you mean what am i doing here dont worry its not what you think its none of my i asked him to bring me here he wanted to have dinneryou know where everyone can seeand i thought no why not here instead i like the music and alone its not possible for me to come why dinner oh he said to explain to me what was happening about my father the man they caught of course the real reason i can guess no its not that she said just to be seen be helpful you know his wife is my mothers cousin so he thinks hes a maglione im the family now the son its useful for him if people think i want his counsel that he has influence with me you know he has political ambitions so its useful he does i glanced toward the dance floor where he was chatting with claudia hes always been ambitious why else would he marry filomena you mean shes rich no but a good family a step for him maybe he married for love she looked at me did you i said nothing for a second thrown by the directness of it her eyes on me yes she tapped her cigarette on the ashtray then its good youll be happy she glanced up i hope you will be she said softer now a kind of apology for having asked so cavallini gets seen with the magliones and what do you get out of it a night out well a friend in the police its always good and to thank him for solving the murder of course i know it was because of you but he listened to you would the others have done that do you really think this case can be tried youre a lawyer not for crime business you know contracts anyway in this case im a maglione the police get the man brava but now the important thingwell that it all goes the right way what way is that she leaned forward businesslike the best of course is that theres no trial at all he confesses its an end but if it has to be then i want him on trial not my father what do you mean she shrugged a tragic mistake my father gives him medicinea humanitarian act at that time even a brave one and he thinks its a betrayal foolish but he acts but the defense will say it was a betrayal and the more they say it the more they make him look guilty vittorio says vittorio inspector cavallini she said surprised i hadnt known his name he says this is the trapif they talk about my father this way it gives moretti more motive so maybe they wont they have to say something theyll say the police are mistaken that its political the government is trying to put the communists on trial and of course its truea convenience for them a case like this but at least then my fathers name she broke off crushing her cigarette her mouth drawn as if putting on lipstick had hardened it aged her i thought of her at the memorial service pale when her fathers good name had not even been in question youve thought about this of course its my name too thats why its so important with vittorio to make it all go right so i make him feel part of the family her eyes slightly amused but determined giannis face at the monaco by bringing him here well im the son but not the son i know what people say we go to harrys and im his mistress nice for him maybe but not for me so i bring him here who will know some soldiers and me yes now you but you know everything youre the other son he thinks of you that way you know i made a noise shrugging this off you almost were she smiled to herself maybe its close enough for him he has a great respect for money then hes wrong again i dont have any she picked up her wineglass then she married for love too she said not looking at me casual as if the phrase were a stray thought i waited a minute i hope so she finished her wine then looked at the dance floor its true youre going to america i opened my hands im american you know if things had turned out differentlyif my father had livedi think he would have offered you a place in his business i doubt it i said easily i dont know anything about business but i do she said looking up i know everything about our business i was raised for it a trumpeter stood up on the bandstand holding a note the end of the song no one spoke so that the moment seemed suspended giulias eyes were still and i felt an almost physical pull being drawn in like cavallini making us both part of the family so things would go right the fathers daughter more than gianni did then i said trying to be light no he knew often he did thingsbecause of the business she said her voice remote something she was still debating with herself people on the dance floor were applauding the trumpeter anyway im not his son i said so but you avenged his death she said quickly im grateful for that no i said shaking my head maybe morettis just convenient for everybody a feather in your cousins cap but what if hes innocent you dont believe its him why did he say he was glad at that bar i dont knowa million reasons maybe he hates businessmen she put her hand over mine how you defend him my father better than a son maybe you think he couldnt have betrayed this man he could he betrayed everybody my mother everybody she said fiercely almost spitting out the words she moved her hand away and grabbed at her glass to steady herself you didnt suspect no like me all my life i thought he was a good man a moral dilemmasave a partisan ha once that he tells me about and what about the rest of it what was he saving then the business well he saved it for me i should be grateful yes i should be grateful she lifted her head suddenly as if shed been caught talking to herself then reached for another cigarette something to do for a moment i sat still afraid id startle her away then struck the match and lit it for her what i said gently its in the notebooks she glanced up at claudia and cavallini coming toward us only a table away you figured out the gaps yes she said but not now nothing to vittorio but if they prove moretti didnt no they prove he did they cant i said involuntarily she looked at me surprised but before either of us could say anything more the others were sitting down the table a party again i dance like an elephant cavallini said laughing at himself and claudia politely said no he was good on his feet and we all drank more wine claudia had given me a lets go look but now i couldnt not until i finished with giulia so i ignored it instead we drank a new bottle exchanged for the old cavallini drummed his fingers on the table to the music finally claudia got up saying shed promised jim a dance and left the table shooting me another look the dance was obviously a surprise to jim but everyone was a little drunk now and he waved a salute to me grinning a minute later i led giulia onto the floor these foolish things slow enough to talk my hand barely touching her back what do you mean they cant prove it she said still turning this over i hesitated trying to think feeling the sweat at my hairline theyre paolos journals arent they he was already dead when the house was attacked so how could they prove anything oh i see no they dont say my father gave moretti the medicine but of course we know he did moretti said so so what do they say you figured out the missing pages she nodded i found the other books but he destroyed them didnt you say well a maglione he gave them to maria to be destroyed the maid you saw her entering nervously with a phone loyal to paolo it turns out maybe the only one she read them no she doesnt read she can write her name thats all but she kept them you know you forgot to take the books away the day vittorio called so that night i was looking through them the missing pages what did they mean and she saw me and said would i like to see the others my father had told her to burn them but she thought these are paolos the history of the family and theyre not my fathers to burn she smiled he wasnt the first son she thinks that way i nodded encouraging her to go on but there was no reluctance now almost a rush to get it out once i had those it was easy enough to guess the rest because i know my fathers businesses so well his businesses yes it was always about that i dont know if that makes it better or worse if he had believed in somethinganyway he believed in this over her shoulder i could see claudia signaling me you had to work with the government giulia said everything was like that here licenses friends its like that everywhere yes but here it was fascists and then the germans he sold arms my mother said he didnt no not that one factory in turin it makes forks then it makes forks for the army little things not the agnellis uniforms electrical pieces many things so the italian army thats one thing its still your country but then the germans come not your country but you supply them too ha one partisan my wonderful father he worked with the germans paolo says so i said trying to keep my voice calm finally there paolo worked with them paolo was perfect the older brother it was his name on the companies the ones that were all ours not just a piece he was already friendly with thema puppet like everybody in the salo government the worse things got the happier he is in the books i presented our proposal to donati so who is our him no my father i met with rohrer and told gianni that the plan had met with approval his plan no so busy now so important head of the family even his brother praises him confides in him uses him yes its my father whos working with them but no one knows that they only see paolo and kill him for it she looked away for a minute just shuffling to the music i dont blame my father for that paolo did that to himself i dont know did paolo have to do everything he did for the germans help them withwhatever they asked i think with my father it would have been different but paolo didnt know where to stop he was important he liked that so you know its his fault too i dont blame my father she looked up but my father did he blamed himself now i understand it how he was when paolo died his fault and now there was no one to run interference no now he had to deal with the germans himself it was too late to back out if he wanted to i dont think he did he hated the partisans for killing paolo maybe he hated the germans too but it was the end they would be gone soon and he was still safe if he was careful no one knew he was a doctor a good man you know when the trials came right after the war no one even thought of him i remembered rosa at the bauer her face filled with excitement a new quarry work with the germans that was paolo it all died with paolo so my father survived the germans then he survived you she waved her hand a little taking in the rest of the room the allied occupation with his good name my god and now an american wife and all the money the money paolo earned for him she looked down sometimes i think i should admire him its not so easy to survive but then look what he did to paolo and this is all in there the germans he worked with that paolo worked with yes and him ill show you you have to know how to read them how the businesses are connected she paused are you still trying to defend him i just want to be sure you think i want this to be true i wasnt even going to tell you about them but it was your idea wasnt it look through the papers and what did we find a man who sells his brother to the devil she paused and maybe paolo had his revenge his friend comes to the hospital such a small thing and then it starts she drifted following the bullet that didnt stop her chain of events unaware that it had been an even smaller thing a mere nod i saw giannis face twisted with fury in the entrance hall thinking i was about to ruin everything because of something so small it hadnt mattered to him so this is who he was she said her voice unsteady eyes filling i glanced down at her what id wanted to know but not this way making another wound part of who he was i said trying to salvage something oh because he was papa well which part do you pick you think theyre all the same all equal no no those people in the house are dead who knows maybe others what part was that we still dont know he did that i said just because he did business with the germans it doesnt prove but she wasnt listening for me paolo thats the worst his own blood my blood and i never would have known nobody would she looked up and nobody has to know now just the family they can never put him on trial now moretti saved us all from that for a second the back of my neck prickling i thought how easy it would be to let it happen let moretti save all of us just by being guilty but now theres his trial i said itll come out not if he confesses she said her eyes firm not flinching maybe the way they were when she talked to cavallini family matters mario cut in on me at the end of the song so that both girls were now on the floor with the soldiers behind them others were standing with their drinks waiting a turn the band surprised to find a party didnt even break before moving into the next number well im glad for this cavallini said watching the dancers i wanted to talk to you that business at the hotel asking questions about signorina grassiniim sorry for that an absurdity i assure you not my men no then who i told you some at the questura theyre not happy about moretti its politics of course but they dont say that so theyre investigating claudia no no please dont upset yourself reviewing the case they say going over everything why a waste of time but theres morettis lawyer making trouble for them so there has to be the pretense looking at everything i tell you this because i know they called your mother in paris yes such an expense and for what what they already knew in the report if she mentions it tell her its nothingsome foolishness here thats all shes well i nodded but what do they want to know if i made a mistake thats what a time wrong anything then they can discredit me this is typical of the communists but do they find anything no its just as it is in the report no mistakes they havent talked to me they will he said easily this is how things are now a man who has been like a partner to us you know if it were up to the questorehe knows your service but even he i understand theyre just being careful still an inconvenience and after all what can you tell them you were with me he laughed a joke on the questura what could i tell them i smiled back at cavallini but my mind was racing the new questions a chance maybe to raise doubts about moretti open just enough space to let him wriggle free cavallini patted me on the shoulder a kind of reassurance well its a question of patience i tell you frankly though i dont like these delays the longer it goes on the more this boy becomes a symbol i told the questore we should move him jesolo maybe verona a facility somewhere out of sight as long as hes in venice the parties throw him at each other this is a crime not politics and look how people use it well here come the ladies but they came trailing suitors so there was another dance before they sat down and another round of drinks before i could rescue claudia by asking her to dance if you dont take me home im going to scream she said in my ear i thought you were having a good time i teased no youre having a good time all your favorite people the police the wonderful giulia you think no one can see you with your heads like that so much to talk about all right just a few more minutes what do you talk about anyway she said her father actually she was offering me a job what she said the word catching in her throat the beginning of a giggle in the maglione businesses a job his daughter offers you a job she said shaking now ssh i said but she pulled back putting her hand to her mouth laughing then gulping her eyes shiny and i realized that she was tipping out of control pushed by drink and tension to somewhere easier funnier his daughter his daughter wants to give you money a reward ssh theyll hear you what about me do i get something too i pulled her close to me stop it go to the ladies roomput some water on your face ill get your coat and go i nodded my face against hers just dont say anything understand i know what job soninlaw ha too late claudia i know ssh she put her finger to her lips i got her off the floor to the ladies room then stood outside for a second shaken wasnt this the way it always happened all the answers the crosschecked times destroyed in a careless moment i went over to the table for her coat sorry but wed better go shes all right giulia said a little too much to drink thats all ill go see if she said getting up no its fine good night and thank you i said taking her hand looking directly at her our secret yes but i am the one who pays cavallini said smoothly a smile in his voice he held up his hand before i could say anything no i insist a wedding gift here let me tell the cameriere he led me away from the table ostensibly to find the waiter but really to move out of earshot you see how remarkable she is after losing a father but i wasnt thinking about giulia i looked toward the ladies room door wondering what was happening inside was she talking to someone being sick my forehead felt moist again nervous sweat and now more trouble but at least we can protect her from this protect her i said distracted this investigationyour rosa we had to start there yes but now its of no importance he takes the medicine he blames gianni what else matters i looked at him already making sure it went right these suspicions about gianni imagine how it would hurt her he nodded toward the table where giulia alone was lighting another cigarette but the defense is bound to bring it up theyd have to well if there is a trial what neither of them wanted now lets hope for her sake he let the rest of the thought float toward the table she was looking out through the smoke toward the band and suddenly i saw her as she would be one of the ladies sitting alone at harrys or florians rich attended by cavallini or someone like him a curiosity finally for the tourists how long would it take years one layer of money at a time the way varnish is spread over a painting to fix the colors i squinted as if i were really looking into crystal waiting for the blur to clear show me my own future but nothing appeared just giulia sitting alone at florians these trials cavallini was saying who wins but the lawyers youre surprised i would say this but ive seen it many times one question then another something that doesnt matter to the crime and now its public an embarrassment worse a reputation ruinedi have seen thisand for what think of signorina grassiniexcuse me signora miller he smiled tipping his head slightly i turned to him confused not sure what connection he was making claudia he put his hand on my arm these are simple people in the questura the obvious thats all they can see in the end what comes of it nothing but meanwhile its a trial so they bring up everything like what excuse me i dont say this myself i know she had a difficult time in that camp and then to have to talk about it but why would she the way vanessi diedyou understand these are simple people everything to them is suspicious of course nothing was ever proven but still they ask their stupid questions do they know how the person feels to talk about this he gripped my arm more tightly a woman who has suffered that way to talk about it thats not justice thats rosas justice forgive me its only my concern for you how you will feel if your wife he stopped as if enough had been said and anything more would overstep i felt his hand the message behind the words literally strongarming me but to do what talk to rosa get her to make moretti confess did he really think that was possible really think moretti had done it or did it matter anymore i stared at him unable to reply alarmed that claudia had been discussed at the questura simple people the way vanessi died ah there you are cavallini said to claudia as she came out youre feeling well i glanced over worried but she was cleareyed herself again yes fine a little tired she moved toward the coat i held up thank you for the wine she said to cavallini an honor he bowed we were standing near the bar the way out and cavallinis gesture caught the eye of a young italian sitting on one of the stools he made a sound to his friends who laughed cavallini turned eh he said a polite warning as if he were in uniform not a doublebreasted jacket il conte permesso the kid said sweeping his hand in front of him cavallini said something quickly in italian which made the group laugh probably because it was the cartoon response theyd expected pompous and middleaged hey youre not going mario with jim and a few others yes it was nice to see you good luck the italian at the bar said something to his friends obviously a wisecrack because cavallini snapped his head around and told him to behave himself what about us dont we get a dance one of the other gis said i mean who else are we going to dance with give it a rest lenny mario winked at us excusing him four drinks and hes the rockettes come on babe one turn around the floor souvenir of venice he moved forward reaching for claudia but jim stepped in between and put a restraining arm around his shoulders next time lenny behind us the italian group started laughing again hey hes all right lennys friend said to jim let him have a turn what the hell the ladys leaving jim said holding up his other hand the ladys leaving the young italian said in english to his friends in a mock singsong then sputtered something in italian clearly obscene and laughed i felt it before i saw it a rush of air next to me cavallinis arm shooting out pushing the italian off his stool and pinning him against the wall by the throat claudia jumped but the rest of us froze stunned by the animal speed of it then the angry growl of words hey one of the gis stepped forward but jim put his arms out blocking everybody not sure what was happening cavallini said something more in italian his voice low with contempt then raised his free hand and slapped the kid striking his face so that one side turned then the other the italians on the stools didnt move the gis now looked confusednot a bar fight something else a practiced brutality official what had been there all along behind walls the rubber hoses and castor oil and boots what he really was claudia gasped some heads turned drawn by the crash of the bar stool and the band faltered for a second as if a shot had gone off then cavallini lowered his hand grabbing the kid by the shirt instead and said something he waited for him to nod before he moved him over to an empty stool and threw him on it limp a laundry bag and took his hand away when he turned to us his face was blank he excuses himself he said to claudia his voice even but for another second no one moved and i just stared unsettled seeing him now as clearly as id seen giulias future we said our goodbyes and then for a while didnt say anything walking through the quiet calles to the accademia bridge ive never seen him like that i said still rattled hes police she said simply was the kid being fresh yes my honor was at stake she said sarcastic so he beats him your friend and you trust this man did you see like a hawk her arm flashed out snatch and its over we stopped at the top of the bridge to look down the grand canal bright tonight with the full moon even the palazzo dario usually dark flickered with light reflecting off the marble and old glass hell snatch us if we stay she said her tone like a counterweight to the view dark and smoky as the club i didnt answer for a minute then shook my head no he has what he wants but now he doesnt know what to do with him he doesnt want to put him on trialhe doesnt want anything to come out about gianni she turned to me then what does he want he wants him to confess and of course he wont how can he so now what they can make him confess not anymore theyd never get away with that now besides hes got protectionnot everybody there thinks he did it cavallini calls it office politics but where does that leave him hes got himself in a box sooner or later hes got to do something look for someone else she said quietly then he looks like a fool for arresting moretti in the first place but the others are talking to people again at the hotel she said worried everybody he said they called my mother were next i guess so wed better be prepared not like tonight you mean i know it was wrong to laugh you dont think no he thought you were a little tipsy thats all okay now theyre coming again she said raising her shoulders a kind of tremor more questions what if i forget you wont forget we dont know we were at mimis thats all just as long as we tell the same story she looked down at the water nothings changed has it she said fingering her ring twisting it we can still give each other away look at tonightone slip oh i know not in court she said stopping me before i could interrupt but thats not everything is it what about the rest we can still give each other away but we wont well go over everything again no surprises by the way what did cavallini mean about vanessithat was the man at the camp how did he die how did he die she said as if she hadnt quite heard or needed a second to think i told you he was killed killed how he talked about this cavallini asked you about this she clutched my arm why did he ask this he thought it would embarrass you to talk about it if it came up at the trial why would it come up she said clutching more tightly if it did no something else hes going to bring it up they never believed me never believed what i knew it i knew they wouldnt stop a man who killed hundreds of people but his death they have to solve not the others just his nothing changes her eyes were darting now as fierce as her grip on my arm the way they had been at the engagement party when she rushed at gianni i stood still watching her afraid of what was coming they suspected you who else his whore why didnt you tell me if they suspected youi have to know these things so we have the same story why do we need a story do you think i did it i said nothing waiting she grabbed both my arms do you do you think that no dont bother i can see it i didnt meani just have to know in case she lowered her head you think its possible i didnt say that and it is isnt it we know it is both of us she nodded pretending to laugh my wedding day well my father doesnt have to see this either my husband so in love with me that she stopped moving away from me touching the bridge youre right we need the same story which one do you want the one you want us to tell i said looking at her no you pick heres onethis is the one the police would prefer were in modena in his flat in bed when hes asleep i take a knife from under the bed and stab him no better hes not asleep hes inside me so of course he never suspects when i reach for the knife stop it you dont like it they would though they always wanted it to be me tell me the other one i came back to the flat and he was lying there with the knife in him who did it anybody think how many would want to you were staying there yes so i was the obvious one no alibi like moretti no ball to go to that time but no proof either and if its me then everything comes out about himwhat he did in the camp why they hadnt turned him over they were supposed to do that but they didnt want a trial like cavallini how they stick together in the end but what were you doing there i dont understand how was it possible to stay with him after the camp how could i do it she said slowly as if someone else had asked the question then she shrugged where was i supposed to go the soldiers come and open the camp and whats their idea another camp refugees then where do we go back to what my fathers dead everyone i knew i could get money there what was the difference i was already a whore and now its all upside down now hes afraid people will come for him afraid of me even that i would give him away you know the allies always wanted the people at the campsnot the magliones just people like him so it ends up that i protect him i dont say anything maybe i felt i owed something to himhe saved my life i had to pay but he did it anyway i went there and do you know what he wouldnt give me any money he said he would but always later another time he wanted it to be like the camp again a prisoner it excited him i think if i was a prisoner so i had to take the money after after after he was killed i hid it so the police never knew i walked out of modena i didnt want them to know i had any money i thought theyd arrest me if i paid for the train so maybe they said it was a robbery i dont know i thought thats the end of it but i knew it wouldnt be and now look how perfect link one with the other if she can do one she can do the other but they cant prove you did it what does it matter they cant prove moretti did itin fact he didnt and they still want to hang him who had a better motive than me im glad hes dead she stopped oh thats what the boy said isnt it in the bar so now were the same nobodys accusing you they would have done it then maybe your friend cavallini gives them new ideas its easy to believe she looked up you believed it why didnt you tell me before what that it was even worse that i was worse i went to him how do you tell somebody these things maybe i wanted you to think she came over and touched my arm then glanced at a couple passing on the bridge and let her hand fall well that was before so what do we tell cavallini what story we dont have to tell him anything theres no link im the link ive always been the linkone murder to the other theres no connection to gianni no not at first at first hes just missing then killed who knows why but then you help them you have to know so now he works with the germans like vanessi now hes someone i would kill she took my arm pressing the point someone i did kill i moved to the right blocking her from the others on the bridge somebody will hear oh she said flinging up her hand everybody hears me but you she turned away and walked fast down the other side so that we were in the campo next to the accademia before i caught up to her and took her by the shoulders listen he believes it happened just the way we said it did we were there at mimis with him hes part of the story hes not looking at us she put her hand on my chest then why dont we go before he does to new york wed be safe there we are safe as long as were together no at first i thought that now maybe its worse can i leave not alone just married and she leaves so we stay and every day they get closer were together but were not safer she killed vanessi why not maglione she held up her left hand showing me the ring you think this protects me no i protect you why because i can tell them about you i looked at her my face suddenly warm but you cant i said slowly neither can i thats the point we protect each other i turned slightly away from her eyes glancing back at the canal in the light from the bridge you could see the waterline on the building the mortar dark and pitted eaten away bit by bit we cant let this fall apart do you understand she said nothing then slowly nodded all right come on i said i reached over to take her hand but she pulled away and walked alone not saying anything until wed crossed san ivo and reached the sluggish back canal the restaurant on the other side of the bridge had already closed and there were no lights in the windows just a streetlamp at either end and the bright moon is this where she saw me yes coming to find you to think if i had waited at the hotel she looked up so maybe shes watching tonight too somebodys always watching us now which one do you think i cocked my head at the window shes not its dark maybe she sits in the dark we kept walking well now she cant see anyway not this far down she didnt see which way gianni turned like this she said pretending to turn left at the end but not this way she turned toward ca venti why not how does cavallini know he turned that way because its the only way that makes sense to him and one day he says what if and he goes this way she started down the calle to us she grabbed the air with one hand snatch and will we be safe then together i stopped we cant walk away we cant let someone hang for this youll never save that boy dont you know that a man like that she said clutching her hand cavallini again he doesnt let go he has his victim what are you going to give him instead a story i turned away i dont know lets wait to hear from frankfurt gianni didnt deal directly with the germansthere was always a gobetween so maybe theres something something what this boy is here right now you want to save him then you have to give them someone else to hang another body she took my hands whose blood do you want on them mine she held them in front of me her hands locked around my wrists and for a second i couldnt breathe trapped in the hermetic logic of it someone else i shook my head but not his either then whose whose would be acceptable to you she dropped my hands who are you going to give them nobody i said but quietly not wanting to hear myself knowing as i said it that she was right that cavallini would never settle for another mystery now with the taste of blood in his mouth hed want a body but he already had one our perfect alibi all we had to do was let it happen i felt something jump in me my skin hot worse than murder you cant save him we have to we have to save ourselves you dont mean that youre just i started to walk then stopped again and waited until she was next to me you dont mean that i repeated we cant live that way how do you think people live in fossoli not out here where its so different i said nothing for a moment looking at her then nodded it has to be you think no ones watching we are were watching or we have to pretend someone is otherwise youre right theres no difference fossoli out here its all the same then is that what you want and what if it is all the same then what im not going to let him die i cant i said an end to it then somebody else will she said its started now somebody will i didnt answer hot again trapped back where wed started somebody would a cat slunk by mewling the only sound we turned into the last calle with the house door at the end she slowed as we got near dragging her feet i turned the latchkey the one that worked not the ornate one near the knob angelina had left on two table lamps near the stairs but otherwise the hall was in shadow all the sconces dark a bottle of champagne was chilling in a silver bucket on the side table angelinas idea for our wedding night but claudia was looking down the hall her arms crossed over her chest rocking a little lets not stay here she said still in the doorway not tonight lets go somewhere else i turned to her we have to stay here i said touching her shoulder how would it look she slumped for a minute then straightened thats right i for got we stay here and wait until he turns the wrong way except that its the right way ssh angelinas upstairs and well be here waiting we can show him where she pointed toward the water gate we can look at it every day while were waiting its okay i said stroking her shoulder its not for long youll get used to it her shoulder moved under my hand almost a spasm as if she had started to laugh but caught it before she could be heard i pressed down feeling the shaking not laughter but she stepped away from me walked over to the ice bucket and picked at the foil over the cork she left champagne we should open it shell be offended her fingers stopped resting on the foil i thought you were something new in my life a new life now look where we are she turned looking at me a new prison i stood still suddenly afraid that she had seen what i couldnt our piece of the crystal its not like that i said she looked at me for another minute as if she had something else to say then gave it up and turned back to the bucket close the door she said i reached behind me to push and because i didnt hold it the heavy weight of the wood swung away from me slamming shut with a clang that sounded like metal loud enough to echo down the hall chapter seventeen theyre going to kill him rosa said thats what it means what shot trying to escape come on rosa we were walking on the waterfront of the giudecca heading toward redentore somewhere public but out of the way rosas request she had called from a cafe to arrange the meeting convinced now that her bauer phone was tapped youre imagining things i dont have time to argue with you the minute i heard i knew what it meant theres no reason to move him you think theres something wrong with the jail in venice cavallini said he was becoming a symbol of what their incompetence they have no case they know that so they have to win some other way its what the germans used to do something happens on the way or theres someone in the new place a grudge they didnt know about fut she waved her fingers youre serious theyre going to kill him she said stopping and turning to me her voice steady certain i said nothing waiting theyre moving him tomorrow night she said starting to walk again you know this a bird told me to vicenza by train so its difficult the stations a trap and once hes on the traina car would be easier there are possibilities between piazzale roma and vicenza even piazzale roma would be betterthere are several ways outbut no its the train possibilities for what what are you planning to do kidnap him im not going to let them kill him so its necessary an action she said slightly excited back in the game are you serious they really will kill him then trying to escape youll be setting him up listen to me they are going to kill him you have to understand that so this is his only chance now do you think were amateurs we did this many many times during the war his father was killed its enough for one family i want the son to live why are you telling me this because youre going to help me yes you owe him this much both of us this never would have started if we hadntwell thats done she raised her eyes but there is an obligation here rosa i was in the army not the commandos a paper pusher so sometimes you leave the desk its not enough files we cant save him with files rosa the wars over over not for him christ i turned away exasperated im not asking you to take any risk she said her voice softer now just leave a door open a door open yours on the canal then what am i supposed to do nothing you wont be there there is no risk to you a little commando raid but no risk for your piece no but i need someone i can trust youre not one of us in the group you dont even know who we are so you cant betray us i have to be careful of that i know you and youd betray me she shook her head then you betray moretti no she looked at me again i know you a little there is an obligation here we have to save him i looked away his only chance just leave a door open i can do this without you but no one suspects you no one thinks to suspect you an american so its perfect perfect i said all worked out but she didnt hear any irony in my voice its important to plan she said and after i open the door she said nothing i stick my neck out but no questions i said youre not sticking it out very far its for your protection id like to know what im getting into at least since i seem to be in it she looked at me then its agreed not yet she nodded come see the church she took my arm starting up the broad palladian steps but no names i can tell you what will happen your part but its better if you dont know the rest all right so they put him on a train i said beginning yes think how difficult the police boat to the station is impossible look at the route canale di cannaregio always crowded the station a culdesac you cant get out so the first likely place they think is maestre over the bridge and theyll be prepared after that theres only padua no other stops but theres vicenza itself theyll have to put him in a car there yes it was my first thought so their first thought too no ha the city of palladio maybe thats why i thought of this place she said opening the doors the inside was stark white unadorned something rare in venice architecture left alone rosa dipped her fingers in a font crossed herself then took a pew in the back an old woman was arranging gladioli in vases on the altar but otherwise the nave was empty a perfect meeting place for a second i wondered if it was one of those churches where voices gathered at the ceiling and then swirled down to some listening spot behind a pillar but rosa suspicious of the bauer seemed unconcerned here she lowered her voice but didnt whisper and what if vicenzas too late you understand we dont know when theyll do ita few days right away we dont know and the train worries me so easy to fall off and people might believe it not like in a car who jumps out of a car her voice fast caught up in it war stories do you really believe this cavallini doesnt want a trial you told me yourself to protect the maglione name because hell lose the name is disgraced and he loses a double loss so another solution one he knows another thing he learned from the germans you think its the first time for him i thought of the arm shooting out to the boys throat i know him a little too so she said already moving past it vicenza maybe its too late maybe everywhere its too late the best thing is if he never leaves venice but theyll have people in the station yes she said her voice eager but not in the yards we have people in the yards a signal delay once the trains over the bridge hes gone but in the yardstheres no one but the guards on the train how long will you have a few minutes but after if we make the boat then we have the advantage the police will be out front in the grand canal by the time they get behind the station were already gone to maestre one boat yes she said her eyes bright watching my reaction where they expect to follow another where they dont expectback to venice a reverse like a football play yes i dont know and then what and then we get off the water we have to expect by this time the alarm is made all the boats are out police boats are fast they can outrun almost anything so they chase to maestre they chase somewhere else looking but theres nothing to see the fox has gone into his hole at ca venti she spread her hands ecco with the boat parked out front no of course not we dont even tie up we dont need long just enough time to drop him off the boat keeps going he stays in the hole then later another boat comes one the police have never seen and if they do catch the first what do they catch only the driver and meanwhile theyve lost the scent and the new boat takes the fox somewhere else that i wont know nobody knows just your piece the first boat doesnt know the second boat no one can betray anyone not this time you dont need ca venti to make the switch you could do it anywhere in venice she raised her eyebrows not so many of us have our own canal entrance i told you no one suspects you if we use one of our own people maybe the police have a list theyll look but nobody looks for you besides the house is convenient close to the channel youve already been there rio di fornace yes she said precise two ends one the grand canal the other giudecca channel two exits not a trap not busy either not at that hour a boat might be noticed i thought of us looking at the bedroom light across the canal afraid to make a splash yes i know just leave the water gate unlocked it takes a minute theres nothing to make people look and youll be out where a restaurant anywhere people will see you you dont know anything about it you werent there you didnt think to lock the gate thats all you dont know do you think theyd believe that no she said smiling faintly but nothing will go wrong theyre not expecting this and if we think the police are right behind us we dont stop i give you my word and what about angelina who the maid she lives there che bella the problems of the rich give her the night off i started to smile in spite of myself then stopped out for the evening no risk the plan already in motion whether i helped or not do you want to save his life yes i said nodding suddenly believing it would happen moretti safe claudia and i happy again maybe on the train he never took then just leave the gate unlocked come on shes finished with the flowers she got up crossing herself again and turned to the door before the woman could see her outside she pulled her sweater tighter an automatic reflex even in the warm spring air whats going to happen to him i said well hide him until its safe who knows maybe theyll find the one who did it maybe i said glancing away and if not then he becomes someone else anyway hes alive she stopped at the foot of the steps and looked across the channel you can see it from here the house its a good plan yes i hope so its your neck she brushed this away its an old neck hes just a boy and to carry this burden now blaming himself how i wish id never talked to him but we were right if that means anything to you gianni was working with the germans yes she said not really interested yesterdays files his brother kept papers it turns out giulia has them gianni was friendly long before he turned up at villa raspelli business partners business partners she said dismissing this and then more after paolo was killed when he found out moretti had been one of you i stopped backing away from her husband what must have happened next but her mind had gone elsewhere still herr kroger with files these papers you can get them no anyway hes dead theyre no use to us now except to know but there must be others people he mentions italians we need shed burn them first its her family i thought you didnt care anymore about gianni him no but the others not care do you know whats happening in italy no an american all you see is this she spread her arm to the view not whats really here you think the fascists have gone away no back again the same people back where they were head of the table magliones the church my god the church she waved her hand the same fingers that had just dipped in holy water made a quick cross at the pew the germans friends we did nothing patrioti and soon everyone will believe it again all patrioti trials thats all in the past and then its too late i dont have time for a dead man but the living to get just one more she lowered her voice she told you about them shell let you read them yes she nodded good just get the names ill do the rest she glanced up sensing my reluctance you asked me once to look at files for you another obligation to me no you know what these people are you saw it in germany that was different yes imagine if it were your countrywhat would you do i stared at her for a minute a bulky figure in a sweater still in combat then looked away id get the names i said so you married an italian youre not a tourist anymore a patriota she smiled a real one she nodded her head toward the vaporetto approaching the landing you go first i have some business here on the giudecca she wagged her finger just your piece unlock the gate then before i could turn toward the dock she put a hand on my shoulder soft as the air a thankyou and the names we could have spent the evening anywhereharrys montinsbut i got the idea of asking for giannis seats at la fenice because it gave me an excuse to go to ca maglione and look at paolos journals i had planned to spend the afternoon but i arrived to find cavallini there having tea a surprise visit and giulia edgy handing me the tickets with an expression that said the library was now out of the question another day one minute and i will walk with you cavallini said holding up a finger giulia gave me a wry your turn look then there was a fuss in the hall about his hat and more goodbyes so it was five minutes before we were finally out on the street walking to santo stefano what is on tonight he said la boheme ah romantic for the newlyweds you like opera i said marking time eager to be away my wife enjoys it perhaps youll see her tonight but not you no not tonight work so late a special assignment i waited but he said nothing we crossed a bridge into a narrow calle smelling of garbage and mold sometimes you know i think its time to leave the police business maybe a position i thought you enjoyed it yes when youre young you dont worry about anything then but now you think what if maybe tonight its your turn i thought there wasnt any crime in venice before no a few robberies like anywhere but now since the war such violence think of maglione murdered all these animosities they dont go away it takes time i said blandly letting him lead yes how long the war teaches them to fight then how do you make them stop its in the blood an excitement the law something to shoot at they forget he said opening his jacket to show me a gun in a side holster we were in the war too i froze staring at the gun dark and bulky something he hadnt carried before why now even in the dim calle the dull steel drew the eye an almost hypnotic pull ready to jump at you if you looked away youre expecting trouble in the police were always expecting trouble he said official again but you never carry a gun yes sometimes but it ruins the suit he brushed his hand down the side showing the bulge the holster made then looked over at me and smiled it worries you the gun he put his hand on my shoulder leading me toward the campo no im an excellent shot but why today he shrugged if theres trouble youre prepared you mean theres going to be what let the police worry but how do you know signor miller he said indulgently there are many ears in venice it has always been so a tradition everyone listens so i know when to be ready he said as we walked into the campo sometimes its good a little trouble people show themselves they come up out of the ground they show their faces you can see who they are he squinted at the cafes with umbrellas out against the spring sun as if he were looking for them now but its true im getting old for this guns at my age one nightyou never know well dont worry he said amused at the look on my face well be ready you go to la boheme i said nothing afraid to press hoping hed volunteer more but he became withdrawn again not so much discreet as preoccupied with something he looked back for a second before we left the square you know a girl like that all alone nowshe may never marry and then who looks out for her of course she has the protection of her family but so many responsibilities he said thinking out loud the gun forgotten i didnt know how to bring it up again without being obvious so i let him talk about giulia not really listening too nervous to pay attention he knew at least one of rosas pieces had failed her more than one the one that led to ca venti the important thing now was to let her know before anyone showed his face walked into cavallinis waiting hands i glanced again at the bulge near his breast pocket ready there were more goodbyes when i turned off for the traghetto i waited counting off seconds then went back to the calle to make sure he had kept going finally spotting his head in the crowd moving toward san marco a few minutes later i followed far enough behind to be out of sight i was halfway across campo san moise to the hotel entrance when it occurred to me that if cavallini knew anything at all hed have somebody watching the bauer i stopped and turned pretending to look at the church but scanning the rest of the square a cafe at the other end would probably have a phone i could get her to come down without having to show myself in the lobby after a few rings the operator asked if i wanted to leave a message i hung up what if she never came back but there was nowhere else to reach her and the cafe had a clear sightline to the hotel so i ordered a coffee and stood at the window to wait she hadnt checked out maybe she was planning a routine afternoon as blameless as an evening at la fenice i had another coffee a small group of tourists stopped to take pictures of san moise kneeling and shooting up to get the full effect of the grimy rococo swirls i craned slightly to the left around them afraid id miss her a man at the other end of the window counter looked at me then quickly went back to his book why did i assume the police would be in the lobbywhy not here with a good view of the door there was no other way out of the bauer except the gondola landing i looked around why hadnt i brought a newspaper no one stood for this long looking out a window unless he was waiting for somebody a meeting the man couldnt miss just glancing up from his book after another cigarette i decided to play it safe and leave but just as i turned i saw claudia coming into the square carrying a wrapped box i dropped my head a reflex the last person i wanted to see i dont want any part of it shed said when i told her rosas plan yesterday you wont have any part of it neither will i we wont be here and you believe her a crazy woman she knows what shes doing its what she did in the war if anybody can get him away yes and when hes gone then where do they look well be out somewhere no connection another alibi shed said turning away but dropping it tired of arguing after that neither of us mentioned it the man with the book now looked at me again i had to be waiting for somebody even somebody i didnt want to see i rapped a coin on the window making claudia turn her head what are you doing here she said after id kissed her made a show of getting another coffee not too loud i think hes police i said moving my eyes toward the other end of the window she glanced over startled its okay just have coffee with me ill explain it later whats in the box lace she said vaguely still distracted by the man a special order at the europa why police what are you doing waiting for rosa i have to warn her she stared at me drink the coffee warn her and then theyll see you together and me i told you i didntim leaving but just then the man closed his book and started going through his pockets for change after dropping a few coins in the saucer he headed for the door see if he goes to the bauer i said my back to the window not wanting to turn around no san marco then there must be someone in the lobby she looked at me disturbed are you crazy now too somebody has to be watching they know they know and youre waiting for her she has to call it off theyll see you with her we just happened to run into each other had a coffee thats all claudia moved to leave but i put my hand on her arm holding her we have to tell her i said shed be walking into a trap oh but not us she looked down at her coffee how long have you been here if theyre watching ill say i was waiting for you i glanced at my watch just give it a few more minutes she has to come back sometime but we had finished another coffee before claudia finally looked over my shoulder and nodded ecco la brigadiera rosa was coming over the bridge improbably with a shopping bag i hurried out an accidental meeting youve been shopping i said a public voice then under it i have to talk to you cavallini knows what she said surprised at my being there come and have a coffee i said still public claudias here she studied me then followed me inside claudia was bringing a new cup over from the bar she handed it to her but didnt meet her eyes barely acknowledging her you have to call it off cavallini knows theyll be waiting for you what she said again loud this time so i leaned closer to her to tell her the rest just a murmur to anyone else barely audible over the steam hiss of the coffeemaker she took it in blankly staring out at the campo when i finished she asked for a cigarette and glanced around the room while i lit it for her calm down she said looking at my fingers shaking a little its the coffeeive been waiting i was afraid i wouldnt get to you in time i didnt know where you were youre panicking she said blowing out smoke no he knows she shrugged it doesnt matter stop worrying itll be all right how can you say that claudia snapped how can it be all right claudia you want to drag everyone down with you claudia said then turned away a frustrated gesture as if she were stamping her foot you cant go through with it now i said quietly we have to they move him tonight so you had a friendly talk so hes wearing a gun this doesnt prove anything you cant take that chance youve got people to think about someone must have talked maybe it doesnt matter of course it does i know everyone just knows his piece but one piece leads to another one of the links breaks the whole thing can fall apart all it takes is one she took a sip of coffee slowing the moment only if he really knows what is going to happen i looked at her and no one does it wouldnt be wise would it if someone did talk you told everybody a different story claudia said including adam a man so friendly with the police you think id tell them the boy didnt think he was betraying us either helping medicine she drew on the cigarette then put it out im never going to be in that house again now stop worrying maybe cavallini thinks he knows something but he doesnt i told you wed be careful you also said they werent expecting you but they are they know something s happening that cant be helped we always knew there was a risk in getting him she looked up but not to you or you she said to claudia so stop scaring yourselves and go home if its true about cavallini you dont want to be seen with me she put her hand on my arm just open the gate if hes coming at all or is that part of the story real she smiled someday ill tell you tonight you see nothing maybe someone was there maybe a ghost she patted my arm thank you for the warning i know you meant it for the best but you dont believe it it doesnt matter if i do its too late to stop it now not if you want to stop it she gathered up her shopping bag but i dont theres no choiceto save him cavallini i cant worry about him you have to the boy could be killed do you want that boys death on your hands do you she said sharply in the moment that followed nobody moved then claudia whod been staring out the window listening stepped away from the counter and put herself between us no nobody wants that she said gently making peace im sorry she said to rosa its just all nerves with us worried for you but if its the only way i looked at her surprised a sudden turn midstream rosa also surprised said nothing just shifted the bag in her hand waiting then well leave the gate claudia said our piece rosa didnt reply just nodded and went out the door i watched her start across the campo dragging her leg then turned to claudia my face a question mark you cant stop her she said you can see that shes going to do it no matter what she picked up the box have you paid i still have to drop this at the europa suddenly business as usual there wont be any way to connect us i said as if we were still arguing but claudia just shrugged resigned to everything now i followed her out and over the bridge to the passage to the europa lined with gondoliers a few of them halfheartedly making a pitch but most just smoking waiting for tourists from the hotel but shes so pigheaded i said what if something goes wrong then shes caught not you claudia said coolly i looked up at her and if hes killed she turned to me her eyes steady then theyll never look anywhere else i stood for a moment vaguely aware of the doorman holding open the door white gloves on the handles claudia walking through but not really seeing any of it my stomach lurching as if we had just stepped off something amazed somehow that no one had noticed us falling signor the doorman said and then i was in the lobby watching claudia hand the box to the man at the front desk and for an odd moment i felt i was looking at someone else no longer just covering tracks wiping away smears of blood wishing for someones death so theyd never look anywhere else a waiter in the terrace dining room smiled unaware that anything terrible had happened through the window i could see salute white and swirling exactly the way it had been when wed flirted on the boat just across the water from where we were now chapter eighteen claudia blotted her lipstick at the mirror then turned and smiled at me okay you like the dress no longer nervous relieved as if some unexpected solution had been handed to us the corner already turned and hadnt it whatever happened tonight would have nothing to do with us sitting at the opera even if it went wrong the other solution because either way wed be free i nodded barely seeing it here help me with my coat we dont want to be late we want them to see us who the montanaris christ i forgot maybe they wont be there you want them to be there our witnesses and was signor miller with you yes all evening and signora miller ha now what do they say youre enjoying yourself isnt that what she wants us to do as if nothings happening she kept her good spirits at the opera despite my restlessness and despite the montanaris forced cordiality they must have had the box to themselves since giannis death because they had already taken giannis front seats and looked awkward when we insisted they keep them there were vague inquiries about giulia the offer of a pair of opera glasses a halfhearted invitation to join them for champagne at the interval and then they turned to face the stage their backs stiff and uncomfortable selfconscious as if they felt they were being watched at least i thought theyd remember our being there claudia using the glasses spied bertie and pointed him out a few seats away from the doges box he was sitting with a priest dressed in satin and i thought of that first cocktail party claudia in simple gray and the priest in scarlet the bestdressed person in the room a hundred years ago i looked at her she was still scanning the room with the glasses interested an evening out the way it was all supposed to be while rosa was doing whatever she was doing i shifted in my chair guns and escape boats and hunched figures darting along the tracksnone of it real somehow like stories told over drinks and this there was bertie in his jewel box red wallpaper and gilded moldings the whole room gleaming with gold dimming now people hushing in a minute there would be music and rodolfo would find mimi and wed sit back annoying the montanaris and no one would find it fantastical at all perfectly normal i thought of berties party again rich foreigners entertaining one another in rented palazzos another puccini world and yet it was rosa and her friends who didnt seem real the orchestra started only a mile away someone might be firing a gun i shifted in my seat again wishing i could smoke and looked around for cavallinis wifeit would be a nice touch if she could say shed seen usbut the darkness made it hard to find anyone beyond the first row of the boxes the train would be leaving the station in a few minutes halting unexpectedly for the signal unless that was no longer the plan something rosa had made up to make me chase the wrong scent but it had to be the yards if they expected to stay in venice maestre would favor the police maybe it was all exactly the way shed told me it would be but which story had cavallini been told there are many ears in venice how much easier now for rosa to be betrayed with the germans gone the partisan groups out of hiding nobody could be that careful there was always something to give you away how many guards did he have on the train they wouldnt suspect anything in the yardstheyd be bored with the delay their guns not even drawn still how long would it take to get them out fire into the surprise something moved over my finger and i jumped claudias hand reaching over just to touch she didnt turn her head and i saw that her eyes were shiny her whole attention given to the music now i heard it too rodolfos love song so beautiful that it seemed no one could have written it just found it floating somewhere above the ordinary world if this was possible anything was i looked down at her hand we could be happy why shouldnt it work rosa knew what she was doing gianni was gone and we had an alibi the germans had gotten away with murder the whole world even in venice as beautiful as the music everyone had an alibi somewhere else when the air raid sirens covered the sounds of people being dragged off i didnt know i didnt realize i had my own life to consider and of course everyone did i checked my watch theyd be in boats now streaming off to maestre or wherever they were really going later wed go home and not know whether theyd been there or not i put my hand over claudias hearing the music again why shouldnt it all work signora montanari developed one of her headaches after act i and they left with apologies and improbable hopes of seeing us again instead we had champagne with bertie i dont blame them a bit he said watching the montanaris go act i is bliss and then everything goes wrong think how it ends i sipped more champagne uneasy again of course the good monsignor loves the death part he said nodding toward the priest now talking to someone else divine retribution i suppose for all that lovely sin what is going on filomena will be furious she hates being reminded hes in the police i followed his look past the priest to the bar where signora cavallini had been approached by two policemen their uniforms so showy that for a second it seemed they were part of the opera she was frowning putting down her glass to leave what is it do you think i said quickly find out adam he said pretending to be offended but maybe somethings happened he looked at them again debating then tapped his champagne glass i could use a topup right back he hurried to the bar just in time to catch signora cavallini they talked for a second then he put his hand on her arm reassuring and shooed her away with the uniforms theyve taken him to hospital hes been shot bertie blinked dont be ridiculous why would he be shot in venice its probably nothingthey check in here with a sneeze shot he peered over his glasses this flair for melodrama ever since you joined the force i should go maybe hes adam he said his tone like a physical restraint a hand on my chest stop being a ninny and finish your drink his wife is with him he drank some champagne id no idea you were so close its not that then what is it i think all this business has gone to your head unless its the wine i think ill finish that he said taking my glass and pouring some wine into his own and then before i could protest you dont have to sit with the monsignor there was more of this even a few dull minutes with the priest before the warning bell rang and i didnt hear any of it my head buzzing with shots why else would cavallini be taken to the hospital but it was cavallini whod been shot which meant that moretti might have gotten away unless they were all still there littered across the yards everything gone wrong in our box lights down i tried to focus on the stage but now even the music was drowned out by the buzzing in my head instead of the cafe momus i was seeing the train doors closing the smooth glide out from the platform then the jerky stop in the yards for the light thenthen what the worst of it was not knowing but bertie had been right catching me in time before an absurd rush to the hospital how would i have explained that a hunch i checked my watch again theyd be long gone from ca venti by now assuming theyd ever come why not do what i was supposed to do enjoy the opera while the house sat there open and waiting like an overlooked piece of evidence do you want to go claudia said at the next intermission we should stay see it through scratching your knees and squirming in your seat do you think im seeing it either she reached over and touched me if cavallinis shot maybe they got away come on everyone has already seen us and what excuse if anybody asks you think only the montanaris get headaches we took the traghetto near the gritti standing up as we crossed looking toward mimis dark landing i thought of the footmen and umbrellas and torches leading the guests into the hall the jumpy apprehension id felt then too not knowing if it would work our calle was quiet and the door was locked as it was supposed to be only a single nightlight so angelina wasnt back yet i turned on the hall lights the sconces shining all the way to the stairs beyond through the wroughtiron and glass door the water entrance was dark maybe untouched i walked down the hall and opened the inside door putting my hand up to the light switch no no lights rosa crouching in a corner a disembodied voice from a dark pile they might see help me with him i went over to the pilemoretti with his head leaning on her in the dim light coming from the hall i saw the cloth she was holding against him blotched with blood my god do you have a towel im using my slip the worst of it has stopped so not an artery there was a whimper behind me claudia stood still for a second her mouth open as if she were about to scream what are you doing here you said no one would be here lies i knew it then she took in the bloody cloth a towel rosa said again a towel claudia said a faint echo her eyes still wide and something to clean the wound i couldnt leave him but claudia was already running down the hall to the stairs cavallini was shot i said i hope so what happened she indicated moretti they shot him before we could get him off the train they must have had orders if anything happens shoot him first how bad is it hes bleeding not an artery hed be dead but we have to get him to a doctor he wont make it like this whens the pickup boat she shrugged the link that broke he should have been here long ago we have to assume hes not coming but he knew where to get you if they break him theyll come here he wont break everybody breaks rosa i said angry we have to get the boy out of here she glared at me then nodded then we use your boat my boat you have to take us that was always the plan wasnt it claudia said angrily from the doorway there was never any other boat her voice quivering edging toward hysteria does it matter rosa said to me hell die oh my god claudia said the blood its all over we have to clean it up before anyone sees she knelt and began to wipe the stone floor yes it matters i have to know how much time we have was there another boat i had raised my voice almost shouting yes so no time lets get going first him let me see the wound i took claudia by the shoulders and held her until they stopped shaking you all right can you do this me dont you remember im good at it she said her voice catching i shot her a look then glanced down at rosa but rosa was busy now peeling off the soaked cloth here i brought some brandy this is peroxide for the wound thatll kill him i said maybe we should chance it bullets still in anyway thats where the real infection no we dont chance it rosa said taking the bottle ill get another towel claudia said eager to leave rosa gave moretti some of the brandy sitting him up so he wouldnt choke and i saw that he wasnt unconscious just scared and quiet keeping his eyes closed against the pain shock had drained his face pale making him look even younger so that the stubble of beard from his days in jail seemed out of place ink from another sketch this is going to hurt rosa said pouring some of the peroxide on a towel he nodded and clenched his teeth playing patient and then the towel touched him a searing shock and he screamed a yelp that raced out of the room and down the canal rosa clamped a hand over his mouth to muffle the scream making him fight for air his body writhing so that when she finally took it away he was panting exhausted from it the way a seizure subsides into twitches claudia raced back into the room are you crazy she said not really to anyone then she saw morettis face theyll hear she said softly youll give us all away she took the peroxide back from rosa and handed her a towel put this on him where is the doctor how far far rosa said theres no time for that claudia snapped tell us where the lido the lido claudia said with the police in the lagoon what do we say if they stop us oh just something we picked up you want to go there go alone dont kill us too i dont know anything about boats she looked down at moretti then call an ambulance take him to the hospital they already shot him once you think theyll stop now claudia bit her lip thinking can you take a bullet out in the war they did that no doctors you were a partisan you rosa shook her head its too deep he needs a doctor instruments all right we can call an ambulance from the zatterewe can carry him that far no one will know about you yes about us do you want everyone caught at least he can live hell be safe there in the hospital was your father safe there claudia looked away then went back to the floor scrubbing it clean doing something why the lido i said theres a car there they wont know about it the next link we can get to jesolo theres a doctor i know if hes still alive i said watching moretti who was breathing heavily in a series of grunts you cant involve us in this claudia said what can we say theyll think we were part of it attacking police there its gone what do we do with the towel she held it out to me rosa looked up at me we cant take him to the hospital you know that there is an obligation here i glanced around the room thinking the police were on the water not searching the calles could he walk mimis wasnt far a few deserted blocks away but how could we take him there anywhere were you followed here i said rosa shook her head no so only the pickup boat knows youre still here yes the policell be on the lagoon maybe not so many she said bargaining they cant stay out all night they have to think we went to maestre no one will think of the lido its the wrong way that was the plan yes and look how well its worked claudia said hes here isnt he if we can get to the lido we can get him away she turned to me theyre not looking for your boat i took in the canal steps the boat tied to its mooring pole barely moving in the calm water if they were keeping watch nearby theyd be in the giudecca channel not the other end nobody in his right mind would head for the grand canal all lights and vaporetti and tourist gondolas the way to maestre the mainland was up the channel to piazzale roma and the bridge that would be the way to escape not out toward the lagoon and the open sea rosa was rightthey wouldnt think of the lido the trick would be getting past venice itself the curve of bright lights around the basin without even a shadow to hide behind a long trip in any case too long for someone with a stomach wound groaning between channel markers and now theyd be hours late what if he didnt wait the driver theres no one just the car and youre going to drive i can drive a car but not a boat i said to myself then looked at her its not going to work rosa you have to give him up hes not guilty claudia said if theres a trial its too late for that rosa said a policeman was killed how do you know you didnt know if cavallini was shot i didnt shoot cavallini she said calmly in the silence that followed you could hear the creaking of moored boats in the canal anybody see you i said quietly rosa shrugged it was dark maybe maybe they saw him she said looking down at moretti you understand they dont need a trial for maglione anymore now they have this i said nothing my eyes darting around the room againthe hanging gondola the paving stones nothing changed feeling as trapped and anxious as that night only the water the calle entrance was impossiblesomeone would see and where would we carry him gianni had been dead something you could slip over the side moretti would have to be taken all the way loaded into the car if he survived the trip and if he didnt i saw us pitching him into the water a macabre repetition everything happening all over again you have to get him out of here claudia said maybe seeing it too shivering as if she were back in the boat its not fair to be blamed for this go then rosa said somewhere after the opera if they come you wont be here ill say you never knew i came to steal the boat theyd believe that stealing the boat you wouldnt even get the motor started i said ill row then what do you want me to do sit let him bleed to death nobody said anything waiting for someone else to move moretti on the floor fumbled in his jacket and pulled out a gun aiming at me take us he said stop rosa said theyre friends but morettis eyes were blunt beyond niceties i stared at the gun feeling dislocated a gun where we used to give parties all he had to do was squeeze the trigger give it to me rosa said holding out her hand then fondly imbecile he lowered the gun not giving it to rosa but putting it back in his pocket where did he get a gun i asked the guard who shot him its the one he used so we took it after i tried to imagine the scene in the yards the guard slumping forward rosa helping the boy across the tracks a confusion of shots the boat racing away from the pier or that moment earlier when shed fired at the guard not the first how many had there been paolo and all the others i wondered if it got easier or if each time was like gianni with blood pounding in your head what happened to the other guard he was ours she said simply and now the others would kill him no end to it the war that kept going the only thing real to her but not to me nothing to do with me it must have been utterly still because the doorbell when it rang was louder even than morettis scream claudia jumped oh dio she said frantic looking at the bloody towel in her hand rosa sat up rigid clutching moretti somebody heard claudia said a gasp angelina i said thats all she rings with a key she held out the towel in front of her as if it were alive about to bite her i stood for a moment almost dizzy my head turning left right anywhere all right i said finally pretending calm get over there behind the stones i stepped over to help rosa drag moretti behind the pile get under the tarp its probably angelina ill come back when she goes up just stay there what do i do with this claudia held out the towel panicking under here come on quick we need to see if anything shows i said tucking the side of the tarp down there was a murmur from underneath you okay i loosened the edge letting some air in the doorbell rang again not a sound not a sound i said grabbing claudia we were upstairs it took us that long to answer she nodded and i closed the wroughtiron door i hurried down the hall momento i said out loud when i reached the door i looked over my shoulder to see claudia standing halfway up the stairs patting her hair everything in place only her eyes startled i opened the door and heard the blood in my head again so home early cavallini said i saw the light inspector i said dumbly staring at his arm wrapped in white bandages and set in a sling are you all right at the opera the policemen yes i know poor filomena to worry her that way i spoke to them acting like women a scratch and she comes for the last rites well maybe wives hope for that he said genial he looked toward the stairs signora miller buona sera she nodded stiff you enjoyed the opera i stepped aside to let him in behind him a uniformed policeman waited by the door yes but i had a headache she said wary i was just going to bed im sorry to come like this but what happened what do you mean a scratch i said trying to remember what i was supposed to know if id only been to the opera a bullet but not serious you know i felt today something might happen a superstition remember a bullet you were shot he smiled there was an incident i told you i expected something tonight i didnt know you meant tonight well whenever we moved moretti we moved him tonight but what happened he was shot so they defeat themselves hes dead we dont know hes still with them but well find him still with who communists so of course this is what they do always the same methods was anyone else hurt yes he said solemn now he murders police moretti he nodded this time you can be sure i said nothing i thought you would be interested cavallini said thats why you cameto tell me no no why i came he looked around as if for a second hed forgotten to ask you i glanced toward the stairs where claudia was still standing her hand gripping the rail did you know that your canal gate was open the canal gate i said yes its open did you know was i supposed to know how else could it have been opened yes i left it open in case we took a taxi home from the opera but you didnt no you permit me to see he said starting down the hall yes if you want whats it all about your boat is still there not stolen i suppose so i havent looked i never thought claudia was following us now walking tentatively as if she were bracing herself for each step someone stole the boat she said signora im sorry i didnt mean to disturb you ah this door is not locked he opened the door to the water entrance youre very trusting signor miller the light i drew a breath and flipped on the switch listening for a sound any rustling of the tarp under the yellow overhead light the dark clumps were only partly illuminated still leaving shadows around the edges i took in the smell damp stone and musty wood but nothing more any boathouse even the peroxide faded now something that might have come in from the canal yes cavallini said taking stock remembering the gondola i walked toward the steps trying to draw him away from the tarp the boats here why did you think it was stolen we had information they would come here i wondered if rosa could hear under the tarp everybody breaks here why here your friend rosa this is how they are she knew you were going to the opera i dont know how would she know no matter that type they would steal under your nose they came here theyre in the house claudia said looking frightened upstairs drawing him away too no no dont be alarmed they dont want to stay in venice they want to leave venice i thought perhaps they came for the boat but as you can see he waved his hand to the mooring post so a change of plans you were lucky he said to me but we should look upstairs if theyre hiding claudia said trying to move us through the door would that make you feel easier signora one of my men can search if you like you think its foolish i think its careful he said politely and you he said to me lock the gate he turned from the water stopping again to look up at the gondola on its supports you mean they might still come i said no its late i thought if the boat were missing it would be a clue they wont come here now they need to leave venice and who helps them foreigners no old comrades you know moretti worked on the boats we know where to look but still lock the gate yes i said stepping past him to pull it shut making a loud clang with the latch i could feel beads of sweat on my forehead any noise echoed here you could hear the boat rocking against its mooring why not breathing the faintest movement a beautiful thing cavallini said still looking up at the gondola to find an old one in this condition the marchesa never takes it out i said but i wasnt looking at it claudia had glanced just once toward the pile and now was signaling me eyes large and panicky forcing me to look there too at first it just seemed a thin shadow on the gray stones but then i saw that it was moving growing longer coming toward us dark blood seeping out from under the tarp to follow gravity to the stairs impossible to miss if cavallini turned his head claudia stared at me and for an instant i stopped breathing because we both saw that in another minute it would be too late if we stepped back now we could stay free still unsuspecting visitors in someone elses fight moretti might die anyway but if we hid them we became them the same in cavallinis eyes the blood viscous moved a little just a trickle almost at my shoe now there would be no story that would distance us and make sense wed have to go through with all the rest save them when all we had to do to save ourselves was to let it happen claudia could do it alone look down at the blood in horror until cavallini noticed but she was waiting for me wed do this together too the same room just a trickle this time not a red splotch on a white dress shirt but the same pulsing in the head jumping off the end they couldnt stay hed die there was only the impossible trip across the lagoon and nowhere to go after no alibi unless we stepped back now pointed to the blood surprised and stayed safe i breathed out i moved between claudia and the pile and put my hand on cavallinis shoulder can we ask your men to search i said i really think claudia would feel better he looked down from the gondola but at claudia not me missing the blood i moved us toward the door dont turn now a trickle would anyone see it if he wasnt looking but nobody missed blood the eye went to it an instinct of course cavallini was saying claudia glanced at me for a second dismayed then slipped into her part and the closets i know its foolish she said leaving for the hall not at all cavallini said as i turned out the lights and closed the inside door behind me he used two of his men who made a halfhearted show of poking in closets and looking behind shower curtains i followed with cavallini but in my mind i saw the trickle growing thicker a red stream running over the stone floor down the mossy steps spreading out into the canal a giant stain in the middle of the search angelina came home and had to be calmed down so we went through her room too the men covered every inch of ca venti all of it innocent nothing to connect us except the blood spreading on the floor downstairs the one place they didnt search because cavallini had already been there at the door he offered to leave one of his men if it would make you feel safer a guard outside listening do you think we need it he made a dismissive gesture with his eyebrows no to be frank with you i need every man tonight you know how it is but if the signora shell be all right ill lock the doors both of them she just needs rest if we can get angelina to bed ive never seen her so jumpy youd think shed robbed a bank her brother he said what well not banks the black market during the war of course not now but she thinks we still want him ill tell you something he said almost winking we never did it was the only way then i bought from him myself he looked at me we have our own ways here a message a reminder or maybe nothing at all i heard a creak someone moving and felt my scalp itch every sound in the house now a finger pointing at me a single groan would do it while he was still in the house thank you for coming claudia said with your arm its nothing he said moving the sling a demonstration still i said a bullet wound thats never just a scratch no he lifted his head did you hear something a gasp of pain unmistakable maybe moretti clutching his stomach i felt my hand move a tic say anything the house it makes noises i said casually trying to sound unconcerned cavallini listened for another minute then reached for the doorknob these old houses he said turning it with me pipes all night he shook his head venice not bothering to say more as if we could hear the city sinking around us when the door closed i leaned against it breathing listening for footsteps claudia didnt move either frozen for a minute by relief i put a finger to my lips stepping closer to her so that we couldnt be heard go get angelina settled i said tell her ill lock up keep a light on in the bedroom so it looks like were still up i switched off the hall lights something cavallinis men would see from the calle and walked with claudia in the dark toward the stairs turning on a small nightlight on the hall table check the canal from upstairssee if any boats are waiting ill get them ready we cant wait too long she stopped placing her hand on the banister if we do this the rest was all for nothing we cant explain this she clutched my arm we can stilltheres nothing to connect us let them steal the boat and just turn away its our lives theirs too i took her shoulders steadying her all we have to do is get him to the lido then were done with it were finally done with it she looked down then turned to the stairs were never done with it she paused what do i tell angelina tell her cavallinis watching the house thatll keep her in bed she started up the stairs not too long okay just keep one light on so they think were here chapter nineteen we waited another twenty minutes cleaning the water entrance and listening for any signs of activity on the canal a water taxi passed cutting through to the giudecca channel but otherwise it was quiet a backwater i swung the boat around from the mooring pole the canal itself was dark the moon covered by convenient clouds moretti was still conscious able to crawl into the boat without our having to lift him but he was gasping obviously in pain he lay down in the front rosa next to him claudia threw in the wad of bloody towels we cant keep these in the house here get under this she said spreading the tarp over them imagining it could hide them if we were stopped behind us the pile of paving stones was bare i pulled the gate just to the point before it would click shut so that it looked closed from the water we glided away from the house hugging the edge of the canal if the police were anywhere theyd be in the giudecca channel but if theyd given up it was still our best route out so i decided to check i pushed against the building wall letting us float quietly toward the end of the canal the daytime traffic was gone it might be worth a chance a quick dash to san giorgio then behind the island the way wed gone with gianni we had almost passed under the zattere bridge into the open water when i saw it an idling boat with a blue light waiting to see if anyone came out i grabbed a mooring pole and held the boat back until it began to pivot twisting around in the other direction with the police boat patrolling wed have to keep the motor off we could make our way back down the fornace by pushing against the side but farther on some boats were moored and wed have to swing out using the oars on both sides indians in a canoe police i said to claudia well have to use the grand canal she said nothing just stared at ca venti as we passed no turning back ahead a gondola was approachingno passengers just someone heading home come here i said to claudia pulling her to me and kissing her the only thing wed be doing at this hour on a quiet canal she put her hand on the back of my neck then rested her forehead on mine both our faces hidden adam she whispered shaking ssh its going to be all right i heard the faint splash of the gondoliers pole in the front of the boat rosa peeked out from under the tarp hes gone she said but i stayed with claudia for another minute locked together my head filled with her it was going to be all right near the grand canal it was lighter and more important noisier a vaporetto was heading across the water its noise loud enough to cover the sound of our own engine i waited until it was closer then started ours no trouble this time the cord caught and the engine roared loud enough to bounce off the walls of the buildings or maybe just loud to us listening for it an ordinary motorboat usually an insect buzz in venices water traffic i nosed us out to the broad canal the police boat was off to the right a bookend to the other with the same blue light it was standing guard near the center of the canal with sight lines not just to us but to the traghetto stand across anything streaming down to san marco the terrace lights were on at the gritti i idled the boat for a minute churning the water but not going anywhere theyd blocked the fornace just in case if they spotted us here they could radio to the other end and trap us in between over by the gritti a pack of tourist gondolas went by with lanterns what you saw at this hour at the hotel end of the grand canal taxis at the europa the monaco a few private boats going to harrys but not a single motorboat with a young couple and a bulky tarp farther down the lights of salute reflected on the water then there was only a brief shadow before san marco lit up everything nowhere to hide the vaporetto was getting closer lumbering toward salute on our side of the canal as slow and bulky as a land bus big enough i lifted my head as if id been shaken awake then looked in both directions san marco was impossible easier to double back to the giudecca but not on the fornace the trick would be to catch the vaporetto at the right moment even at this speed there wouldnt be any leeway i watched it get nearer its bulk coming between us and the rest of the canal and then as it reached the fornace i put the boat in gear and shot out to run along its starboard side invisible to the police while i chugged along in its shadow we began to rock a little in the wake a few people on deck noticed us one waving us away with his hand warning us in another minute the vaporetto would head for the salute landing station squeezing me but not before we passed the rio della salute still blocked from view and i swung away and headed down the side canal the salute rio ran parallel to the fornace but farther down almost at the customs house if i entered the giudecca there away from the waiting police boat i might be able to run along the dark side of the dogana and reach the bacino at its tip pulling toward san marco into the grand canal boats patrolling area but too far away to be seen if i could outrun the giudecca boat this canal was narrower than the fornace and even quieter only a few people lived at this end of dorsoduro wedged in between the great church and the customs house we were out of it in minutes turning left to hug the tip of land almost afraid to look back we had no lights to see and our motor was far enough away to be indistinctno reason to notice us at all just keep going in seconds wed be out of range theyre coming rosa said facing backward maybe just to look a routine check but the minute i speeded up theyd know without even having to pull back the tarp claudia turned around spotting the light too go behind san giorgio she said like before we cant well never lose them there at least its dark there remember nobody saw us nobody was chasing us i said okay hold on its going to bump rosa hang on to him rosa who had been watching us just nodded we passed the tip of the customs house with its golden ball and i swerved slightly to the left streaking across the basin toward the doges palace then along the curve of the riva the one place in venice id wanted to avoid open and bright center stage but also busy with traffic boats to the islands and danieli taxis and ferries leaving for the adriatic i realized that unexpectedly the boats here became trees in a forest something to dodge around slip behind we passed san zaccaria passed the rio dei greci the way to the questura heading finally toward the darker end of venice the empty public gardens and the lagoon beyond in the lagoon still covered by clouds we could make it we hit the wake from another boat lifting up then smashing down with a thud water spraying over everything moretti cried out our speed now was drawing attention too fast for the harbor if i could pull away into the city again thread us somehow through the back of castello we might lose the police but the canals were a maze here watery blind alleys the police hadnt outrun us yet just a few more seconds and wed be in the dark on cue a searchlight came on behind hitting the water next to us in a long white beam then moving left until our boat was flooded with light claudia ducked lowering herself out of sight i swerved but whoever was operating the light had the rhythm of it now and followed us tracking us smoothly in a minute there would be a horn someone yelling at us to stop my mouth went dry there are two rosa said only one has the light calculating odds what she must have been like on their other raids harrying germans moretti crawled out from under the tarp and pulled himself along the side of the boat we hit another wake and i could see him grimace pain and something more a frantic desperation blinking against the glare as if the light itself were hitting him making him hurt then almost before i could register what was happening his hand came up and a gun went off a roar past my ear claudia screamed he fired again and suddenly the light went off hit or just temporarily doused stop it youll kill us claudia shouted jumping at him and grabbing the gun it was rosa who snatched it however handing it over to claudia and pulling him back to the tarp what can you hit like this she said to him gently putting the towel back on his wound she pulled out her own gun dont worry you she said to claudia can you shoot no stop if we do this the light came on again touching the edge of the boat and then there was gunfire bullets hitting the water next to us we crouched down claudia and rosa peering back at the police boat i kept steering bobbing my head a moving target there was a sharp thunk behind me a bullet hitting wood not far from the motor not far from any of us real bullets i felt everything rushing out of control cut the engine hold up your hands it was time to stop real bullets get the light rosa said steadying her hand and firing a marksmans stance theyre going to kill us all and hes going to die anyway claudia said her voice jagged then take one with you rosa said shoot its fossoli and this time you have a gun claudia looked at her its the same people shoot but it was rosa who shot taking her time careful then smiling when she heard the ping of metal glass smashing and the light suddenly went out another burst of gunfire hit the water next to us i could hear yelling on the boat behind confusion our one second chance it didnt matter where the back canals went if we stayed here wed be killed i pushed the tiller hard and the boat veered left heading straight for the nearest canal a high bridge dark water behind only a few streetlights after the riva it was only after wed passed under the bridge that i saw the tall brick towers at the end of the rio the crenellated walls stretching out from the water entrance the arsenale the republics old shipyard silent now for years navy property but not lockeda vaporetto route went through it past the walledin docks and out the other end a shortcut to the northern lagoon i looked behind us the police had seen the turnoff were now racing toward the bridge at the rio entrance only the usual boat lights no more beacon in the arsenale it would be almost pitchdark just a few corner lamps for night watchmen nothing came through here but the vaporetti and nothing got out if you stopped up either end i tried to remember its shape from the mapa box of water surrounded by warehouses and ships works a rio out in each direction not completely hemmed in a connecting boatyard to the right a longer way out but an alternative unless the navy had closed it off if they were here at all what ships were left would be in taranto nothing had been built here since the first war the foundries the ropemakers were all just memories something to mention to tourists as they sailed through a deserted factory on water and a trap if we couldnt make it through i had decided to head right toward the connecting boatyard when i heard the shot behind us close enough to shoot again someone leaned out of one of the tower windows shouting guarded after all but what were they guarding in a moment i saw i made an abrupt turn after the towers hoping for a clear path to the other boatyard and instead found myself surrounded by ghost ships the arsenale was dotted with yellow fog lights everything shuttered the docks lined with rusting premussolini warships a ship graveyard clotted enough to obscure the opening to the adjoining basin but now it was too late to head back to the lagoon i could hear the police boats already at the entrance towers still wed have to try nobody would stay in a bottleneck but thats what they would think too i turned the boat once more an old warship lay almost listing against the dock its wide middle close enough to board by jumping but its tapered bow and stern sitting out in the water i made another quick turn almost fishtailing then cut the motor behind the stern bobbing in a narrow slot of water between the rusting hulk and the stone walls of the dock the boat rocked and i grabbed a rope from the dock to hold us steady until our wake had subsided then i pulled us farther in making sure the boat didnt stick out past the warships stern a hiding hole dark nothing to see but rusting steel everything now was soundthe motors of the police boats shifting gears idling while they looked around footsteps running past the workshops presumably the guard from the tower shouts out to the water unintelligible but excited wanting to know what was going on the creaking of ships pulling against ropes i looked up the warship was secured to keep any movement to a minimum ropes stretched taut from stern to dock probably the same at the bow but that didnt mean it couldnt move the water churned up by the police boats rocking the stern just enough to push it closer to the dock crushing us the others were looking at it too their eyes fixed on the old metal watching it as if they were waiting to put up their hands to stop it coming closer no one spoke rosa leaned down putting her head next to morettis ready to cover his mouth if he made a sound on the water the boats had come together their motors in the same place conferring but they were running out of time if they searched the arsenale and found nothing theyd lose any advantage on the open water i heard the boats shift gears separating but which way would we have gone the northern outlet toward murano or the longer arsenale basin the directions were oppositea wrong guess meant wed get away then one motor got fainter moving toward the lagoon and the other seemed almost on top of us someone yelling one more thing to the guard before it passed by the stern of our ship and then to the next basin finally rosas reverse play the police off in all directions except the one i intended to use back to where i had started we waited another minute to make sure the police had really gone then edged our way out from behind the warship for a moment i thought of just drifting with the oars slipping past the guard in silence the way wed gone down the fornace but we were running out of time too every second crucial if we wanted to get out before the police realized they were chasing shadows what could the guard do call out the navy mothballed in taranto the last scraps of mussolinis war i started the engine and swung around the big stern the guard may have seen the boat but none of us looked back just headed straight down the canal to the open water we had a real chance now to catch up the police would have to go all around the tail end of venice skirting san elena minutes behind we passed under the bridge and shot across the water toward the channel lights i peered into the darkness trying to measure how far i could see past the buoys before everything was swallowed up still no moon we wouldnt need to hide behind anythingthe air itself would do it if we were outside the range of the lights but it was a fine line too far and you risked shallows is he okay i said to rosa it gets choppier out here she didnt say anything just held him a cushion where is the car the casino the big parking lot at the vaporetto landing stage where it would be easy to be overlooked in the crowd no at the end the excelsior the excelsior its not open yet no one will be at the dock its easy to find all worked out the next link not in the dark well have to go to the casino and then follow the lights down no go straight across that was the idea no one will see us you cant cross the lagoon in the dark thats why they mark the channels its a shallow boat but the lagoon could be even shallower that was what had always protected venicenot water but mud sometimes only a few feet under the surface sometimes less rising in little underwater islands we cant go at this speed if we hit something we could wreck the boat if they come for us theyll look in the channel she said i nodded all right but itll take more time can he wait he was lying still under the tarp maybe passed out yes she said now i looked at her face suddenly soft hes dead oh claudia said a whimper are you sure rosa pulled back the tarp as if seeing him his perfectly calm face would be evidence in the arsenale i didnt want to say then we were still moving slowly in a direct line to the far lights of the lido i looked around checking for boats then back at his face streaked with blood where he had wiped it sweating a kind of camouflage effect in the dark a boy whod delivered medicine better cover him up i said not wanting to look anymore im sorry rosa said quietly and for an odd second i thought she was talking to me but her face was turned to his words to a comrade claudia moved forward and helped her with the tarp folding it around him lets go back she said they wont expect that we can hide you get you away somehow tomorrow it was the wound that was the problemwe couldnt hide him he would have died he did rosa said but claudia wasnt really listening busy with the tarp absorbed now in a new plan do you think they saw our faces she said to me in that light the boat could be anyones we could go back nobody would know i cant stay in venice rosa said they know it was me even if they didnt see she said spreading her hand to take in the boat they know it was me theyll hunt for me not at ca venti claudia said they already did and what do we do with him rosa said quietly is there some rope claudia said its better if its tied the tarp will come loose even if we roll it she was folding it under him talking to herself how can we weight it not that it matters you use those big stones and itll come up anyway nothing keeps it down its the tides isnt that what they said the tides loosened the tarp she turned to me well have to explain why this one is missing theres nothing over those stones now someone might notice i looked up to find rosa watching her studying her face you want to put him in the lagoon this boy hes dead yes claudia said rosa looked out to the dark then shook her head not to the fishes ill take him in the car with a body where hes carlos son she said simply i cant just throw him over the side two can do it claudia said not hearing her the boat wont tip an expert rosa said dismissive then turned to me theyll find the car then its someone else they can trace it she shrugged you will never get me out of venice not now this is the best way get me there then its my risk and when they ask how you got there claudia said when they ask rosa said they wont ask me anything if they can ask ill be dead she said it casually sure of things a car punctured with bullet holes the only way it would be stopped but it could happen the other way too an undetected dash to jesolo then the whole veneto to disappear in taking the body to friends youre not turning around claudia said after we drop them i said we cant keep her in venice the train station would be swarming with police the highway bridge guarded not even a tarp to hide under whos that claudia said swiveling around a distant engine a light shining in front coming slowly not police rosa said fishermen maybe they go out at night have they seen us not yet soon rosa said pull to the left i turned the boat slightly on an angle now to the channel markers stretching across the lagoon like highway lights the fishing boat would pass without even noticing us heading for the opening to the adriatic the chugging was nearer a steady hum then suddenly as if it had found a road it sped up moving its lights right to left to make sure its whole path was clear on the swing left the light caught us something unexpected in the dark a man shouted the boat came toward us shining its beam down where are your lights the man yelled in italian whats wrong just people in distress i idled the engine broken rosa yelled back its all right were fixing it youll get run over go back to the channel he said waving his arms someone will pick you up were all right were going to the lido bah he said in the dark sciocci this to the other fishermen disgusted by our ineptness then follow us its another channel i turned my head away from the light looking toward the main channel markers the string of white now with a small blue light moving along it rosa police tell them to go the policell see us i imagined someone with binoculars scanning drawn to the spot of light two boats one familiar rosa shouted something up forced and hearty and the fisherman laughed but turned the boat moving the light away it started out again its luck for us rosa said we can follow them they know the channels what did you say to him i told him to stop looking down my dress i opened the throttle following the fishing boat but keeping far enough back to stay in its shadow we were making better time now getting closer i looked left keeping the blue light in sight one of the night ferries to trieste was coming up behind it in the channel and in the bright lights i could see it clearly now a police boat probably the one that had spun off through the arsenale yard the ferry passed and the blue light kept following the channel the only place we could sensibly be are they still there claudia said watching me yes but theyre heading for the casino and then they werent the blue light swung out into the lagoon drawn irresistibly to the fishing boats light cutting straight across to it damn i slowed down letting the fishermen run ahead watching the police boat race toward them the fishing boat was making for the end of the lido the outlet to the adriatic past the big beach hotels its path drew the police boat right in front of us a slice of light that crossed up ahead and then kept going leaving us alone again in the dark go faster claudia said theyll come back we cant we dont know how shallow it is the excelsior boats go there she said but i didnt answer trying to concentrate on the water ahead in what little light there was the casino was miles down to our left the fishing boat trying to leave the lagoon to our rightwe should be heading straight for the hotel in the day wed see the white turrets poking through the trees now thered be nothing to orient us but a dock light theyll be back soon rosa said theyre almost at the fishing boat once they see its not us i nodded and opened the throttle again jerking us faster toward the island too late now to worry about shallows if we didnt get to the dock wed be in the police boats return path then what play hideandseek in the lagoon until we ran out of luck the yellow light rosa said there see it thats where they unload down on my right the police were making a loop around the fishing boat probably cursing themselves now for having followed it theyd head back to the main channel cutting behind us hearing our motor unless we were already at the dock silent and invisible again the excelsior landing area was a deadend canal protected from rough open water and at this time of year lighted only by the dock lamp at the entrance i shot past the light then cut the motor so that the boat swerved as if we were skidding on ice our swell slapped against the wall then came back at us a bathtub effect i held the boat steady then pushed us toward the landing stairs okay quick i said wheres the car across the street help me carry him not that way claudia said positioning herself at the end of the tarp slide it over the side first like this she motioned rosa to the other end and they pushed the rolled tarp onto the stairs while i held the rocking boat they both got out claudia pulling the body up to the pavement now lift wait ill do it i said tying the boat but before i could step out i heard the other engine grinding in neutral out past the dock light looking around i turned to see the blue light then back at rosa run theres no time now and you ill say you forced us something just get going help me i cant leave him are you crazy claudia said her voice hoarse breathing hard she had started dragging the body but only managed to pull the tarp away now looking at moretti then out toward the blue light she seemed desperate gulping air hes dead look what does it matter now we did this to save him so he wouldnt be blamed for us we could have done nothing let him take the blame but we didnt and now look it doesnt matter to him now let him be the guilty one then its over we have to save ourselves she knelt by the body reaching for the loose tarp look but rosa was staring at her eyes round no longer seeing the body but hes not the guilty one she said evenly you take the blame for you thats what it meant in the boat how you knew what to do she looked at me both of you but why i heard the engine again louder why there must have been a reason once rosa just go i said leave him alone she said to claudia what another one for the lagoon she turned back to me yes both how else to do it it takes two all along pretending behind us some shouts a light rippling up the canal rosa theyre coming what were you doing a game and this boywhat hed pay for you no thats why we i turned to see the blue light closer almost at the entrance theyre coming run and leave him then hes their murderer thats what you want she said to claudia carlos boy a murderer think of his name his name claudia said hes dead theyll kill you i said not before i tell them claudia pulled out morettis gun then got up slowly holding it in front of her no you wont do that for what hes dead claudia put it down i turned to rosa just run well cover you he doesnt pay she said looking calmly at the gun oh but we do claudia said the living nobody pays i said impatient my head swirling with the sound of the engine close enough to be in the canal now what for gianni he was a murderer yes and what are you and then before i could say anything yes me too many times she looked down at the body but not him there is an obligation here obligation claudia said to whom go well tell them something maybe theyll believe it no theyll believe me then youll kill us claudia said quietly there was a swell of water a boat pulling close rosa i said please run i cant she said reasonable with my leg i cant make it now anyway the carits not possible no time theyll kill you she glanced at the gun her mouth twisting in a faint smile who does it first you or them i will claudia said breathless and how do you explain this one rosa said looking at me she shook her head then youll pay for me me himyoull pay for one of us either way there were shouts now the sounds of people getting off a boat coming up behind us the way the pursuit boat had so that i wanted to hold up my hand again to make it stop to come this far claudia said no you want to die but not us not now ill survive you too rosa looked at her still calm how and then suddenly everything did stop startled by a roar so loud it drove every other sound out of the air no footsteps at the end of the dock no soft moan as rosas face went slack with surprise no boats creaking or buoy bells out on the lagoon the world turned silent rosa slumped and fell over claudia lowered the gun shoulders drooping and looked at it dumbly as if it had gone off by itself all without a sound happening somewhere quiet out of reach then air started rushing back into my eardrums how do you explain this one another body claudia with a gun in her hand i stepped forward putting myself between claudia and rosas body i heard footsteps again no time but there had to be some way one last alibi claudia was staring at me still in the quiet place listen to me shoot me i said she blinked here i said touching my shoulder then put rosas gun in her hand she tried to kill us but i got her before she could shoot again understand put the gun in her hand i had to shoot back here i touched my shoulder again do it shoot you she said vaguely as if she were trying to translate just do it i said almost growling quick its a chance yes she said still vague but raising her hand i looked down at the gun followed it up until it was pointed at my chest here i said touching my shoulder again and in that second i saw what she must have seen too that the shoulder was only a chance but the heart could be the end of it the story they would believe rosas forcing us out onto the lagoon my grabbing morettis gun her shooting me as i fired it both dead only claudia alive free of all of us the bullet finally stopped i looked at her eyes steady no expression at all ill survive you too the only thing that matters when no one is watching my throat felt thick closing up maybe this was the only part that was truenot the hotel near the station slick with sweat not the ball fingering the necklace excited in spite of ourselves not the magistrates office solemn in berties corsage or afterward looking up at the high windows to find her father instead i saw her face as she brought down the stone on giannis head saw a hand come out from under the bed with a knifewasnt it possible who would blame her who would blame her now one second and it was done no longer than it had taken to silence rosa she moved her hand a little taking aim i could flinch now duck somehow break the trance between us before she could fire but then id never know never know what was left and i realized suddenly that i wouldnt move that it was worth my life to know the one thing in it that mattered the rest just sleepwalking do it i said almost whispering she looked at me her eyes moving now harried the shoulder i hissed thats the story no sound but the blood in my head i glanced down at her hand waiting for the finger to move brava a voice said stepping out of the dark the white sling visible before his face claudia turned the gun still pointing at me but her eyes fixed now behind me cavallini walked over excellent except for the bulletsthey would match two people shot with the same gun even the police would notice he took the gun from her too stunned now to move quiet again the others waited behind only partly visible on the dock rosa he said shaking his head as he walked over to her stepping past moretti how did you say she forced you to take out the boat he paused after we had left of course it would be embarrassing otherwise he touched the body with his toe pushing it slightly then jumped back when it moved a twitch that might have been a reflex but then happened again still alive stronzo angry now glancing up at claudia annoyed still alive he looked quickly toward the dock then pointed the gun down and fired into rosas chest close her body jerked from the force of it its all right he shouted before the others could rush up from the dock like startled birds i stared at the body absolutely still now he squatted and patted her sides with his good arm until he found her gun then got up and turned back to us aiming it she would have used this gun yes now the bullets dont match when you shoot each other he raised it and i blew out some air surprised almost a laugh because i knew it must be a joke until i looked at his eyes dark pools like the canal water showing nothing underneath dont claudia said and then all i heard was a roar again covering everything even my own gasp as something slammed into me a piece of fire burning flesh and i fell back knocked over by the wind the rush of something i couldnt hear and felt the sharp pain as i hit the pavement a crunch i couldnt hear either just felt another jagged piece of fire red then black everything dark and then no sound at all chapter twenty i woke up in giannis hospital with a throbbing in my shoulder claudia was standing staring out the window and for a moment i saw her back on the pier her body still looking down at rosa what cavallini had seen too the gun dangling at her side but we were here both of us no bars on the window everything crisp white can you see san michele i said my voice raspy she turned youre awake she said then stopped hesitant fingering the opening at her collar the cemetery i said prompting its bad luck she shook her head not from here just the canal so ill live does it hurt they said it would when you woke up theyll give you something for it she started toward the door eager to be doing something in a minute tell me first what i dont know what time is it morning here have some water she held a glass to my mouth playing nurse they said after today the pain is less theres no danger no tell mewheres cavallini somewhere she said waving her hand he has a statement for you to sign she pointed to a paper on the night table a statement i said trying to make sense of it about what happened to rosa falling forward her surprised face i felt the heat spread through my shoulder againnot just pain memory and the boy i said another innocent moretti rosa maybe even gianni killed for just doing business the boy they knowthere were witnesses in the train yards i nodded the movement setting off another rush of pain in my shoulder a confession i said tired wanting to slip back into sleep claudia looked at me no do you want me to read it to you its in italian just tell me what you said rosa forced us to take her in the boat then when we got there she tried to kill usleave no witnessesbut you managed to get morettis gun and shoot back and save us yes she said and save us from rosa she said nothing and then cavallini came after she was dead is that it she looked at me yes and then its over if we lie for him she picked up the paper we have to sign it its what he wants and make rosa what i turned my head toward the window a blank sky theyd both be over on san michele now being cut open and drained then what happens then its finished and we go away i said in a monotone the practiced response she bit her lip no me i go to paris to your mother so it looks right it was his idea its family so no one would think who cares what they think he does he wants everything to look all right worked out the last story instead of the way it is i closed my eyes shutting out the room i heard the scrape of a chair her sitting near me yes she said softly maybe just as exhausted both of us finally at an end a few minutes passed so quiet i could hear the birds outside what do i say to you she said finally nothing i was there too but this time it was just me not both just me another silence and after paris after i dont know you mean youre leaving i said my eyes still closed so that both our voices seemed disembodied for a minute she said nothing when i had the gun what did you think i didnt know what to think yes she said slowly why not i opened my eyes and looked at her she got up from the chair so maybe were leaving each other thats how it ends she went over to the window for her purse and we sign a paper and cavallini gets away with it and so do we you didnt kill rosa i said he did but he can explain it i cant do you want to explain it we looked at each other for a minute then i turned my head she wasnt even part of this all i asked for was a file yes claudia said then opened her purse i forgot this was at the house from germany its what you were waiting for yes i took the envelope army beige frankfurt yes thick something more than a routine no but late we didnt need another story now i opened the envelope and flipped past the cover note to the typed pages transcripts and memos bauers interview chatty and detailed wanting to cooperate war stories its there claudia said i nodded reading everything id wanted all along only thought i knew the raid on the safe house gianni planning it using young moretti guilty of all of it and now that it was here proof on paper what did it matter bauer breaking marco everybody breaks getting the names to gianni no longer a businessman at arms length part of the chain now link by link from paolos death the way id known it had to be laid out in detail the messengeri stopped what claudia said i looked up but didnt see her just a blur nothing i said covering he did it its all here its what you wanted the proof i dropped the papers next to me not answering she put her hand on my arm you see a man like that how could it be wrong i lay back on the pillow hes not the only one dead now she looked at me for a second then stood up ill get the nurse for your shot she opened the door to cavallini but if hed been listening he gave no sign just smiled and walked in as if it were an ordinary hospital visit so awake he said now two of us he pointed to his sling the bandaged arm but not a scratch for youim sorry i meant only to hit the skin not go into the muscle youre in pain its all right i said dont be foolish look at his face i was going for the nurse claudia said i will only be a minute cavallini said nodding to the door a kind of permission to leave he waited for her to go before turning to me i came for the statement she explained it to you rosa tried to kill me before you got there yes i saw it from the dock but i was a better shot he shrugged luckier perhaps why this way why because its best what purpose does it serve to involve signora miller this way is simple everyone understands the raid on the train this is typical of her to rescue her partner her partner in giannis murder what are you talking about she wasnt even in venice when i said partner the one who encourages urges him to do it why would anyone believe that signor miller shes the obvious person i thought so from the first i lay back again slightly dizzy caught in another maze only one person survived in that house only one who would have a better motive moretti ran errands for her in the war again the obvious person to turn to the fathers son so together you cant she was a good person a war hero for chrissake was yes now she serves a different purpose these are bad people signor miller godless bad for italy its important for the country to see what they are like what they are willing to doeven to their friends innocent foreigners who dont understand what they are you killed her not according to you he said nodding to the night table you have signed it no theres a difficulty its not true he sighed and sat down in the chair signor miller true the important thing is what purpose does it serve this story a good purpose good for everybody especially for you youll be sitting pretty at the questura yes a successful case what i said from the beginning he looked over at me with your help now i help you help me there are other stories things people could believe signora miller for instance a scene at a party so many witnesses ive already told you about that he held up his hand signor miller please i believe you im trying to explain what other people could say you know at the questura they ask all these questions again your mother for instance you know they called her so interesting the night of signora mortimers party shes so anxiouswhere is my fiance she telephones ca venti and youre there with signora miller but you dont answer making love i remember you said so you dont answer yes i said my throat dry closing the smallest thing but she calls againdid you know this an hour later still no answer of course its possible a young man but even i that doesnt mean anything but it could if someone asked this where was she what are you trying to say me nothing i already know the true story he said gesturing at the statement again to look for another nowso many confusions but someone could believe it unless they believe this what you say and what i say he had been staring at me his voice smooth explaining something to a child now it hardened which is better for her a woman like that a woman like what i said quietly feeling a shiver on my neck like a draft who could kill vanessi they cant prove that yes there is proof he said simply even my shoulder was cold now as if my blood had stopped running then why was it never used cavallini shrugged to what purpose such a manand italian not german an italian who would do that to italians so many were already on trial why make more shame a robber kills him theres an end and you know there was a certain amount of sympathy for signora miller for her suffering even now i feel that you see its better to arrange things this way so they serve a purpose he reached over for the paper then took a pen out of his pocket what about her prints i said watching him on the gun there were no prints on the gun he said all business someone must have wiped it and you never saw it in her hand no never only in yours he held out the pen meeting my eyes now locked on them you see ill be her alibi he said and youll be mine he moved the pen closer your accomplice i whispered my throat dry again squeezed shut i took the pen wincing as i raised my bad shoulder the end of the maze cavallini kept looking at me his eyes as cool and determined as they had been last night when he had aimed the gun he smiled a little when he heard the scratch of the pen good he said taking the paper its for the best im very good at arranging these things you can put yourself in my hands i glanced down at them casually putting away the pen a wedding ring thick blunt fingers oversized hands big enough whats that he pointed to the papers on my bed german testimony about gianni he helped them attack the safe house he raised his eyebrows you see how well we work together more proof that rosa would do it but maybe we wont need to use it think of giulias feelings shell be so grateful if its finished its important to put these things behind us a doctors daughter used to keeping other peoples secrets he got up and straightened the chair watching me youre in pain he said that nurse was there really proof about vanessi yes of course even proof is a matter ofhow you tell the story he said glancing at bauers transcript he opened his hand signor miller shes your wife a piece of advice let it go meant to reassure unaware that we had already left each other he was gone by the time she came back with the nurse so he didnt see me avoid her eyes not wanting to talk anymore not even to tell her she was finally safe i looked instead at the syringe waiting for the drug to take effect let me drift away from all of it bertie came in the afternoon i hope youre satisfied cops and robbers how are you peachy mm i expected worse i have to say given the papers he tossed il gazzettino on the bed shootouts at the lido what in gods name here i said handing him the frankfurt envelope whats this read it page three he walked over to the window reading then looked out for a minute before folding the paper up and putting it back in the envelope well you would poke and pry he said softly his head down you were afraid id find out werent you thats why you didnt want mechrist bertie i breathed out christ he leaned back taking out his cigarette case its not allowed i said oh tut he said lighting his cigarette and putting his arm on the sill using the open window as an ashtray a condemned mans always allowed thats what i am now isnt it in your eyes i said nothing waiting all right i admit its not the sort of thing you want to see in your obituary he looked up or have to explain for that matter you worked for them i didnt work for them he said sometimeswell sometimes we do things we never thought wed do oh not you of course youre always on the side of the just and the good but the rest of us im a guest in this country adam i stay at the pleasure of whoever happens to be running things i dont choose them i just stay out of their way not all the time they could have taken my passport in a second then what ship me off to switzerland if i was lucky maybe worse then why stay its my home anyway i didnt have the luxury of sitting out the war somewhere and coming back after bright as a penny i didnt have the time he looked down at his cigarette then threw it out the window it wasnt much you know we all had to report all the foreigners tell them where we were living what we were up to but they asked you to tell them a little more he nodded i knew the foreign community such as it was then who was still here a few white russians with nowhere else to go hungarians some english whod married italians and thought that made them italian nobody you cant imagine how harmless it all was they just liked to keep records think everything was under control who said what at which party well whoever did say anything nobody was hurt and i had friends where i needed them of course now its over nobody wants to remember what it was like now it lookswell the way it looks anyway its over and done with no its not he looked up apprehensive there are two people in the morgue it wasnt over for them well i didnt put them there no you just gave gianni the names hers the boys father they were in that house and now theyre all dead you were part of it do you lie to yourself too or just to me oh who could lie to you the grand inquisitor gave him names if i hadnt somebody else would have youre not somebody else you told him who killed paolo and people died adam you dont think i knew what theyd do you dont think that that awful business with the fire you just thought theyd round them up and then what scold them execute them quietly they were burned he turned away facing the window again all right they were i didnt know but so was paolo thats what they did to him in that car all charred he stopped his voice drifting they burned him paolo he was a thug i know what he was he snapped turning to face me but that wasnt all of him before all that when he was young if youd known him then you couldnt take your eyes off him there was a quality i stared at the sheet feeling awkward i know he was an oaf really worse i suppose at the end all puffed up he paused catching himself we dont get to choose how we feel you know we just do and he never had a clue he looked out the window sometimes i think the only thing ive really loved is venice it doesnt love you back either but i couldnt lose it so i gave gianni the names i was asked to do it and i did it satisfied are you you have to live with it what my guilty conscience well as it happens i wont not that either he came away from the window stopping at the foot of the bed do you know what its like knowing youre going to die you dont really its just an idea to you you think youre going to live but when you know things are different they dont matter so much anymore people dont matter you find you can dowhatever you have to do i wanted to stay in venice even if people had to die for it what paolos killers why not they deserved it havent you ever wanted to get rid of someone i looked up at him what stops you you think youre going to live you might have to pay for it but if you know youre going to die anyway itsnot so unthinkable its easy if you dont have to pay not even afterward oh afterward he said i thought you believed in all that i did he said running his hand over the chair now talking to himself its odd about the church just when you think it ought to come in handy it doesnt matter either you see that its all tosh really all those wonderful paintings judgment day this hellfire that puttis flying around everywheredo you think they believed it at the end lying there with some sore full of pus and not a hope in hell anything was coming afterward maybe i doubt it i think they were like mewaiting for their time to run out he stopped staring at his hands it was just gossip you know thats all it was except for gianni except for gianni why you he waved his hand i was his patient nothing could have been more innocent than my going to see him that was important to him that no one would suspect anything he made a face uncomfortable even now i think it was his idea to use me i think he told them i was dying that i wouldnt want to leave venice so id beamenable to be his messenger boy so bauer called you who oh no i never met with the germans then who gave you the names he glanced up at me surprised who who do you think your friend cavallini i reported to him remember as a foreigner he even came to the house surely you knew he nodded toward the frankfurt letter or did they just tattle on me he peered at me over his glasses are you all right youve come over queer do you need something water why didnt he tell gianni himself i said barely getting it out short of breath well gianni was something of a snob you know there was a family connection through the wife but gianni wouldnt have anything to do with him he wouldnt have him in the house now sitting in the pew at salute family at last gianni thought he was common bertie was saying police are always a little rough around the edges arent they and cavalliniwell you ought to know slick as oil its one thing to be on the take everyone is over here but he does very well for himself and there were stories during the war you know the way the police could be sometimes i never saw it myself but gianni was carefulmaybe a little afraid of him said he was the kind who would get away with murder i swallowed still gasping a little as if my neck were being held to the wall are you sure youre all right here he handed me a glass of water i took a sip always one step ahead pulling tighter and tighter even while i thought i was slipping away put yourself in my hands everybody gets away with it i said picking up the beige envelope bertie moved away from the bed what do you want me to say adam i never thought i know you never did a thing nobody did he stood for a minute not saying anything then went to the chair and picked up his hat i dont like this very much kangaroo court i dropped the letter my body sinking with it weighted down by a nameless disappointment walking away from it but what had i expected we were all pleabargaining now leave then he paused looking down at his hat im still something to you i think he said you wouldntyoull keep that to yourself he motioned toward the letter and not show it around i thought nothing mattered to you anymore not to me but you know people dont like to remember there might be a certain social stigma and that still matters to you i live here i dont want to spend my last days alone his voice caught me tentative almost wispy and i looked up not the dark figure in the transcript anymore whispering into giannis ear just a slight old man with halfmoon glasses whom nobody ever loved back no i said it was just for me when id wanted to know when we had gotten away with it cavallini took us to the station in a police launch heading away from the hospital toward the rialto because claudia said she wanted to go up the grand canal the sun was out bright as it had been on our wedding day and she sat in the back just as she had then with her corsage not smiling this time just taking it all in fixing it in her memory cavallini and i had exchanged slingshis had been snipped away mine put in place that morningand i still felt a little wobbly offbalance he sat up front with the driver pointing to buildings from time to time a tour guide palazzo foscari ca doro ca pesaro the fairytale city everyone knew untouched by the war at the station he dealt with the porters and luggage to give us time alone but even with him gone it seemed we were playing out a scene hed arranged an ordinary couple saying the usual things on the platform youre sure you have your tickets enough money something to read on the train then we said nothing waiting for a cue theres not much time she said id better get on beginning to turn so that i saw it was really happening dont go i said she hesitated letting me take her by the shoulders with my good arm facing me again dont go she smiled faintly i wondered if you would say it thank you for that tell me what else to say what do you want to hear anything she shook her head nothing i cant adam a loudspeaker blared behind us announcing the train i cant stay here no i fixed it with cavallini even about vanessi i looked down its all fixed all fixed she said and when i raised my head again her eyes were moist with cavallini you dont have to worry you did that for me i said nothing waiting for her youll pay for it you know rosa paid for it and now well pay for her she said quietly on and on no its over you dont have to be afraid no just when you look at me what you see and me when i look at myself i want to go somewhere people cant see it do you understand that we can start over she shook her head not after this we know about each other what happened so how can it change she put her hand on my chest shall i tell you something when i asked you what did you think when i had the gun and you said you didnt know i didnt know either so thats who i am now i didnt know either she brushed her hand over her eyes oh so stupid well at the station the one place i held out a handkerchief do you know how it used to be my father was a doctor he sent me to london we were people ofstanding and now a murderer shooting a woman and i could do it so how did that happen i still dont know she sniffled blowing her nose look hes coming i gripped her tighter but i love you she reached up putting her hands on the sides of my head i know she said staring at me her fingers trembling but its not safe for me here she darted her eyes toward cavallini say goodbye hes watching i kissed her on the mouth feeling her lean against me youre my wife but she had pulled away stroking the side of my face yes my father would be so proud her voice soft saying goodbye a rich american i said and that she said smiling a little here i said taking an envelope out of my pocket my mother doesnt have anyshe just talks big adam i cant see her how could i do that its just what we say here take it anyway you give me money to leave you its marked itll make it easier to find you she smiled so that cavallini joining us thought everything was fine so all arranged he said handing her a claim stub the rest is in your compartment thank you he bowed kissing her hand its hard these goodbyes he said but now you must hurry i walked claudia over to the train and held her hand as she climbed the steps she glanced down the platform toward cavallini thank you then for vanessi so its true she made a wry half smile even now you have to know so important to you to know was maglione a good man no he couldnt be so you could be is it true she took her hand way he tried to she stopped yes thats what you were afraid of all along why didnt you tell me i couldnt she shook her head how could i tell you then wed both know to trust someone with that you cantits one thing you learn after when we knew did we trust each other a door slammed at the end of the platform and maybe i wanted you to think i wasi dont know the way i used to be you are you just cant see it i can thats what i see doors were slamming along the line now the loudspeaker crackling hes waiting for you the conductor was closing the next car i pulled myself up the train steps taking her arm and kissing her no go she said turning away then as i took a step back she clutched my jacket and pulled me to her just touching her face against mine for a second before moving away again looking at me would we have been happy do you think if none of it had happened we can still be happy but in her eyes shiny and fluttering wounded i saw that it wasnt true and that i had become a kind of cage i dropped my arms signore the conductor asking me off the train lurched i nodded and stepped down to the platform and stood there watching until the train began to move only then taking in the gray suit the same one shed worn when i first noticed her standing alone at berties the suit i shouted but the train was loud now and she just smiled and then raised her hand not quite a wave a lettinggo finally free both of us i watched the train rush out into the yards two people and a secret the impossible equation i could close up the house now and go anywhere i walked down the platform at the end cavallini was leaning against a pillar and reading a newspaper an old picture he said showing it to me from those days rosa looking young and pretty in an offtheshoulder blouse before she was always cold i read some of the italiandriven by political vengeanceand handed it back on and on you see they believe it already he said there wont be any trouble at the inquest he put his hand at the small of my back and guided me into the main hall i had the boat wait he said not back to the hospital i said where gianni had nodded in the ward would you drop me at ca venti the canal entrance with its mossy steps no sign of blood i thought we would visit giulia giulia yes if youre not tired she has been so worried about you ive been keeping her informed you know she has a very high regard for you but both of us would be there one of us working his way from the family pew to the lunch table protecting all things maglione signora miller was happy to go he said yes its not a long trip very beautiful in the mountains we were passing out of the hall to mussolinis broad steps its all arranged shes easy in her mind i stopped for a second squinting in the bright light at the boats on the grand canal watercolor venice then i shivered suddenly chilled even in the sun maybe the way rosa had felt youre ill cavallini said solicitous i shook my head all arranged she understands good va bene i suppose i should thank you he shrugged shes your wife yes i said to myself mocking my voice bitter how can i ever repay you but evidently he had heard me he helped me into the boat with my good arm ca maglione he said to the driver then turned to me an odd smile on his face dont worry he said his hand still holding my arm these things arrange themselves well think of something
