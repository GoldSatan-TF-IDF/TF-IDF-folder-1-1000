kneeling on the ground hands over her face shoulders heaving with sobs the man studied the corpse for a moment then tried shielding his wifes eyes but she had already turned away he took out his phone and called the emergency number it was ten minutes before the police car arrived during which time the girl tried to leave the man explaining calmly that she should wait his hand rubbing her shoulder his wife was seated kerbside despite the nighttime chill november in edinburgh not quite cold enough for a frost but heading that way kings stables road wasnt the busiest of thoroughfares a no entry sign prevented vehicles using it as a route from the grassmarket to lothian road at night it could be a lonely spot with not much more than a multistorey jcar park on one side castle rock and a cemetery on the other the street lighting seemed underpowered and pedestrians kept leir wits about them the middleaged couple had been to a ol service in st cuthberts church helping raise money for the s childrens hospital the woman had bought a holly wreath rhich now lay on the ground to the left of the corpse her husband ldnt help thinking a minute either way and we might not have rd might be heading home in the car the wreath on the back at and classic fm on the radio i want to go home the girl was complaining between sobs she standing knees grazed her skirt was too short the man felt her denim jacket was unlikely to keep out the cold she looked liar to him he had considered briefly considered lending his coat instead he reminded her again that she needed to stay put suddenly their faces turned blue the police car was arriving lights flashing here they come the man said placing his arm around her shoulders as if to comfort her removing it again when he saw his wife was watching even after the patrol car drew to a halt its roof light stayed on engine left running two uniformed officers emerged not bothering with their caps one of them carried a large black torch raeburn wynd was steep and led to a series of mews conversions above garages which would once have housed the monarchs carriages and horses it would be treacherous when icy maybe he slipped and banged his head the man offered or he was sleeping rough or had had a few too many thank you sir one of the officers said meaning the opposite his colleague had switched the torch on and the middleaged man realised that there was blood on the ground blood on the slumped bodys hands and clothes the face and hair were clotted with it or someone smashed him to a pulp the first officer commented unless of course he slipped repeatedly against a cheesegrater his young colleague winced hed been crouching down the better to shine light on to the body but he rose to his feet again whose is the wreath he asked my wifes the man stated wondering afterwards why he hadnt just said mine jack palance detective inspector john rebus said i keep telling you i dont know him big film star so name me a film his obituarys in the scotsman then you should be clued up enough to tell me what ive seen him in detective sergeant siobhan clarke got out of the car and slammed shut the door he was the bad guy in a lot of westerns rebus persisted clarke showed her warrant card to one of the uniforms and took a proffered torch from the younger of the two the sceneofcrime unit was on its way spectators had started gathering drawn to the scene by the patrol cars blue beacon rebus and clarke had been working late at gayfield square police station hammering out a theory but no prime suspect in an unsolved investigation both had been glad of the break provided by the summons theyd arrived in rebuss wheezing saab from the boot of which he was now fetching polythene overshoes and latex gloves it took him half a dozen noisy attempts to slam shut the lid need to trade it in he muttered whod want it clarke asked pulling on the gloves then when he didnt answer were those hiking boots i glimpsed as old as the car rebus stated heading towards the corpse the two detectives fell silent studying the figure and its surroundings someones done a job on him rebus eventually commented he turned towards the younger constable whats your name son goodyear sir todd goodyear todd mums maiden name sir goodyear explained ever heard of jack palance todd wasnt he in shane tfoure wasted in uniform goodyears colleague chuckled give young todd here half a chance and its you hell be grilling rather than any suspects hows that clarke asked the constable at least fifteen years older than his partner and maybe three times the girth nodded towards goodyear im not good enough for todd he explained got his eyes set on cid goodyear ignored this he had his notebook in his hand want us to start taking details he asked rebus looked towards the pavement a middleaged couple were seated kerbside holding hands then there was the teenage girl arms wrapped around herself as she shivered against a wall beyond her the crowd of onlookers was starting to shuffle forward again warnings forgotten best thing you can do rebus offered is hold that lot back till we can secure the scene doctor should be here in a couple of lutes hes not got a pulse goodyear said i checked rebus glowered at him told you they wouldnt like it goodyears partner said with ler chuckle ixjontaminates the locus clarke told the young constable showhim her gloved hands and overshoes he looked embarrassed fdoctor still has to confirm death rebus added meantime youstart persuading that rabble to get themselves home jrlorified bouncers thats us the older cop told his partner as moved off which would make this the vip enclosure clarke said quietly she was checking the corpse again hes well enough dressed probably not homeless want to look for id she took a couple of steps forward and crouched beside the body pressing a gloved hand against the mans trouser and jacket pockets cant feel anything she said not even sympathy she glanced up at rebus does the suit of armour come off when you collect the gold watch rebus managed to mouth the word ouch reason theyd been staying late at the office so often rebus only ten days from retirement wanting loose ends tied a mugging gone wrong clarke suggested into the silence rebus just shrugged meaning he didnt think so he asked clarke to shine the torch down the body black leather jacket an opennecked patterned shirt which had probably started out blue faded denims held up with a black leather belt black suede shoes as far as rebus could tell the mans face was lined the hair greying early fifties around five feet nine or ten no jewellery no wristwatch bringing rebuss personal bodycount to what maybe thirty or forty over the course of his threedecadesplus on the force another ten days and this poor wretch would have been somebody elses problem and still could be for weeks now hed been feeling siobhan clarkes tension part of her maybe the best part of her wanted rebus gone it was the only way she could start to prove herself her eyes were on him now as if she knew what he was thinking he offered a sly smile im not dead yet he said as the sceneofcrime van slowed to a halt on the roadway the duty doctor had duly declared death the socos had taped off raeburn wynd at top and bottom lights had been erected a sheet pinned up so that onlookers no longer had a view of anything except the shadows on the other side rebus and clarke were suited up in the same white hooded disposable overalls as the socos a camera team had just arrived and the mortuary van was standing by beakers of tea had materialised from somewhere wisps of steam rising from them in the distance sirens headed elsewhere drunken yelps from nearby princes street maybe even the hooting of an owl from the churchyard preliminary statements had been taken from the teenage girl and the middleaged couple and rebus was nicking through these flanked by the two constables the elder of whom he now knew was called bill dyson rumour is dyson said youve finally got your jotters weekend after next rebus confirmed cant be too far away yourself seven months and counting nice wee taxi job lined up for afterwards dont know how todd will cope without me ill try to maintain my composure goodyear drawled thats one thing youre good at dyson was saying as rebus went back to his reading the girl who had found the body was called nancy sievewright she was seventeen and on her way home from a friends house the friend lived in great stuart street and nancy in blair street just off the cowgate she had already left school and was unemployed though hoping to get into college some day to study as a dental assistant goodyear had done the interview and rebus was impressed neat handwriting and plenty of detail turning to dysons notebook was like turning from hope to despair a mess of hastily scrawled hieroglyphs those seven months couldnt pass quickly enough for pc bill dyson through guesswork rebus reckoned the middleaged couple were roger and elizabeth anderson and that they lived in frogston road west on the southern edge of the city there was a phone number but no hint of their ages or occupations instead rebus could make out the words just passing and called it in he handed the notebooks back without comment all three would be interviewed again later rebus checked his watch wondering when the pathologist would arrive not much else to be done in the meantime tell them they can go girls still a bit shaky goodyear said reckon we should drop her home rebus nodded and turned his attention to dyson how about the other two their cars parked in the grassmarket spot of latenight shopping dyson shook his head carol concert at st cuthberts a conversation we could have saved ourselves rebus told him youd bothered to write any of it down as his eyes drilled into constables he could sense the question dyson wanted to ask i would be the bloody point of that luckily the oldtimer knew tter than to utter anything of the kind out loud not until the br oldtimer was well out of earshot rebus caught up with clarke at the sceneofcrime van where she was quizzing the team leader his name was thomas banks tarn to those who knew him he gave a nod of greeting and asked if his name was on the guest list for rebuss retirement do how come youre all so keen to witness my demise dont be surprised tam said if the suits from hq come with stakes and mallets just to be on the safe side he winked towards clarke siobhan here tells me youve wangled it so your last shifts a saturday is that so were all at home watching telly while you take the long walk just the way it fell tam rebus assured him any tea going tou turned your nose up at it tam chided him that was half an hour ago no second chances here john i was asking clarke interrupted if tarn s team had anything for us im guessing he said to be patient thats about the size of it tam confirmed checking a text message on his mobile phone stabbing outside a pub at haymarket he informed them busy night clarke offered then to rebus doctor reckons our man was bludgeoned and maybe even kicked to death hes betting blunt force trauma at the autopsy hes not going to get any odds from me rebus told her nor me tam added rubbing a finger across the bridge of his nose he turned to rebus know who that young copper was he nodded towards the patrol car todd goodyear was helping nancy sievewright into the back seat bill dyson drumming his fingers against the steering wheel never seen him before rebus admitted tou maybe knew his grandad though tam left it at that wanting rebus to do the work it didnt take long not harry goodyear tam was nodding in confirmation leaving clarke to ask who harry goodyear was ancient history rebus informed her which typically left her none the wiser rebus was giving clarke a lift home when the call came in on her mobile they did a uturn and headed for the cowgate home to the citys mortuary there was an unmarked white van sitting by the loading bay rebus parked next to it and led the way the night shift consisted of just two men one was in his forties and had the look to rebuss eyes of an excon a faded blue tattoo crept out of the neck of his overalls and halfway up his throat it took rebus a moment to place it as some sort of snake the other man was a lot younger bespectacled and gawky i take it youre the poet rebus guessed lord byron we call him the older man rasped thats how i recognised him the young attendant told rebus i was at a reading he gave just yesterday he glanced at his watch day before yesterday he corrected himself reminding rebus that it was past midnight he was wearing the exact same clothes hard to id him from his face clarke interrupted playing devils j advocate the young man nodded agreement all the same the hair that jacket and the belt so whats his name rebus asked todorov alexander todorov hes russian ive got one of his oks in the staffroom he signed it for me thatll be worth a few quid the other attendant sounded sudly interested you fetch it rebus asked the young man nodded and luffled past heading for the corridor rebus studied the rows of srated doors which ones he in number three the attendant rapped his knuckles against the door in question there was a label on it but no name as yet i wouldnt bet on lord byron being wrong hes got brains how long has he been here couple of months real names chris simpson clarke had a question of her own any idea how soon the autopsy will get done soon as the pathologists get their arses down here rebus had picked up a copy of the days evening news looking bad for hearts the attendant told him pressleys lost the captaincy and theres a caretaker coach music to ds clarkes ears rebus told the man he held the paper up so she could see the front page a sikh teenager had been attacked in pilrig park and his hair lopped off not our patch thank god she said at the sound of footsteps all three of them turned but it was only chris simpson returning with the slim hardback book rebus took charge of it and turned to the back cover the poets unsmiling face stared back at him rebus showed it to clarke who shrugged looks like the same leather jacket rebus commented but hes got some sort of chain round his neck he was wearing it at the reading simpson confirmed and the guy you brought in tonight no chain i had a quick look maybe they took it whoever mugged him i mean or maybe its not him how long was todorov staying in town hes here on some sort of scholarship hasnt lived in russia for a while calls himself an exile rebus was turning the pages of the book it was called astapovo blues the poems were in english and called things like raskolnikov leonid and mind gulag what does the title mean he asked simpson its the place where tolstoy died the other attendant chuckled told you he had a brain on him rebus handed the book to clarke who flicked to the title page todorov had written an inscription telling dear chris to keep the faith as i have and have not what did he mean she asked i said i was trying to be a poet he told me that meant i already was i think hes saying he kept faith with poetry but not with russia the young man was starting to blush where was this rebus asked the scottish poetry library just off the canongate was anyone with him a wife maybe or someone from the publisher simpson told them he couldnt be sure hes famous you know there was talk of the nobel prize clarke had closed the book theres always the russian consulate she suggested rebus gave a slow nod they could hear a car drawing up outside thatll be at least one of them the other attendant said best get the lab ready lord byron simpson had reached out a hand for his book but clarke waved it at him mind if i hang on to it mr simpson promise i wont put it on ebay the young man seemed reluctant but was being prodded into action by his colleague clarke sealed the deal by slipping the book into her coat pocket rebus had turned to face the outer door which was being hauled open by a puffyeyed professor gates only a couple of steps behind him was dr curt the two pathologists had worked together so frequently that they often seemed to rebus a single unit hard to imagine that outside of work they could ever lead separate distinguishable lives ah john gates said proffering a hand as chilled as the room the nights grown bitter and heres ds clarke too looking forward no doubt to stepping out from the mentors shadow clarke prickled but kept her mouth shut no point in argui ing that as far as she was concerned shed long ago left rebuss hadow rebus himself offered a smile of support before shaking hands with the ashenfaced curt there had been a cancer scare eleven months back and some of the mans energy had failed to jjjeturn though hed given up the cigarettes for good how are you john curt was asking rebus felt maybe that lould have been his question but he offered a reassuring nod im guessing box two gates was saying turning to his associite deal or no deal its number three actually clarke told him we think he may a russian poet not todorov curt asked one eyebrow raised clarke showed the book and the eyebrow went a little higher wouldnt have taken you for a poetry lover doc rebus combnted are we in the midst of a diplomatic incident gates snorted auld we be checking for poisoned umbrella tips looks like he was mugged by a psycho rebus explained unless theres a poison out there that strips the skin away from your face necrotising fasciitis curt muttered arising from streptococcus pyogenes gates added not that i think weve ever seen it to rebuss ears he sounded genuinely disappointed blunt force trauma the police doctor had been spoton rebus sat in his living room not bothering to switch on any lights and smoked a cigarette having banned nicotine from workplaces and pubs the government were now looking at banning it from the home too rebus wondered how theyd go about enforcing that a john hiatt album was on the cd player volume kept low the track was called lift up every stone all his time on the force he hadnt done anything else but hiatt was using stones to build a wall while rebus just peered beneath them at the tiny dark things scuttling around he wondered if the lyric was a poem and what the russian poet would have made of rebuss riff on it theyd tried phoning the consulate but no one had answered not even a machine so theyd decided to call it a night siobhan had been dozing off during the autopsy much to gatess irritation rebuss fault hed been keeping her late at the office trying to get her interested in all those cold cases all the ones still niggling him hoping that maybe they would keep his memory warm rebus had dropped her home and then driven through the silent predawn streets to marchmont an eventual parking space and his secondfloor tenement flat the living room had a bay window and that was where his chair was he was promising himself hed make it as far as the bedroom but there was a spare duvet behind the sofa just in case he had a bottle of whisky too eighteenyearold highland park bought the previous weekend and with a couple of good hits left in it ciggies and booze and a little night music at one time they would have provided enough consolation but he wondered if they would sustain him once the job was behind him what else did he have a daughter down in england living with a college lecturer an exwife whod moved to italy the pub he couldnt see himself driving cabs or doing precognitions for defence lawyers couldnt see himself starting afresh as others had done retiring to marbella or florida or bulgaria some had sunk their pensions into property letting flats to students a chief inspector he knew had made a mint that way but rebus didnt want the hassle hed be nagging the students all the time about cigarette burns in the carpet or the washingup not being done sports none hobbies and pastimes just what he was doing right now bit maudlin tonight are we john he asked himself out loud then gave a little chuckle knowing he could maudle for scotland gold medal a nap at the grump olympics at least he wasnt being sewn together again and slid back into drawer number three hed gone through a list in his mind offenders he knew whod go overboard on a beating most were in jail or under sedation on the psycho ward gates himself had said it theres a fury here or furies plural curt had added true they could be looking for more than one attacker the victim had been whacked on the back of the head with enough force to fracture the skull hammer cosh or baseball bat or anything else resembling them rebus was guessing that this had been the first blow the victim would have been poleaxed meaning he posed no threat to his attacker so why then the prolonged beating to the face as gates had speculated no ordinary mugger would have bothered theyd have emptied the pockets and fled a ring had been removed from one finger and there was a line on the left hand wrist indicating that the victim had been wearing a watch a slight nick on the back of the neck showed that the chain might have been snapped off nothing left at the scene curt had asked reaching for the chestcutters rebus had shaken his head say the victim had put up some sort of struggle maybe hed ipushed a button too many or could there be a racism angle his snt giving him away the condemned ate a hearty meal gates had eventually rerked opening the stomach prawn bhuna if im not mistaken rashed down with lager and do you detect a whiff of brandy or rhisky dr curt unmistakably and so it had progressed with siobhan clarke fighting to stay irake and rebus seated next to her watching as the pathologists it about their business fno grazes on the knuckles or shreds of skin under the finger nails nothing to suggest that the victim had been able to defend himself the clothing was chainstore stuff and would be sent to the forensic lab with the blood washed off the face more clearly resembled the one on the poetry book during one of her short naps rebus had removed the volume from siobhan clarkes pocket and found a potted biography of todorov on the flyleaf born in the zhdanov district of moscow former literature lecturer winner of numerous awards and prizes author of six poetry collections for adults and one for children seated now in his chair by the window rebus tried to think of indian restaurants near kings stables road tomorrow he would try looking in the phone book no john he told himself its already tomorrow hed picked up an evening news at the allnight petrol station so he could check the headlines again the marmion trial was continuing at the crown court pub shooting in gracemount one dead one lucky to be alive the sikh teenager had escaped with bumps and bruises but hair was sacred to his religion something the attackers must have known or guessed and jack palance was dead rebus didnt know what hed been like in real life but hed always played tough guys in his films rebus poured another highland park and raised his glass in a toast heres to the hard men he said knocking the drink back in one siobhan clarke got to the end of the phone books listing for restaurants shed underlined half a dozen possibles though really all the indian restaurants were possible edinburgh was a small city and easy to get around but they would start with the ones closest to the locus and work their way outwards she had logged on to her laptop and searched the web for mentions of todorov there were thousands of hits he even featured in wikipedia some of the stuff she found was written in russian a few essays came from the usa where the poet featured on various college syllabuses there were also reviews of astapovo blues so she knew now that the poems were about russian authors of the past but also critiques of the current political scene in todorovs home country not that mother russia had actually been his home not for the past decade hed been right to term himself an exile and his views on post glasnost russia had earned him a good deal of politburo anger and derision in one interview hed been asked if he considered himself a dissident a constructive dissident he had replied clarke took another gulp of lukewarm coffee this is your case girl she told herself rebus would soon be gone she was trying not to think about it too much all these years theyd worked together to the point where they could almost read one anothers mind she knew she would miss him but knew too that she had to start planning for a future without him oh they would meet for drinks and the occasional dinner shed share gossip and titbits with him maybe he would nag her about those cold cases the ones he was trying to dump on her bbc news was playing on the tv but with the sound turned off shed made a couple of calls to check that no one as yet had reported the poet missing not much else to be done so eventually she turned off the tv and computer both and went through to the bathroom the lightbulb needed changing so she undressed in the dark brushed her teeth and found she was rinsing the brush under the hot tap instead of the cold with her bedside light on a pale pink scarf draped over it she plumped up the pillows and raised her knees so she could rest astapovo blues against them it was only fortyodd pages but had still cost chris simpson a tenner keep the faith as i have and have not the first poem in the collection ended with the lines as the country bled and wept wept and bled he averted his eyes ensuring he would not have to testify flicking back to the title page she saw that the collection had been translated from the russian by todorov himself with the assistance of scarlett colwell clarke settled back and turned to the second poem by the third of its four stanzas she was asleep day two thursday november the scottish poetry library was located down one of innumerable pends and wynds leading off the canongate rebus and clarke managed to miss it and ended up at the parliament and the palace of holyrood driving more slowly back uphill they missed it again theres nowhere to park anyway clarke complained they were in her car this morning and therefore dependent on rebus to spot crightons close i think it was back there he said craning his neck pull up on to the pavement and well take a look clarke left the hazard lights on when she locked the car and folded her wing mirror in so it wouldnt get sideswiped if i get a ticket youre paying she warned rebus police business shiv well appeal it the poetry library was a modern building cleverly concealed amidst the tenements a member of staff sat behind the counter and beamed a smile in their direction the smile evaporated when rebus showed her his warrant card poetry reading a couple of nights back alexander todorov oh yes she said quite marvellous we have some of his books i for sale was he in edinburgh on his own any family that sort of thing the womans eyes narrowed and she clutched a hand to her iigan has something happened it was clarke who answered im afraid mr todorov was attacked st night gracious the librarian gasped is he as a doornail rebus supplied we need to speak to next of kin or at the very least someone who can identify him alexander was here as a guest of pen and the university hes been in the city a couple of months the librarians voice was trembling along with the rest of her ten its a writers group very big on human rights so where was he staying the university provided a flat in buccleuch place family a wife maybe but the woman shook her head i think his wife died i dont recall them having any children a blessing i suppose rebus was thoughtful for a moment so who organised his event here was it the university the consulate it was scarlett colwell his translator clarke asked gaining a nod of confirmation scarlett works in the russian department the librarian started sifting the slips of paper on her desk ive got her number here somewhere what a terrible thing to have happened i cant tell you how upsetting it is no trouble at the reading itself rebus asked trying to make the question seem casual trouble when she saw he wasnt about to elucidate she shook her head it all went swimmingly terrific use of metaphor and rhythm even when he recited in russian you could feel the passion she was lost for a moment in reminiscence then with a sigh alexander was happy to sign books afterwards tou make it sound clarke pointed out as if that might not always have been the case alexander todorov was a poet a very considerable poet as if this explained everything ah here it is she held up the piece of paper but seemed unwilling to relinquish it instead clarke entered the number into her own mobile before thanking the librarian for taking the trouble rebus was looking around where exactly did the performance happen upstairs we had an audience of over seventy i dont suppose anyone filmed it did they filmed it for posterity why do you ask rebus gave a shrug by way of reply there was a sound recording the woman admitted someone from a music studio clarke had her notebook out name she asked abigail thomas the librarian realised her mistake oh you mean the name of the recordist charlie something abigail thomas screwed shut her eyes with the effort then opened them wide charles riordan he has his own studio in leith thank you ms thomas rebus said then can you think of anyone we should contact tou could talk to pen there wasnt anyone here that night from the consulate i wouldnt have thought so oh alexander was quite vocal in his opposition to the current situation in russia he was on the question time panel a few weeks back the tv show clarke asked i watch that sometimes so his english was pretty good then rebus surmised when he wanted it to be the librarian said with a wry smile if he didnt like the point you were making the ability seemed suddenly to desert him he sounds quite a character rebus had to admit he saw that a small pile of todorovs books had been given their own display on a table near the stairs are these for sale he asked indeed they are would you like to buy one would they happen to be signed he watched her nod in that case make it half a dozen he was reaching into his jacket for his wallet as the librarian rose from her seat to fetch them feeling clarkes eyes on him he mouthed something to her something very like ebay the car had not received a ticket but there were dirty looks from the line of motorists attempting to squeeze past rebus threw the jjfoag of books on to the back seat should we warn her were comig might be wise clarke agreed punching the keys on her phone ad holding it to her ear tell me do you even know how to sell lething on ebay i can learn rebus said then tell her well meet her at his flat st in case hes lying in a stupor there and weve got a lookylikey the mortuary he stuck a fist to his mouth stifling a yawn get any sleep clarke asked probably the same as you he told her clarkes call had connected her to the university switchboard she asked for scarlett colwell and was put through miss colwell a pause sorry doctor colwell she rolled her eyes for rebuss benefit ask her if she can fix my gout he whispered clarke thumped his shoulder as she began to give dr scarlett colwell the bad news two minutes later they were heading for buccleuch place a six storey georgian block which faced the more modern and far uglier university edifices one tower in particular had been voted the building most people in edinburgh wanted to see condemned the tower perhaps sensing this hostility had begun to selfdestruct great chunks of cladding falling from it at irregular intervals you never studied here did you rebus asked as clarkes car rumbled across the setts no she said nosing into a parking space did you rebus gave a snort im a dinosaur shiv back in the bronze age they let you become a detective without a diploma and a mortarboard werent the dinosaurs extinct by the bronze age not having been to college thats just the sort of thing i wouldnt know reckon theres any chance of grabbing ourselves a coffee while were here you mean in the flat clarke watched him nod toud drink a dead mans coffee ive drunk a damn sight worse you know i actually believe that clarke was out of the car now rebus following must be her over there she was standing at the top of some steps and had already unlocked the front door she gave a little wave which rebus and clarke acknowledged clarke because it was the right thing to do and rebus because scarlett colwell was a looker her hair fell in long auburn waves her eyes were dark her figure curvy she wore a hugging green miniskirt black tights and brown calflength boots her little red riding hood coat reached only as far as her waist a gust of wind caused her to push the hair back from her eyes and rebus felt as if he were walking into a cadburys flake advert he saw that her mascara was a bit blurry evidence that shed shed a few tears since receiving the news but she was businesslike as the introductions were made they followed her up four flights of tenement stairs to the top floor landing where she produced another key unlocking the door to alexander todorovs flat rebus arriving having paused for breath on the landing below just as the door swung open there wasnt much to the apartment a short narrow hallway led to the living room with a kitchenette off it there was a cramped shower room and separate toilet and a single bedroom with views towards the meadows being in the eaves of the building the ceilings angled sharply downwards rebus wondered if the poet had ever sat up sharply in bed and thumped the crown of his head the whole flat felt not so much empty as utterly desolate as though marked by the departure of its most recent resident were really sorry about this siobhan clarke was saying as the three of them stood in the living room rebus was looking around him a wastepaper bin full of crumpled poems an empty cognac bottle lying next to the battered sofa an edinburgh bus map pinned to one wall above a foldaway dining table on which sat an electric typewriter no sign of a computer or a tv or a music system just a portable radio whose aerial had been snapped off books scattered everywhere some english some russian plus a few other languages a greek dictionary sat on the arm of the sofa there were empty lager cans on a shelf meant for knickknacks invitations on the mantelpiece to parties from the previous month they had passed a telephone on the floor in the hallway rebus asked if the poet had owned such a thing as a mobile when colwell shook her head hair bouncing and swaying rebus knew he wanted to ask another question she could answer in the same way clarkes clearing of the throat warned him against it and no computer either he asked anyway he was welcome to use the one in my office colwell said but alexander mistrusted technology tfou knew him fairly well i was his translator when the scholarship was announced i petitioned hard on his behalf so where was he before edinburgh paris for a time cologne before that stanford melbourne ottawa she managed a smile he was very proud of the stamps in his passport speaking of which clarke interrupted his pockets had been emptied any idea what he would usually carry around with him anotebook and pen some money i suppose any credit cards he had a cash card i think hed opened an account with first albannach should be some statements around here somewhere she looked about her you say he was mugged some sort of attack certainly what kind of man was he dr colwell rebus asked if someone confronted him in the street would he put up a struggle fight them back oh id think so he was physically robust liked good wine and a good argument did he have a temper not especially but you said he liked to argue in the sense that he enjoyed debate colwell corrected herself when did you last see him at the poetry library he was headed to the pub afterwards but i wanted to get home essays to mark before we break for christmas so who did he go to the pub with there were a few local poets in the audience ron butlin andrew greig id guess abigail thomas would be there too if only to pay for the drinks alexander wasnt brilliant with money rebus and clarke shared a look theyd have to talk to the librarian again rebus gave a little cough playing for time before asking his next question would you be willing to identify the body dr colwell the blood drained from scarlett colwells face you seem to have known him better than most rebus argued unless theres a next of kin we can approach but she had already made up her mind its all right ill do it we can take you there now clarke told her if thats okay with you colwell nodded slowly eyes staring into space rebus caught clarkes attention get on to the station he said see if hawes and tibbet can come give this place a looksee passport cash card notebook if theyre not here someones either got them or dumped them not forgetting his set of keys clarke added good point rebuss eyes scanned the room again hard to say if this place has been turned over or not unless you know better dr colwell colwell shook her head again and had to remove a strand of hair from over one eye it was always pretty much like this so no need for forensics rebus told clarke just hawes and tibbet clarke was nodding as she reached for her phone rebus had missed something colwell had said ive a tutorial in an hour she repeated well have you back in plenty of time he assured her not particularly caring one way or the other he held out a hand towards clarke keys pardon youre staying here to let hawes and tibbet in ill drive dr colwell to the mortuary clarke tried staring him out but eventually relented get one of them to bring you to the cowgate afterwards rebus said hoping to sugar the pill the identification was immediate even though most of the body was kept in its shroud concealing the work done by the pathologists colwell laid her forehead against rebuss shoulder for a moment and allowed a single tear to escape from either eye rebus regretted not having a clean handkerchief on him but she reached into her shoulder bag for one dabbing her eyes and then blowing her nose professor gates was in the room with them dressed in a threepiece suit which had fitted him beautifully four or five years back he held his hands in front of him head bowed respecting the formalities its alexander colwell was eventually able to say youre sure of that rebus felt obliged to press positive perhaps gates piped up raising his head dr colwell would like a cup of tea before the paperwork just a couple of forms rebus explained quietly colwell nodded slowly and the three of them went to the pathologists private office it was a claustrophobic space with no natural light and the smell of damp wafting in from the shower cubicle next door the day shift was on and rebus didnt recognise the man who brought the tea gates called him kevin told him to close the door again on his way out then opened the folder on his desk by the way he said was mr todorov any sort of car enthusiast i dont think hed have known the engine from the boot colwell said with a hint of a smile he once got me to change the bulb in his desk lamp gates smiled back at her then turned his attention to rebus forensics asked if he maybe worked as a mechanic there was some oil on the hem of the jacket and the trouser knees rebus thought back to the crime scene could have been some on the ground he admitted kings stables road the pathologist added a lot of the stables were turned into garages werent they rebus nodded and glanced towards colwell gauging her reaction its all right she told him im not going to start blubbing again who was it spoke to you rebus asked gates ray duff rays no slouch rebus said in fact rebus knew damned well that ray duff was the best forensic scientist they had whats the betting hes at the locus right now gates said checking for oil rebus nodded and lifted the mug of tea to his lips now that we know the victim really is alexander colwell said into the silence do i need to keep quiet about it i mean is it something you want to keep from the media gates gave a loud snort dr colwell we wouldnt stand a chance of keeping it from the fourth estate lothian and borders police leaks like the proverbial sieve as does this very building he lifted his head towards the door isnt that right kevin he called they could hear feet beginning to shuffle back down the corridor gates gave a satisfied smile and picked up his ringing telephone rebus knew it would be siobhan clarke waiting in reception after dropping colwell back at the university rebus treated clarke to lunch when hed made the offer shed stared at him and asked if anything was wrong hed shaken his head and shed said he must be after a favour then fwho knows how often well get the chance once im retired hed explained they went to an upstairs bistro on west nicolson street where the dish of the day was venison pie it came with chips and garden peas over all of which rebus dumped quarter of a bottle of hp sauce he was limiting himself to a halfpint of deuchars and had managed four drags on a cigarette before stepping over the threshold between mouthfuls of pie crust he told her about ray duff and asked if everything was okay at todorovs flat reckon young colin has a thing going for phyllida clarke mused detective constables phyllida hawes and colin tibbet shared the cid suite at gayfield square with rebus and clarke until recently all four had worked under the baleful gaze of detective inspector derek starr but starr seeking the further advancement which he saw as his right was on secondment to police headquarters on fettes avenue the rumour was that once rebus walked into the sunset clarke would take his place promoted inspector it was a rumour clarke herself was trying not to listen to why do you ask rebus lifted his glass noting that it was already almost empty they just seem very comfortable with one another rebus stared at her trying for a look of pained surprise and were not were fine she answered with a smile but i think theyve been on a couple of dates not that they want anyone to know tou reckon theyre snuggling up just now in the dead mans bed clarke wrinkled her nose at the suggestion then half a minute later im just wondering how to handle it you mean once im out of the way and youre in charge rebus put down his fork and gave her a glare youre the one who wants all the loose ends tied up she complained maybe so but ive never thought of myself as an agony aunt he lifted his glass again only to find that hed finished it do you want coffee she asked making it sound like a peace offering he shook his head and started patting his pockets what i need is a proper smoke he found the packet and rose to his feet tfou get yourself a coffee while im outside what about this afternoon he thought for a moment well get more done if we diwy it up you go see the librarian again ill hit kings stables road fine she said not bothering to disguise the fact that it wasnt really fine at all rebus stood his ground for a moment as if about to muster some words then waved the cigarette in her direction and headed for the door and thanks for the lunch she said as soon as he was out of earshot rebus thought he knew why they could barely hold a fiveminute conversation without starting to snipe at one another it was bound to be a tense time him leaving the field of battle her on the cusp of promotion theyd worked together so long been friends almost as long bound to be a tense time everyone assumed that theyd slept together at some point down the line but no way either of them would have let it happen how could they have worked as partners afterwards it would have been all or nothing and they both loved the job too much to let anything else get in the way the one thing hed made her promise was that thered be no surprise parties his last week at work their boss at gayfield square had even offered to host something but rebus had thanked him with a shake of the head youre the longestserving officer in cid dci macrae had persisted then its the folk whove put up with me who deserve the medal rebus had retorted the cordon was still in place at the bottom of raeburn wynd but one of the locals ducked beneath the blueandwhitestriped tape resistant to the idea that anywhere in edinburgh could be off limits to him or so rebus surmised by the hand gesture the man made when warned by ray duff that he was contaminating a crime scene duff was shaking his head more in sorrow than anything else when rebus approached gates reckoned this is where id find you rebus said duff rolled his eyes and now youre walking all over my locus rebus answered with a twitch of the mouth duff was crouching beside his forensic kit a toughened red plastic toolbox bought from b ampq its myriad drawers opened concertinastyle but duff was in the process of closing them thought youd be putting your feet up duff commented no you didnt duff laughedtrue enough any joy rebus asked duff snapped shut the box and lifted it with him as he got to his feet i wandered as far as the top of the lane checking all the garages along the way thing is if hed been attacked up there wed have traces of blood on the roadway he stamped his foot to reinforce the point and the bloods elsewhere john he gestured for rebus to follow and took a left along kings stables road see anything rebus looked hard at the pavement and noticed the trail of splashes there were intervals between them the blood had lost most of its colour but was still recognisable how come we didnt spot this last night duff shrugged his car was parked kerbside and he unlocked it long enough to stow his box of tricks how far have you followed it rebus asked i was just about to get started when you arrived then lets go they began walking eyes on the sporadic series of drips tou going to join scru duff asked think theyd want me scru was the serious crime review unit it consisted of three retired detectives whose job was to look at unsolveds did you hear about that result we got last week duff said dna from a sweated fingerprint sort of thing that can be useful on cold cases dna boost means we can decipher dna multiples shame i cant decipher what youre saying duff chuckled worlds changing john faster than most of us can keep up with youre saying i should embrace the scrapheap duff just shrugged theyd covered a hundred yards or so and were standing at the exit to a multistorey car park there were two barriers drivers could choose either one once youd paid for your ticket you slid it into a slot and the barrier would rise have you idd the victim duff asked looking around as he tried to pick up the trail again a russian poet did he drive a car he couldnt change his own lightbulbs ray thing about car parks john theres always a bit of oil left lying around rebus had noticed that there were intercoms fixed alongside either barrier he pressed a button and waited after a few moments a voice crackled from the loudspeaker what is it wonder if you can help me you after directions or something look chief this is a car park all we do here is park cars it took rebus only a second to work things out tou can see me he said yes a cctv camera high up in one corner pointing at the exit rebus gave it a wave have you got a problem with your car the voice was asking im a cop rebus answered want to have a word with you what about where are you next floor up the voice admitted eventually is this to do with that prang i had that depends did you happen to hit a guy and kill him christ no might be okay then well be there in a minute rebus moved away from the barrier towards where ray duff was down on all fours peering beneath a parked bmw not keen on these new beamers duff said sensing rebus behind him found something i think theres blood under here quite a bit of it if you were asking me id say this is trails end rebus walked around the vehicle there was a ticket on the dashboard showing that it had entered the car park at eleven that morning next car along duff was saying is there something underneath it rebus did a circuit of the big lexus but couldnt see anything nothing else for it but to get down on hands and knees himself a bit of string or wire he reached a hand beneath the car fingertips scrabbling at it eventually drawing it out hauled himself back to his feet and held it dangling by thumb and forefinger a plain silver neckchain ray he said better go fetch your kit clarke decided it wasnt worth visiting the librarian so called her from todorovs flat while hawes and tibbet started the search clarke had barely punched in the number for the poetry library when hawes arrived back from the bedroom waving the dead mans passport under a corner of the mattress hawes said first place i looked clarke just nodded and moved into the hallway for a bit more privacy miss thomas she said into her phone its detective sergeant clarke here sorry to trouble you again so soon three minutes later she was back in the living room with just a couple of names yes abigail thomas had accompanied todorov to the pub after his recital but shed only stayed for the one and knew that the poet wouldnt be satisfied until hed sampled another four or five wateringholes i reckoned he was in safe hands with mr riordan shed told clarke the sound engineer tes no one else was there none of the other poets just the three of us and as i say i didnt stay long colin tibbet meantime had finished rummaging through desk drawers and kitchen cupboards and was tilting the sofa to see if anything other than dust might be hidden there clarke lifted a book from the floor it was another copy ofastapovo blues shed managed a couple of minutes research on count tolstoy so knew that hed died in a railway siding shunning the wife who had refused to join his paredtothebone lifestyle this helped her make more sense of the collections final poem codex coda with its refrain of a cold cleansed death todorov she saw had not quite finished with any of the poems in the book there were pencilled amendments throughout she reached into his wastebin and uncrumpled one of the discarded sheets city noise invisible havoccrying air congested as a the rest of the sheet consisted of doodled punctuation marks there was a folder on his desk but nothing inside it a book of killer sudokus all of them finished pens and pencils and an unused calligraphy set complete with instructions she walked over to the wall and stood in front of the edinburgh bus map traced a line from kings stables road to buccleuch place there were a dozen routes he could have chosen maybe he was on a pub crawl or a little bit lost no reason to assume hed been heading home he could have left his flat and crossed george square made for candlemaker row and wandered down its steep brae into the grassmarket plenty of pubs there and kings stables road only a righthand fork away her phone rang caller id rebus phyl found his passport she told him and i just found his neckchain lying on the floor of the multistorey so he was killed there and dumped in the lane trail of blood says so or he staggered that far and then keeled over another possibility rebus seemed to concede thing is though what was he doing in the car park in the first place are you at his flat i was just about to leave before you do add car keys or a driving licence to the search list and ask scarlett colwell if todorov had access to a vehicle im pretty sure shell say no but all the same no sign of any abandoned cars in the multistorey good point shiv ill have someone check talk to you later the phone went dead and she managed a little smile hadnt heard rebus so fired up in several months not for the first time she wondered what the hell he would do with himself when the work was done answer bug her most likely phone calls daily wanting to know everything about her case load clarke got through to dr colwell on the mobile colwell having forgotten to turn her own off sorry clarke apologised are you in the middle of your tutorial i had to send them away i can understand maybe you should shut up shop for the day youve had quite a shock and do what exactly my boyfriends in london ive got the whole flat to myself there must be a friend you could call clarke looked up as hawes walked back into the room but this time all hawes did was offer a shrug no notebook keys or cash card tibbet had done no better and was sitting on the chair frowning over one of the poems in astapovo blues anyway clarke rattled on reason im phoning is to ask if alexander owned a car he didnt could he drive ive no idea i certainly wouldnt have ventured into any vehicle with him behind the wheel clarke was nodding towards the route map stood to reason todorov would take buses thanks anyway she said did you talk to abi thomas colwell asked abruptly she went to the pub with him ill bet she did but only stayed for one oh yes tou sound as if you dont believe her dr colwell abi thomas got hot flushes just reading alexanders poems imagine how she felt squeezed in next to him at a corner table in some seedy bar well thanks for your help but clarke was talking into a dead phone she stared at it then became aware of two pairs of eyes on her hawes and tibbet i dont think were going to find anything else here siobhan hawes piped up while her partner clucked his agreement he was an inch shorter than her and several inches less smart but knew enough to let her argue their case back to base clarke suggested to enthusiastic nods okay she agreed but take one more recce first and this time were after car keys or anything else that might suggest the deceased would have need of a carparking space having said which she relieved tibbet of his book and swapped places with him settling back to see if there was anything shed missed in codex coda the socos tried pushing the bmw aside with no success at all they then debated jacking it up or maneuvering a hoist in so they could lift it the rest of the parking level had become a buzz of activity as a line of cops in white overalls shuffled along in formation on their knees checking that the ground held no further clues todd goodyear was among them and greeted rebus with a nod photos and video were being taken and another team was outside tracing the route from car park to lane the socos were trying not to look too shamefaced knowing they should have spotted the blood trail on the night itself they gave ray duff dirty looks whenever his back was turned such was the scene which greeted the bmws owner when she returned briefcase and shopping bags in hand todd goodyear was told to get to his feet and take a brief statement from her bloody brief tam banks stressed keen for his team to start work on the evidence beneath her car rebus was standing alongside the car parks security guard the man had just returned from a check of the other levels his name was joe wills and the uniform he was wearing had probably been tailored with someone else in mind hed already explained that it would be hard to tell an abandoned car from any of the others toure open twentyfour hours rebus had asked wills had shaken his head close at eleven and you dont look to see if any cars are left wills had offered a shrug which went beyond the casual not much job satisfaction rebus had guessed now wills was explaining that he still couldnt say whether any of the current bays had been occupied overnight we do a numberplate check once a fortnight he said so a stolen car to give an example could sit here fourteen days before youd have an inkling thats the policy the man looked to rebus like a drinker grey stubble hair in need of a wash eyes redrimmed there was probably a bottle of something hidden away in his control room to be added to the daily round of teas and coffees what sort of shifts do you work seven till three or three till eleven i seem to prefer the mornings five days on two off theres other guys usually do the weekends rebus checked his watch twenty minutes till the changeover tour colleague will be starting soon is that the same one whod have been here last night wills nodded names gary tou havent spoken to him since yesterday wills shrugged heres what i know about gary lives in shandon supports hearts and has a stoater of a missus thats a start rebus muttered then lets go look at your cctv what for the mans eyes were glassy as he met rebuss glare to see if the tapes caught anything from the look on willss face rebus knew what was coming next a single word forming echo and question both tapes they walked back up the exit slope anyway willss lair was a small booth with greasy windows and a radio playing five flickering blackandwhite screens plus a sixth which was blank top storey wills explained its playing up rebus studied the remaining five the pictures were blurry he couldnt pick out any individual licence plates the figures from the floor below were indistinct too what the hell use is this he couldnt help asking bosses seem to think it gives the clients a sense of security bloody false at best as the poor sod in the mortuary can testify rebus turned away from the screens one of the cameras used to point pretty much at that spot wills said but they get moved around and you dont keep any recordings machine packed in a month back wills nodded towards a dusty space below the monitors not that we bothered much all the bosses were interested in was when anyone tried conning their way out without paying systems pretty foolproof didnt happen often wills thought of something theres a set of stairs between the top storey and the pavement we had a punter attacked there last year oh i said at the time they should get cctv into the stairwell but nothing ever happened at least you tried dont know why i bother jobs on the way out anyway theyre replacing us with just the one guy on a motorbike scooting between half a dozen car parks rebus was looking around the cramped space kettle and mugs a few tattered paperbacks and magazines plus the radio these were all on the work surface opposite the monitors he guessed that for most of the time the guards would be facing away from the screens why the hell not minimum wage bosses only a distant threat no job security one or two buzzes on the intercom per day people whod lost their tickets or didnt have change there was a rack of cds bands whose names rebus vaguely recognised kaiser chiefs razorlight killers strokes white stripes no cd player he commented theyre gary s wills explained he brings one of those little machines with him with headphones rebus guessed watching as wills nodded just wonderful he muttered you were working here last year mr wills been here three years next month and your colleague eight maybe nine months i tried his shift but couldnt hack it i like my afternoons and evenings free the better to do some drinking rebus cajoled willss face hardened encouraging rebus to press on ever been in trouble mr wills how do you mean police trouble wills made show of scratching dandruff from his scalp long time ago he eventually said the bosses know about it fighting was it thieving wills corrected him but that was twenty years back what about your car you said youd had a prang but wills was peering through the window heres gary now a palecoloured car had drawn to a halt outside the cabin its driver locking it after him the door burst open hells going on downstairs joe the guard called gary wasnt yet quite in uniform rebus guessed the jacket was in his carrier bag along with a sandwich box he was a few years younger than wills a lot leaner and half a foot taller he dumped two newspapers on to the worktop but couldnt get any further into the room with rebus there space was at a premium the man was shrugging out of his coat crisp white shirt beneath but no tie probably a clipon tucked into a pocket somewhere im detective inspector rebus rebus told him last night a man was severely beaten on level zero wills added is he dead the new arrival asked wideeyed wills made a cutthroat gesture with accompanying sound effect bloody hell does the reaper know wills shook his head and saw that rebus needed an explanation its what we call one of the bosses he said shes the only one we ever see wears a long black coat with a pointy hood hence the name rebus nodded his understanding ill need to take a statement he told the new arrival wills seemed suddenly keen to leave gathering up his bits and pieces and stuffing them into his own supermarket carrier happened on your watch gary he said with a tut the reaper wont be happy now theres a turnup for the books gary had moved out of the cabin giving wills room to make his exit rebus came out too needing the oxygen well talk again he warned the departing figure wills waved without looking back rebus turned his attention to gary lanky hed have called him and roundshouldered as if awkwardly aware of his height a long face with a square jaw and welldefined cheekbones plus a mop of dark hair rebus almost said it out loud you should be on a stage in a band not stuck in a deadend job but maybe gary didnt see it that way goodlooking though which explained the stoater of a missus then again rebus couldnt tell just how high or low joe willss standards might be twenty minutes got him nothing except a retread full name gary walsh maisonette in shandon nine months on the job tried taxidriving before that but didnt like the night shift had seen and heard nothing unusual the previous evening what happens at eleven rebus had asked we shut up shop metal shutters come down at the entrance and exit nobody can get in or out walsh had shaken his head you check no ones locked in a nod were any cars left on level zero not that i remember tou always park next to the cabin thats right but when you drive out you exit on level zero a nod from the guard and you didnt see anything didnt hear anything either there would have been blood on the ground a shrug you like your music mr walsh love it lie back in your chair feet up headphones on eyes shut some security guard you make rebus had stared at the monitors again ignoring walshs glower there were two covering level zero one was fixed on the exit barriers the other trained on the far corner youd have had better luck with a cameraphone sorry i cant be more help walsh had said not bothering to sound sympathetic who was he anyway a russian poet called todorov walsh had thought for a moment i never read poetry join the club rebus had told him bit of a waiting list mind cr studios took up the top floor of a converted warehouse just off constitution street charles riordans hand when clarke shook it was pudgy and moist seeming to leave a residue on her palm which rubbing couldnt remove there were rings on his right hand but not the left and a chunky gold watch loose around his wrist clarke noted sweat stains at the armpits of riordans mauve shirt hed rolled his sleeves up showing arms matted with curled black hairs the way he moved she could tell he always wanted to appear busy there was a receptionist at a desk just inside the door and some sort of engineer pushing buttons at a control desk eyes fixed to a screen showing what clarke guessed were sound waves the kingdom of noise riordan announced impressive clarke allowed through a window she could see two separate booths but no sign of anyone in them bit tight for a band though we can accommodate singersongwriters riordan said one man and his guitar that sort of thing but really were for the spoken word radio commercials audio books tv voiceovers a pretty specialised kingdom clarke couldnt help thinking she asked if there was an office where they could talk but riordan just stretched out his arms a specialised small kingdom well she began as i said on the phone i know riordan burst out i cant believe hes dead neither receptionist nor engineer batted an eyelid riordan had obviously told them the minute hed come off the phone were trying to account for mr todorovs last movements clarke had opened her notebook for effect i believe you had a few drinks with him the night before last i saw him more recently than that sweetheart riordan couldnt help making it sound like a boast hed been wearing sunglasses but now slipped them off showing large darkrimmed eyes i treated him to a curry yesterday evening clarke watched the man nod where was this west maitland street wed had a couple of beers near haymarket hed been through to glasgow for the day any idea why just wanted to see the place he was trying to figure out the difference between the two cities in case it helped explain the country and bloody good luck to him ive been here most of my life and still cant make sense of it riordan shook his head slowly he did try explaining it to me his theory about us but it went in one ear and out the other clarke noticed the receptionist and engineer share a look and assumed this was nothing new as far as they were concerned so he spent the day in glasgow she recapped what time did you meet up around eight hed been waiting till rush hour was past meant he got a cheap ticket met him off the train and we hit a couple of pubs werent the first drinks hed had that day he was drunk he was voluble thing about alex was when he drank he got more intellectual which was a bugger because if you were drinking with him you soon started to lose the plot what happened after the curry not much i had to be heading home he said he was getting thirstier if i know him he would have gone on to mathers on queensferry street but hes just as likely to have wandered into the caledonian hotel leaving todorov at the west end of princes street not a stones throw from kings stables road what time was this mustve been around ten im told by the scottish poetry library that you recorded mr todorovs recital the previous night thats right ive done a lot of poets charlies done a lot of everything the engineer added riordan laughed nervously he means my little project im putting together a sort of soundscape of edinburgh from poetry readings to pub chatter street noise the water of leith at sunrise football crowds traffic on princes street the beach at portobello dogs being walked in the hermitage hundreds of hours of the stuff thousands more like the engineer corrected him clarke tried not to be deflected had you met mr todorov before i taped another performance of his at a cafe which one riordan shrugged it was for a bookshop called word power clarke had seen it that very afternoon opposite the pub where shed had lunch with rebus she remembered a line in one of todorovs poems nothing connects and thought again how wrong he was how long ago was that three weeks back we had a drink that night too clarke tapped her pen against her notebook do you have a receipt for the restaurant probably riordan reached into his pocket and brought out a wallet first sighting this year the engineer said eliciting a laugh from the receptionist shed clamped a pen between her teeth and was playing with it clarke decided the two of them were an item whether their employer knew it or not riordan had pulled out a mass of receipts reminds me he muttered need to get some stuff to the accountant ah here it is he handed it over mind if i ask why you want it shows the time you got the bill sir nine fortyeight much as you said clarke slipped the piece of paper into the back of her notebook one question you havent asked riordan said teasingly why did we meet up at all all right thenwhy did you alex wanted a copy of his gig seemed to him it had gone well clarke thought back to todorovs flat did he ask for any particular format i burned it on to a cd he didnt have a cd player riordan gave a shrug plenty of people do true enough but the cd itself hadnt turned up most likely taken with the other stuff could you make another copy for me mr riordan clarke asked how would that help im not sure but id like to hear him in full flow as it were the masters back at my home studio i could get it burnt by tomorrow im based at gayfield square any chance someone could pop it in ill have one of the children do it riordan agreed eyes taking in the engineer and receptionist thanks for your help clarke said when smoking had been banned back in march rebus had foreseen disaster for places like the oxford bar traditional pubs catering to basic needs a pint a cigarette horseracing on tv and a hotline to the local turf accountant yet most of his haunts had survived albeit with reduced takings true to form however the smokers had formed a stubborn little gang that would congregate outside trading stories and gossip tonight the talk was the usual mix someone was giving his views on a recently opened tapas bar while the woman alongside wanted to know what the quietest time was to visit ikea a pipesmoker was arguing for fullscale independence while his englishsounding neighbour teased that the south would be glad of the breakup and no bloody alimony north sea oils the only alimony well need the pipesmoker said its already running out twenty years and youll be back with the beggingbowl in twenty years well be norway either that or albania thing is another smoker interrupted if labour lost its scottish seats at westminster itd never get elected again south of the border fair point the englishman said just after opening or just before closing the woman was asking bits of squid and tomato her neighbour stated not bad once you got the taste rebus stubbed out his cigarette and headed indoors the round of drinks was waiting for him along with his change colin tibbet had emerged from the back room to help out you can take your tie off you know rebus teased him were not in the office tibbet smiled but said nothing rebus pocketed the change and hefted the two glasses he liked that phyllida hawes drank pints tibbet was on orange juice clarke sticking to white wine theyd taken the table at the far end clarke had her notebook out hawes raised her fresh glass in a silent toast to rebus he scraped himself back into the chair drinks took longer than i thought he offered by way of apology managed a quick smoke though clarke chided him he decided to ignore her so what have we got he asked instead well they had a timeline for todorovs last two or three hours of life they had a growing list of items missing presumed removed from the deceased they had a new locus the car park is there anything colin tibbet piped up to suggest that were dealing with something other than a particularly brutal mugging not really clarke offered but she met john rebuss eyes and he gave a slow blink of acknowledgement it didnt feel right clarke could sense it too it just didnt feel right his phone which hed laid on the tabletop started to vibrate sending tremors across the surface of the pint glass next to it he picked it up and moved away either for a better signal or to escape the hubbub they werent alone in the back room a group of three tourists sat bewildered in one corner showing too much interest in the various artefacts and adverts on the walls two men in business suits were hunched over another table arguing nearsilently about something the tv was on tuned to a quiz show we should enter a team of four tibbet said hawes asked what he meant hq is having a pub quiz week before christmas he explained by then clarke reminded him well be a team of three heard anything about the promotion hawes asked her clarke just shook her head taking their time hawes added twisting the knife rebus was coming back curiouser and curiouser he said sitting down again that was howdenhall with a bit of news tests show our russian poet had ejaculated at some point during the day stained underpants apparently maybe he got lucky in glasgow clarke speculated maybe rebus agreed him and this sound recordist hawes offered todorov had a wife clarke said tou can never tell with poets though rebus added couldve been some time after the curry of course any time up until the minute he was attacked clarke and rebus shared another look tibbet was shifting in his chair or it could have been you know he cleared his throat cheeks reddening what clarke asked you know tibbet repeated i think colin means masturbation hawes interjected tibbets look was a study in gratitude john it was the barman rebus turned towards him thought youd want to see this he held up a newspaper it was the days final printing of the evening news the headline was death of a poet and beneath it in bold lettering the maverick who dared to say nyet there was an archive photo of alexander todorov he stood in princes street gardens the castle louring behind him a tartan scarf was wrapped around his neck probably his first day in scotland a man with only two months to live cats out of the bag rebus said taking the proffered newspaper then to anyone around the table who might know does that count as metaphor day three friday november there was a funny smell in the cid office at gayfield square police station you often noticed it at the height of summer but this year it seemed determined to linger it would disappear for a matter of days or weeks then one morning would announce its creeping reappearance there had been regular complaints and the scottish police federation had threatened a walkout floors had been lifted and drains tested traps set for vermin but no answers smells like death the seasoned officers would comment rebus knew what they meant every now and again a body would be discovered decomposing in the armchair of a sixties semi or a floater would be pulled from leith docks there was a special room set aside for them at the mortuary and the attendants had placed a radio on the floor which could be switched on when desired helps take our minds off the pong at gayfield square the answer was to open all available windows which sent the temperature plummeting the office of detective chief inspector james macrae separated by a glass door from the cid suite was like a walkin fridge this morning macrae had shown foresight by hauling an electric heater into work from his blackhall home rebus had seen somewhere that blackhall boasted the wealthiest residents in the city it had sounded an unlikely setting bungalows and more bungalows homes in barnton and the new town fetched millions then again maybe that explained why the people who lived there werent as rich as those in bungalowland macrae had plugged the heater in and switched it on but it stayed his side of the desk and radiated warmth only so far phyllida hawes had already shuffled so close to it that she was almost seated on macraes lap something the dci noted with a scowl right he barked clenching his hands together as if in angry prayer progress report but before rebus could begin macrae sensed a problem colin shut the door will you lets keep what heat there is to ourselves not much room sir tibbet commented he was standing in the doorway and what he said was true with macrae rebus clarke and hawes inside space in the dcis den was limited then go back to your desk macrae replied im sure phyllida can report on your behalf but tibbet didnt want that happening if clarke was promoted di thered be a vacancy at detective sergeant making hawes and him rivals as well as partners he sucked in his stomach and managed to get the door closed progress report macrae repeated but then his phone rang and he lifted it with a growl rebus wondered about his bosss blood pressure his own was nothing to boast about but macraes face was typically puce and though a couple of years younger than rebus his hair had almost gone as rebuss own doctor had conceded during his last checkup youve had a lucky run john but luck always runs out macrae made only a few grunts before putting the phone back down his eyes were on rebus someone from the russian consulate at the front desk wondered when theyd turn up rebus said siobhan and i should take this sir meantime phyl and colin can tell you all you need to know we had a powwow last night macrae nodded his agreement and rebus turned to clarke one of the interview rooms she suggested just what i was thinking they moved out of the dcis office and through the cid suite the wallboards were still blank later today photos from the crime scene would go up along with lists of names jobs to be done and schedules of hours at some murder scenes you would set up a temporary hq work from there but rebus didnt see the point this time round they would put up posters at the car park exit appealing for information and maybe get hawes and tibbet or a few of the uniforms to stick leaflets on windscreens but this large cold room would be their base clarke was looking back over her shoulder towards macraes office hawes and tibbet seemed to be in competition to see who could offer the best titbits to the boss anyone rebus commented would think theres a ds slot going begging whos your money on thyls got more years in clarke answered shes got to be favourite if colin gets it i think shell walk rebus nodded his agreement which interview room he asked i like three why so tables all greasy and scabby graffiti scratched on the walls its the sort of place you go when youve done something rebus smiled at her thinking even for the pure at heart ir was a troubling experience spot on he said the consular official was called nikolai stahov he introduced himself with a selfeffacing smile he was younglooking and shiny faced with a parting in his lightbrown hair which made him seem even more boyish but he was six feet tall and broadshouldered and wore a threequarterlength black woollen coat complete with belt and the collar turned up from one pocket peeked a pair of black leather gloves mittens actually rebus realised smooth and rounded where there should have been fingers did your mum dress you he wanted to ask but he shook stahovs hand instead were sorry about mr todorov clarke said reaching out her own hand towards the russian she got a little bow along with the shake my consulate stahov said wishes to be assured that everything possible is being done to capture and prosecute the perpetrator rebus nodded slowly we thought wed be more comfortable in one of our interview rooms they led the young russian down the corridor stopping at the third door it was unlocked rebus pulled it open and gestured for clarke and stahov to go in then he slid the panel across the door changing its message from vacant to in use take a seat he said stahov was studying his surroundings as he lowered himself on to the chair he was about to place his hands on the tabletop but thought better of it and rested them on his lap instead clarke had taken the seat opposite rebus content to lean against the wall arms folded so what can you tell us about alexander todorov he asked inspector i came here for reassurances and from a sense of protocol you must know that as a diplomat i am not obliged to answer any of your questions because youve got immunity rebus acknowledged we just assumed youd want to assist us in any way possible it is one of your countrymen whos been killed and rather a notable one at that he tried to sound aggrieved of course of course thats unquestionable stahov kept turning his head trying to talk to both of them at the same time good clarke told him then you wont mind us asking how big a thorn todorov was proving to be thorn it was hard to tell if stahovs english was really defeating him how awkward was it for you clarke rephrased the question having a noted dissident poet living in edinburgh it wasnt awkward at all tou welcomed him clarke pretended to guess was there any kind of party at the consulate hed been talked about for the nobel that must have given you great satisfaction in todays russia the nobel prize isnt such a big deal mr todorov had given a couple of public performances recently did you happen to go see him i had other engagements did anyone from the consulate but stahov felt the need to interrupt i dont see what bearing any of this could have on your inquiries in fact your questions could be construed as a smokescreen whether we wanted alexander todorov here or not is of no consequence he was murdered in your city your country edinburgh is not without its problems with race and creed polish workers have found themselves attacked wearing the wrong football shirt can be provocation enough rebus looked towards clarke talk about a smokescreen i am speaking the truth stahovs voice was beginning to tremble and he made an effort to calm himself what my consulate requires inspector is to be kept informed of developments that way we can reassure moscow that your investigation has been rigorous and fair and they in turn can advise your government of our satisfaction rebus and clarke seemed to consider this rebus unfolded his arms and slipped his hands into his pockets theres always the possibility he said quietly that mr todorov was attacked by someone with a grudge that person could be a member of the russian community here in edinburgh im assuming the consulate keeps a list of nationals living and working here my understanding inspector was that alexander todorov was just another victim of this citys street crime foolish to rule anything out at this stage sir and that list would come in handy clarke stressed stahov looked from one detective to the other rebus hoped hed make up his mind soon one error theyd made in opting for ir it was bloody freezing the russians overcoat looked toasty but rebus reckoned siobhan was going to start shivering soon he was surprised their breath wasnt visible in the air i will see what i can do stahov said at last but quid pro quo you will keep me informed of developments give us your number clarke told him the young russian seemed to take this as agreement rebus knew it was anything but there was a package waiting for siobhan clarke at the front desk rebus had gone outside for a cigarette and to see whether stahov had a chauffeur clarke opened the padded envelope and found a cd inside with the single word riordan written on it in thick black pen it told her a lot about charles riordan that he used his own name in place of todorovs she took the cd upstairs but there was no machine to play it on so instead she headed for the car park passing rebus as he came in big black merc waiting for him rebus confirmed guy wearing shades and gloves at the helm where are you off to she told him and he said he wouldnt mind joining her though warning that he might not last the pace in the end though the pair of them sat in clarkes car for a solid hour and a quarter engine running so the heater stayed on riordan had recorded everything some chat between audience members then the introduction by abigail thomas todorovs halfhour and the q and a session after most of the questions steering clear of politics as the applause died and the audience dispersed riordans mike was still picking up chatter hes an obsessive clarke commented i hear you rebus agreed almost the last thing they heard was a muttered snatch of russian probably rebus speculated saying thank khrushchev thats over whos khrushchev clarke asked some friend of jack palance the recital itself had been riveting the poets voice by turns sonorous gruff elegiac and booming he performed some of his work in english some in russian but the majority in both usually russian first english after sounds like scots doesnt it clarke had asked at one point maybe to someone from england rebus had retorted okay so shed walked into that one as so often before her southern accent had been easy prey for rebus since the moment theyd met this time shed refused to rise to him this one shed said at another point is called raskolnikov i remember it from the book raskolnikovs a character in crime and punishment a book id probably read before you were even born youve read dostoevsky you think id lie about something like that whats it about then its about guilt one of the great russian novels in my opinion how many others have you read thats neither here nor there now as she turned the cd off he swivelled towards her youve listened to the show youve been through todorovs book have you found anything resembling a motive for his killing no she conceded and i know what youre thinking macraes going to treat it as a mugging gone wrong which is pretty well how the consulate wants to see it handled too she gave a slow thoughtful nod so who did he have sex with she eventually asked is it relevant we wont know till we know most likely candidate is scarlett colwell because shes a stunner rebus sounded dubious cant bear to think of her with anyone else clarke teased what about miss thomas at the poetry library but this time clarke gave a snort i dont see her as a contender she explained dr colwell didnt seem so sure which probably says more about dr colwell than ms thomas maybe young colin had a point rebus ploughed on or its just as likely our redblooded poet picked up a tart in glasgow he saw clarkes look sorry i should have said sex worker or has the terminology changed again since i last got my knuckles rapped keep going and ill rap them again she paused for a moment eyes still fixed on him funny to think of you reading crime and punishment she took a deep breath i did a search on harry goodyear thought you might he turned his attention to the windscreen and the bleak car park beyond clarke could see that he wanted to wind down the window so he could smoke but the smell was out there lying in wait just above the level of the tarmac he was a pub landlord in rose street mideighties she said you were a detective sergeant you helped put him away he was dealing drugs from the premises he died in jail didnt he just a year or two after bad heart or something todd goodyear wouldnt long have been out of nappies she paused in case he had anything to add then went on todds got a brother did you know that names sol been on our radar a few times i say that but actually he lives in dalkeith making him e divisions problem guess what hes been in trouble for drugs so you know about him rebus shook his head educated guess and you didnt know todd goodyear was in the police believe it or not shiv i dont keep tabs on the grandkids of villains i locked up two decades back thing is we didnt just get sol for possession we tried to have him for dealing too court gave him the benefit of the doubt rebus turned towards her how do you know all this i was in the office before you this morning few minutes on the computer and one phone call to dalkeith cid rumour at the time was sol goodyear was dealing on behalf of big ger cafferty she could see straight away that shed struck a nerve cafferty was unfinished business big unfinished business his name top of rebuss to do list cafferty had made a decent fist of looking like a retired villain but rebus and clarke knew better cafferty still ran edinburgh and had found himself a place at the top of her list too is any of this leading somewhere rebus asked turning his attention back to the windscreen not really she ejected the cd from its slot the radio blasted into life forth the dj talking twenty to the dozen she switched it off rebus had noticed something didnt know there was a camera there he said he meant at the corner of the building between the first and second storeys the camera was pointing into the car park they reckon it stops vandalism reminds me actually think theres any point looking at citycentre footage from the night todorov was killed bound to be cameras at the west end of princes street maybe on lothian road too if someone was shadowing him she let the sentence drift its an idea he admitted needle in a haystack she added his silence seemed to confirm it and she rested her head against the back of the seat neither of them in any hurry to go back inside i remember reading in a paper that weve got the most surveillance of any country in the world more cctv in london than the whole of the usa can that be right cant say ive noticed it reducing the crime stats rebuss eyes narrowed whats that noise clarke saw that tibbet was gesturing from an upstairs window i think were wanted maybe guilt got the better of our killer and hes come to hand himself in maybe clarke said not believing it for one moment been here before rebus asked once theyd passed through the metaldetector he was scooping loose change back into his pocket got the guided tour soon after it opened clarke admitted there were indented shapes in the ceiling rebus couldnt tell if they were supposed to be crusaderstyle crosses plenty of activity in the main entrance hall tables had been set up for the tour parties id badges lying on them and placards to say which groups were expected staff were everywhere ready to direct visitors to the reception desk at the far end of the hall some schoolkids in uniform were settling down for an early lunch first time for me rebus told clarke always wondered what four hundred million pounds looks like the scottish parliament had divided public opinion from the moment its plans were revealed in the media some thought it bold and revolutionary others wondered at its quirks and its price tag the architect had died before completing the project as had the man whod commissioned it but it was built now and working and rebus had to admit that the debating chamber whenever hed seen it on the tv news looked a bit special when they told the woman on the reception desk that they were here to see megan macfarlane she printed out a couple of visitor passes a call to the msps office confirmed that they were expected and another member of staff stepped forward and asked them to follow him he was a tall briskstepping figure and like the receptionist probably not a day under sixtyfive they followed him down corridors and up in a lift and down more corridors plenty of concrete and wood rebus commented and glass clarke added the special expensive kind of course rebus speculated their guide said nothing until they turned yet another corner and found a young man waiting for them thanks sandy the man said ill take it from here as the guide headed back the way theyd just come clarke thanked him and received a little grunt of acknowledgement maybe he was just out of breath my names roddy liddle the young man was telling them i work for megan and who exactly is megan rebus asked liddle stared at him as if he were maybe making a joke all our boss told us rebus explained was to come down here and talk to someone with that name apparently she phoned him it was me who did the phoning liddle said making it sound like yet another arduous task that hed taken in his stride good for you son rebus told him the son obviously rankled liddle was in his early twenties and reckoned he was already well on his way in politics he looked rebus up and down before deciding to dismiss him as irrelevant im sure megan will explain having said which liddle turned and led them to the end of the corridor the msps private offices were well proportioned with desks for staff as well as the politicians themselves it was rebuss first sighting of one of the infamous thinkpods little alcoves with curved windows and a cushioned seat this was where the msps were supposed to come up with bluesky ideas it was also where they found megan macfarlane she rose to greet them glad you could come at such short notice she said i know youre busy on the inquiry so i wont keep you long she was short and slim and impeccably groomed not a hair out of place and with just the right amount of makeup she wore halfmoon glasses which rested most of the way down her nose so that she peered over them at the two detectives im megan macfarlane she said inviting them to make introductions of their own liddle was back behind his desk staring at messages on his computer rebus and clarke gave their names and the msp looked around for places to sit before having a better idea well go downstairs and get a coffee roddy can i bring you one back no thanks megan one cup a days plenty for me good point i dont need to be in the chamber later on she waited till hed shaken his head then focused her gaze on clarke diuretic effects you know doesnt do to be caught short when youre halfway through a point of order they went back the way theyd come and found themselves descending an impressive staircase macfarlane announcing that the scot nats had high hopes for mays elections latest polls put us five points clear of labour blairs unpopular and so is gordon brown the iraq war cash for peerages it was one of my colleagues who started that investigation labours panicking because scotland yard say theyve uncovered significant and valuable material she gave a satisfied smile scandal seems to be our opponents middle name so its the protest vote youre after rebus asked macfarlane didnt seem to feel this merited any sort of reply if you win in may rebus went on do we get a referendum on independence absolutely and we suddenly become a celtic tiger the labour party has been failing the people of scotland for fifty years inspector its time for a change queuing at the counter she announced that this would be her treat rebus ordered an espresso clarke a small cappuccino macfarlane herself opted for a black coffee into which she poured three sachets of sugar there were tables nearby and they chose an empty one pushing aside the leftover crockery were still in the dark rebus said lifting his cup i hope you dont mind me getting straight to the point but as you said yourself weve got a murder inquiry waiting for us back at base absolutely macfarlane agreed then she paused for a moment as if to marshal her thoughts how much do you know about me she began by asking rebus and clarke shared a look until we were told to come see you rebus obliged neither of us had ever heard of you the msp trying not to show any pain blew across the surface of her coffee before taking a sip im a scottish nationalist she said that much wed guessed and that means im passionate about my country if scotland is to flourish in this new century and flourish outwith the confines of the uk we need enterprise initiative and investment she counted these three off on her fingers thats why im an active member of the urc the urban regeneration committee not that our remit is purely urban you understand in fact ive already proposed a namechange in order to make that clear forgive me for interrupting clarke said having noted rebuss agitation but can i ask what any of this has to do with us macfarlane lowered her eyes and gave a little smile of apology im afraid when im passionate about something i do tend to rabbit on rebuss glance towards clarke said it all this unfortunate incident macfarlane was saying involving the russian poet what about it rebus prompted right now a group of businessmen is in scotland a very prosperous group and all of them russian they represent oil gas and steel and other industries besides they are looking to the future inspector scotland s future we need to ensure nothing jeopardises the links and relationships that weve painstakingly fostered over the past several years what we certainly dont want is anyone thinking were not a welcoming country a country that embraces cultures and nationalities look at what happened to that young sikh lad toure asking us clarke summarised if this was a racial attack one of the group has voiced that concern macfarlane admitted she looked towards rebus but he was staring at the ceiling again still not sure about it hed heard that its concave sections were supposed to look like boats when he turned his attention back to the msp her worried face demanded some reassurance we cant rule anything out he decided to tell her instead could have been racially motivated the russian consulate told us as much this morning thereve been attacks on some of the migrant workers from eastern europe so its certainly a line well be following she looked shocked by these words just as hed intended clarke was hiding her smile behind a raised cup rebus decided there was more fun to be had would any of these businessmen have met with mr todorov recently if so it would be helpful to talk to them macfarlane was saved from answering by the appearance of a new arrival like rebus and clarke he wore a badge which proclaimed him a visitor megan he drawled i saw you from the reception desk hope im not interrupting not at all the msp could hardly disguise her relief let me get you a coffee stuart then to rebus and clarke this is stuart janney from first albannach bank stuart these are the officers in charge of the todorov case janney shook hands before pulling over a chair i hope youre both clients he said with a smile state of my finances rebus informed him you should be happy im with the competition janney made a show of wincing hed been carrying his trench coat over one arm and now folded it across his lap grim news about that murder he said while macfarlane rejoined the queue at the counter grim rebus echoed from what ms macfarlane just said clarke added im guessing shes already spoken with you about it happened to come up in conversation this morning janney acknowledged running a hand through his blond hair his face was freckled the skin pink reminding rebus of a younger colin montgomerie and his eyes were the same dark blue as his tie janney seemed to have decided that further explanation was needed we were on the phone to one another are you something to do with these russian visitors rebus asked janney nodded fab never turns away prospective customers inspector fab it was how most people referred to the first albannach bank it was a term of affection but behind it lay one of the biggest employers and probably the most profitable company in scotland the tv adverts showed fab as an extended family and were filmed almost as minisoaps while the banks brandnew corporate hq built on greenbelt land despite the protests was a city in miniature complete with shopping arcade and cafes staff could get their hair done there or buy food for the evening meal they could use the gym or play a round of golf on the companys own ninehole course so if youre looking for someone to manage that overdraft janney handed out business cards macfarlane laughed when she saw it before passing him his black coffee interesting rebus thought he takes it the same way she does but hed bet that if janney was out with an important customer whatever the customer ordered would be janneys drink of choice too the police college at tulliallan had run a course on it a year or two back empathic interviewing techniques when questioning a witness or a suspect you tried to find things you had in common even if that meant lying rebus had never really got round to trying it but he could tell that someone like janney would be a natural stuarts incorrigible the msp was saying what have i told you about touting for business its unethical but she was smiling as she spoke and janney gave a quiet chuckle while sliding his business cards closer to rebus and clarke mr janney clarke began tells us the pair of you were discussing alexander todorov megan macfarlane nodded slowly stuart has an advisory role in urc i didnt think fab would be pronationalist mr janney rebus said completely neutral janney stressed there are twelve members of the urban regeneration committee inspector representing five political parties and how many of them did you speak to on the phone today so far only megan the banker admitted but then its not quite lunchtime he made show of checking his watch stuart is our threei consultant macfarlane was saying inward investment initiatives rebus ignored this did ms macfarlane ask you to drop by mr janney he asked when the banker looked to the msp rebus had his answer he turned his attention to macfarlane herself which businessman was it she blinked sorry which one was it who seemed so concerned about alexander todorov why do you want to know is there any reason i shouldnt know rebus raised an eyebrow for effect the inspectors got you cornered megan janney was saying with a lopsided smile he got a baleful look in return which had gone by the time macfarlane turned towards rebus it was sergei andropov she stated there was a russian president called andropov clarke commented no relation janney told her taking a sip of coffee at hq theyve taken to calling him svengali whys that sir clarke sounded genuinely curious the number of takeovers hes finessed the way he built up his own company into a global player the boards hes won round the strategies and gamesmanship janney sounded like he could go on all day im pretty sure he said its meant as a term of endearment sounds like hes endeared himself to you at any rate rebus commented im guessing first albannach would love to do business with these big shots we already do rebus decided to wipe the smile off the bankers face well alexander todorov happened to bank with you too sir and look what happened to him di rebus has a point sir clarke interrupted any chance you could get us details of mr todorovs accounts and most recent transactions there are protocols i understand sir but they might help us find his killer which in turn would put your clients minds at rest janney gave a thoughtful pout is there an executor not that we know of which branch was his account with clarke stretched out her arms and gave a shrug and a hopeful smile ill see what i can do we appreciate it sir rebus told him were based at gayfield square he made show of studying his surroundings not quite as grand as this but then it didnt bankrupt the taxpayer either it was a quick run from the parliament to the city chambers rebus told the staff on reception that they had a pm appointment with the lord provost and were hellish early but could they leave their car parked outside anyway everyone seemed to think that was fine which caused rebus to beam a smile and ask if they could fill in the time by saying hello to graeme macleod more passes another security check and they were in as they waited for the lift clarke turned to rebus i meant to say you handled macfarlane and janney pretty well i guessed as much from the way you let me do most of the work is it too late for me to withdraw the compliment but they were both smiling how long till they find out weve nicked a parking space under false pretences depends whether they bother to ask the lord provs secretary the lift arrived and they got in descending two storeys below ground level to where a man was waiting rebus introduced him to clarke as graeme macleod and macleod led them into the cmf room explaining that cmf stood for central monitoring facility rebus had been there before but clarke hadnt and her eyes widened a little as she saw the array of closedcircuit monitors dozens of them three deep and with staff manning desks of computers in front of them macleod liked it when visitors were impressed and needed no prompting to give his little speech ten years the citys had cctv he began started with a dozen cameras in the centre now weve got over a hundred and thirty with more due to be introduced shortly we maintain a direct link to the police control centre at bilston and about twelve hundred arrests a year are down to things we spot in this stuffy wee room the room was certainly warm heat from all the monitors and clarke was shrugging off her coat were open macleod went on and can track a suspect while telling the police where to find them the monitors had numbers above them and macleod pointed to one thats the grassmarket and if jenny here meaning the woman seated at the desk uses the little keypad in front of her we can swivel the camera and zoom in on anyone parking their car or coming out of a shop or pub jenny showed how it was done and clarke nodded slowly the pictures very clear she commented and in colour i was expecting black and white dont suppose youve any cameras on kings stables road macleod gave a dry chuckle i knew thats what youd be after he reached for a logbook and flicked back a couple of pages martin was manning the decks that night he tracked the police cars and ambulance macleod ran a finger along the relevant entry even had a look back at what footage there was but didnt spot anything conclusive doesnt mean theres nothing there absolutely siobhan here rebus said was telling me theres more cctv in the uk than any other country twenty per cent of all the closedcircuit cameras in the world one for each and every dozen of us so quite a lot then rebus muttered tou save all the footage clarke asked we do what we can it goes on to hard disk and video but there are guidelines we have to follow what graeme means rebus explained for clarkes benefit is that he cant just go handing material to us data protection act macleod was nodding ninetyeight actually john we can give you what weve got but there are hoops to be gone through first which is why ive learned to trust graemes judgement rebus turned to macleod and im guessing youve been through the recordings with whatever the digital equivalent is of a finetoothed comb macleod smiled and nodded jenny gave me a hand we had the photos of the victim from the various news agencies i think weve picked him up on shandwick place he was on foot and unaccompanied thats at just gone ten next time we see him is half an hour later on lothian road but as youve guessed weve no cameras on kings stables road itself did you get the sense anyone was following him rebus asked macleod shook his head and neither did jenny clarke was studying the screens again a few more years of this and ill be out of a job macleod laughed i doubt that surveillance is a tricky balancing act invasion of privacy is always an issue and the civil rights people oppose us every step of the way now theres a surprise rebus muttered dont tell me youd want one of our cameras peering in through your own window macleod teased clarke had been thinking charles riordan picked up the tab at the curry house at nine fortyeight todorov left there and headed into town along shandwick place how come it took him half an hour to travel quarter of a mile to lothian road he stopped for a drink rebus guessed riordan mentioned mathers or the caledonian hotel wherever he went todorov was back on the street at ten forty meaning hed have been outside the car park five minutes later she waited for rebus to nod his agreement shutters go down on the car park at eleven he added the attack mustve been quick then to macleod what about afterwards graeme macleod was ready for this the passerby who found the body called it in at twelve minutes past eleven we took a look at the footage from the grassmarket and lothian road ten minutes either side of that time he gave a shrug just the usual pubgoers office parties latenight shoppers no crazed muggers legging it with a hammer swinging from their hand be handy if we could take a look at that rebus stated we might know faces you dont fair enough but youd want us to jump through the hoops macleod had folded his arms the gesture providing an answer in itself they were heading back through the reception area rebus breaking open a fresh packet of cigarettes when an attendant in some sort of official garb stopped them it took a moment for rebus to register that the lord provost herself was there too her gold chain of office hanging around her neck she didnt look particularly happy i believe we have an appointment she was asking though nobody seems to know about it except you two bit of a cockup there rebus apologised so not just a ploy to grab yourselves a precious parking bay perish the thought she glared at him just as well youre going we need that space for more important visitors rebus could feel his grip tightening on the cigarettes what could be more urgent than a murder inquiry he asked she caught his meaning the russian poet we need that one cleared fast to appease the moneymen of the volga rebus guessed then after a moments thought how much does the council have to do with them megan macfarlane tells us her urban regeneration committee is involved the lord provost was nodding but theres council input too so youre gladhanding the fat cats good to see my council tax being put to such good use the lord provost had taken a step forwards glare intensifying she was readying a fresh salvo when her attendant cleared his throat through the window a long black car could be seen trying to manoeuvre itself through the arch in front of the building the lord provost said nothing just turned from rebus and was gone he gave her five seconds then made his own exit clarke at his shoulder nice to make friends she said im a week from retirement shiv what the hell do i care they walked a few yards down the pavement then stopped while rebus got his cigarette lit did you see the paper this morning clarke asked andy kerr won politician of the year last night and whos he when hes at home man who brought in the smoking ban rebus just snorted pedestrians were watching the officiallooking car draw to a halt in front of the waiting lord provost her liveried attendant stepped forward to open the back door tinted windows had shielded the passenger from view but as he stepped out rebus immediately guessed he was one of the russians big coat black gloves and a chiselled unsmiling face maybe forty years old hair short and well groomed with some greying at the temples steely grey eyes which took in everything rebus and clarke included even as he was shaking the lord provosts hand and answering some remark shed made rebus sucked smoke deep into his lungs and watched as the party disappeared back inside looks like the russian consulates going into the taxi business rebus stated studying the black mercedes same car stahov had clarke guessed could be what about the driver hard to tell another official had appeared and was gesturing for them to move their car so the chauffeur could park rebus held up a single digit meaning one minute then he noticed that clarke was still wearing her visitors badge better hand them back he said tou take this he held out the halfsmoked cigarette towards her but she was reluctant so instead he balanced it on a windowsill nearby watch it doesnt blow away he warned taking her badge and unclipping his own im sure they dont need them she commented rebus just smiled and headed for reception thought we better give you these he told the woman behind the desk tou can always recycle them eh weve all got to do our bit he was still smiling so the receptionist smiled back by the way he added leaning over the desk that bloke with the lord provost was it who i think it was some sort of business tycoon the woman said yes because the visitors log was sitting there in front of them and the last name to be entered entered with what looked like thick blue ink from a fountain pen was the same one she uttered now sergei andropov where to clarke asked the pub do you have one in mind mathers of course but as clarke drove them down johnston terrace rebus told her to take a detour a series of left turns bringing them into kings stables road from the grassmarket end they drew to a halt outside the multistorey and saw that hawes and tibbet were busy clarke sounded the horn as she turned off the ignition tibbet turned and waved hed been sticking flyers on windscreens police incident information required hawes was setting up a sandwich board on the pavement next to the exit barriers a larger version of the flyer exact same wording there was a grainy photograph of todorov around pm on wednesday november a man was attacked within the confines of this car park dying from his injuries did you see anything was anyone you know parked here on that evening please call the incident room the number given was a police switchboard just as well rebus pointed out seeing as theres no one currently home at cid macrae was saying much the same thing hawes agreed studying her handiwork wanted to know how many more officers wed be needing i like my teams small and perfectly formed rebus replied obviously not a hearts fan tibbet added in an undertone tou a hibs fan then colin same as siobhan here livingston tibbet corrected him hearts have got a russian owner havent they it was clarke who answered hes lithuanian actually hawes interrupted to ask where rebus and clarke were headed the pub clarke announced lucky you business rather than pleasure so what do colin and me do after this hawess eyes were on rebus back to base he told her to await the torrent of phone calls and clarke suddenly remembered i need someone to call the bbc for me see if theyll send us a copy of todorov on question time i want to see just how much of a stirrer he really was they ran a bit of it on the news last night colin tibbet announced there was a package about the case and that was all the footage of him they seemed to have thanks for sharing clarke told him maybe you could get on to the beeb for me he gave a shrug indicating willingness clarkes attention was drawn to the stack of flyers he still held though they were printed on various colours of paper most seemed to be a particularly lurid pink we wanted them in a hurry tibbet explained this was what was on offer lets go rebus told clarke making for the car but hawes had other ideas we should be doing the followup interviews with the witnesses she called the and colin could do it rebus pretended to think for all of five seconds before turning down the offer back in the car he stared at the no entry sign which was denying them direct access to lothian road think i should chance it clarke asked up to you shiv she gnawed at her bottom lip then executed a threepoint turn ten minutes later they were on lothian road passing the other end of kings stables road shouldve chanced it rebus commented two further minutes and they were parking on the yellow lines outside mathers having disregarded a road sign warning them they could only turn into queensferry street if they were a bus or a taxi the white van in front had done the selfsame thing and the estate car behind them was following suit a regular little lawbreaking convoy was rebuss comment i despair of this town clarke said teeth bared who thinks up the traffic management you need a drink rebus informed her he didnt get into mathers much but he liked the place it was oldfashioned with few chairs most of them occupied by seriouslooking men early afternoon and sky sports was on the television clarke had brought a few of the flyers with her yellow in preference to pink and went around the tables with them while rebus held one up in front of the barmans face two nights ago he said around ten oclock maybe a little after wasnt my shift the barman answered then whose was it terrys and wheres terry in his kip most likely is he on again tonight when the barman nodded rebus pressed the flyer on him i want a phone call from him whether he served this guy or not no phone call its you ill blame the barman just gave a twitch of the mouth clarke was standing next to rebus guy over in the corner seems to know you she said rebus looked and nodded then walked over to the table clarke following all right big rebus said by way of greeting the man drinking alone half of heavy and an inch of whisky seemed to be enjoying his berth one foot up on the chair next to him a hand scratching his chest he was wearing a faded denim shirt undone to below the breastbone rebus hadnt seen him in maybe seven or eight years he called himself podeen big podeen exnavy exbouncer looking his age now his huge weatherbeaten face caving in on itself most of the teeth having disappeared from the fleshylipped mouth not bad mr rebus there were no handshakes just slight tilts of the head and occasional eye contact this your local then rebus asked depends how you mean thought you were living down the coast that was years back people change move on there was a pouch of tobacco on the table next to a lighter and cigarette papers podeen picked it up and began to play with it got something for us podeen puffed out his cheeks and exhaled i was here two nights back and your man there wasnt he nodded towards the flyer know who he is though used to see him in here round about closing time bit of a nighthawk if you ask me like yourself big and your good self too i seem to remember pipe and slippers these days big rebus told him cocoa and in bed by ten cant see it somehow guess who i bumped into the other day our old friend cafferty how come you never managed to put him away we got him a couple of times big podeen wrinkled his nose a few years here and there he always seemed to get back off the canvas though didnt he podeens eyes met rebus again word is youre for the gold watch not a bad heavyweight career mr rebus but thats what theyll always say about you what that you lacked the knockout punch podeen lifted his whisky glass anyway heres to the twilight years maybe well start seeing you in here more often then again most of the pubs in this city youd have to keep your back to the wall plenty of grudges mr rebus and once youre not the law any more podeen gave a theatrical shrug thanks for cheering me up big rebus glanced towards the flyer did you ever talk to him podeen made a face and shook his head anyone else in here we should be asking he used to stand at the bar as near the door as possible it was the drink he liked not the company he paused for a moment youve not asked me about cafferty okay what about him he said to say hello rebus stared him out is that it thats it and where did this earthshattering exchange take place funnily enough just across the road i bumped into him as he was coming out of the caledonian hotel which was their next destination the vast pinkhued edifice had two doors one led into the hotels reception area and boasted a doorman the other took you directly into the bar which was open to residents and waifs alike rebus decided he was thirsty and ordered a pint clarke said shed stick to tomato juice been cheaper across the road she commented which is why youre paying but when the bill came he slapped a fivepound note on it hoping for change tfour chum in mathers was right wasnt he clarke ventured when i go out for the night i always keep watch on whos coming and going just in case i see a face i know rebus nodded number of villains weve put away stands to reason some of them are back on the street just make sure you frequent a better class of wateringhole like this place for instance clarke looked around her what do you think todorov would see in it rebus thought for a moment not sure he conceded maybe just a different sort of vibe vibe clarke echoed with a smile mustve picked that up from you i dont think so tibbet then anyway whats wrong with it its a perfectly decent word it just doesnt sound right coming from you should have heard me in the sixties i wasnt born in the sixties dont keep reminding me hed downed half his drink and signalled for the barman flyer at the ready the barman was short and stickthin with a shaved head he wore a tartan waistcoat and tie and only looked at todorovs photo for a few seconds before starting to nod bald pate gleaming hes been in a few times recently was he in two nights ago clarke asked i think so the barman was concentrating brow furrowed rebus knew that sometimes the reason people concentrated was to think up a convincing lie the badge on the barmans waistcoat identified him only as freddie just after ten rebus prompted hed already had a few drinks freddie was nodding again wanted a large cognac he just stayed for one i think so did you speak to him freddie shook his head but i know who he is now i saw about it on the news what a hellish thing to happen hellish rebus agreed did he sit at the bar clarke asked or was he at a table the bar always the bar i knew he was foreign but he didnt act like a poet and how do poets act in your experience what i mean is he just sat there with a scowl on his face mind you i did see him writing stuff down the last time he was in no before that had a wee notebook he kept taking from his pocket one of the waitresses thought maybe he was an undercover inspector or doing a review for a magazine i told her i didnt think so the last time he was here you didnt see the notebook he was talking to somebody who rebus asked freddie just shrugged another drinker they sat pretty much where you two are rebus and clarke shared a look what were they talking about pays not to eavesdrop its a rare bartender who doesnt like to listen in on other peoples conversations they might not have been talking in english what then russian rebuss eyes narrowed could be freddie seemed to concede got any cameras in here rebus was looking around him freddie shook his head was this other drinker male or female clarke asked freddie paused before answering male description another pause bit older than him stockier we dim the lights at night and it was a busy session he shrugged an apology youre being a great help clarke assured him did they talk for long freddie just shrugged again they didnt leave together the poet left on his own freddie sounded confident about this at least dont suppose cognac comes cheap in here rebus commented taking in his surroundings skys the limit the barman admitted but when youve a tab running you tend not to notice not until your bills handed to you at checkout rebus agreed thing is though freddie our russian friend wasnt a resident here he paused for effect so whose tab are we talking about the barman seemed to realise his mistake look he said i dont want to get into trouble tou certainly dont want to get into trouble with me rebus confirmed the other man was a guest freddie looked from one detective to the other i suppose so he said seeming to deflate rebus and clarke locked eyes if you were here from moscow on a business trip she said quietly maybe some kind of delegation which hotel would you stay at there was only one way to answer that but through in reception the staff said they couldnt help instead they called for the duty manager and rebus repeated his question any russian businessmen bunking here the duty manager was studying rebuss warrant card when he handed it back he asked if there was a problem only if your hotel continues to obstruct me in a murder inquiry rebus drawled murder the duty manager had introduced himself as richard browning he wore a crisp charcoal suit with a checked shirt and lavender tie colour flooded his cheeks as he repeated rebuss word a man left the bar here a couple of nights back got as far as kings stables road and was beaten to death means the last people who saw him were the ones knocking back cocktails in your hotel rebus had taken a step closer to richard browning now i can get my hands on your registration list and make sure i interview every single guest maybe set up a big table next to the concierge desk so that its nice and public rebus paused i can do that but itll take time and itll be messy or another pause tfou can tell me what russians you have staying here tou could also clarke added go through the bar receipts and find the names of anyone who paid for a large cognac some time after ten on the night before last our guests have the right to their privacy browning argued we only want names rebus told him not a list of whatever porn theyve been watching on the film channel browning stiffened his spine okay rebus apologised this isnt that sort of hotel but you do have some russians staying here browning admitted as much with a nod tou know theres a delegation in town rebus assured him he did to be honest we only have three or four of them the rest are spread around the city the balmoral george sheraton prestonfield dont they get along clarke asked just not enough presidential suites to go round browning sniffed how much longer are they here a few days theres a trip to gleneagles planned but theyre keeping their rooms saves checking out and checking in again nice to have the option rebus commented how soon can we have the names im going to have to talk to the general manager first how soon rebus repeated i really cant say browning spluttered clarke handed him a card with her mobile number sooner the better she nudged him else itll be a table by the concierge rebus added they left browning nodding to himself and staring at the floor the doorman saw them coming and held open the door rebus handed him one of the lurid flyers by way of a tip as they crossed to clarkes car which shed parked in an empty cab rank rebus saw a limo drawing to a halt the black merc from the city chambers and the same figure emerging from the back sergei andropov again he seemed to sense eyes on him and returned rebuss stare for a moment before entering the hotel the car cruised around the corner and entered the hotels car park same driver stahov had clarke asked still didnt get a good enough look rebus told her but that reminds me of something meant to ask when we were inside namely what the hell is a respectable hotel like the caledonian doing letting big ger cafferty over its threshold they waited until pm to do the witness interviews reckoning thered be a better chance of finding people at home roger and elizabeth anderson lived in a detached s house on the southern edge of the city with views to the pentland hills the path leading through the garden to the front door was lit allowing them to take in the impressive rockeries and an expanse of lawn which could well have been trimmed with nail scissors a little hobby for mrs anderson clarke guessed who knows maybe shes the highflyer and he stays at home but when roger anderson opened the door he was dressed in his work suit the tie loosened and top shirtbutton undone he held the evening paper in one hand and had pushed his reading glasses to the top of his head oh its you he said wondered when youd get round to us he headed back indoors expecting them to follow its the police he called to his wife rebus gave her a smile when she arrived from the kitchen see youve not put the wreath up yet he said gesturing towards the front door she had me throw it in the bin roger anderson said using the remote to turn off the tv were about to sit down to dinner his wife pointed out this wont take long clarke assured her shed brought a folder with her pcs todd goodyear and bill dyson had typed up their initial notes goodyears were immaculate dysons riddled with spelling mistakes it wasnt you who actually found the body was it clarke asked elizabeth anderson had taken a few more steps into the room standing just behind her husbands chair the chair roger anderson was sinking back into without bothering to ask if either detective would like to sit rebus however was happier standing it meant he could cruise the room taking it all in mr anderson had laid his newspaper down on the coffee table next to a crystal tumbler of what smelled like three parts gin to one of tonic we heard the girl screaming the man was saying went over to see what was happening thought shed been attacked or something you were parked clarke pretended to be scouring the notes in the grassmarket mr anderson stated why there sir rebus broke in why not there just seems a fair walk from the church you were at a carol service yes thats right bit early in the year for it the christmas lights go on next week it finished pretty late didnt it we had a spot of supper afterwards anderson sounded indignant that any questions at all needed to be asked of him you didnt think to use the multistorey closes at eleven wasnt sure wed be back at the car by then rebus nodded you know the place then know its opening hours ive used it in the past thing is the grassmarket doesnt cost anything after six thirty got to be careful with the pennies sir rebus agreed looking around the large wellfurnished room it says in the notes you work in im on the staff at first albannach rebus nodded again pretending not to be surprised dyson hadnt actually bothered to make a note of anderson s profession youre bloody lucky to find me home so early anderson went on been hellish busy recently do you happen to know someone called stuart janney met him many times look whats any of this got to do with the poor sod who died probably nothing at all sir rebus admitted we just like to build up as full a picture as possible another reason we park in the grassmarket elizabeth anderson said voice not much above a whisper is that its well lit and there are always people about were very careful that way didnt stop you taking a scary route to get there clarke pointed out that time of night kings stables road s pretty well deserted rebus was peering at a selection of framed photographs in a cabinet tou on your wedding day he mused twentyseven years ago mrs anderson confirmed and is this your daughter he knew the answer already half a dozen photos timelined the girls life deborah shell be home from college next week rebus nodded slowly seemed to him that the most recent pictures were half hidden behind framed memories of a gaptoothed infant and schoolgirl i see shes been going through a goth stage meaning the hair suddenly turning jet black the heavily kohled eyes again inspector roger anderson interceded i dont see what possible bearing any of this rebus waved the objection aside clarke looked up from the notes shed been pretending to read i know its a stupid question she said with a smile but youve had time to think back over everything so is there anything you can add you didnt see anyone else or hear anything nothing mr anderson stated nothing his wife echoed then after a moment hes quite a famous poet isnt he weve had reporters on the phone best not to say anything to them rebus advised id love to know how the hell they got to hear about us in the first place her husband growled is this the end of it do you think im not sure i understand will you lot keep coming back even though weve nothing to tell you actually you need to come to gayfield square to make a formal statement clarke told them she pulled another of her business cards out of the folder tou can call this number first and ask for dc hawes or dc tibbet whats the bloody point roger anderson asked its a murder inquiry sir rebus responded crisply a man was beaten to a pulp and the killers still out there our job is to find him sorry if that inconveniences you in any way tou dont sound too sorry i must say anderson grumbled actually mr anderson my heart bleeds apologies if that doesnt always come across rebus turned as if readying to leave but then paused what sort of car is it by the way the one you need to keep parked where theres plenty of light a bentley the continental gt from which i take it you dont work in the mailroom at fab doesnt mean i didnt start there inspector now if youll excuse us i think i can hear our dinner shrivelling on the hob mrs anderson put a hand to her mouth in horror and darted back into the kitchen if its burnt rebus said you can always console yourself with a couple more gins anderson decided not to grace this with an answer and rose to his feet instead the better to usher the two detectives off the property did you have a good supper clarke asked casually slipping the notes back into her folder after the carols i mean pretty good yes im always on the lookout for a new restaurant im sure you can afford it anderson said with a smile which suggested the opposite its called the pompadour ill make sure hes paying clarke nodded towards rebus tou do that anderson told her with a laugh he was still chuckling when he closed the door on them no wonder his wife likes the garden rebus muttered chance for some time away from that pompous prick he started down the path reaching into his pocket for a cigarette if i tell you something interesting clarke teased will you buy me dinner at the pompadour rebus busied himself with his lighter nodding a reply there was a copy of its menu sitting on the concierges desk rebus exhaled a plume of smoke into the night sky whys that then because clarke told him the pompadour is the restaurant at the caledonian hotel he stared at her for a moment then turned back to the door and gave it a couple of thumps with his fist roger anderson looked less than delighted but rebus wasnt about to give him the chance to complain before he was attacked he stated alexander todorov was drinking in the bar at the caledonian so so you were in the restaurant you didnt happen to see him elizabeth and i didnt go near the bar its a big hotel inspector anderson was closing the door again rebus thought about wedging a foot in to stop him probably been years since hed done anything like that but he couldnt think of any other questions so he just kept his gaze on roger anderson until the solid wooden door was between them even then he focused on it for a few seconds more willing the man to open up again but anderson was gone rebus headed back down the path what do you think clarke asked lets go talk to the other witness after that ill give you my best guess nancy sievewrights flat was on the third storey of a blair street tenement there was an illuminated sign across the street advertising a basement sauna further up the steep incline smokers were huddled outside a bar and there were a few yips and yells from hunter square where the citys homeless often held court until moved on by the police there wasnt much light in the tenements doorway so rebus held his cigarette lighter under the intercom while clarke made out the various names rented flats and a shifting population meaning some of the buzzers boasted half a dozen names alongside with scrawled amendments on peeling bits of gummed paper sievewrights name was just about legible and when clarke pressed the button the door clicked open without anyone bothering to check who wanted in the stairwell was well enough lit with some bags of rubbish at the bottom and a stack of several years worth of unwanted telephone directories someones got a cat rebus said sniffing the air or an incontinence problem clarke agreed they climbed the stone steps rebus pausing at each level as though studying the various names on the doors but really just catching his breath by the time he reached the third floor clarke had already rung the bell the door was opened by a young man with tousled hair and a weeks growth of dark beard he wore eyeliner and a red bandanna youre not kelly he said sorry to disappoint you clarke was holding up her warrant card were here to see nancy shes not in he sounded instantly defensive did she tell you about finding the body what the young mans mouth fell open and stayed that way you a friend of hers flatmate she didnt tell you clarke waited for a response that didnt come well anyway this is just a backup call shes not done anything wrong so if youll kindly let us in rebus interrupted well try to ignore the smell of bob hope wafting into our faces he gave what he hoped was an encouraging smile sure the young man held the door open a little wider nancy sievewrights head appeared around her bedroom door hello nancy clarke said stepping into the hall there were boxes everywhere stuff for recycling stuff to be thrown out stuff that hadnt made it into the flats limited cupboard space just need to check a few things with you nancy was in the hallway closing her bedroom door after her she wore a short tight skirt with black leggings and a crop top which showed off her midriff and a studded belly button im just on my way out she said td put another layer on rebus suggested its perishing wont take a moment clarke was reassuring the teenager wheres the best place to talk kitchen nancy stated yes because the sweet smell of dope was coming from behind another closed door probably the living room there was music too something rambling and electronic rebus couldnt place it but it reminded him a bit of tangerine dream the kitchen was narrow and cluttered seemed the flatmates existed on takeaways the window had been left open a couple of inches which did little to lessen the smell from the sink someones missed their turn to do the washingup rebus commented nancy ignored him she had folded her arms and was waiting for a question clarke went back into her folder again bringing out todd goodyears impeccable report and another business card wed like you to come down to gayfield square some time soon clarke began and give a proper signed statement ask for either of these officers she handed over the card meantime we just want to check a couple of things you were on your way back here when you found the victim thats right youd been to a friends in clarke pretended to look at the report she was expecting nancy to finish the sentence but the teenager seemed to be having trouble remembering great stuart street clarke reminded her nancy nodded in agreement whats your friends name nancy what do you need that for its just the way we are we like as much detail as we can get her names gill clarke wrote the name down surname she asked morgan and what number does she live at sixteen great clarke wrote this down too thanks for that the livingroom door opened and a female face peered out disappearing again after meeting rebuss glare whos your landlord rebus decided to ask nancy she gave a shrug i give the rent to eddie is eddie the one who answered the door she nodded and rebus took a couple of steps back into the hall on top of one of the cardboard boxes sat a pile of mail as clarke asked another question he sifted through it stopping at one envelope in particular in place of a stamp there was a business frank and alongside it the name of the company mgc lettings rebus dropped the letter and listened to nancy s answer i dont know if the car park was locked up what difference does it make not much clarke seemed to concede we think the victim was attacked there rebus added he either staggered along to the lane where you found him or else he was carried there i didnt see anything the teenager wailed tears were welling in her eyes and she had wrapped her arms more tightly around her the livingroom door opened again and eddie emerged into the hall stop hassling her he said were not hassling her eddie rebus told him the young man blanched when he realised rebus now had his name he held his ground a further moment or two for prides sake then retreated why didnt you tell him what had happened rebus asked nancy she was shaking her head slowly having blinked back the tears just want to forget all about it cant blame you for that clarke sympathised but if you do remember anything she was pointing towards the business card ill call you nancy agreed and youll come to the station too clarke reminded her any time monday nancy sievewright nodded looking utterly dejected clarke threw a glance towards rebus wondering if he had any other questions he decided to oblige nancy he asked quietly have you ever been to the caledonian hotel the teenager gave a snort oh yeah im in there all the time seriously though what do you think ill take that as a no rebus gave a little jerk of his head signalling to clarke that it was time to go but before they did he shoved open the livingroom door the place was a haze of smoke there was no ceiling light just a couple of lamps fitted with purple bulbs and a row of thick white candles on the mantelpiece the coffee table was covered with cigarette papers torn bits of card and shreds of tobacco apart from eddie there were three figures sprawled on the sofas and the floor rebus just nodded at them then retreated do you do anything yourself he asked nancy a bit of blaw maybe she was opening the front door sometimes she admitted thanks for not lying rebus said there was a girl on the doorstep kelly presumably she was probably the same age as nancy but the makeup would get her into most overs nightspots bye then nancy told the two detectives as the door closed they could hear kelly asking nancy who they were along with nancy s muffled reply that they worked for the landlord rebus gave a snort and guess who that landlord would be he watched clarke give a shrug morris gerald cafferty as in mgc lettings i knew he had a few flats clarke commented hard to turn a corner in this city and not find caffertys pawprints nearby rebus was thoughtful for a moment she was lying clarke stated about the friend she was visiting rebus nodded his agreement why would she lie probably a hundred good reasons her stoner buddies for example clarke was starting back down the stairs is it worth trying to talk to someone called gill morgan at great stuart street up to you rebus said he was looking over his shoulder towards the door of nancy sievewrights flat shes an anomaly though how so every other bugger in this case seems to use the caledonian like a home from home clarke was smiling a little smile as the door opened behind them it stayed open as nancy sievewright padded down the stairs towards them theres something you can do for me she said voice lowered whats that nancy keep that creep away from me the two detectives shared a look which creep is that clarke asked the one with the wife the one who phoned roger anderson rebuss eyes had narrowed nancy gave a nervous nod he was round here yesterday i wasnt in but he must have waited he was parked outside when i got back what did he want said he was worried about me wanted to make sure i was all right she was heading back up the steps again im done with that done with what rebus called but she didnt answer just closed the door softly after her bloody hell clarke whispered what was all that about something to ask mr anderson funny i was just thinking to myself that nancy looks a bit like his daughter how did he get her address rebus just shrugged itll keep he stated after a moments thought ive another little mission for you tonight another little mission meaning she was on her own when she met with macrae in his office hed been out to some function or other and was dressed in a dinner jacket and black bowtie there was a driver waiting outside to take him home as he sat behind his desk he removed the tie and undid his top button hed fetched himself a glass of water from the cooler and was waiting for clarke to say something she cleared her throat cursing rebus his reasoning macrae would listen to her that was the whole of it well sir she began its about alexander todorov youve got someone in the frame macrae had brightened but only until she shook her head its just that we think there may be more to it than a mugging gone wrong oh yes weve not got much in the way of evidence as yet but there are a lot of a lot of what she couldnt think of a convincing way of putting it there are a lot of leads we need to follow and mostly they point away from a random attack macrae leaned back in his chair this sounds like rebus he stated hes got you in here arguing his corner doesnt mean i dont agree with him sir sooner youre free of him the better clarke prickled visibly and macrae gave a little wave of apology you know what i mean siobhan how long till he goes a week and what happens then will the case be closed by the time he packs his bags doubtful clarke conceded meaning youii be left with it siobhan i dont mind that sir macrae stared at her reckon its worth a few more days this hunch of his its more than a hunch clarke stressed todorov connects to a number of people and its a matter of ruling them out rather than ruling anything in and what if theres less to this than meets the eye weve been here before with john after all hes solved a lot of cases in his time clarke stated you make a good character witness siobhan macrae was smiling tiredly i know john outranks you he said eventually but i want you in charge of the todorov murder makes things easier as he himself would admit clarke nodded slowly but said nothing two or three days see what you can come up with youve got hawes and tibbet who else are you going to bring aboard ill let you know macrae grew thoughtful again someone from the russian embassy spoke to scotland yard and they spoke to our dear chief constable he sighed if he knew i was letting john rebus anywhere near this hed have kittens they make nice pets sir clarke offered but macrae just glowered its why youre in charge siobhan not john is that clear yes sir im guessing hes skulking nearby waiting for you to report back to him tou know him too well sir macrae made a little gesture with his hand telling her she was dismissed she wandered back through the cid suite and down to the lobby where she saw a face she recognised todd goodyear had either finished a shift or was working undercover dressed as he was in black straightleg denims and a black padded bomber jacket clarke made show of trying to place him the todorov crime scene pc goodyear he nodded and glanced towards the folder she was still carrying you got my notes as you can see she was playing for time wondering why he was there were they all right they were fine he looked keen for a bit more than that but she just repeated the word fine then asked what he was doing waiting for you he owned up id heard tell you worked late actually i just got here twenty minutes ago he was nodding i was outside in the car he glanced over her shoulder di rebus isnt with you look todd what the hell is it you want goodyear licked his lips i thought pc dyson told you im after a stint with cid good for you and i wondered if you maybe needed someone he let the sentence drift off with todorov you mean itd be a chance for me to learn that was my first murder scene id love to know what happens next what happens next is a lot of slogging most of it with nothing to show at the end sounds great he offered her a grin i write a good report ds clarke i dont miss too many tricks i just feel i could be doing more persistent little sod arent you let me try to convince you over a drink im meeting someone tomorrow then i could buy you a coffee tomorrows saturday and dci macrae hasnt put together a budget meaning no overtime goodyear nodded his understanding clarke thought for a moment why me rather than rebus hes the ranking officer maybe i thought youd be a better listener meaning more gullible meaning just what i said clarke took another moment to make up her mind actually its me in charge of this case so lets meet for that coffee first thing monday morning theres a place on broughton street i sometimes use she named it and a time thanks ds clarke goodyear said tou wont regret it he held out his hand and they shook on it day four monday november siobhan clarke was ten minutes early but goodyear was already there he was in his uniform but with the same bomber jacket as friday night covering it and zipped to the neck embarrassed to be seen in it clarke asked well you know what its like she did indeed long time since shed worn a constabulary uniform but the job was still something you didnt always readily own up to parties shed been to people always seemed a bit less comfortable once they knew what she did for a living it was the same on a night out guys either losing interest or else making too many jokes going to cuff me to your bedposts wait till you see my truncheon dont worry about the neighbours ill come quietly officer goodyear was back on his feet asking what shed like theyre on the case she assured him her regular cappuccino was being prepared so all goodyear had to do was pay for it and fetch it over they were seated on stools at a table by the window it was a basement so all they could see was a passing parade of legs at street level gusts of rain were blowing in from the north sea everyone was hurrying to be somewhere else clarke turned down his offer of sugar and told him to relax youre not at a job interview she said i thought i was he replied with a nervy little laugh showing a line of slightly crooked teeth his ears stuck out a little bit too and his eyelashes were very fair he was drinking a mug of filter coffee and the crumbs on his plate were evidence of an earlier croissant good weekend he asked great weekend she corrected him hibs won sixone and hearts lost to rangers youre a hibs fan he nodded slowly to himself filing the information away were you at the game she shook her head it was at motherwell i had to content myself with a film casino royalet she shook her head the departed they lapsed into silence until a thought struck clarke how long were you waiting before i got here not too long woke up early and thought i might as well he took a deep breath to be honest i wasnt sure id find this place so i left plenty of time i always err on the side of caution duly noted pc goodyear so tell me a bit about yourself like what anything well im guessing you know who my grandad was he looked up at her and she nodded most people seem to whether they say as much to my face tou were young when he died clarke said i was four but i hadnt seen him for the best part of a year mum and dad wouldnt take me with them to the prison you mean it was goodyears turn to nod mum fell apart a bit she was always highly strung and her parents thought her a class above my dad so when his dad ended up in jail that seemed all the proof they needed added to which my dad always liked drowning his own sorrows he offered a rueful smile maybe some people would be better off never marrying but then thered be no todd goodyear god must have had his reasons does any of it explain why you joined the police maybe but thanks for not making a straight assumption so many people have tried spelling it out to me like that youre atoning todd or youre showing not all goodyears are cut from the same cloth lazy thinking clarke guessed how about you ds clarke what made you become a cop she considered a moment before deciding to tell him the truth i think i was reacting against my parents they were typical liberal lefties growing up in the sixties the only way to rebel was to become the establishment goodyear smiled and nodded his understanding not a bad way of putting it clarke agreed lifting her cup to her lips what does your brother think of it all tou know hes been in trouble a few times i know his names on our books clarke admitted touve been checking up on me but clarke wasnt about to answer that i never see him goodyear paused actually thats not strictly true hes been in hospital and i went to visit him nothing serious he got himself into some stupid argument in a pub thats just the way sol is is he older than you or younger two years older not that youd ever have known it when we were kids neighbours used to say how much more mature than him i seemed they just meant i was better behaved plus i used to do the shopping and stuff he seemed lost in the past for a moment then shook his head clear di rebus he said has a bit of history with big ger cafferty doesnt he clarke was surprised by the change of subject depends what you mean she said warily its just gossip among the uniforms the pair of them are supposed to be close they detest one another clarke heard herself say really she nodded i sometimes wonder how itll pan out she was almost talking to herself because it had crossed her mind often these past few weeks any particular reason why youre asking when sol started dealing i think he was talked into it by cafferty you think or you know hes never admitted it then what makes you so sure are cops still allowed to have hunches clarke smiled thinking of rebus again its frowned upon but that doesnt stop it happening he studied what little was left in his mug im glad youve put my mind at rest about di rebus you didnt sound surprised when i mentioned cafferty like you said i did some checking he gave a smile and a nod then asked if she wanted a refill ones enough for now clarke drained her cup taking only a few seconds to make up her mind youre based at torphichen right right and can they spare you for a morning goodyears face brightened like a kid at christmas ill give them a call clarke went on and tell them ive snaffled you for a few hours she wagged a finger in his face just a few hours mind lets see how we get on you wont regret it todd goodyear said thats what you said on friday better make sure i dont my case clarke was thinking and my team and here was her first little bit of recruiting maybe it was his naked enthusiasm reminding her of the cop shed been too once upon a time or the notion of rescuing him from his timeserving partner then again with rebus on the cusp of retirement a buffer between herself and her remaining colleagues might prove handy being selfish or being kind she asked herself was it possible for an action to be both roger anderson had reversed halfway down his drive when he spotted the car blocking the gates the gates themselves were electric and had swung open at the push of a button but there was a saab on the roadway stopping him getting out of all the inconsiderate bloody he was wondering which neighbour was responsible the archibalds two doors down always seemed to have workmen in or visitors staying the graysons across the road had a couple of sons home for the winter from their gap years then there were the cold callers and the people dropping leaflets and cards through the door he sounded the bentleys horn which brought his wife to the diningroom window was there someone in the saabs passenger seat no they were in the bloody driving seat anderson thumped on the horn a couple more times then undid his seatbelt and got out stomping towards the offending vehicle the window on the drivers side was sliding down a face peering out at him oh its you one of the detectives from last night inspector something di rebus rebus reminded the banker and how are you this morning mr anderson look inspector i do intend coming to your station sometime today whenever suits you sir but thats not the reason im here oh after we left you on friday we paid a call to the other witness miss sievewright oh yes she told us youd been to see her thats right anderson glanced over his shoulder as if checking his wife was out of earshot any particular reason sir just wanted to make sure she hadnt suffered any well shed had a nasty shock hadnt she seems you gave her another one sir anderson s cheeks had flushed i only went round there to so youve said rebus interrupted but what im wondering is how did you know her name and address shes not in the phone book the officer told me ds clarke rebus was frowning but anderson shook his head when our statements were being taken or rather just after id offered to run her home you see he happened to mention her name and blair street both and you wandered up and down blair street looking for a buzzer with her name on i dont see that ive done anything wrong in which case im sure youll have told mrs anderson all about it now look here but rebus was starting his ignition well see you at the station later and your good lady wife too of course he pulled away with the window still open and left it that way for the first few minutes this time of the morning he knew the traffic would be sluggish heading back into town hed only had the three pints last night but his head felt gummy saturday hed watched a bit of tv rueing another obituary the footballer ferenc puskas rebus had been in his teens when the european cup final had come to hampden real madrid against eintracht frankfurt real winning one of the great games and puskas one of the greatest players the young rebus had found hungary the footballers home country in an atlas and had wanted to go there jack palance and now puskas both gone for ever that was what happened with heroes so saturday night at the oxford bar sorrows drowned any and all conversations forgotten by the next morning sunday laundry and the supermarket and news that a russian journalist called litvinenko had been poisoned in london that had made rebus sit up in his chair increasing the volume on the tv gates and curt had joked about poisoned umbrella tips but here was the reallife equivalent one theory was that a meal in a sushi restaurant had contained the poison the russian mafia to blame litvinenko was in hospital under armed guard rebus had decided against calling siobhan it was just a coincidence after all hed been agitated waking each morning to dread his last weekend as a serving officer his last week now beginning siobhan had done all right on friday night and had even looked a little bit sheepish when explaining that macrae wanted her spearheading the case makes sense to me was all rebus had said getting in the drinks he thought he knew the way macrae would be thinking less to this than meets the eye that was the way siobhan said he had put it but it would keep rebus occupied until retirement day after which siobhan would be persuaded to return to route one a mugging gone wrong makes sense to me he repeated now heading down a rat run ten minutes later he was parking at gayfield square no sign of siobhans car he went upstairs and found hawes and tibbet seated together at the same desk staring at the mute telephone no joy rebus guessed eleven calls so far hawes said tapping the notepad in front of her one driver who exited the car park at nine fifteen on the night in question and therefore had nothing at all to tell us but wanted to chat anyway she glanced up at rebus he enjoys hillwalking and jogging if youre interested without bothering to look she could sense tibbet grinning beside her and gave him an elbow in the ribs he was on the phone to phyl for half an hour tibbet added after stifling a grunt who else have we got rebus asked anonymous cranks and practical jokers hawes replied and one guy were hoping will call back he started talking about a woman hanging around on the street but the line went dead before i could get any details probably just saw nancy sievewright rebus cautioned but he was thinking why would nancy be hanging around ive got a job for the pair of you he said reaching for hawess notepad and finding a clean sheet he jotted down the details of nancy s friend gill morgan go see if this checks out sievewright reckons she was on her way home from great stuart street even if theres someone by that name living at the address give them a bit of a grilling hawes stared at the page you think shes lying seemed to have trouble remembering but shell probably have primed this pal of hers i can usually tell when someones spinning me a line tibbet stated thats because youre a good cop colin rebus told him tibbet puffed out his chest a little which hawes noticed with a laugh touve just been spun a line she pointed out to her partner then rising to her feet lets go tibbet followed her sheepishly pausing in the doorway tfou okay manning the phones he asked rebus it rings and i pick it up does that about cover it tibbet was trying not to scowl as hawes returned to fetch him by the way she said to rebus if you get bored you can watch the telly we got hold of that video siobhan wanted rebus noticed it lying on the desk it was marked with the words question time tou might learn something was the parting shot from the doorway made by tibbet rather than hawes rebus was quietly impressed well make a man of you yet colin he muttered under his breath reaching out to pick up the tape charles riordan wasnt at the studio the receptionist told them he was spending the morning at home and when asked provided them with an address in joppa it was a fifteenminute drive away and took them past the flat grey waters of the firth of forth at one point goodyear tapped the side window cat and dog home back there he said i went once thinking id get a pet in the end i couldnt choose told myself id go back some day ive never had a pet clarke said find it hard enough taking care of myself he laughed at that any boyfriends one or two down the years he laughed again i meant just now she took her eyes off the road long enough to give him a look tfoure trying too hard todd just nervous that why youre asking so many questions no not at all im just well i suppose im interested in me in everybody he paused i think were put here for a purpose never find out what it is if you dont ask questions and your purpose is to pry into my love life he gave a little cough face reddening i didnt mean it like that back in the cafe you talked about gods purpose is this where you tell me youre religious well as a matter of fact i am is there anything wrong with that nothing at all di rebus used to be too and ive managed to cope with him all these years used to be in that he went to church she thought for a moment actually he went to dozens of them a different one every week looking for something he couldnt find goodyear guessed hed probably kill me for telling you clarke warned but youre not religious yourself ds clarke lord no she said with a smile hard to be in this line of work tou reckon all the stuff we deal with people gone bad hurting themselves and others she gave him another glance isnt god supposed to have made us in his or her image an argument that might take us the rest of the day instead of which ill ask if youve got a girlfriend he nodded her names sonia works as a soco and what did the two of you get up to at the weekend apart from church obviously she had a hen party saturday i didnt see much of her sonias not a churchgoer and hows your brother doing okay i think tou mean you dont know hes out of hospital i thought you said it was a punchup there was a knife his or the other guys the other guys hence sols stitches clarke was thoughtful for a moment tou said your mum and dad fell apart when your grandad went to jail goodyear leaned back into his seat mum started on medication dad walked out soon after and hit the bottle harder than ever there were days id bump into him outside the shops and he wouldnt even recognise me tough on a young kid sol and me mostly stayed with our aunt susan mums sister house wasnt really big enough but she never complained i started going with her to church on sundays sometimes she was so tired she nodded off in the pew used to have a bag of sweets with her and this one time they slid from her lap and started rolling across the floor he smiled at the memory anyway thats about all there is to it just as well were nearly there they were heading down portobello high street and a first for clarke without being held up by roadworks two more minutes and they were turning off joppa road and cruising a street of terraced victorian houses number eighteen goodyear said spotting it first plenty of kerbside parking clarke reckoned most people had taken their cars to work she pulled on the handbrake and turned off the ignition goodyear was already striding down the path all i need she muttered to herself undoing her seatbelt is a bloody holyroller not that she meant it as soon as the words were out of her mouth she knew where shed got them or at least their sentiment john rebus shed only just reached goodyear as the door opened charles riordan looking surprised to be facetoface with a police uniform he recognised clarke however and ushered the two officers inside the hallway was lined with bookshelves but no books instead all the available space was taken up with oldfashioned reels of tape and boxes of cassettes come in if you can get in was riordans comment he led them into what should have been the living room but had been fitted out as a studio complete with acoustic baffling stapled to the walls and a mixingdesk surrounded by more cartons of cassettes minidiscs and reeltoreels cables snaked underfoot microphones lay in the dust and the curtains covering the only window looked half an inch thick riordan mansions charles riordan announced can i take it youre not married clarke asked was once but she couldnt hack it the equipment you mean but riordan shook his head i like to make recordings he paused meaningfully of everything after a while it started to get to audrey he slipped his hands into his pockets so what can i do for you today officers clarke was looking around the room are we being taped mr riordan riordan gave a chuckle and by way of answer pointed to a slender black microphone and the other day at your studio he nodded i used dat though these days im more into digital i thought dat was digital goodyear asked but its tape im talking about straight to the hard drive would you mind turning it off clarke asked making it sound like the demand it really was riordan shrugged and hit a switch on the mixing desk more questions about alexander he asked one or two yes you got the cd clarke nodded thanks for that he was a great performer wasnt he he was clarke acknowledged but what i really wanted to ask you about was the night he died tes after the curry you said you parted company you were heading home and mr todorov was going to find a drink thats right and you added that it was a tossup whether he went to mathers or the caledonian hotel why those two in particular mr riordan riordan gave a shrug he was going to have to walk past both of them and a dozen more besides clarke countered maybe hed mentioned them to me you dont remember is it important it could be clarke glanced towards goodyear he was playing the game shoulders back legs slightly parted hands clasped in front of him and saying nothing he looked official clarke doubted riordan would pay any attention to the prominent ears or the crooked teeth or the eyelashes all hed be seeing was a uniform focusing his mind on the gravity of the situation riordan had been rubbing his chin thoughtfully well i suppose he must have mentioned them he said but not on the night you met clarke watched riordan shake his head so he didnt have a rendezvous planned how do you mean after you split up mr todorov headed straight for the bar at the caledonian he got talking to someone there just wondered if it was a regular thing alexander liked people people whod buy him drinks and listen to his stories and then tell him a few of their own never thought of the caledonian as a place for storytelling youre wrong hotel bars are perfect you meet strangers there and you spill your life out for the twenty or thirty minutes that youre with them its quite incredible what people will tell complete strangers maybe because they are strangers goodyear interrupted the constable has a good point riordan said but how do you know this mr riordan clarke asked can i assume youve done some covert taping in places like the caledonian plenty of times riordan admitted and on trains and buses people snoring or talking to themselves or plotting the overthrow of the government tramps on park benches and mps at the hustings iceskaters and picnickers and love rats on the phone to their mistresses he turned to goodyear my little hobby he explained and when did it turn to an obsession sir goodyear asked politely some time before your wife left you id imagine the smile fell from riordans face realising hed slipped up goodyear risked a glance towards clarke she was shaking her head slowly are there any other questions riordan asked coldly tou cant think of anyone alexander todorov could have been drinking with at the hotel clarke persisted no riordan was moving towards the door goodyear mouthed the word sorry at clarke as the pair of them followed their host into the hallway back in the car clarke told goodyear not to worry i think wed had about all we were going to get all the same i should have left the talking to you a lesson learned clarke said turning the ignition whats sonny jim doing here rebus asked he was leaning back in his chair feet up on the desk the remote for the video recorder in his hand having just frozen the tv picture hes on secondment from torphichen clarke stated rebus stared at her but she refused to make eye contact todd goodyear had his hand stretched out for shaking rebus turned his attention to it but ignored the offer goodyear let his arm fall back to his side and clarke gave a vexed sigh anything good on the box she eventually asked that video you wanted rebus seemed already to have dismissed the new arrival from his mind come and take a look he let the programme run again but turned the sound most of the way down a panel of politicians and pundits was being asked questions by a sawylooking audience large letters on the floor between the two groups spelt out the word edinburgh filmed at the hub rebus explained i went to a jazz concert there recognised it straight off you like jazz goodyear asked only to be ignored do you see who i see rebus was asking clarke megan macfarlane funny she didnt mention it rebus mused when the presenter was doing the introductions he said shes number two in the snp and likely to take over when her leader jacks it in making her in the presenters words candidate for president of an independent scottish state and the rest of the panel labour tories and lib dems plus todorov the poet was seated next to the presenter at the semicircular desk he seemed relaxed doodling with his pen on some paper hows he doing knows more about politics than i do rebus admitted and seems to have an opinion on everything goodyear had folded his arms and was concentrating on the screen rebus gave clarke another look this time achieving eye contact she shrugged then narrowed her eyes slightly warning him off rebus turned towards goodyear you know i helped put your grandad away ancient history the young man said maybe so but if its going to be an issue best tell me now its not an issue goodyear was still staring at the screen whats the deal with this woman macfarlane shes a scot nat msp clarke explained has a vested interest in us not shaking things up because of all the russian tycoons in town goodyear saw that clarke was impressed i read the papers he explained so macfarlane had a little chat but neglected to say that she knew the victim thats the size of it rebus was showing more interest in the new recruit well shes a politician last thing she wants is bad pr and being linked to a murder inquiry probably counts as a negative goodyear offered a shrug analysis complete the tv show was coming to an end the dapper presenter announcing that the following weeks episode would be coming from hull rebus turned off the tape and stretched his spine anyway he asked whereve you two been riordan clarke stated starting to fill him in on the meeting halfway through hawes and tibbet returned and had to be introduced to todd goodyear hawes had brought cakes for the office and apologised to goodyear that there wasnt one left over i dont have a sweet tooth he replied with a shake of the head tibbet had spent a few months in uniform at torphichen just before his promotion to cid and asked about old colleagues rebus got stuck into his slice of caramel shortbread while clarke boiled the kettle she checked but there was no sign of macrae meeting at hq rebus explained as she placed a mug on his desk then in an undertone have you cleared the sundance kid with him not yet she glanced over to where goodyear was chatting easily with tibbet and hawes and even managing to make them both laugh bringing a uniform in on a murder case he kept his voice low sure you know what youre doing dci macrae put me in charge meaning youre responsible for any and all fuckups thanks for reminding me how much do you know about him i know hes young and hes keen and hes spent too long hanging around with a dead weight i hope youre not drawing parallels ds clarke rebus slurped from the mug perish the thought di rebus she looked towards goodyear again im just giving him a taster thats all couple of days and hell be back to west end besides macrae wanted a few more recruits to the cause rebus nodded slowly slid from his chair and wandered over his hand landing on goodyears shoulder it was you who took the statement from nancy sievewright he checked goodyear nodded when she said shed just been passing by did you get any sort of an inkling the young man thought for a moment holding his bottom lip between his teeth not really he said at last tfou either did or you didnt in which case i didnt rebus nodded turning to hawes and tibbet what did you get in great stuart street gill morgan does live there and she knows nancy sievewright rebus stared at hawes but tibbet didnt want to be left out but he said we got the feeling she was parroting something shed been told to say rebus turned back to goodyear and dc tibbet can tell when someones spinning him a line what does that tell you goodyear gave his lip another gnaw shes asked a friend to cover for her because she was lying to us that night lying to you rebus corrected him and you didnt even know it having made his point he seemed to dismiss the constable again turning to hawes and tibbet whats morgan like hawes lives in a nice flat doesnt seem to be sharing with anyone just her name on the door tibbet added works as a model so she says but no jobs today if youre asking me though shes got credit at the bank of mum and dad different league from sievewright rebus commented waiting for clarke to nod agreement so how do they know one another hawes and tibbet seemed at a loss rebus made a tutting sound a teacher whose star pupils had eventually slipped up i think they just know each other socially tibbet blurted out rebus glared at him attend the same regattas you mean hawes felt compelled to come to her partners defence she wasnt that posh just making a point phyl rebus told her maybe we should bring her in clarke suggested your call shiv rebus reminded her youre the one macraes put in charge this was news to hawes and tibbet news to goodyear too by the look of it he was studying rebus as though wondering how a sergeant could suddenly outrank an inspector the ringing phone broke the silence rebus being closest picked it up todorov inquiry di rebus speaking oh hello the voice was male and tremulous i called earlier rebus caught hawess eye about a woman sir we appreciate you taking the trouble to phone back tes well so what is it i can do for you mr do i have to give my name this can be as confidential as you like sir but a name would be nice by confidential you mean mean spit it out rebus wanted to yell into the receiver but instead he kept his voice level and pleasant thinking of something hed once been told sincerity is everything when you can fake that the skys the limit well all right then the caller was saying my names he broke off again i mean you can call me george thank you george george gaverill george gaverill rebus repeated watching hawes add the name to her notepad now what is it youd like to say george my colleague mentioned something about a woman yes and youre calling because you saw our flyers at the car park on the sandwich board outside the car park the man corrected rebus im sure its nothing i mean i saw it on the news the poor guy was mugged wasnt he i dont think she could have done it youre probably right sir all the same we try to gather up as much information as we can helps us build a picture rebus was rolling his eyes clarke made a circular motion with her finger keep him talking i wouldnt want my wife to think it was anything other than what it actually was gaverill was saying absolutely so this woman sir the night that man was murdered the voice broke off abruptly and rebus thought hed lost him but then he heard breathing on the line i was walking along kings stables road what time was this ten maybe ten fifteen and there was a woman tea im with you so far sir rebus rolled his eyes again she propositioned me it was rebuss turn to pause by which you mean just what i say she wanted to have sex though she put it rather more crudely and this was on kings stables road yes near the car park outside the car park yes a prostitute i suppose so i mean its not every day something like that happens not to me at any rate and what did you say to her sir i turned her down naturally and this was around ten or quarter past something like that yes rebus shrugged letting the others know he wasnt sure what he was getting he really wanted a description but it would be easier face to face moreover gaverills eyes would tell rebus whether he i was dealing with just another crank is there any way he began quietly i could persuade you to come to the station i cant stress how vital your information might be really gaverill perked up for a moment but only a moment my wife though i couldnt possibly you could make some excuse im sure why do you say that the man barked suddenly i just thought but the line had gone dead rebus cursed under his breath and dropped the phone back on to the desk in the movies someone would have traced the call ive never heard of a sex worker operating from that street or anywhere near clarke commented sceptically sounded genuine enough rebus felt bound to counter reckon gaverills his real name id put money on it then we look him up in the phone book clarke turned to hawes and tibbet get on to it they got on to it while rebus tapped the phone willing it to ring again when it did he snatched the receiver up i shouldnt have done that gaverill was saying it was rude of me dont blame you for being a little cautious sir rebus assured him we were just hoping youd phone again this is one of those cases where were desperate for a break of some kind but she wasnt a mugger or anything doesnt mean she didnt see something we reckon the victim was attacked just before eleven if she was in the area tes i see what you mean hawes and tibbet had done the deed a piece of paper was waved under rebuss nose phone number and address for george gaverill tell you what rebus said into the phone this call must be costing you money let me ring you back are you on the number yes but i dont want the rest of the sentence died with a gurgle in gaverills throat now then rebus said a little more steel in his voice we either come round to question you at your home mr gaverill or you come and see us here at gayfield square which is it to be sounding like a chastened child gaverill told rebus to give him half an hour but before gaverill arrived there were three other visitors roger and elizabeth anderson were first and after hawes and tibbet had taken them to an interview room nancy sievewright turned up rebus asked the front desk to put her in one of the spare rooms but not ir and give her a cup of tea dont want her seeing anderson he explained to clarke she nodded we need to talk to anderson anyway see what he says to nancy s story already done rebus admitted her gaze hardened but all he did was shrug happened to be out that way this morning thought i might as well ask him about it what did he say he was worried about her got her name and address from rebus turned towards todd goodyear wasnt you was it mustve been dyson goodyear said thats what i thought anyway ive warned him off he seemed to think for a moment then asked clarke if she wanted to take goodyear with her and get sievewrights formal statement part of todds learning curve he argued tfoure forgetting one thing john im in charge only trying to be helpful rebus had stretched his arms all innocence thanks but id rather hear what gaverius got so say i get the feeling hell be easily intimidated he trusts me now but when he comes up against three of us he started to shake his head dont want him clamming up again lets wait and see was all clarke said rebus gave another shrug and wandered over to the window meantime he said want to hear my theory tour theory of what why hes so sweaty about his wife finding out because goodyear piped up shell think he accepted the offer but rebus was shaking his head quite the reverse young todd would ds clarke like to hazard a guess slay us with an insight she said instead folding her arms what else is there on kings stables road rebus asked castle rock goodyear offered and a churchyard clarke added exactly rebus said and on the corner of that churchyard youll find an old lookout tower it was used a couple of centuries back to keep watch for bodysnatchers and to my mind they should put it back into use dodgy place at night that churchyard he let his words hang in the air gaverills gay clarke speculated and his wife doesnt know it rebus shrugged but seemed pleased that shed reached the same conclusion as him so he was hardly going to take up the womans offer goodyear continued nodding to himself at which point the phone buzzed it was the front desk letting them know george gaverill was waiting for them theyd already decided that he should be brought to the cid suite just that little bit more welcoming than an interview room but first rebus shook him warmly by the hand and led him along the corridor to ir where he asked him to put his eye to the peephole see the young woman rebus asked quietly yes gaverill whispered back she the one gaverill turned towards him no he stated rebus stared at the man gaverill was about five and a half feet tall thinboned and palefaced with mousy brown hair and some sort of rash on his face he was probably in his early forties and rebus got the feeling the rash could have been with him since his teens sure rebus asked fairly sure this woman was a bit taller id say not as young and not as skinny rebus nodded and led him back the way theyd come before climbing the stairs to cid he shook his head when clarke made eye contact no identification she gave a twitch of the mouth and held up the latest evening news there was a photo of the man called litvinenko he was attached to wires in his hospital bed and the poison had made him lose his hair coincidence was all rebus said as clarke introduced herself to gaverill cant thank you enough for coming sir goodyear meantime was busy on the phone taking notes from someone whod called the hotline and looking less than thrilled clarke had gestured for gaverill to sit down can we get you anything she asked i just want this over and done with well then rebus intervened well get straight to business maybe you can tell us in your own words exactly what happened like i told you inspector i was on kings stables road around quarter past ten and there was this woman loitering there close to the car park exit i reckoned she was waiting for someone but when i was making to pass her she spoke to me and what did she say she asked if i wanted gaverill swallowed hard his adams apple bouncing a fuck rebus offered exact words gaverill agreed was any sort of a price mentioned she told me it was i think she said no strings something like that no strings no comebacks said she just wanted a but he still couldnt bring himself to say it and this was going to happen right where you stood rebus sounded disbelieving maybe in the car park did she say as much i dont really remember id started walking away to be honest with you i was a bit shocked i can imagine clarke sympathised what a hellish thing to happen so can you tell us what she looked like well she was im not sure exactly about the same height as me a bit older than the lass downstairs though im not very good at ages womens ages i mean lots of makeup some makeup and perfume but i couldnt tell you what kind would you say she looked like a prostitute mr gaverill rebus asked not the kind you see on tv no she wasnt dressed provocatively she had a coat on with a hood it was cold that night dont forget a coat with a hood like a duffel coat maybe or a bit longer than a duffel im not terribly sure he gave a nervous little laugh i wish i could be more help toure doing fine rebus assured him better than fine clarke added to be honest with you gaverill went on when i played it back in my mind i decided she was probably a wee bit bonkers i remember one time there was a woman on the steps of a church by bruntsfield links and she was lying there with her legs in the air skirt hiked up and it turned out shed escaped from the royal ed he seemed to think some explanation was needed thats where they keep the psychiatric patients clarke interrupted him with a nod well i was only a bairn when that happened but i still remember it not the sort of thing youd forget rebus agreed surprised it didnt put you off women for life he gave a laugh so gaverill would take it as a joke but clarkes eyes warned him to go easy irenes a special woman inspector gaverill stated im sure she is sir been married a while nineteen years she was the first real girlfriend i ever had first and last eh rebus offered mr gaverill clarke interrupted would you be willing to do us one further favour id like an identification officer to work with you on a composite of the womans face do you think that might be possible right now gaverill checked his watch soon as possible while the memorys still fresh we could have someone here in ten or fifteen minutes meaning half an hour meant to ask mr gaverill rebus butted in whats your line of work auctions gaverill told him i pick stuff up and sell it on flexible hours rebus argued you can always explain to irene that you were with a punter clarke gave a little cough but gaverill hadnt read anything into rebuss words ten minutes he asked ten or fifteen clarke assured him lunchtime sandwiches theyd given their orders to goodyear rebus stressing that it was all part and parcel of the training roger and elizabeth anderson had gone home so had nancy sievewright hawes and tibbet had gleaned nothing new from either interview rebus was studying the computer image of a womans face gaverill had insisted that most of it be left in shadow the hood pulled low over the forehead nobody we know clarke said not for the first time gaverill had just left and not in the best of moods it had taken almost an hour for the id expert with the help of his laptop printer and software to put together the efit could be anybody rebus said in response to clarkes statement still lets say she was there whoever she is tou buy gaverills story tou mean you dont he seemed genuine to me goodyear piped up before quickly adding for what its worth rebus gave a snort and dumped the remains of his filled roll into the bin brushing his shirt free of crumbs so now hawes added weve got a woman trying to lure men into the car park to have quick meaningless sex with her she paused i can see where siobhan has a problem tends not to happen too often clarke agreed unless the boys know different rebus looked to tibbet and tibbet looked to goodyear none of them said anything a hooker then tibbet decided to offer sex worker rebus corrected him but the andersons and nancy sievewright walked right past the car park and didnt see a woman in a hood doesnt mean she wasnt there colin rebus pointed out theres a term for it isnt there goodyear asked when a woman sets a man up honey trap rebus told him so are we back to the mugging theory again its not an mo ive come across not in edinburgh and heres another thing forensics say todorov had had sex that day the room was quiet for a moment as they tried to untangle the various threads clarke sat with her elbows on the desk face in her hands eventually she looked up is there anything at all stopping me from coming to the obvious conclusion and taking that conclusion to dci macrae victim was robbed beaten left for dead she nodded towards the efit and heres the only suspect we have so far rebus cautioned but macrae said weve got a few days to keep digging so why not use them and dig where exactly rebus tried to think of an answer but gave up he gestured for clarke to follow him into the corridor hawes and tibbet looking hurt by the snub rebus paused at the top of the stairs clarke was approaching arms folded are you sure rebus asked her that phyl and col are okay with goodyear suddenly appearing on the team how do you mean i mean hes not one of us she stared at him i dont think theyre the ones with the problem she paused before continuing do you remember your first day in cid vaguely i remember mine like it was yesterday the way everybody kept saying i was fresh meat i thought they were vampires she unfolded her arms rested her hands on her hips todd wants that taste of cid john sounds like hes got his teeth into you at any rate her smile became a scowl but the thought of vampires had given rebus a notion might be a long shot he said but the guard at the car park said something about one of the bosses the only one that ever went near the place he called her the reaper want to know why okay then why clarke was determined not to be placated on account rebus told her of the hood she always wears gary walsh was in the car parks security shack having relieved joe wills about an hour before with the jacket of his uniform undone and his shirt tieless he looked fairly relaxed money for old rope this rebus teased him as he knocked on the halfopen door walsh slid his feet from the tabletop and pulled out his earphones turning off the cd player whatre you listening to primal scream and what would you have done if id been one of the bosses reapers the only one we ever see so you said anyone told her about the murder she got it from a reporter and rebus was studying a newspaper next to the radio that afternoons evening news with the crossword already done walsh just shrugged wanted to see the blood she sounds lovely shes all right got a name for her walsh was studying him tou nicked anybody yet not yet what do you want to talk to cath for thats her name cath cath mills does she look anything like this walsh took the picture of the hooded woman from rebus and stared at it unblinkingly then shook his head sure rebus said nothing like her walsh handed the picture back whos it supposed to be witness saw a woman hanging around outside on the night todorov was murdered its a question of ruling people out well you can rule the reaper out straight away cath wasnt here that night all the same ill take her phone number walsh pointed to a corkboard behind the door its up there rebus started jotting down the mobile number how often does she drop by maybe a couple of times a week once on joes shift once on mine ever had trouble with the local prossies didnt know there were any rebus was closing his notebook when the buzzer sounded walsh was looking at one of the monitors a driver was out of his car and standing at the exit barrier is there a problem walsh asked into the microphone bloody things just chewed up my ticket walsh rolled his eyes for rebuss benefit been doing that a lot he told him he pushed a button and the barrier started to rise the driver getting back behind his steering wheel without so much as a thanks or goodbye going to have to close that exit walsh muttered till they come and fix it never a dull moment eh walsh gave a snort this woman he said rising to his feet reckon she had anything to do with it why do you ask walsh was buttoning his uniform tou dont get many women muggers do you not many rebus conceded and it was a mugging i mean papers say the guys pockets were emptied looks that way rebus paused for a moment tou lock up at eleven right right thats pretty much when the body was found oh aye but you didnt see anything nothing youd have driven right past raeburn wynd walsh just shrugged i didnt see anything and i didnt hear anything i certainly didnt see a woman in a cloak probably have scared the life out of me with that graveyard across the road he broke off brow furrowing what is it rebus asked probably nothing just thinking about those ghost tours they do dressing up in costumes putting a fright on the tourists i dont think our mystery woman was in that sort of game but rebus knew what he meant you saw them at night wandering up and down the royal mile guides dressed as vampires or godknewwhat besides ive never heard of them doing walking tours down here cemeterys not safe enough walsh agreed ready to leave the kiosk hed picked up a glossy plastic sign with the words out of order on it rebus preceded him out ever get any hassle from that quarter rebus asked couple of junkies wanting a handout if you ask me they beat that poor bugger up in the stairwell last year tour colleague told me about that never solved walsh gave a snort which was all the answer rebus needed any idea which station did the investigating it was before i started here walshs eyes narrowed is it because this guys foreign or because hes a bigwig not sure i get you they were heading down the ramp towards the exit level is that why youre spending so much time on it its because he was murdered mr walsh rebus stated getting out his mobile megan macfarlane had been to some meeting in leith roddy liddle said she could probably manage ten minutes at the starbucks just uphill from the parliament so that was where clarke and todd goodyear were waiting goodyear was drinking tea while clarkes own americano had come with the requested extra shot of espresso shed also splashed out on two slices of carrot cake though goodyear had tried paying my treat shed insisted then had asked at the till for a receipt just in case she could finesse it as an expense they sat at a table near the window with a view of the darkening canongate daft place to put a parliament she commented out of sight out of mind goodyear offered she smiled at that and asked him what he thought of cid so far he considered for a moment before answering i like that youve kept me on so far she warned and you seem to click as a team like that too the case itself his voice drifted off spit it out i think maybe all of you and this isnt a criticism are a little bit in thrall to di rebus can you be a little bit in thrall you know what i mean though hes old experienced seen a lot of action down the years so when he has hunches you tend to follow them its just the way some cases go todd you drop a pebble in water and the ripples start to spread but its not like that at all is it he pulled his chair closer to the table warming to his argument its actually linear the crime is committed by a person and the job of cid is to find them most of the time thats pretty straightforward they feel guilty and hand themselves in or someone witnesses the crime or theyre already known to us and their prints or dna give them away he paused i get the feeling di rebus hates those sorts of case the ones where the motives too easy to spot you barely know di rebus clarke prickled goodyear seemed to sense hed gone too far all i mean is he likes things to be complex gives him more of a challenge less to this than meets the eye thats what youre saying im saying we should keep an open mind thanks for the advice clarkes voice was as chilled as the carrot cake goodyear stared into his mug and looked relieved when the door opened and megan macfarlane approached the table she was toting about three kilos of ringbinder which she let clatter to the floor roddy liddle had gone to the counter to order their drinks the hoops we have to go through macfarlane complained she gave todd goodyear a questioning smile and clarke made the introductions im a great fan goodyear told the msp i admired the stand you took on the tram system tou wouldnt happen to have a few thousand friends who think the same way macfarlane had collapsed into her chair eyes staring ceilingwards and ive always supported independence goodyear went on she angled her head towards him before turning to clarke i like this one better she commented speaking of di rebus clarke said hes sorry he cant make it along this afternoon but he was the one who happened to spot your question time appearance were wondering why you didnt mention it is that all macfarlane sounded irritated i thought maybe youd arrested someone did you just meet mr todorov that one time clarke persisted tea so you met at the studio the hub macfarlane corrected yes we were all due to rendezvous there an hour before recording i thought it went out live goodyear interrupted not quite the msp insisted of course jim bakewell being a labour minister had to turn up fashionably late floor staff didnt like that which might explain why he got so little screen time she perked up again at the memory and gave liddle a blessing as he arrived with her black coffee and a single espresso for himself he dragged a chair over so he could be part of the company and shook hands with goodyear think well start to hear rumours roddy macfarlane asked pouring a first sachet of sugar into her drink the being seen with a uniformed police officer very likely liddle drawled lifting the tiny cup to his mouth tou were saying about mr todorov clarke prompted she wants to know about question time macfarlane explained to her assistant thinks i must be hiding something just wondering clarke interrupted why you didnt think to mention it tell me sergeant have any of the other politicos who shared the stage with the victim come forward with their reminiscences the question didnt seem to require an answer no because theyd have said much the same as me our russian friend necked some wine crammed a few sandwiches into his face and said nary a word to us i rather got the impression he wasnt a great fan of politicians as an overall species what about after the show taxis were waiting he grunted his goodbyes and left tucking a spare bottle of wine under his jacket she paused how any of this aids your inquiry is a mystery to me that was the only time you met him didnt i just say so she looked to her assistant for confirmation clarke decided to look at him too what about you mr liddle she asked did you talk to him at the hub i introduced myself surly id have called him theres usually a nonpolitician on the show and theres always a rigorous preinterview the researcher whod talked with todorov didnt sound too thrilled you could tell by her notes that he hadnt been forthcoming to this day i dont know why they had him on clarke thought for a moment charles riordan had said that todorov liked to chat to people yet the drinker in mathers had said he hardly uttered a word and now macfarlane and liddle were saying much the same did todorov have two sides to his personality whose idea would it have been to book him on the show she asked liddle producer presenter one of the crew i dare say anyone can propose a guest could it have been goodyear interrupted a case of sending a message to moscow i suppose so macfarlane conceded sounding impressed how do you mean clarke asked goodyear there was a journalist killed there a while back maybe the bbc wanted people to know you cant stifle free speech so easily someone stifled it eventually though didnt they liddle added or we wouldnt be having this conversation and look at what happened to that poor bloody russian in london macfarlane was scowling at him thats exactly the kind of rumour we want to clamp down on of course of course he mumbled busying himself with his already empty cup so just to recap clarke announced into the silence the two of you saw mr todorov at the question time recording but didnt get much of a conversation going you hadnt met him before and you didnt see him again afterwards is that the way youd like me to phrase it in my report report macfarlane fairly barked the word not for public consumption clarke reassured her then after a moments beat she delivered her coup de grace until the trial of course ive already stressed sergeant that we have some influential investors in town and it might not take much to spook them but youd agree wouldnt you clarke countered that we need to show them how scrupulous and thorough our police force is macfarlane seemed about to say something to that but her phone was trilling she turned away from the table as she answered stuart how are things clarke guessed stuart might be the banker stuart janney i hope you got them all a booking at andrew fairlie macfarlane had got to her feet and was on the move she headed outside glancing through the window as she continued her conversation its the restaurant at gleneagles liddle was explaining i know clarke told him then for goodyears benefit our economic saviours are staying the night there nice big dinner and a round of golf after breakfast she asked liddle who would be picking up the tab the hardpressed taxpayer she guessed he gave a shrug and she turned back to goodyear still reckon the meek will inherit the earth todd psalm verse goodyear intoned but now clarkes own phone was ringing she picked it up and held it to her ear john rebus wanted a progress report just getting a bit of scripture from pc goodyear she told him the meek inheriting the earth and all of that rebus had only called because he was bored but within a minute of clarke answering his call a black vw golf was roaring to a kerbside stop outside the car park the woman who emerged had to be cath mills so rebus cut the call short miss mills he said taking a step towards her with late afternoon darkness had come biting gusts of wind scudding in from the north sea he didnt know what hed been expecting the reaper to be wearing a fulllength cape maybe but in fact her coat was more like a parka with furtrimmed hood she was in her late thirties tall with red hair in a pageboy cut and blackrimmed spectacles her face was pale and rounded lips reddened with lipstick she looked nothing like the picture in his pocket inspector rebus she assumed giving a shortlived shake of the hand she wore black leather driving gloves which she plunged into her pockets afterwards i hate this time of year she muttered checking the sky dark when you get up dark when you go home you keep regular hours rebus asked job like this theres always something needs dealing with she glowered at the out of order sign next to the nearest exit barrier so were you out and about on wednesday night she was still looking at the barrier home by nine i seem to think problem at our facility in canning street shift hadnt turned up i got the attendant to pull a double so that was that slowly she turned her attention to rebus youre asking about the night the man was killed thats right pity your cctvs worse than useless mightve given us something to work with we didnt install it with slaughter in mind rebus ignored this so you didnt happen to pass here around ten oclock on the night it happened who says i did no one but weve a woman matching your description okay so he was stretching it but he wanted to see how she would react all she did was raise an eyebrow and fold her arms and how she asked did you happen to get my description in the first place she glanced towards the car park boys been telling tales out of school ill have to see to it theyre disciplined actually all they said was that you sometimes wear a hood a pedestrian happened to spot a woman hanging around and she was wearing a hood too a woman with her hood up at ten oclock on a winters night and this is your idea of narrowing the field all of a sudden rebus wanted the day to be over he wanted to be seated on a bar stool with a drink before him and everything else left far behind if you werent here he sighed just say so she thought this over for a moment im not sure she said at last drawing the words out what do you mean might liven things up being a suspect in a police case thanks but we get quite enough timewasters as it is the worst offenders he added we might even prosecute her face opened into a smile sorry she apologised been a long gruelling day i probably picked the wrong person to tease her attention was back on the barrier i suppose i should talk to gary make sure hes reported that she peeled back a glove to look at her wristwatch just about see me through to the end of play she brought her eyes back to rebuss after which i dare say i can be located in montpelier s wine bar in bruntsfield it had taken rebus only a couple of seconds to place it her smile widened thought you looked the kind whod know she said in the end he stayed for three drinks blame the third glass free promotion not that he was drinking glasses of anything three small bottles of imported lager keeping his wits about him cath mills was a pro her own three drinks adding up to a whole bottle of rioja shed parked her car around the corner since she lived in some flats nearby and could leave it there overnight so dont think you can have me for drunkdriving shed said with a wag of the finger im walking too hed answered explaining that his own flat was in marchmont when hed entered the bar assailed by loudspeaker music and office chatter shed been waiting in a booth at the back hoping i wouldnt find you hed speculated dont want to seem too easy do i the conversation had mostly been about his job plus the usual edinburgh rants the traffic the roadworks the council the cold shed warned him that there wasnt much of a story to her own life married at eighteen divorced by twenty tried again at thirty four and it lasted all of six months should have known better by then shouldnt i you cant always have been a parking supervisor though indeed not office job after office job then her own little consulting business which had plummeted to earth after two and a half years not helped by husband two hoofing it with the savings i was a pa after that but couldnt hack it bit of time on the dole and trying to retrain then this came along my line of work rebus had said i hear peoples stories all the time they always hold back the interesting stuff then take me in for questioning shed replied stretching her arms wide eventually hed got her to say a little about gary walsh and joe wills she too suspected wills of drinking on the job but had yet to catch him being a detective you could find out for me its a private eye you need or set up a few more cctv cameras without him knowing about it shed laughed at that before telling the waitress she was ready for her free drink after an hour they were checking their watches and giving little smiles across the table to one another what about you shed asked found anyone wholl put up with you not for a while i was married one daughter in her thirties now no office romances highpressure job working in a team i know how it is hasnt happened to me hed confirmed bully for you she sniffed and gave a twitch of the mouth ive given up on onenight stands more or less the twitch becoming another smile this has been nice hed said aware of how awkward it sounded you wont get into trouble for consorting with a suspect whos going to tell nobody needs to and shed pointed towards the bars own cctv camera trained on them from a corner of the ceiling theyd both laughed at that and as she shrugged back into her parka hed asked again were you there that night be honest now and shed shaken her head as much of an answer as he was going to get outside hed handed her a business card with the number of his mobile on it no peck on the cheek or squeeze of the hand they were two scarred veterans each respectful of the other on his way home rebus had stopped for fish and chips eating them out of the little cardboard box they didnt come wrapped in newspaper any more something to do with public health didnt taste the same either and the portions of haddock had been whittled away blame overfishing in the north sea haddock would soon be a delicacy either that or extinct hed finished by the time he arrived at his tenement pulling himself up the two flights of stairs there was no mail waiting not even a utility bill he switched on the lights in the living room and selected some music then called siobhan whats up she asked just wondered where we go from here i was thinking of going to the fridge for a can of something time was that would have been my line the times are achanging and thats one of mine too he could hear her laughing then she asked how his interview with cath mills had gone another dead end took long enough to drive down it didnt see the point of coming back to base he paused thinking of reporting me for bad timekeeping ill give you the benefit of the doubt whats the music youre playing its called little criminals theres a track on it called jolly coppers on parade not someone au fait with the police then its randy newman theres another title of his i like you cant fool the fat man and would the fat man be yourself by any chance maybe ill keep you guessing he let the silence linger for a moment youre starting to side with macrae arent you you think we should be concentrating on the mugger file ive put phyl and colin on it clarke conceded youre losing your bottle im not losing anything okay i put that badly its good to be cautious shiv im not about to blame you for it think about it for a second john was todorov followed from the caledonian hotel not according to your cctv wizard did a prostitute proposition him maybe and maybe her pimp jumped in with a length of lead pipe whatever happened the poet was in the wrong place at the wrong time that much we agree on and getting up the noses of msps russian tycoons and first albannach bank isnt going to get us anywhere but its fun isnt it whats the point of a job if youre not having fun its fun for you john its always been fun for you so humour me my last week at work i thought thats what i was doing no shiv what youre doing is writing me off thats what todd goodyear is about hes your number two same way you used to be mine youre already starting to train him up and probably enjoying it too now hang on a sec and im guessing hes also a means to an end as long as youve got him with you you dont have to choose between phyl and col with insights like that its a wonder you never got further up the ladder thing about that ladder shiv each rung you climb theres another arse waiting to be licked what a lovely image we all need some poetry in our lives he told her hed see her tomorrow always supposing im needed and ended the call sat there another five minutes wondering if shed call back but she didnt there was something too cheery about randy newmans delivery so rebus turned off the album plenty of darker stuff he could play early king crimson or peter hammill for example but instead he walked around the silent flat going from room to room and ended up in the hallway with the keys to the saab in his hand why the hell not he told himself it wasnt as if it would be the first time and he doubted it would be the last wasnt drunk enough for it to be a problem he locked the flat and headed down the stairwell out into the night unlocked the saab and got in it was only a fiveminute drive and took him past montpelier s again a righthand turn off bruntsfield place then one more right and he was parking in a quiet street of detached victorianera houses hed been here so often hed started to notice changes new lampposts or new pavements signs had gone up warning that come march the parking would be zoned it had already happened in marchmont hadnt made it any easier to find a space a few rubbish skips had come and gone hed heard the polish accents of the workmen extensions had been added to some homes and the garages dismantled in two separate gardens plenty of comings and goings during the day but much quieter in the evening practically every house had its own driveway but cars from neighbouring streets would park up overnight no one had ever paid attention to rebus in fact one dogwalker had started to mistake him for a local and would nod and smile or offer a hello the dog itself was small and wiry and looked less trusting turning away from him the one time hed tried crouching down to pat it that had been a rare occurrence mostly he stayed in the car hands on the steering wheel window rolled down and a cigarette between his lips the radio could be playing he wouldnt even be watching the house necessarily but he knew who lived there knew too that there was a coachhouse in the back garden which was where the bodyguard lived one time a car had stopped when it was halfway through the driveway gates the bodyguard was in the front but it was the back window which had slid soundlessly down the better for the passenger to make eye contact with the watching rebus the look was a mixture of contempt frustration and maybe even pity though this last would have been imitation rebus doubted big ger cafferty had ever in his adult life felt an emotion like pity for another human being day five tuesday november the air still smouldered the charred smell almost overpowering siobhan clarke held a handkerchief to her mouth and nose rebus stubbed out his breakfast underfoot bloody hell was all he could think to say todd goodyear had heard the news first and had phoned clarke who was halfway to the scene before she decided to call rebus they now stood on a roadway in joppa while the fire crew gathered up the spent coils of hose charles riordans house was a shell the windowpanes gone roof collapsed can we go in yet clarke asked one of the firemen whats the rush im just asking talk to the boss some of the firemen were sweating rubbing smudges of soot across their foreheads theyd taken off their oxygen tanks and masks they were talking among themselves like a gang after a rumble debating their roles in the action a neighbour had brought them water and juice more neighbours were standing in their doorways or gardens while onlookers from further afield shuffled and whispered it was a d division call and two suits from leith cid had already asked clarke what gayfield square s interest was witness in a case was all shed told them no point giving away anything more the suits hadnt been happy about it and were now keeping their distance phones held to their ears reckon he was at home rebus asked clarke she shrugged remember what we were talking about last tight l you mean the argument we were having me reading way too much into todorovs death dont rub it in rebus decided to play devils advocate could be an accident of course and hey maybe well find him alive and well at his studio ive tried calling no answer as yet she nodded towards a kerbside tvr woman two doors down says thats his car he parked it last night she knows it was him because of the noise it makes the tvrs windscreen was shrouded in ash rebus watched two more firemen step gingerly over some timbers on their way into what was left of the house some of the shelves were still visible in the hallway though most had been destroyed fire investigator on his way rebus asked on her way clarke corrected him the march of progress an ambulance crew had turned up too but were now checking their watches unwilling to waste much more time todd goodyear came bounding forward dressed in a suit rather than a uniform he nodded a greeting at rebus and started leafing back through his notebook how many of those do you get through a month rebus couldnt help asking clarke gave him a warning look ive talked to the neighbours either side of him goodyear reported to clarke theyre in a state of shock of course terrified their own houses might be about to explode they want to get back in and save a few bits and pieces but the brigades not having it seems riordan came home at eleven thirty after that not a peep from him the way hed soundproofed the house goodyear nodded enthusiastically unlikely theyd have heard anything one of the fire officers says the acoustic baffling was probably part of the problem it can be incredibly flammable riordan didnt have any visitors in the night clarke asked goodyear shook his head he couldnt help glancing towards rebus as if expecting some sort of praise or appraisal youre in mufti was all rebus said the constables eyes swivelled between the two detectives clarke cleared her throat before speaking if hes working with us i thought hed look less conspicuous rebus tried staring her out then nodded slowly though he knew she was lying the suit had been goodyears idea and now she was covering for him before he could say anything a red car with flashing light roared into view stuttering to a halt the fire inspector clarke announced the woman who emerged from the car was elegant and businesslike and seemed straight off to have the brigades attention and respect officers started pointing at parts of the smokestreaked building obviously giving their side of the story while the two detectives from leith hovered nearby think we should introduce ourselves clarke asked rebus sooner or later he told her but shed already decided and was striding towards the cluster of bodies rebus followed indicating for goodyear to hang back the constable seemed reluctant hopping from pavement to roadway and back again rebus had attended plenty of house fires including one hed ended up being accused of starting thered been a fatality that time too not much fun for the pathologists when there were victims to be identified hed almost burned his own flat down once as well falling into a stupor on the sofa with the cigarette hanging from his mouth hed woken to smouldering fabric and a plume of sulphurous smoke easily done clarke was shaking hands with the fi not everyone looked happy the firefighters reckoned cid should leave them to get on with it natural reaction and one rebus could sympathise with all the same he started lighting another cigarette reckoning it might get him noticed bloody menace one of the brigade dutifully muttered mission accomplished the ffs name was katie glass and she was telling clarke what happened next locating any victims securing breached gassources checking the obvious meaning anything from a chip pan left on the heat to an electrical fault clarke nodded along until glass had finished then explained about the homeowners role in an ongoing investigation aware of leith cid listening in and that makes you suspect something glass guessed so be it but i always like to enter a scene with an open mind preconceptions mean you can miss things she moved towards the garden i gate flanked by firefighters and watched by rebus and clarke theres a cafe back in portobello rebus said giving a final glance towards the gutted house fancy a fryup afterwards they headed to gayfield square where hawes and tibbet feeling abandoned welcomed them with frowns they soon perked up at news of the fire and asked if it meant they could put the hmf away goodyear asked what that was habitual mugger file hawes explained not an official term tibbet added slapping a hand against the pile of box files thought theyd all be on computer goodyear commented if youre applying for the job but goodyear waved the offer aside clarke was seated at her desk tapping it with a pen what now boss rebus asked receiving a glare for his efforts i need to talk to macrae again she said at last though she could see his office was empty has he been in hawes shrugged not since we got here travel in together rebus asked all innocence it was colin tibbets turn to glower at him this changes everything clarke was saying quietly unless it was an accident rebus reminded her first todorov now the man he spent his final evening with it was goodyear who had spoken but clarke was nodding her agreement could all be a horrible coincidence rebus argued clarke stared at him christ john you were the one seeing conspiracies now it looks like weve got a connection youre pouring cold water on it isnt that what you do with a fire when he saw the blood shooting up clarkes neck he knew hed gone too far okay say youre right you still need to run it past macrae and meantime we wait to hear if they find a body and supposing they do we then wait to see what gates and curt make of it he paused thats whats called procedure you know it as well as i do clarke knew he was right and he watched as her shoulders relaxed a little and she dropped the pen on to the desk where it rolled and settled for once johns not wrong she told the room much as it galls me to say it she smiled and he smiled back with a little bow from the waist had to happen once in my career he said better late than never i suppose there were more smiles and rebus felt it at that moment the inquiry had been on the go for days but only now had everything changed despite the scowls and the sniping they really were a team which was how macrae found them when he walked into the cid suite even he seemed to sense a change of atmosphere clarke gave him her report keeping everything simple the phone rang on hawess desk and rebus wondered if it was another response to their public appeal he thought again of the prostitute trying to do business on a nothroughroad and of cath mills stoking up on rioja todorov was attractive to women and attracted by them no doubt could a stranger have lured him to his doom with an offer of sex it was straight out of le carre hawes was off the phone and advancing towards rebuss desk they found the body was all she needed to say rebus knocked on macraes door relaying the message with a look and a nod clarke asked the boss if she could be excused back in the main body of the kirk she asked hawes for details male they think under a collapsed section of ceiling in the living room meaning the studio room goodyear interrupted reminding them all that he too had been to the producers home theyve got their own team taking photographs and the like hawes went on body is on its way to the mortuary to be placed in the decomposing room rebus didnt doubt he wondered how todd goodyear would react to seeing a crispy one we should go there clarke told him but rebus was shaking his head take todd he offered part of that cid learning curve hawes was on the phone to cr studios giving them the news while confirming that riordan himself hadnt actually turned up so far that day colin tibbets task was to chase up richard browning at the caledonian hotel how long did it take to go through an evenings worth of bar tabs if rebus didnt know better hed have said browning was chancing his arm hoping cid would forget all about it when a face appeared around the door rebus was the only one not doing anything theres someone downstairs the desk sergeant said looking to hand in a list of russians could it be the hearts first team for saturday but rebus knew who and what it was nikolai stahov from the consulate russian nationals based in edinburgh again stahov had taken his time and rebus doubted theyd have much use for the list the landscape had changed since theyd first asked for it all the same and for want of anything better to do he nodded and said hed be down straight away but when he opened the door to the reception area the man studying the posters on the walls was not stahov it was stuart janney mr janney rebus said holding out a hand and trying not to show his surprise its detective inspector rebus he reminded the banker janney nodded as if in apology for not having remembered im just handing in a message hed lifted an envelope from his pocket didnt expect someone of your calibre to be on the receiving end likewise i didnt know you ran errands for the russian consulate janney managed a smile i ran into nikolai at gleneagles he happened to find the envelope in his pocket mentioned he was supposed to bring it in tou told him youd save him the trouble janney gave a shrug no big deal how was the golf i didnt play fab was giving a presentation which happened to coincide with the visit by our russian friends that is a coincidence anyone would think you were stalking them now janney laughed head back business is business inspector and lest we forget good for scotland true enough that why youre keeping in with the snp too reckon theyll be running the show next may as i said at our first encounter the bank has to stay neutral on the other hand the nats are making a strong showing independence may be a ways off but its probably inevitable and good for business janney gave a shrug theyre pledging to drop the rate of corporation tax rebus was examining the sealed envelope did comrade stahov happen to mention whats in here russian nationals living locally he said its to do with the todorov case i cant really see the connection myself janney let the sentence hang as if ready for rebuss explanation but all rebus did was tuck the envelope inside his jacket how about mr todorovs bank statements he asked instead any further forward with them as i said inspector there are procedures sometimes without the benefit of an executor the wheels grind slow so have you done any deals yet deals janney seemed not to understand with these russians im supposed to be tiptoeing around its nothing to do with tiptoeing we just dont want them getting the wrong idea about scotland you mean a mans dead mr janney not much we can do to change that the door next to the reception desk opened and dci macrae appeared he was dressed in coat and scarf ready to leave any news on the fire he asked rebus no sir rebus told him nothing from the postmortem not yet but you still think it ties to the poet fellow sir this is mr janney he works for first albannach bank the two men shook hands rebus hoped his boss would take the hint but just in case he added the information that janney was going to provide details of todorovs bank account am i to understand janney said that someone else has died house fire macrae barked friend of todorovs gracious me rebus had extended his own hand towards the banker well he interrupted thanks again for dropping by yes janney conceded you must have a lot on your plate the whole helpyourself buffet rebus acknowledged with a smile the two men shook hands for a moment it looked as if macrae and the banker might leave the station together rebus didnt like the idea of macrae spilling any more of the buffet so told him he needed a word janney exited alone and rebus waited until the door had closed but it was macrae who spoke what do you think of goodyear he asked seems proficient macrae seemed to be expecting some caveat but rebus shrugged his shoulders instead and left it at that siobhan appears to agree with you macrae paused therell be a few changes to the team when you retire tes sir i reckon siobhans about ready for a stepup to inspector shes been ready for years macrae nodded to himself what was it you wanted to speak to me about he eventually askeditll keep sir rebus assured him he watched the boss head for the exit and considered stepping into the car park for a smoke but instead he headed back upstairs tearing open the envelope and studying the names there were a couple of dozen but no other details nothing like addresses or a list of occupations stahov had been scrupulous to the point of adding his own name at the very bottom maybe hed done it for a laugh knowing the sheet itself was of no possible use to the inquiry but as rebus pushed open the door to the cid suite he saw that hawes and tibbet were on their feet keen to tell him something spit it out he said tibbet was holding out another sheet of paper fax from the caledonian several of the hotel residents bought brandies at the bar that night any of them russian rebus asked have a look so rebus took the fax from him and saw three names staring back at him two were complete strangers but didnt sound foreign the third wasnt foreign either but it sent the blood thrumming in his ears mr m cafferty m for morris morris gerald cafferty big ger hawes explained with no necessity whatsoever rebus had only the one question bring him in or question him at his house my decision not yours siobhan clarke reminded him shed been back from the mortuary half an hour and seemed to be nursing a headache tibbet had made her a coffee and rebus had watched her press two tablets from their foil enclosure into the palm of her hand todd goodyear had thrown up only the once in the mortuary car park though there had been another crisis point on the way back to gayfield square when they passed some men laying tarmac something about the smell hed explained he now looked pale and shaken but kept telling everyone he was all right whether they wanted to hear it or not clarke had gathered them round so she could tell them what gates and curt had told her male five ten rings on two fingers of the right hand gold watch on one wrist and with a broken jaw maybe a roof beam fell on him she speculated the victim hadnt been tied to any piece of furniture and neither his hands nor his feet had been bound just lying in a heap on the livingroom floor probable cause of death smoke inhalation gates did stress that these were preliminary findings rebus still makes it a suspicious death hawes which means its ours and id tibbet asked dental records if were lucky or the rings goodyear guessed even if they belonged to riordan rebus told him doesnt mean riordan was the last man wearing them i had a case ten or twelve years back guy being done for fraud tried faking his own death goodyear nodded slowly beginning to see after which rebus divulged his own news before asking his question clarke sat with the fax in one hand head resting in the other this she said just keeps getting better and better then raising her eyes to meet rebuss interview room ir it is he said and remember to wrap up warm cafferty however sat with his chair slid back from the table one leg crossed over the over and hands behind his head for all the world as if he were in the parlour back home siobhan he said as she walked into the room always a great delight doesnt she look businesslike rebus youve trained her to perfection rebus closed the door and took up position by the wall clarke easing herself on to the chair opposite cafferty he gave her a little bow inclining the great dome of his head but keeping the hands where they were i was wondering when you would pull me in he said so you knew it was coming clarke had placed a blank pad of paper on the table and was taking the top off her pen with di rebus only days away from the scrapheap the gangster glanced in rebuss direction i knew youd dream up some pretext for giving me grief well as it happens weve got slightly more than a pretext did you know siobhan cafferty broke in that john here sits outside my house of an evening making sure im tucked up in bed id say that level of protection goes somewhat beyond the call of duty clarke was trying not to be deflected she placed her pen on the table but then had to stop it rolling towards the edge tell us about alexander todorov she began say again the man you bought a tenners worth of cognac for last wednesday night in the bar of the caledonian hotel rebus added what the polish guy russian actually clarke corrected him tou live a mile and a half away rebus pressed on makes me wonder why youd need a room to get away from you maybe cafferty made show of guessing iior just because i can afford one and then you sit in the bar buying drinks for strangers clarke added cafferty unlinked his hands so he could raise a finger as if to stress a point difference between rebus and me hed sit in the bar all night and buy drinks for no bugger he gave a cold chuckle this is the sum total of why youve dragged me here because i bought some poor immigrant a drink how many poor immigrants do you reckon would wander into that bar rebus asked cafferty made show of thinking closing his sunken eyes and then opening them again they were like dark little pebbles in his huge pale face tou have a fair point he admitted but the man was still a stranger to me whats he gone and done hes gone and been murdered rebus said with as much restraint as he could muster and as of right now youre the last person who saw him alive whoa there cafferty looked from one detective to the other the poet guy the one i saw in the papers attacked on kings stables road maybe fifteen or twenty minutes after drinking with you what was it the pair of you fell out about cafferty ignored rebus and concentrated on clarke do i need my solicitor here not as yet she said levelly cafferty smiled again are you not wondering siobhan why im asking you and not rebus he outranks you after all now he turned back to rebus but youre days from the scrapheap just like i say while siobhan heres still on the way up if the pair of you have got a case on the go my guess is that old man macrae will have seen sense and put shiv in charge only my friends get to call me shiv my apologies siobhan far as youre concerned im detective sergeant clarke cafferty whistled through his teeth and slapped one meaty thigh trained her to perfection he repeated and rare entertainment with it what were you doing at the caledonian hotel clarke asked as if hed never spoken having a drink and staying in a room it can be murder finding a taxi home so how did you meet alexander todorov i was in the bar alone but only because i wanted to be unlike di rebus there i have plenty of friends i can drink and have a laugh with im betting youd be fun to drink with too ds clarke so long as miseryguts was elsewhere and todorov just happened to sit next to you clarke was guessing i was on a stool at the bar he was standing waiting to get served barman was crafting a cocktail so we had a minute or two to talk i liked him well enough to put his drink on my tab cafferty offered an exaggerated shrug he slugged it said thanks and buggered off he didnt offer to buy one back rebus asked he took the poet to be a drinker of the old school etiquette would have demanded no less actually he did cafferty admitted i told him i was fine heres hoping the cctv backs you up rebus commented for the first time caffertys mask slipped a little though the unease was momentary at best it will he stated rebus just nodded slowly while clarke suppressed a smile good to know they could still rattle cafferty victim was beaten without mercy rebus went on if id thought about it idve had you in the frame from the word go tou always did like framing people cafferty turned his gaze on clarke so far all shed added to the top sheet of paper was a sequence of doodles three four times a week hes in that old banger of his parked on the street outside my house some people would cry harassment what do you think ds clarke should i apply for one of those restraining orders what did the two of you talk about back to the russian guy again cafferty sounded disappointed far as i can recollect he said something about edinburgh being a cold city i probably said he was dead right maybe he meant the people rather than the climate and hed still have been right i dont mean you of course ds clarke youre a little ray of sunshine but those of us whove lived here all our lives well we can be on the morose side wouldnt you agree di rebus a pal of mine told me once its because weve never stopped being invaded a silent invasion to be sure quite a pleasant invasion and sometimes more a trickle than an onslaught but its made us prickly some more than most giving a sly glance towards rebus youve still not explained why you were paying for a room at the hotel rebus stated i thought i had cafferty countered only if you mistake us for halfwits i agree halfwits would be stretching it cafferty gave another chuckle rebus had slipped his hands into his trouser pockets the better to curl them into unseen fists look cafferty went on seeming suddenly to tire of the game i bought a drink for a stranger somebody mugged him end of story not until we know the who and the why rebus corrected him what else did you talk about clarke added cafferty rolled his eyes he said edinburgh was cold i said yes he said glasgow was warmer i said maybe his drink arrived and we both said cheers come to think of it he had something with him what was it a compact disc i think yes the one charles riordan had given him two dead men sharing a curry rebus clenching and unclenching his hands clenching and unclenching cafferty he realised stood for everything that had ever gone sour every bungled chance and botched case suspects missed and crimes unsolved the man wasnt just the grit in the oyster he was the pollutant poisoning everything within reach and theres no way i can take him down is there unless god really was up there handing rebus this last slim chance the disc wasnt on the body clarke was saying he took it with him cafferty stated slipped it into one of his pockets he patted his righthand side meet any other russians in the bar that night rebus asked now you mention it there were some rum accents i thought they must be gaels or something soon as they started with the ceilidh songs i swore id be heading for bed did todorov speak to any of them how should i know because you were with him cafferty slapped both hands against the greasy tabletop one drink i had with him so you say got you rattled again you bastard meaning you were the last person he spoke with before he died clarke reinforced youre saying i followed him put the boot in him fine lets take a look at this cctv of yours lets get the barman in here to say how late i stayed at the bar youve obviously seen my tab what time was it signed for i didnt move from that place until gone midnight room full of witnesses signed bar tab cctv he held up three fingers triumphantly there was silence in ir rebus eased himself from the wall and took the couple of steps which left him standing beside caffertys chair something happened in that bar didnt it he said his voice not much above a whisper sometimes i wish i had your fantasy life rebus i really do there was a sudden knock at the door clarke released the breath shed been holding and called out for whoever it was to come in todd goodyear edged nervously around the door what do you want rebus snapped goodyears eyes were on the gangster but the message was for clarke fire investigators got some news is she here clarke asked in the suite he confirmed fresh blood cafferty drawled measuring goodyear from head to toe whats your name son pc goodyear a police constable out of uniform cafferty smiled cid must be desperate is he your replacement rebus thanks goodyear was all rebus said nodding to let the young man know he was dismissed cafferty however had other ideas used to know a heidtheba called goodyear which one todd goodyear decided to ask caffertys smile turned into a laugh youre right there was old harry used to run a pub on rose street but i was thinking of more recent times solomon goodyear todd stated thats the one caffertys eyes gleamed sol everyone calls him my brother cafferty nodded slowly rebus was gesturing for goodyear to hoof it but caffertys stare held the young man captive now i think of it sol did have a brother never seemed to want to talk about him though does that make you the black sheep pc goodyear he was laughing again tell the fi well be there in a minute clarke interrupted but still goodyear didnt move todd rebuss use of his first name seemed to break the spell goodyear nodded and disappeared around the door again nice kid cafferty mused hell be your pet project then ds clarke for when rebus slopes off into the sunset just like you used to be rebuss when neither detective spoke cafferty decided to quit while he was ahead he stretched his spine arms extended to either side and started getting to his feet we done here for the moment clarke conceded tou dont want me to make a statement or anything wouldnt be worth the paper it was written on rebus growled get all the digs in while you can cafferty advised he was at eye level with his old adversary see you tonight maybe same time same place ill be thinking of you freezing in your car speaking of which it was a nice touch turning off the heating in here itll make my room at the hotel feel all the cosier speaking of the caledonian clarke decided to add you bought a lot of drinks that night eleven according to your tab maybe i was thirsty or just generous his gaze settled on her i can be the generous sort siobhan when the circumstances are right but then you know that already dont you i know a lot of things cafferty oh im sure of that maybe we can talk about them while you give me a lift back into town bus stops across the road rebus said something happened in that bar rebus repeated as he walked with clarke back to the cid suite so you said cafferty was there for a reason hes never squandered so much as a quid in his life so whats he doing booked into one of the dearest hotels in town i doubt hell tell us but his stay happens to coincide with the oligarchs she looked at him and he gave a shrug looked it up in the dictionary thought maybe it had to do with oil it means a small group of powerful people right clarke checked right rebus confirmed thing is john weve also got this woman at the car park cafferty could have put her there hes owned a fair few brothels in his time or she could be nothing to do with it im going to have hawes and tibbet talk to the witnesses see if the efit jogs any memories but meantime theres a more pressing question namely what the hell are you doing running a oneman stakeout on big ger cafferty i prefer vendetta to stakeout she seemed ready to say something but he held up his hand i was outside his place last night as it happens and he was at home so so hes keeping a room at the caledonian but not spending much time there they had arrived at the door to cid and that means hes up to something rebus opened the door and went in katie glass had been given a mug of stronglooking tea and was studying it warily dc tibbet always does that rebus warned her if you want tannin poisoning feel free to drink up i might pass she said placing the mug on the corner of a desk rebus introduced himself and shook her hand clarke thanked her for coming in and asked if shed found something early days glass hedged but rebus nudged knowing there was more we may have a source for the fire small glass bottles filled with a chemical of some kind what kind of chemical clarke asked folding her arms all three were standing while hawes and tibbet listened in from behind their desks todd goodyear was standing by one of the windows staring out rebus wondered if hed been tracking caffertys departure gone for analysis the fire inspector was saying if i had to guess id say maybe it was cleaning fluid of some kind household cleaner glass shook her head bottles were too small but this was a man who had a lot of tapes in his house cassette cleaner rebus stated for wiping oxidation off the heads of the cassette decks impressive glass said i used to have a thing about hifi well at least one of the bottles looks like someone had wadded some tissue into its neck it was sitting in the midst of a pile of melted tape casings in the living room glass nodded so you think it was deliberate now she shrugged thing is if you wanted to kill someone in a fire usually youd go to town slosh petrol around the place that sort of thing this was a couple of sheets of loo roll and a small bottle of something flammable i think i see what youre getting at rebus told her maybe riordan wasnt the target he paused to see if anyone would beat him to it the tapes were he eventually explained the tapes hawes asked forehead creasing piled around the little homemade pyre meaning what exactly that riordan had something somebody wanted or something they didnt want anyone else to have clarke added running a finger beneath her chin is there anything at all left of those tapes katie glass gave another shrug most of the tape itself is done to a crisp some of the casings fared a little better so there could still be writing on them its possible glass conceded weve got a slew of stuff that the fire didnt quite get to dunno how playable any of it will be heat smoke and water may have done their bit weve also got some of the deceaseds recording equipment again the stuff on the hard disks might be salvageable she didnt sound optimistic rebus caught siobhan clarkes eye right up ray duffs street he said goodyear had turned away from the window and was trying to catch up whos ray duff forensics clarke explained but she was focusing on rebus how about the engineer at riordans studio he might be able to help could have kept backups tibbet piped up so glass said folding her arms do i send the stuff here or to forensics or the dead mans studio whatever the answer ill have to keep your d division colleagues in the loop rebus thought for a moment then puffed out his cheeks exhaled noisily and said ds clarkes in charge freddie the barman was on duty again rebus had spent a few minutes outside the caledonian hotel smoking a cigarette and watching the choreography of passing traffic two taxis were parked in the cab rank the drivers chatting to one another the caledonians liveried doorman was giving directions to a couple of tourists the elaborate clock at the corner of frasers department store was being photographed presumably by another tourist there never seemed to be enough rooms in edinburgh for these visitors new hotels were always being proposed considered and constructed he could think of five or six off the top of his head all opening within the past ten years and with more to come it gave the impression of edinburgh as a boomtown more people than ever seemed to want to work there or visit or do business the parliament had brought plenty of opportunities some argued that independence would spoil things others that it would build on the success while dealing with devolutions failings it interested him that a hardnosed executive like stuart janney would cosy up to a nationalist like megan macfarlane but not as much as these russian visitors interested him big place russia and rich in all manner of resources you could drop scotland into it dozens of times over so why were these men here rebus was more than curious he finished the cigarette and headed indoors sliding on to one of the bar stools and offering freddie a reasonably hearty good afternoon for a couple of seconds freddie mistook him for a guest he knew the face after all he placed a coaster in front of rebus and asked what he was having the usual rebus teased enjoying the barmans confusion then he shook his head im the cop from friday but ill take a dram with a spot of water in it so long as its on the house the young man hesitated but eventually turned to the array of spirits bottles a malt mind rebus warned him there was no one else in the bar no one at all bit of a graveyard this time of day im on a double shift the quiet suits me fine the too means we can talk that bit more freely talk weve got the bar tabs from the night that russian came in remember he sat right here and one of your guests bought him a cognac guests name is morris gerald cafferty freddie placed the whisky in front of rebus and filled a small glass jug with tap water rebus dribbled some into the malt and thanked the barman toull know mr cafferty he persisted last time we spoke you pretended you didnt might explain why you tried pulling a flanker telling me todorov couldve been talking russian to the man who bought him the drink cant say i blame you freddie caffertys not a man youd want to get on the wrong side of he paused problem is same goes for me i was confused thats all it was a busy night joseph bonner was in with a party of five lady helen wood at another table with half a dozen friends no problem remembering names now eh freddie rebus gave a smile but its cafferty im interested in i know the gentleman the barman eventually conceded rebuss smile widened maybe its because he gets called gentleman that he stays here wouldnt happen everywhere in the city believe me i know hes been in trouble down the years no secret rebus agreed maybe he mentioned it himself and told you to get a copy of that book about him the one that came out last year freddie couldnt help smiling back gave me a copy actually signed and everything hes generous that way comes in here most days would you say he checked in a week ago due to leave us in a couple of days funny rebus said pretending to concentrate on the contents of his glass that just about coincides with all these russians does it the way freddie said it he knew damned well what rebus was up to can i remind you rebus said voice hardening im looking into a murder two murders actually the night the poet came in here hed just had a meal and a drink with a man whos now turned up dead its getting serious freddie something you need to bear in mind you dont want to say anything fine by me ill just arrange to have a patrol car come and pick you up well put you in cuffs and make you comfortable in one of our excellent cells while we get the interrogation room ready he paused letting it sink in im trying to be nice here freddie doing my best to be things like understated and peoplecentred that can all change he tipped the last of the whisky down his throat get you another the barman asked his way of saying he was going to cooperate rebus shook his head tell me about cafferty he said instead comes in most evenings youre right about the russians if it looks like none of them are coming in he doesnt linger i know he tries the restaurant too has a look around and if theyre not there he wont stay what about if they are there takes a table nearby same thing in here i get the feeling he didnt know them before but he knows some of them now so theyre all friendly and chatty not exactly theyve not got much english but each of them has a translator usually some goodlooking blonde rebus thought back to the day hed seen andropov outside the hotel and the city chambers no glamorous assistant they dont all need a translator he said freddie was nodding mr andropov speaks english fairly fluently which means he probably speaks it better than cafferty i do sometimes get that impression other thing i felt was that maybe they werent strangers when they met what do you mean first time they ran into one another in here it was like they didnt need introductions mr andropov when he shook hands with mr cafferty he sort of gripped his arm at the same time i dunno freddie shrugged just seemed like they knew one another how much do you know about andropov rebus asked freddie shrugged again he tips well never seems to drink very much usually bottles of water he insists on scottish i meant what do you know of his background nothing at all the neither rebus admitted so how many times have cafferty and andropov met ive seen them in here a couple of times the other barman jimmy says he saw them having a chinwag one time too what do they talk about not a clue tou better not be holding back on me freddie im not tou said andropovs english was better than caffertys but not from hearing them in conversation rebus was gnawing away at his bottom lip so what does cafferty talk to you about edinburgh mostly the way it used to be how things have changed sounds riveting nothing about the russians freddie shook his head said the best moment of his life was the day he went legit hes about as legit as a twentyquid rolex ive been offered a few of those in my time the barman mused something i noticed about all the russian gentlemen nice watches tailored suits too but their shoes look cheap i can never understand that people should take better care of their feet he decided rebus merited an explanation my girlfriends a chiropodist the pillow talk must be scintillating rebus muttered staring at the empty room and imagining it full of russian tycoons and their translators and big ger cafferty night the poet was in here he said he just had the one drink with cafferty and then left thats right but what did cafferty do rebus was remembering that bar tab eleven drinks in total freddie thought for a moment i think he stayed for a bit yes he was here till i closed up more or less more or less well he may have nipped to the toilet actually he went over to mr andropovs booth there was another gentleman there a politician i think tou think whenever they come on the telly i turn the sound down but you recognised this man like i say i think hes something to do with the parliament which booth was this the barman pointed and rebus slid from his stool and headed over to it and andropov was where he called move in a bit further yes there from where rebus was now sitting he could only see the nearest end of the bar the stool hed just risen from the one todorov had taken was hidden from view rebus got to his feet again and walked back to freddie you sure youve not got cameras in here we dont need them rebus thought for a moment do me a favour will you he said next time you get a break find a computer theres one in the business centre log on to the scottish parliament website therell be about a hundred and twentynine faces there see if you can match one of them my breaks tend to be twenty minutes rebus ignored this he gave freddie his card call me as soon as youve got a name perfect timing the door was swinging open a couple of suits coming in they looked as though some deal had done them a few favours bottle of krug one of them barked ignoring the fact that freddie was busy with another customer the barmans eyes met rebuss and the detective nodded to let him know he could go back to his job bet theyre not even tippers rebus said under his breath maybe not freddie acknowledged but at least theyll pay for their drinks clarke decided to take the call outside so goodyear wouldnt hear her asking rebus if he was going senile weve already been warned off she said into the phone her voice just above a whisper what grounds have we got for pulling him in anyone willing to drink with cafferty has got to be dodgy she heard rebus explain she gave a sigh she hoped hed hear i dont want you going within a hundred yards of the russian delegation until we have something a bit more concrete you always spoil my fun when you grow up youll understand she ended the call and went back into the cid suite where todd goodyear had plugged in a tape deck borrowed from one of the interview rooms turned out katie glass had been toting a couple of evidence sacks worth of stuff from riordans house goodyear had carried them up from the boot of her car drives a prius hed commented when the bags were opened the smell of burnt plastic filled the room but some of the tapes were intact as were a couple of digital recorders goodyear had slotted a cassette tape home and as clarke walked in through the door he pressed the play button the machine didnt have much of a loudspeaker and they leant down either side of it the better to listen clarke could hear chinks and clinks and distant indistinguishable voices a pub or a cafe or something goodyear commented the hubbub continued for a few more minutes interrupted only by a cough much closer to the microphone riordan presumably clarke offered getting bored she told goodyear to fast forward same location same clutter of the overheard everyday tfou couldnt dance to it goodyear admitted clarke got him to eject the tape and turn it over they appeared to be in a railway station there was the platform masters loud whistle followed by the sound of a train moving off the microphone then headed back to the station concourse where people mingled and waited probably watching the arrivals or departures board someone sneezed and riordan himself said bless you a couple of women were caught in the middle of a conversation about their partners and the mic seemed to follow them as they headed for a food kiosk discussing which filled baguettes took their fancy purchases made it was back to gossiping about their partners again as they queued for coffee at a separate kiosk clarke heard the espresso machine at work a sudden announcement over the station tannoy masking the dialogue she heard the towns inverkeithing and dunfermline being mentioned must be waverley she said could be haymarket goodyear hedged haymarket doesnt have a sandwich bar as such i bow to your superior knowledge even when im wrong you should bow anyway he did so giving a courtierstyle flourish of the hand and she smiled he was obsessive clarke stated goodyear nodding his agreement you really think his death is linked to todorov he asked as of this moment its a coincidence but there are precious few murders in edinburgh now we get two in a matter of days and the victims just happen to know one another meaning you dont really think its coincidence at all thing is joppa is a d division call and were b division if we dont argue our corner leith cid will take it then we should claim it which means persuading dci macrae that theres a connection she stopped the tape and ejected it reckon theyre all going to be like that only one way to find out therell be hundreds of hours of the stuff we dont know that fire could have made a lot of it unlistenable best for one of us to check it first then pass anything difficult on to forensics or the engineer at riordans studio true clarke still didnt share goodyears enthusiasm she was thinking back to her own days in uniform not that long ago really in the span of things shed been every bit as keen as goodyear confident that she would make a difference to each and every case and maybe just now and then a telling difference it had happened sometimes but the glory had been grabbed by someone more senior not rebus she was thinking back to before their pairing her at st leonard s being told that it was all about teamwork no room for egos and prima donnas then rebus had arrived his old station having burned to the ground wiring gone bad she had to have a little smile to herself at that wiring gone bad a fair description of rebus himself at times bringing with him to st leonard s his mistrust of teamwork his twodecadesplus of bets hedged lines crossed and rules broken and at least one very personal vendetta goodyear was suggesting they give one of the little digital recorders a listen there was no external speaker but the headphones from goodyears ipod fitted one of the sockets clarke didnt really fancy pushing the little buds into her own ears so told him he could do the listening but after about half a minute and the pressing of buttons in various configurations he gave up thats one for our friendly specialist he said moving to the next machine i meant to ask clarke said how you felt meeting cafferty goodyear considered his answer just looking at him he said eventually you can see hes full of sin its in his eyes the way he looks at you the way he carries himself you judge people by the way they look not all the time he did a bit more buttonpushing earphones still in place and then held up a finger to let her know he was getting something after a moments listening he made eye contact youre not going to believe this he unplugged himself and offered her the earphones reluctantly she held them either side of her head close to her ears but not touching hed rewound a little and now she heard voices tinny little voices but words she recognised after you split up mr todorov headed straight for the bar at the caledonian he got talking to someone there thats me she said he told us he wasnt recording he lied people do sometimes clarke gave him a scowl and listened to a bit more then told goodyear to fast forward he did but there was silence go back again she ordered what was she hoping for riordans last moments captured for posterity his attackers voice riordan gaining some measure of justice from beyond the grave only silence further back clarke and goodyear himself winding up their questioning of riordan in his living room were the last thing on it she stated does that make us suspects any more wisecracks youre back in the woolly suit she warned him goodyear looked contrite woolly suit he repeated ive not heard that one before picked it up from rebus clarke admitted so many things hed given her not all of them useful i dont think he likes me goodyear was telling her he doesnt like anyone he likes you goodyear argued he tolerates me clarke corrected him different thing entirely she was staring at the machine i cant believe he recorded us if you ask me not being recorded by mr riordan would have put us in the minority true enough goodyear picked up another of the clear plastic sacks and gave it a shake plenty more for us to listen to she nodded then leaned across and patted his shoulder plenty for you to listen to todd she corrected him learning curve he guessed learning curve she agreed want to do something tonight phyllida hawes asked she was driving colin tibbet her passenger it annoyed her that he would sit with one hand gripping the door handle as if ready to eject should her skills suddenly desert her sometimes she would put the wind up him on purpose accelerating towards the vehicle in front or taking a turn at the last possible and unsignalled second serve him right for doubting her one time hed told her she drove as though theyd just nicked the car from a forecourt could go for a drink he offered now theres a novelty or we could not go for a drink he thought for a moment chinese indian with ideas as radical as these col you should be running a brains trust toure in a mood he stated am i she replied icily sorry he said another thing that was starting to annoy her rather than argue his corner hed concede on just about any and every point until eight weeks back hawes had had a lover a livein lover at that colin had managed a few singlenighters and one girl whod actually stuck with him for the best part of a month somehow three weeks ago theyd fallen into bed together after a night on the piss neither had really recovered from it since waking up faces an inch apart horror dawning it was an accident best put behind us and never mentioned forget it ever happened but how could they it had happened and despite herself shed quite like for it to happen again she had transferred her annoyance with herself on to colin in the hope he might do something about it but he was like some sort of sponge just soaking it all up wouldnt surprise me he said now if shiv takes us all for a drink tonight keep the team together its what good managers do what you mean is better that than having john rebus to herself tou may have a point on the other hand hawes added could be shell want young todd all to herself he turned towards her tou dont really think so women work in mysterious ways colin so ive noticed why do you think she brought him on to the team maybe she just fell for his charms seriously though the dcfs put her in charge means she can recruit who she likes and young todd wasnt backwards at coming forwards she was easy to persuade tibbets forehead was creased in thought doesnt mean you can persuade her to put your name forward for promotion thats not what i was thinking tibbet assured her he looked through the windscreen its next right isnt it hawes refused to signal and only crossed the traffic when there was a bus bearing down on them i wish you wouldnt do that tibbet said i know phyllida replied with a thinlipped smile but when youre driving a car youve just nicked from a forecourt they were headed shivs orders to nancy sievewrights flat had to ask her about the woman in the cowl very word shiv had used cowl hawes checking afterwards that she hadnt meant hood hood or cowl phyl whats the difference exactly shiv having grown prickly these past couple of weeks just here on the left colin tibbet was saying theres a space further down which i couldnt possibly have spotted without you dc tibbet to which he gave no reaction whatsoever the door to the communal stairwell had been wedged open so they decided not to bother with the intercom once you crossed the threshold you were in a cold shadowy place the white walltiles had been damaged and now sported graffiti tags voices echoed from somewhere above a woman by far the louder of the two the deeper male bass was softer entreating just get the fuck away from me why cant you take a telling i think you know why i dont fucking well care the couple seemed unaware of the two new arrivals who were climbing towards them the man look if youll only talk to me for a moment interrupted by colin tibbet is there a problem here his id open letting them know who and more importantly what he was christ what now the man uttered in exasperation pretty much what i was asking myself thirty seconds ago sir hawes told him its mr anderson isnt it my partner and i took the statements from you and your wife oh yes anderson had the good grace to look embarrassed hawes saw that one of the doors on the next landing up was wide open that would be nancy sievewrights flat hawes met the eyes of the underfed underdressed girl we interviewed you too nancy she said sievewright nodded her agreement two birds with one stone colin tibbet stated i didnt realise hawes said yu two knew one another we dontv nancy sievewright exploded he just keeps coming here grossly unfair anderson snarled hawes shared a look with tibbet they knew what they had to do lets get you inside hawes told sievewright and if youll come downstairs with me sir tibbet said to anderson theres a question we were hoping to ask you sievewright stomped back into her flat and made straight for the narrow kitchen where she picked up the kettle and filled it the other two i thought they were going to deal with it meaning hawes guessed rebus and clarke why does he keep coming round she asked sievewright tugged at a straggle of hair above one ear no idea says he wants to check im all right but when i tell him i am he conies back again i think he hangs around until he knows im in the flat on my own she twisted the hair into a tighter skein fuck him she said defiantly hunting among the mugs on the drainer for the one least likely to poison her you could make a formal complaint hawes told her explain hes harassing you reckon that would stop him it might hawes said believing it about as much as the girl herself did sievewright had rinsed her chosen mug and now dumped a tea bag into it she patted the kettle willing it to boil social call was it she asked at last hawes rewarded her with a friendly smile not exactly some new informations come to light meaning youve not arrested anybody no hawes admitted so whats this information a woman in a hood seen hanging around the exit to the multistorey hawes showed her the efit if she was still there youd have walked right past her i didnt see anyone ive already told you this easy nancy hawes said quietly calm yourself down im calm the teas a good idea i think the kettles knackered sievewright was resting the palm of her hand against it no its fine hawes reassured her i can hear it sievewright was staring at the kettles reflective surface sometimes we try to see how long we can stay touching it while it boils we the and eddie she gave a sad little smile i always win eddie being my flatmate she looked at the detective were not a couple the front door creaked and they turned to look down the passageway it was colin tibbet hes gone tibbet told them good riddance sievewright muttered did he tell you anything hawes asked her partner seemed adamant neither he nor his wife saw any woman in a hood he asked if maybe it was a ghost of some kind i meant hawes said voice toneless did he say why he was giving nancy here such a hard time tibbet shrugged told me shed had this great shock and he wanted to be sure she wasnt bottling it up storing up trouble for later i think his exact words were sievewright one hand still pressed to the kettle gave a hoot of derision very noble of him hawes said and the fact that his act of charity isnt at all what nancy wants he promised to stay away fat chance sievewright sneered that kettles nearly boiled tibbet felt it necessary to warn her having just noticed what she was doing with her hand he was rewarded with something that was between a grimace and a smile anyone care to join me nancy sievewright offered the headline on page five of the evening news was das kapitalists the story below it recounted a dinner at one of edinburgh s michelinrated restaurants the party of russians had booked the whole place fourteen sat down to a dinner of foie gras scallops lobster veal sirloin cheese and dessert washed down with several thousand pounds worth of champagne white burgundy and venerable red bordeaux finishing with port from before the cold war six grand in total the reporter liked the fact that the champagne roederer cristal had been a favourite with the tsars of prerevolutionary russia none of the diners was identified by name rebus couldnt help wondering if cafferty had slimed his way on to the guest list another story on the page opposite stated that the murder rate was down there had been ten in the past year twelve the year before that they were seated around a large corner table in a rose street pub the place was about to get noisy celtic were readying to kick off against manchester united in the champions league and the bigscreen tv was the focus of most drinkers attentions rebus closed the paper and tossed it back towards goodyear who was seated across from him he realised hed missed the last bit of phyllida hawess story so got her to repeat anderson s words storing up trouble for later ill give him trouble he muttered and he cant say i didnt give him fair warning so far colin tibbet said weve only got one sighting of the mystery woman having noticed that todd goodyear had taken off his tie he was now in the process of removing his own doesnt mean she wasnt there clarke told him even if she played no part she might have seen something theres a line in one of todorovs poems about averting your eyes so youll never have to testify and whats that supposed to mean rebus asked her she could be lying low for a reason people dont always want to get involved sometimes hawes agreed they have good reason not to get involved do we still think nancy sievewrights holding something back clarke asked that friend of hers was definitely spinning us a yarn tibbet said so maybe we need to go over her story again anything so far from those tapes hawes was asking clarke shook her head and gestured towards goodyear just that the deceased liked to listen into peoples conversations he obliged even if it meant following them around bit of a weirdo then one way of looking at it clarke conceded christs sake rebus butted in theres a bigger picture youre not looking at todorovs last stop before ending up dead a drink with big ger cafferty and some of the russians not ten yards away he rubbed a hand across his forehead can i just ask one thing rebus stared at goodyear and whats that young todd dont take the lords name in vain tou taking the piss but goodyear was shaking his head id look on it as a great favour which church do you go to todd tibbet asked st fothads in saughtonhall that where you live where i grew up goodyear corrected tibbet i used to go to the kirk tibbet went on stopped when i was fourteen my mum died from cancer couldnt see the point after that god is the place that always heals over goodyear recited however often we tear it he smiled thats from a poem though not one of todorovs seems to make sense of it all to me at any rate hells teeth rebus said poems and quotations and the church of scotland i dont come to pubs for a sermon toure not alone goodyear told him plenty of scots try to hide their cleverness we dont trust clever people tibbet was nodding were supposed to be all jock tamsons bairns meaning were all the same and not allowed to be different goodyear was nodding back at him see what youre going to miss when you retire clarke said her eyes on rebus intellectual debate im getting out just in time then he started to rise to his feet now if you eggheads will excuse me ive got a tutorial with professor nicotine rose street was busy a hennight pub crawl the women dressed in identical tshirts marked with the words four weddings and a pissup they blew kisses at rebus as they passed him but were then stopped by a crowd of young men heading in the opposite direction a stag do by the look of it the groomtobe spattered with shaving foam eggs and flour office workers eased past on their way home after a couple of bevvies there were tourist families too not sure what to make of the hens and stags and men hurrying to catch the match the door opened behind rebus and todd goodyear stepped out wouldnt have taken you for a smoker rebus told him im headed home goodyear was shrugging himself back into his suit jacket i left cash on the table for the next round prior engagement is it girlfriend whats her name goodyear hesitated but couldnt seem to think of a valid excuse not to tell rebus sonia he said shes one of the socos was she there last wednesday goodyear nodded short blonde hair midtwenties cant place her rebus admitted goodyear looked tempted to take this as an insult but changed his mind tou used to be a churchgoer didnt you he asked instead who told you that just something i heard best not to believe rumours even so i get the feeling im right maybe you are rebus conceded blowing smoke into the air years back i tried a few different churches didnt find any answers goodyear nodded slowly what colin said sums up a lot of peoples experience doesnt it a loved one dies and we blame god is that what happened with you nothing happened with me rebus stated stonily watching the hen party move off in search of its next wateringhole the stags were watching too one or two debating whether to follow sorry goodyear was apologising just nosy well dont be are you going to miss the job rebus rolled his eyes here he goes again he complained to the sky above all i want is a peaceful smoke and now its question time goodyear smiled a further apology i better get going while i still can before you do tes rebus studied the tip of his cigarette cafferty in the interview room was that the first time youd met him goodyear nodded he knew your brother and your grandad too if it comes to that rebus looked up and down the street your grandads pub was the next block wasnt it forget what it was called breezers rebus nodded slowly when he went to court i was the one in the witness box i didnt know that three of us made the bust but i was the one who gave evidence have you ever been in that position with cafferty he got put away both times rebus spat on to the pavement shiv tells me your brother was in a fight is he all right i think so goodyear was looking uncomfortable look id better get going you do that ill see you tomorrow night then night rebus said watching him leave didnt seem a bad kid decent enough cop maybe shiv could do something with him rebus remembered harry goodyear pretty well guys pub had been notorious speed coke and a bit of blow all being shifted from the place harry himself a smalltimer in and out of trouble rebus had wondered at the time how did he get a pub licence reckoned money had changed hands someone on the council pitching for him friends could always be bought time was cafferty himself had owned a number of councillors that way he stayed one step ahead cheap at whatever the price hed tried buying rebus too but that was never going to run rebus had learned his lesson by then not my fault grandpa goodyear died in the clink he stubbed out the cigarette and turned towards the door but then paused what was waiting for him inside another drink plus a table of youngsters shiv phyl and col would be discussing the case bouncing ideas around and what exactly could rebus add to the mix he took out another cigarette and lit it then started walking he took a left on to frederick street and a right into princes street the castle was being illuminated from below its shape picked out against the night sky the funfair was under construction in princes street gardens along with the market stalls and booths parked at the foot of the mound it would be a magnet for shoppers in the runup to christmas he thought he could hear music maybe the openair ice rink was being tested out groups of kids were weaving their way past the shopfronts paying him not the slightest heed when did i become the invisible man rebus asked himself catching his reflection in a window he saw heft and bulk yet these kids teemed past as if he had no place in their version of the world is this how ghosts feel he wondered he crossed at the traffic lights and pushed open the door to the bar of the caledonian hotel the place was busy jazz was playing on the hifi and freddie was busy with a cocktail shaker a waitress was waiting to take her tray of drinks over to a table filled with laughter everyone looked prosperous and confident some of them held mobile phones to their ears even as they spoke to the person next to them rebus felt a moments irritation that someone had taken his stool in fact all the stools were taken he bided his time until the barman had finished pouring the waitress moved off balancing the tray on her hand and freddie saw rebus the frown he gave told rebus that the situation had changed the bar was no longer empty and freddie would be unwilling to talk usual please rebus said anyway and then you werent exaggerating about the double shift this time when the whisky arrived the bill came with it rebus smiled to let freddie know this was fine with him he trickled a few drops of water into the glass and swirled it in his hand sniffing the contents as he scanned the room theyve gone in case youre wondering freddie told him who the russians checked out this afternoon apparently winging their way back to moscow rebus tried not to look too deflated by this news what i was wondering he said is whether youve got that name for me the barman nodded slowly i was going to phone you tomorrow the waitress had arrived with another order and he went to fill it two large helpings of red wine and a glass of the house champagne rebus started listening in on the conversation next to him two businessmen with irish accents eyes glued to the football on the soundless tv some property deal had failed to come off and they were drowning their sorrows and god grant them a lingering death seemed to be the toast of choice one of the things rebus liked best about bars was the chance to eavesdrop on other peoples lives did that make him a voyeur not so very different from charles riordan any chance we get to screw them over one of the irishmen was saying freddie had returned the champagne bottle to the ice bucket and was coming back to rebuss end of the bar hes minister for economic development the barman explained ministers are listed first on the parliaments website mightve taken a while otherwise whats he called james bakewell rebus wondered why he knew the name saw him on the tv a few weeks back freddie was saying on question time rebus guessed the barman was nodding yes because rebus had seen bakewell there too arguing the toss with megan macfarlane while alexander todorov sat between them jim everyone seemed to call him and he was in here with sergei andropov same night as the poet freddie kept nodding and the same night too as morris gerald cafferty rebus rested his hands against the bar letting them take his weight his head was swirling freddie had moved to take another order rebus thought back to the tape of question time jim bakewell had been new labour with some of the rough edges left untreated either he wouldnt let the image consultants near him or that was his image late forties with a mop of dark brown hair and wireframed spectacles squarejawed and blueeyed and selfdeprecating hed got a lot of respect north of the border for the way hed resigned a safe seat at westminster to stand for the scottish parliament this made him a rare beast indeed seemed to rebus that a lot of the political talent was still drawn to london freddie hadnt mentioned any minders which rebus also found interesting if bakewell had been meeting the russians in an official capacity surely thered have been assistants and advisers on hand the minister for economic development latenight drinks with a foreign businessman big ger cafferty crashing the party too many questions were hammering away at the inside of rebuss skull it was as if his brain had developed a pulse finishing the drink he left some money on the bar and decided it was time to head home his phone alerted him to a text message siobhan was wondering where hed got to took you long enough he muttered to himself as he passed the irishmen one of them was leaning in towards the other if he dies on christmas morning he was confiding in a booming voice thatll be tinsel enough for me two ways to leave the hotel the bars own door or through reception rebus wasnt sure why he chose the latter as he crossed the lobby two men had just emerged through the revolving door the one in front he recognised the man whod been driving andropov the other was andropov himself he had seen rebus and his eyes were narrowing wondering where he knew him from rebus gave a little bow of the head as they approached one another thought youd all gone home he said trying to sound casual im staying a few more days there wasnt much of an accent at all rebus could tell andropov was still trying to place him friend of caffertys he pretended to explain ah yes the chauffeur was standing just the other side of rebus hands clasped in front of him feet splayed chauffeur and bodyguard the few extra days rebus enquired of andropov business or pleasure usually i find business a distinct pleasure it sounded like a line hed used dozens of times before always expecting a laugh or a smile rebus obliged as best he could seen mr cafferty today he asked eventually im sorry i seem to have forgotten your name im john rebus told him and your connection to cafferty i was wondering the same about you mr andropov rebus decided hed already been rumbled its fine to hobnob with the great and the good being fawned over by politicians of all creeds and colours but when you start cosying up to a career criminal like cafferty alarm bells are bound to start ringing tfou were at the city chambers andropov announced with a wag of one gloved finger and then you were outside the hotel here im a detective mr andropov rebus held up his warrant card and andropov examined it have i done something wrong inspector a week back you were having a little chat with jim bakewell and morris gerald cafferty what if i was there was another man in the bar a poet called todorov less than twenty minutes after walking out of here he was murdered andropov was nodding a great tragedy the world has an apparent need of poets inspector they are so they tell us its unacknowledged legislators id say theyve got a bit of competition in that department andropov decided to ignore this several people he said instead inform me that your police force may not be investigating alexanders death as a simple street attack tell me inspector what do you think happened a story best told at my police station would you be willing to drop in for an interview mr andropov i cant see that anything would be gained from that inspector ill assume thats a no let me offer my own theory andropov took a step closer mimicked by his driver cherchez la femme inspector meaning what exactly tou dont speak french i know what it means im just not sure what youre getting at in moscow alexander todorov had something of a reputation he was forced to leave his teaching post after accusations of improper conduct female students you know and apparently the younger the better now if youll excuse me andropov was obviously heading for the bar hooking up with your gangster friend again rebus guessed andropov ignored him and kept walking the driver however decided that rebus merited a final baleful look the kind that said you me and a dark alley the look rebus gave him back carried another message no less threatening youre on my list pal you and your boss both outside once again in the crisp night air he decided he might try walking home his heart was pounding mouth dry blood coursing through him he gave it a few hundred yards then hailed the first taxi he saw day six wednesday november the sound engineer was called terry grimm and the secretary was hazel harmison they seemed shellshocked and with good reason weve no idea what to do grimm explained i mean do we get paid at months end what do we do about all the jobs weve got on our books siobhan clarke nodded slowly grimm was seated at the mixing desk swivelling nervily on his chair harmison was standing by her desk arms folded im sure mr riordan will have made some kind of provision but clarke wasnt sure of that at all todd goodyear was staring at all the machinery the banks of knobs and dials switches and slider controls in the pub last night hawes had hinted that really it should be either her or tibbet who accompanied clarke today it made siobhan wonder again if shed brought goodyear into the team precisely because she didnt want to have to make that choice can neither of you sign company cheques clarke asked now charlie wasnt that trusting hazel harmison piped up the company accountants the one to speak to except hes on holiday someone else at his firm then oneman band grimm stated im sure itll all work out clarke remarked crisply shed had enough of their bellyaching reason were here is some of mr riordans recordings have been salvaged from the house most however went up in smoke im wondering if he kept copies might be some in the storeroom grimm conceded i was always warning that he didnt back up enough he met her eyes the hard disks didnt make it mostly not weve brought some stuff with us wondered if maybe youd have better luck than us grimm gave a shrug i can take a look clarke handed her car keys to goodyear fetch up the bags she said the phone had started ringing and harmison picked it up cr studios how can i help you she listened for a moment no im sorry she began to apologise we cant take on any new work at the moment due to unforeseen circumstances clarke still had the engineers attention you could go it alone she told him quietly i mean the two of you glancing towards harmison he nodded and got up walked over to the desk and gestured for the telephone one moment please harmison said into the mouthpiece im just going to hand you over to mr grimm how can i help terry grimm asked the caller harmison wandered over towards clarke her arms folded again as if to form a shield against further blows first time i was here clarke said terry hinted that mr riordan recorded everything the secretary nodded one time the three of us went out for dinner they brought something we hadnt ordered charlie pulled this little recorder from his pocket and played it back to the staff proving it was them to blame she was smiling at the memory thereve been times id have done the same clarke acknowledged the too plumbers who promise to be there at eleven people on the phone who say the cheques in the post clarke was smiling now too but harmisons face fell again i feel so sorry for terry hes worked every bit as hard as charlie probably put in more hours truth be told what sort of work have you got on just now radio ads couple of audio books plus editing the parliament project what parliament project you know they have a festival of politics every year i didnt actually had to happen weve got festivals for everything else this coming year theres an artist theyve commissioned to put something together he works in video and so on and he wanted a sound collage to go with whatever it is hes doing so youve been taping stuff at the parliament hundreds of hours of it harmison nodded towards the battery of machines but grimm was clicking his fingers gaining her attention ill just put my assistant back on he was telling the caller and shell fix up a meeting harmison fairly trotted towards the desk and the appointments diary clarke reckoned it was his use of assistant that had done it no longer a mere secretary or receptionist grimm was nodding in gratitude as he approached clarke thanks for the tip he said hazel was just telling me about the festival of politics grimm turned his eyes heavenwards what a nightmare artist hadnt a clue what he wanted bounces around between geneva and new york and madrid wed get the occasional email or fax get me some sounds of a debate but make sure its heated all the meetings of one of the committees some of the guided tours interviews with visitors hed be vague as hell then tell us we hadnt done what he wanted luckily we kept all his emails and of course charlie would have taped any meetings or phone calls how did you guess hazel told me well our artist friend loved that i mean not everyone likes it when they find out theyve been secretly taped i can imagine clarke drawled but he thought it was hysterical sounds like a big project though nearly done i put together two hours of collage and so far he seems to like it plans to use it with some video installation at the parliament building grimm gave a shrug which seemed to sum up his attitude to artists whats his name roddy denholm and hes not based in scotland has a flat in the new town but never seems to be there the intercom buzzed letting them know goodyear was back with the spools of tape and the digital recorders what is it you think we might get from them grimm asked staring at the polythene sacks as goodyear placed them on the floor to be honest im not sure clarke admitted hazel harmison had finished making the appointment and was now staring in morbid fascination at the sacks shed folded her arms once more but it wasnt proving at all effective did you make the appointment for today or tomorrow grimm asked her hoping to divert her attention midday tomorrow this recording youve been doing at the parliament clarke asked grimm you said youd been taping one of the committees mind if i ask which one urban regeneration he stated not exactly a cauldron of human drama believe me i believe you clarke told him interesting all the same so was it you doing the actual recording rather than mr riordan both of us that committees chaired by megan macfarlane isnt it how do you know that you might say ive got an interest in politics mind if i take a listen to the urban regeneration committee he sounded nonplussed youve gone beyond an interest in politics sergeant she took the bait and into what masochism he stated turning towards the mixing desk gill morgan rebus asked into the intercom he was standing outside a door on great stuart street cars rumbled across the setts taking drivers and passengers to queen street and george street the morning rush hour wasnt quite over and rebus had to lean down ear pressed to the intercoms loudspeaker to make out the eventual reply what is it the voice sounded bleary sorry if i woke you rebus pretended to apologise im a police officer a few followup questions regarding miss sievewright youve got to be joking bleary and irritated wait till you hear the punchline but shed missed that the setts sending tremors through a lorry rather than repeat himself rebus just asked to be let in i need to get dressed he repeated the request and the buzzer sounded he pushed open the door into the communal stairwell and climbed the two nights shed left her door ajar for him but he gave a knock anyway wait in the living room she called presumably from her bedroom rebus could see the living room it was at the end of a wide hall the sort that often got called a dining hallway meaning you were supposed to have a table there and entertain your friends to supper rather than have them traipse all over your actual living room it seemed to him a very edinburgh thing welcoming but not very the living room itself boasted stark white walls to complement stark white furniture it was like walking into an igloo the floorboards had been stripped and varnished and he concentrated on them for a moment trying to avoid becoming snowblind it was a big room with a high ceiling and two huge windows he couldnt imagine that gill morgan shared with anyone the place was too tidy there was a flatscreen tv on the wall above the fireplace and no ornaments anywhere it was like the rooms in the sunday newspaper supplements the ones designed to be photographed rather than lived in sorry about that a young woman said walking into the room i realised after id let you in that you could be anybody the officers the other day carried id can i see yours rebus got out his warrant card and as she studied it so he studied her she was tiny almost elfinlike probably not even five feet tall and with a pointy little face and almondshaped eyes brown hair tied into a ponytail and arms the thickness of pipe cleaners hawes and tibbet had said she was a model of some kind rebus found that hard to believe werent models supposed to be tall satisfied with his credentials morgan had sunk into a white leather armchair tucking her legs beneath her so how can i help you detective inspector she asked hands clasped to her knees my colleagues said you have a modelling career miss morgan must be going well for you he made show of admiring the living rooms proportions im moving into acting actually really rebus tried to sound interested most people would have responded to his original question by asking what business it was of his but not gill morgan in her universe talking about herself came naturally ive been taking classes would i have seen you in anything probably not yet she preened but theres some screen work on the horizon screen work thats impressive rebus lowered himself on to the chair opposite her just a small part in a television drama morgan seemed to feel the need to play down the significance no doubt in the hope that hed think she was being modest exciting all the same he told her playing along and it probably helps explain something weve been wondering about now she looked puzzled oh when my colleagues spoke to you they could see you were trying to feed them a line fact that you say youre an actor explains why you thought youd get away with it he leaned forward as if to take her into his confidence but heres the thing miss morgan were now investigating two murders and that means we cant afford to get sidetracked so before you get into serious trouble maybe you should own up morgans lips were the same pale colour as her cheeks her eyelids fluttered and for a moment he thought she might faint i dont know what you mean she said i wouldnt give up those lessons just yet looks to me like youve got a few things to learn about delivering a line the bloods left your face your voice is shaking and youre blinking like youve been caught in someones headlights rebus sat back again hed been here five minutes but he thought he could read the whole of gill morgans life in what hed seen of her so far cushy upbringing parents who poured money and love over her schooled in the art of confidence and never having faced a challenge she couldnt sweet talk her way out of until now lets take it slowly he said in a softening voice ease you into it how did you meet nancy at a party i think tou think id been to a few bars with some friends we ended up at this party and i cant remember if nancy was already there or if shed somehow attached herself to the group along the way rebus nodded his understanding how long ago was this three or four months around festival time im guessing the two of you come from different backgrounds absolutely so what did you find in common she didnt seem to have a ready answer i mean something must have helped you bond shes just good fun why do i get the feeling youre lying again is it the shaky voice or the fluttering eyelids morgan leapt to her feet i dont have to answer any of your questions do you know who my mother is wondered how long it would take rebus said with a satisfied smile go on then impress me he clasped his hands behind his head shes the wife of sir michael addison meaning hes not your actual father my father died when i was twelve and you kept his surname colour had flooded back into the young womans cheeks shed decided to sit down again but keeping her feet on the floor this time rebus unclasped his hands and rested them on the chair arms so whos sir michael addison he asked chief executive of first albannach bank a useful sort to know im guessing he rescued my mother from alcoholism morgan stated eyes boring into rebuss and he loves both of us very much nice for you but it doesnt help the poor sod who ended up dead on kings stables road your friend nancy found the body then lied to us about where shed been heading home from she gave your name gill and your address meaning she must think youre one hell of a friend the kind whod go to jail on her behalf rather than tell the truth he didnt realise his voice had risen but when he stopped there was a moments reverberation from the walls you think your stepdad would want you doing that gill he went on voice softening again you think your poor mum would want that gill morgan had bowed her head and seemed to be analysing the backs of her hands no she said quietly no rebus agreed now tell me if i were to ask you right now where nancy lives could you give me an answer a single tear dropped into the young womans lap she squeezed her eyes with thumb and forefinger then blinked any further tears back somewhere off the cowgate doesnt sound to me rebus said as if you really know her all that well so if the two of you arent what you might call bosom buddies why are you covering for her morgan said something he didnt catch he asked her to repeat it she glared at him and this time the words were unmistakable she was buying me drugs she let the words sink in buying us drugs i should say some for her and some for me just a bit of pot nothing to send civilisation crashing to its knees is that how you became friends i dare say its part of the reason but morgan couldnt really see the point of lying maybe quite a lot of the reason the party you met her at she brought dope with her tes was she sharing or selling were not talking about some medellin cartel here inspector cocaine too rebus deduced morgan realised shed said too much and you had to protect her because otherwise she was going to pardon the pun grass you up is that the punchline you were talking about i didnt think youd heard that i heard so nancy sievewright wasnt here that night she was supposed to turn up at midnight with my share it annoyed me at the time because id had to rush home where from ive been helping out one of my drama teachers he has a sideline running one of those nighttime walking tours of the city ghost tours you mean i know theyre preposterous but the tourists like them and its a bit of a giggle so youre one of the actors jumping out from the shadows and going boo i have to play several roles actually she sounded hurt by his glibness and between setups i have to run like blazes to the next location changing costume as i go rebus remembered gary walsh saying something about the ghost tours where does it happen he asked now st giles to the canongate same route each night do you know of any tours that take in kings stables road no rebus nodded thoughtfully so who exactly do you play she gave a puzzled laugh why the interest indulge me she puckered her lips well she said at last im the plague doctor i have to wear a mask like a hawks beak the doctor would fill it with potpourri to ward off the stench from his patients nice and then im a ghost and sometimes even the mad monk mad monk bit of a challenge for a woman isnt it i only have to do a bit of moaning and groaning yes but they can see youre not a bloke the hood covers most of my face she explained smiling again hood rebus echoed i wouldnt mind having a look at that the costumes stay with the company inspector that way when one actors off sick they can use another as cover rebus nodded as if satisfied by the explanation tell me he asked did nancy ever come to see you perform a couple of weeks back enjoy herself did she seemed to she gave another nervy little laugh am i walking into some trap here i cant see what any of this has to do with your case probably nothing rebus assured her morgan grew thoughtful youre going to talk to nancy now arent you shell know ive told you afraid you may be in the market for another supplier miss morgan shouldnt worry though there are plenty of them about rebus got to his feet she followed suit standing on tiptoe and still below the height of his chin is there she swallowed back the rest of the question but decided she had to know is there any reason why my mother might get to hear of this depends really rebus said after a moments pretend thought we catch the killer it comes to trial the timeline is gone through minute by minute defence is going to want some doubt in the jurys minds and that means showing any witnesses to be less than trustworthy they show nancy s original statement to be a pile of dung and it all starts to smell from then on in he gazed down at her thats the worstcase scenario he offered might never happen which is another way of saying it might tou should have told the truth from the start gill lying is all very well for an actor but out here in the real world we tend to call it perjury im not sure i can take all this in siobhan clarke admitted they were gathered in the cid suite clarke was pacing up and down in front of the murder wall she passed by photos of alexander todorov in life and in death a photocopied pathology report names and phone numbers rebus was polishing off a ham salad sandwich washed down with polystyrene tea hawes and tibbet sat at their desks swaying gently in their chairs as if in time to a piece of music only they could hear todd goodyear was sipping milk from a halflitre carton want me to recap for you rebus offered gill morgans stepdad runs first albannach she buys drugs from nancy sievewright and she has ready access to a hooded cape he shrugged as if it was no big deal oh and sievewright knew about the cape too we need to bring her in clarke decided phyl col go fetch they managed a synchronised nod as they rose from their chairs what if shes not there tibbet asked find her clarke demanded yes boss he said sliding his jacket back on clarke was glaring at him but rebus knew tibbet hadnt been trying for sarcasm hed called her boss because that was what she was she seemed to sense this and glanced towards rebus he balled up the wrapper from his sandwich and missed the wastebin by about three feet she doesnt seem like a dealer to me clarke said maybe shes not rebus responded maybe shes just a friend who likes to share but if she charges for that share goodyear argued doesnt that make her a dealer he had walked over to the wastebin and picked up rebuss wrapper making sure it found its target rebus wondered if the young man was even aware that hed done it so if she wasnt at gill morgans flat that night where was she clarke asked while were adding ingredients to the broth rebus interrupted heres another for you barman at the hotel saw andropov and cafferty with another man the night todorov was murdered the man in question is a labour minister called jim bakewell he was on question time clarke stated rebus nodded slowly hed decided not to mention his own runin with andropov at the caledonian did he talk to the poet clarke asked i dont think so cafferty bought todorov a drink at the bar then when the poet hoofed it he went and joined andropov and bakewell at their table i sat where theyd been sitting theres a blind spot doubtful andropov saw todorov coincidence goodyear offered weve not much room for that in cid rebus told him doesnt that mean you often see connections where none exist everythings connected todd six degrees of separation they call it idve thought a biblethumper would concur ive never thumped a bible in my life tou should try it good way of letting off steam when you two boys have quite finished clarke chided them tfou want us to talk to this bakewell character she asked rebus at this rate wed be as well precognosing the whole parliament goodyear stated how do you mean rebus asked so then it was their turn to tell him about their morning roddy denholms project and the urban regeneration committee recordings as if to prove the point goodyear held up a box of dat tapes now if only we had a player he said ones on its way from howdenhall clarke reminded him hours and hours of fun he muttered laying the small cassettes out in a row across the desk in front of him he stood them on their sides as if attempting to build a run of dominoes i think the allure of cid is beginning to wane rebus suggested to clarke tou could be right she agreed giving the desk a nudge so that the tape cases fell over think we need to talk to megan macfarlane again was rebuss next question on what grounds that she probably knew riordan funny she has links to both the victims clarke was nodding without looking entirely convinced this case is a bloody minefield she eventually groaned turning back to the murder wall rebus noticed for the first time that a photo of charles riordan had been added to the collection a single killer he suggested let me just go ask the ouija board she shot back not in front of the children rebus teased her goodyear had found a biscuit wrapper on the floor and was tidying it into the bin weve got cleaners to do that todd rebus reminded him then to siobhan clarke one killer or two i really dont know close enough the correct answer should be doesnt matter all thats important at this stage is that were treating the two deaths as connected she nodded her agreement macraes going to want the team enlarged the more the merrier but when her eyes drilled into his he could see she wasnt confident shed never led a fullscale inquiry before the death at the g last year had been kept lowkey so as not to grab headlines but once the media got to hear that they were dealing with a double murder theyd be resetting their front pages and demanding plenty of action and a quick result macraes going to want a di heading it up clarke stated rebus wished goodyear wasnt there the pair of them could talk properly he shook his head make your case he said if youve anyone in mind for the team tell him that way you get the people you want ive already got the people i want aww isnt that sweet but what the public needs to hear is that theres a twentystrong force of detectives prowling the badlands hot on the villains scent five of us in a room in gayfield square doesnt have the same ring to it five was enough for enid blyton clarke said with a thin smile worked for scooby doo too goodyear added only if you include the dog clarke corrected him then to rebus so who do i start annoying first macrae macfarlane or jim bakewell go for the hattrick he told her the phone on his desk started ringing and he picked it up di rebus he announced to the caller he pursed his lips gave a couple of grunts in response to whatever was being said and let the receiver clatter back into its cradle the chiefs are demanding a sacrifice he explained hauling himself to his feet james corbyn chief constable of lothian and borders police was waiting for rebus in his office on the second floor of the fettes avenue hq corbyn was in his early forties a parting in his black hair and a face that shone as though freshly shaved and cologned people usually paid too much attention to the chief constables grooming as a way of not staring at the oversized mole on his right cheek officers had noticed that when interviewed on tv he always stayed rightofscreen so that the other side of his face would be in profile there had even been discussion as to whether the blemish most resembled the coastline of fife or a terriers head his initial nickname of trouser press had soon been supplanted by the more telling mole man which rebus seemed to think was also the name of a cartoon villain hed met corbyn only three or four times never so far for a pat on the back or a congratulatory handshake nothing hed heard over the phone had suggested a change of script this time round in you come then corbyn himself snapped having opened his door just wide enough to stick his head around by the time rebus rose from the corridors only chair and pushed the door all the way open corbyn was back behind his large and unfeasibly tidy desk there was a man seated across from the chief constable he was bulky and balding with an overfed face tinged pink by hypertension he rose up just long enough to shake rebuss hand introducing himself as sir michael addison she works fast your stepdaughter rebus told the banker and addison was no slouch himself no more than ninety minutes since rebus had left gill morgans flat and here they all were nice to have friends isnt it gills explained everything addison was saying seems shes fallen in with a bad lot but her mother and i will deal with that her mother knows does she rebus decided to probe were hoping that may not be necessary wouldnt want her falling off the wagon rebus agreed the banker seemed stunned by this corbyn took the silence as his cue look john i cant see what youve got to gain from pressing the point his use of rebuss first name was a message that they were all on the same side here what point might that be sir rebus asked refusing to play along you know what i mean young girls are susceptible maybe gill was scared to tell the truth because shed be losing her supplier rebus pretended to guess he turned towards addison the friends called nancy sievewright by the way mean anything to you ive never met her one of your colleagues has though name of roger anderson seems he cant keep away from her i know roger addison admitted he was there when that poets body was found found by nancy sievewright rebus stressed and does any of this corbyn broke in really concern gill she lied to a murder inquiry and now shes told you the truth corbyn pressed surely thats good enough not really sir he turned to addison heres another name for you stuart janney yes he works for you too he works for the bank rather than for me personally and spends his days hanging out with msps and trying to protect dodgy russians now wait a minute addison s fleshy face had gone from pink to red highlighting razorrash at the neck ive just been talking with my colleagues rebus ploughed on about how everythings connected country the size of scotland city as small as edinburgh you start to see the truth of it your banks hoping to do some big deals with the russians isnt it maybe you took some time out of your busy schedule for a round of golf with them at gleneagles stuart janney making sure everything went smoothly i really dont see what any of this has to do with my stepdaughter might be a bit embarrassing if it turns out shes linked to the todorov murder doesnt matter how many degrees of separation you try to make out there are she leads straight to you straight to the top of fab dont suppose andropov and his pals will be too thrilled with that corbyn banged his fists against the table eyes like burning coals addison was shaking levering himself to his feet this was a mistake he was saying i blame myself for not wanting to see her hurt michael corbyn started to say but then broke off having nothing with which to finish the sentence i notice your stepdaughter hasnt taken your surname sir rebus said doesnt stop her asking for favours though does it and that lovely apartment of hers owned by the bank is it addison s overcoat and scarf were hanging on a peg behind the door and that was his destination an appeal to common decency thats all the banker was saying more to himself than anyone else hed managed to get one arm into a sleeve but was struggling with the other nevertheless his need to get out was too great and the coat was hanging off him as he left the door stayed open corbyn and rebus were on their feet facing one another that seemed to go well rebus commented youre a bloody fool rebus what happened to john reckon hell hike your mortgage just out of spite hes a good man and a personal friend corbyn spat and his stepdaughter is a lying druguser rebus offered a shrug like they say you cant choose your family you can however choose your friends but fabs friends seem to be a fairly rum bunch too first albannach is one of the few bloody success stories this country has corbyn erupted again doesnt make them the good guys i suppose you opt to see yourself as the good guy corbyn let out a jagged laugh christ youve got a nerve was there anything else sir maybe a neighbour who wants cid to focus its scant resources on the theft of a garden gnome just one last thing corbyn had seated himself again his next three words were spaced evenly you are history thanks for the reminder i mean it i know youve got three days left till retirement but youre going to spend them on suspension rebus stared hard at the man isnt that just a tiny bit petty and pathetic sir in which case youre going to love the rest of it corbyn took a deep breath if i hear youve so much as crossed the threshold at gayfield square ill demote each and every officer within your compass what i want you to do rebus is crawl away from here and tick off the days on the calendar youre no longer a serving detective and never will be he held out the palm of one hand warrant card please want to fight me for it only if youre ready to spend time in the cells i think we could hold you for three days without too much trouble the hand twitched inviting rebuss cooperation i can think of at least three chief constables before me who would love to be here right now corbyn cooed the too rebus agreed wed get a barbershop quartet going and sing about the fuckwit sitting in front of us and that corbyn added triumphantly is the reason youre being suspended rebus couldnt believe the hand was still there you want my warrant card he said quietly send the boys round for it he turned and headed for the door there was a secretary standing there clutching a file to her chest eyes and mouth gawping rebus confirmed with a nod that her ears had not deceived her and mouthed the word fuckwit just to be on the safe side outside in the car park he unlocked his saab but then stood there hand on the door handle staring into space for a while now hed known the truth that it wasnt so much the underworld you had to fear as the overworld maybe that explained why cafferty had to all purposes and appearances gone legit a few friends in the right places and deals got done fates decided never in his life had rebus felt like an insider from time to time hed tried during his years in the army and his first few months as a cop but the less he felt he belonged the more he came to mistrust the others around him with their games of golf and their quiet words their stitchups and handshakes palmgreasing and scratching of backs stood to reason someone like addison would go straight to the top hed done it because he could because in his world it felt entirely justified and correct rebus had to admit though hed underestimated corbyn hadnt expected him to pull that particular trick kicked into touch until goldwatch day fuckwit he said out loud this time aiming the word at no one but himself that was that then end of the line end of the job these past weeks hed been trying so hard not to think about it throwing himself into other work any work dusting off all those old unsolveds trying to get siobhan interested as if she didnt have more than enough on her plate in the here and now a situation unlikely to change in the future the alternative was to take the whole lot home with him call it his retirement gift something to keep his brain active when the idea of the pub didnt appeal for three decades now this job of his had sustained him and all it had cost him was his marriage and a slew of friendships and shattered relationships no way he was ever going to feel like a civilian again too late for that too late for him to change he would become invisible to the world not just to revelling teenagers fuck he said drawing the word out way past its natural length it was the casual arrogance that had flipped his switch addison sitting there in the full confidence of his power and the stepdaughters arrogance too in thinking one weepy phone call would make everything better it was rebus realised how things worked in the overworld addison had never woken from a beating in a pissstained tenement stairwell his stepdaughter had never worked the streets for money for her next fix and the kids dinner they lived in another place entirely no doubt part of the buzz gill morgan got from mixing with the likes of nancy sievewright the same buzz corbyn got from having one of the most powerful men in europe come to him with a favour the same buzz cafferty got buying drinks for businessmen and politicians cafferty unfinished business and likely to remain that way if rebus heeded corbyns orders cafferty unfettered free to commute between underworld and overworld unless rebus went back indoors right now and apologised to the chief constable promising to toe the line the scrapheaps hurtling towards me as it is give me this one last chance please sir please aye right rebus said yanking open the car door and stabbing the key into the ignition nancy were going to record this okay sievewrights mouth twitched do i need a lawyer do you want a lawyer dunno clarke nodded for goodyear to switch on the deck shed slotted home both tapes herself one for them and one for sievewright but goodyear was hesitating and clarke had to remind herself that hed not done this sort of thing before interview room felt stuffy and sweltering as if it was sucking all the heat from the rooms around it the central heating pipes hissed and gurgled and couldnt be turned down even goodyear had taken off his jacket and there were damp patches beneath his arms yet ir two doors along was freezing maybe because ir was keeping all the heat to itself that one and that one she explained pointing to the relevant buttons he pressed them the red light came on and both tapes started running clarke identified herself and goodyear her final few words drowned by the scrape of his chair as he drew it in towards the desk he gave a little grimace of apology and she repeated herself then asked sievewright to state her name before adding date and time to the recording formalities done with she sat back a little in her chair the todorov file was in front of her autopsy photo uppermost she had padded the file itself with blank sheets of copy paper to make it seem more impressive and perhaps more threatening goodyear had nodded admiringly same went for the postmortem photo plucked from the murder wall to remind sievewright of the grim seriousness of the case the young woman certainly looked unnerved hawes and tibbet had explained nothing of their appearance at her door and had kept tightlipped during the drive to gayfield square sievewright had then been left in ir for the best part of forty minutes without any offer of tea or water and when clarke and goodyear had come in theyd both been carrying a fresh brew even though goodyear himself had insisted he wasnt thirsty for effect clarke had told him next to the file on the table sat clarkes mobile phone and next to that a pad of paper and a pen goodyear too was bringing out a notebook now then nancy clarke began want to tell us what you were really up to the night you found the victim what sievewrights mouth stayed open long after the question had left it the night you were out at your friends flat clarke made show of consulting the file gill morgan her eyes met sievewrights tour good friend gill tes your story was that youd been round to her flat and were on your way home but that was a lie wasnt it no well somebodys lying to us nancy whats she been saying the voice taking on a harder edge were led to believe nancy that you were on your way to her flat not from it did you have the drugs on you when you tripped over the body what drugs the ones you were going to share with gill shes a lying cow i thought she was your friend enough of a friend to stick to the story you gave her shes lying sievewright repeated eyes reduced to slits why would she do that nancy why would a friend do that toud have to ask her we already have thing is her story fits with other facts in the case a woman was seen hanging around outside the car park i already told you i never saw her maybe because you were her i look nothing like that picture you showed me see she was offering herself for sex and we know why some women will do that dont we do we money for drugs nancy what you needed the money to buy drugs you could sell on to gill shed already given me the money you dozy cow clarke didnt bother replying just waited for nancy s outburst to sink in the teenagers face crumpled and she knew shed said more than she should what i mean is she stumbled but the lie wouldnt come gill morgan gave you money to buy her some dope clarke stated to be honest with you and this is for the record i couldnt give a monkeys doesnt sound to me like youre some bigshot dealer if you had been youd have scarpered that night rather than sticking around to wait for us but that makes me think you didnt have anything on you at the time which means you were either waiting to score or on your way to score yes i wouldnt mind knowing which it was the second one on your way to meet your dealer sievewright just nodded nancy sievewright nods clarke said for the benefit of the slowly spooling tapes so you werent hanging around outside the car park i already said didnt i just want to make sure clarke made show of turning to another page in the file ms morgan has ambitions to be an actress she stated teah ever seen her in anything dont think shes been in anything tou sound sceptical first she was going to write for the papers then it was tv presenting then modelling what we might call a gadfly clarke agreed tou call it what you want must be fun though hanging out with her she gets good invites sievewright admitted but she doesnt always take you with her clarke guessed not often sievewright shifted in her chair i forget how did you two meet at a party in the new town got talking to one of her pals in a pub and he said i could tag along with them you know who gills father is i know he must have a few quid he runs a bank figures clarke turned to another sheet of paper really she wanted rebus there so she could bounce ideas off him and let him do some of the running while she collected her thoughts between rounds todd goodyear looked stiff and uncertain and was gnawing away at his pen like a beaver with a particularly juicy length of timber she works on one of the citys ghost tours did you know that clarke asked eventually can i get a drink or something were nearly done sievewright scowled like a kid on the verge of a major sulk clarke repeated her question she took me along with her one time the teenager admitted how was it sievewright shrugged okay i suppose bit boring really tou werent scared the question received a snorted response clarke closed the file slowly as if winding up but she had a few more questions she waited until sievewright was readying to get up before asking the first of them remember the cloak gill wears what cloak when shes being the mad monk what about it ever seen it at her flat no has she ever been to your flat came to a party once clarke pretended to spend a few moments considering this you know im not going to be chasing you for drugs offences nancy but i wouldnt mind knowing your dealers address no chance the teenager sounded adamant she was still poised to get up in her mind she was already leaving meaning shed want to give quick answers to any further questions clarke rapped her fingernails against the closed file but you know him pretty well says who im guessing you had some dope on you at that first party explains how you made friends so quickly so so youre not going to give me a name bloody right im not how did you meet him through a friend tour flatmate the one with the eyeliner none of your business the day i was there quite an aroma was wafting from the living room sievewright stayed tightlipped tou in touch with your parents nancy the question seemed to throw the young woman dad did a runner when i was ten and your mum lives in wardieburn not the citys most salubrious neighbourhood see her much is this turning into a social work interview clarke smiled indulgently had any more trouble from mr anderson not yet tou think hell be back he better think twice funny thing is he works for gills dads bank so what gills never taken you to any of their parties no possibility mr anderson could have met you there no sievewright stated clarke let the silence linger then leaned back in her chair and placed her palms on the tabletop again just to be clear youre not a prostitute and hes not one of your clients sievewright glared at her forming some sort of comeback clarke didnt give her the chance i think thats us then she said i want to thank you for coming in didnt have much choice sievewright complained interview ends at clarke checked the time announced it for the benefit of the recorder then switched the machine off and ejected both tapes sealing them in separate polythene bags she handed one to sievewright thanks again the young woman snatched the bag pc goodyear will see you out do i get a lift home what are we a taxi service sievewright gave a curl of the lip letting clarke know what she thought of that goodyear led her outside while clarke gave a twitch of her head to let him know shed see him upstairs once the door was closed clarke lifted her phone to her ear tou caught all of that pretty much rebuss voice said she could hear him lighting up this is going to cost us both a fortune in phone bills that depends on where you do the interviews he told her anywhere outside the station i can sit in its only gayfield itself corbyn told me to avoid clarke slipped the cassette tape into the file and tucked it under her arm do you think i got everything i could out of her she asked tou did fine it was good to leave some of the big questions till the end had me wondering if you were going to remember to ask them did i leave anything out not that i can think of she was out in the corridor now glad to find it about eight degrees cooler one thing though rebus was adding why did you ask about her parents not sure really maybe its because we see so many like her singleparent household mum probably holding down a job giving the daughter time to be led astray are you going to go all liberal on me growing up in wardieburn and then suddenly youre going to parties in the new town and pushing drugs rebus reminded her clarke shouldered open the door to the car park he was there in his saab phone to his ear and a cigarette in his other hand she folded her phone shut as she opened the passengerside door and slid in closing it after her rebus had put his own phone back in his pocket that everything he asked holding out a hand for the file as much as i could photocopy without the troops suspecting he removed the inchdeep block of unsullied copy paper you learned all the right tricks kwai chang caine does that make you master po didnt think you were old enough for rung fu old enough for the reruns she watched him place the file on the back seat all through the interview i was praying you wouldnt cough or sneeze couldnt risk lighting a ciggie either rebus replied she stared at him but he was avoiding eye contact how come she asked eventually you couldnt play nice just this once people like corbyn seem to push my buttons he explained making them part of the majority she chided him maybe so he admitted are you going to interview bakewell at the parliament she nodded slowly am i invited remind me what does it mean to be on suspension last time i looked shiv the public were allowed into the parliament building buy the man a coffee and i could be seated at the next table over or you could go home and let me talk to corbyn see if i can change his mind wont happen he stated which you going home or him changing his mind both god give me strength she sighed amen to that and speaking of the almighty i didnt hear much from young todd during the interview he was there to observe its all right you know you can admit that you missed me werent you just saying that i covered all the bases she watched rebus shrug maybe there were bases she kept hidden from us youre telling me youd have teased the dealers name out of her twenty quid says ill have it by days end if corbyn gets wind that youre still on the case but i wont be ds clarke ill be a civilian not much he can do about that is there john she began to caution but broke off knowing shed be wasting her breath keep me posted she muttered at last opening the car door and easing herself out notice something he asked she leaned back down into the car what he waved his arm taking in the car park the smells gone wonder if thats an omen he was smiling as he turned the key in the ignition leaving clarke with an unasked question good omen or bad nancy at home rebus asked sievewrights flatmate when the young man answered the door no no because shed been walking up leith street when rebus had passed her in his saab meaning he had maybe a twentyminute start on her always supposing shed head straight for her flat its eddie right rebus said i was here a few days ago i remember didnt catch your surname though gentry as in bobbie gentry not many people know her these days im older than most people got a couple of her albums at home mind if i come in rebus noted that gentry had lost his bandanna but still wore the smudgy eyeliner she told me to be here at three he lied blithely someone was at the door for her a while back gentry was reluctant but rebuss stare told him resistance was futile he opened the door a little wider and rebus gave a little bow of the head as he walked in the living room smelt of stale tobacco and something that could have been patchouli oil been a while since rebus had come across that particular scent he wandered over to the window and peered down on to blair street tell you a funny story he said back still to eddie gentry theres a warren of basements across the way where bands used to practise owner was thinking of redeveloping so he got some builders in they were working in these tunnels miles and miles of them and they started to hear unearthly groans the massage parlour next door gentry said cutting to the punchline youve heard it rebus turned from the window and studied some of the album sleeves actual lps rather than cds caravan he commented canterbury s finest didnt know people still listened to them there were other sleeves he recognised the fairports and davey graham and pentangle somebody studying archaeology he guessed i like a lot of the old stuff gentry explained he nodded towards the corner of the room i play guitar so you do rebus agreed seeing a sixstring acoustic nestling on its stand a twelvestring lying on the floor behind it any good in answer gentry picked up the sixstring and settled on the sofa legs crossed beneath him he started to play and rebus realised that hed grown the fingernails long on his right hand each one a readymade plectrum rebus knew the tune even if he couldnt place it bert jansch he guessed over the closing chord from that album he did with john renbourn havent listened to it in years rebus nodded his appreciation tfoure pretty good son shame you cant make a living from it eh might have stopped you from dealing drugs what nancy s told us all about it whoa wait a minute gentry put his guitar aside and rose to his feet whats that youre saying a deaf musician rebus sounded impressed i heard the words i just dont know why she would say that night the poet was killed she was picking up a delivery from the guy you introduced her to she didnt say that gentry was trying to sound confident but his eyes told rebus a different story i didnt introduce her to anybody v rebus shrugged with his hands in his pockets no skin off my nose he commented she says youre dealing you say youre not we all know theres stuff being smoked here stuff she gets from her boyfriend gentry burst out but then he corrected himself hes not even her boyfriend she just thinks he is whos this i dont know i mean hes been here a couple of times but he just calls himself sol says its latin for the sun not that he strikes me as that bright rebus laughed as if this were the best joke hed heard in a while but gentry wasnt smiling i cant believe shed try dropping me in it he muttered to himself she dropped a pal of hers in it too rebus revealed got her to provide an alibi rebus let his final word hang in the air alibi gentry echoed christ you think she killed that guy rebus offered another shrug tell me he said does nancy own anything like a cape or a cloak sort of thing a monk might wear no gentry sounded bewildered by the question have you ever met her friend gill hooray henrietta from the new town gentry screwed up his face tou know her then she came to a party a while back i hear that she throws a good party too you could offer to play a set id rather stick pins in my eyes youre probably right same as id rather listen to dick gaughan than james blunt rebus sniffed loudly drawing a handkerchief from his pocket this sol character got an address for him afraid not not to worry rebus was over at the window again putting the handkerchief back as he gazed down on the street not long now till nancy sievewright returned top of leith street then north bridge and hunter square do you sing as well as play a little bit but not in a band no tou should get yourself up to fife friend of mine says theres some sort of acoustic scene up there gentry was nodding ive played anstruther funny to think of the east neuk as the centre of anything used to be it was shut winter and weekends gentry smiled wait there will you he was gone from the living room less than a minute when he came back he was holding something out towards rebus a cd in a clear plastic pocket there was a folded square of white paper with the titles of three tracks listed my demo gentry announced proudly thats great rebus said after ive played it do you want it back i can burn another one gentry said with a shake of the head rebus patted the disc against the palm of his left hand i really appreciate that eddie as long as you appreciate that its not a bung of some kind gentry looked horrified no i just thought but rebus touched him on the shoulder and assured him he was only joking id best be off he said thanks again he gave a little wave with the cd and made for the hallway and the front door with the door closed behind him he started down the stairs just as nancy sievewright was making her way up still holding the sealed polythene bag with the interview tape inside rebus offered her a nod and a smile but said nothing all the same he could feel her watching his descent at the bottom he looked up sure enough she hadnt moved just told him rebus called to her told who what she called back tour flatmate eddie he answered the one you tried fobbing us off with he exited the tenement and unlocked his car it was parked illegally but had managed to avoid a ticket my lucky day he told himself hed finally got round to installing a cd player in the saab he drew gentrys offering from its sleeve and slotted it home then studied the titles of the songs megs mons minstrel in pain reverend walker blues he liked them already with the volume low he took out his phone and called siobhan clarke tell me youre in the pub was her opening line blair street actually and you owe me twenty notes i dont believe you you wont when i tell you he paused for dramatic effect sievewright gets her stuff from someone called sol her flatmate thinks hes named himself after the sun but we know differently dont we sol goodyear i take it todds not within earshot making me a coffee isnt that sweet of him sol goodyear she repeated as if she still couldnt take it in eventually she asked him what he was listening to nancy s flatmate plays guitar im assuming hes not in the car with you probably shouting the odds at sievewright as we speak but he did give me a demo he made that was good of him bet you cant remember the last time you listened to anything made after tou gave me that elbow album true the tangent had run its course so now we need to add todds brother to the list nice to stay busy rebus consoled her do you have a time for jim bakewell yet havent been able to track him down and macrae wants to add another twenty or so bodies to the team as long as theyre warm ones hes even thinking of bringing derek starr back from fettes which would mean relegating you to vicecaptain if only i had some vices should have listened to me shiv i couldve given you a few tips will i see you later at the pub might have an early night actually no offence none taken but dont think ill forget about that twenty rebus ended the call and turned the music up a little gentry was humming along to the melody and rebus wasnt sure if it was meant to be picked up by the mic it was still the first track megs mons he wondered if meg was a real woman peering at the slip of paper in the clear plastic sleeve he thought he could make out writing on the other side he pulled out the track listing and unfolded it sure enough on the back was written the name of the studio where gentry had recorded his demo cr studios rebus sat in front of his own personal video monitor graeme macleod had placed him in a corner of the room and had piled the videotapes next to him edinburgh city centres west end the night of the todorov killing youre going to get me shot macleod had complained fetching the tapes from their locked cupboard rebus had been sitting for an hour in the central monitoring facility sometimes hitting search and sometimes pause there were cameras on shandwick place princes street and lothian road rebus was looking for evidence of sergei andropov or his driver or maybe cafferty or anyone else attached to the case come to that so far he had nothing at all to show for his efforts the hotel would have its own surveillance of course but he doubted the manager would hand it over without a fight and couldnt see himself persuading siobhan to put in the request there was something soothing about the unhurried voyeurism going on around him one act of vandalism reported and one known shoplifter tracked along george street the camera operators seemed as passive as any daytime tv viewers and rebus wondered if there might be some reality show to be made from it he liked the way the staff could control the remote cameras using a joystick zooming in on anything suspicious it didnt feel like the police state the media were always predicting all the same if he worked here every day hed be careful of himself on the street for fear of being caught picking his nose or scratching his backside careful in shops and restaurants too and probably with no interest in the tv at home macleod was back at rebuss shoulder anything he asked i know youve been over this footage more than once graeme but there are a few faces i may know that you dont im not having a moan if i were in your shoes id be thinking the same just a pity we didnt have a camera in kings stables road hardly anyone uses it at night ive noticed that plenty of people turning into castle terrace but almost no one into kings stables and no woman in a hood not yet macleod consoled rebus with a pat on the shoulder then went back to work it didnt make sense to rebus why would some woman be hanging around there doling out offers of sex they only had the one witnesss word for it could it have been some fantasy hed been harbouring rebus felt his vertebrae snap back into place as he stretched his spine he wanted a break but knew if he took one he might not be tempted back he could always go home it was what everybody wanted but then his phone rang and he scooped it from his pocket caller id siobhan whats up he asked cupping the phone to his mouth so he wouldnt be overheard megan macfarlanes just called dci macrae shes not happy youve been harassing sergei andropov she paused want to tell me about it happened to run into him last night whereabouts caledonian hotel your regular wateringhole no need for sarcasm young lady and you didnt think to let me in on it i really did just bump into him shiv no big deal to you maybe but andropov seems to think it is and now megan macfarlane thinks so too andropovs russian probably used to politicians controlling the police rebus was thinking out loud macrae wants to see you tell him im banned from gayfield ive told him he was furious about that too corbyns fault for not alerting him thats what i said any word from jim bakewells office no so what are you up to trying to make space for the new recruits four have arrived from torphichen and two from leith anyone we know ray reynolds hes not even a good imitation of a detective rebus stated then he asked her if she was going to do anything about sol goodyear soon as ive worked out what to say to todd she decided good luck with that one of the cctv operators suddenly called to her colleague that she had the shoplifter on camera entering the bus station clarkes groan was almost audible youre at the city chambers she stated well make a detective of you yet youre on suspension john it keeps slipping my mind studying the tapes from that night correct trying to place who at the scene exactly who do you think why in gods name would cafferty want a russian poet killed maybe he gets annoyed when verses dont rhyme by the by heres a strange one for you that cd sievewrights flatmate gave me was recorded at riordans studio yet another coincidence but she was silent for a moment think its worth talking to the engineer about toure mobhanded shiv its worth chasing every single lead no matter how brittle im not great at delegating the neither still headed straight home from work thats the plan ill be thinking of you then john just promise me one thing no more drinks at the caledonian hotel tes boss talk to you later he ended the call but sat there staring at the phone macrae macfarlane and andropov all annoyed as hell with him good he said quietly reaching for the next videotape can i ask you about your brother clarke had led todd goodyear into the corridor for a bit of privacy shed already set the new recruits to work some were studying the bible the collating of everything pertaining to the case while others had been assigned the riordan tapes it wasnt exactly a collection of the brightest and the best no cid unit wanted to give up its star players to a rival team a detective from goodyears own station had recognised him and asked what he thought he was up to masquerading as a proper cop sol goodyear was asking now looking puzzled what about him he was in a fight what night was that last wednesday clarke nodded same night todorov was attacked can you give me an address for him whats going on turns out he might know nancy sievewright youre kidding me hed started laughing no joke she assured him we think he was her dealer did you know he was still in the game no the blood was rising up goodyears neck so i need his address i dont know it i mean its somewhere around the grass market i thought he lived in dalkeith sols always on the move how did you know hed been in a fight he called me so youre still in touch he has my mobile number meaning youve got his goodyear shook his head he keeps changing it this fight he had any idea where it happened a pub in haymarket clarke nodded to herself the soco tarn banks had got a message about the incident hadnt he mentioned it at the todorov scene a stabbing so you dont keep in touch but he phones you i when hes been stabbed goodyear ignored this what does it matter if he knows nancy ievewright just another loose end that needs tying weve got more of those than a frayed rug clarke offered up a tired smile and goodyear sighed shoulders slumping when you find sols address do you want me along cant happen she said youre his brother he nodded his understanding im assuming west end took an interest in the stabbing she asked meaning the police station on torphichen place goodyear nodded again they asked him a few questions at a ampe by the time i saw him hed been transferred to a ward just the one night for observation do you think he told the officers anything goodyear shrugged all he said was he was having a drink and this guy took against him it moved outside and sol came off worst and the other guy didnt say anything about him goodyear bit his bottom lip if sols connected does that mean a conflict of interest back to my old station and uniform ill have to ask dci macrae he nodded again but dolefully this time i didnt know he was still dealing he stressed maybe sievewrights lying clarke imagined herself placing a hand on his arm offering comfort but in the real world she just moved past him and back into the already overcrowded cid suite chairs had been borrowed from the interview rooms and she had to weave between them as she made for her desk there was another officer stationed there he apologised but didnt move three more detectives were huddled around rebuss desk clarke picked up her phone and called torphichen she was patched through to cid and found herself talking to detective inspector shug davidson want to thank you he chuckled for taking ray reynolds off our hands she looked across the room towards reynolds a detective constable these past nine years promotion never on the cards he was standing in front of the murder wall and rubbing his stomach as if preparing for another of his infamous belches thats good she told davidson because im after a favour in return whats this i hear about john getting booted into touch news travels age has not softened him thats a quote from somewhere listen shug do you remember last wednesday night a fight outside a pub at haymarket sol goodyear you mean thats right touve got his brother on secondment im told seems like a decent bloke i think hes embarrassed about sol and rightly so sols got a fair bit of form so this fight he got into if you ask me there was money owed by one of his punters guy didnt fancy paying up so decided to have a go at sol were considering making it attempted murder todd says he was only in hospital the one night with eight stitches in his side more of a slice than a proper stabbing meaning he got lucky tou caught the attacker hes pleading selfdefence naturally names larry fintry crazy larry he gets called should be in the nuthouse if you ask me care in the community shug aye with the pharmaceuticals dispensed by sol goodyear i need to speak to sol clarke said whys that the todorov murder we think the girl who found the body was on her way to sols more than likely davidson agreed last address i have for him is raeburn wynd clarkes whole body froze for a moment thats where we found the body i know davidson was laughing and if sol hadnt been getting himself stabbed at haymarket around the exact same time i might have thought to mention it earlier in the end she took phyllida hawes with her tibbet had looked distraught as if fearing siobhan had already made up her mind who should replace her at sergeant level when she was promoted she hadnt bothered reminding him that she would have little or no say over anyones fate instead she had simply told him that he was in charge until her return which perked him up a little theyd taken clarkes car sticking to shop talk interrupted only occasionally by awkward silences hawes wanting to know about life postrebus but not daring to ask while clarke didnt quite get round to bringing up hawess relationship with tibbet it was a mercy when the car finally stopped at the foot of raeburn wynd the lane was lshaped from the main road all you could see were garages and lockups but around the corner buildings which at one time would have housed horses and their coaches had been turned into mews flats none of the neighbours heard anything hawes asked might send the team out to ask them again and flash that efit clarke considered can ray reynolds be one of them please clarke managed a smile didnt take long id heard the stories hawes said but nothing quite prepares you theyd turned the corner into the mews proper clarke stopped at one of the doors checked the address shed copied into her notebook and pressed the bell after twenty seconds she tried again im coming someone yelled from within there was the sound of feet thumping down a flight of stairs and the door was opened by sol goodyear had to be him same eyelashes and ears as his brother solomon goodyear clarke checked christ what do you lot want well spotted im ds clarke this is dc hawes got a warrant want to ask you a couple of questions about the murder what murder the one at the bottom of your street i was in hospital at the time hows the wound he lifted his shirt to show a large white compress just above the waistband of his underpants itches like buggery he admitted then catching on how did you know about it di davidson at torphichen filled me in mentioned crazy larry too bit of a tip for you actually before you square up to someone always check their nickname sol goodyear snorted at that but still didnt show any great desire to let them in my brothers a cop he said instead oh yes clarke tried to sound surprised she reckoned sol would try this line on any police officer he met hes still in uniform but not for much longer todds always been a fasttrack kind of guy he was the white sheep of the family he gave a little laugh at what clarke reckoned was another of his wellrehearsed lines thats a good one hawes obliged managing to sound as though she meant the opposite the laugh died in sol goodyears throat well anyway he sniffed i wasnt here that night they didnt discharge me till the evening after did nancy come to see you at the hospital nancy who your girlfriend nancy she was on her way here when she tripped over the body you were going to sell her some stuff for a friend of hers shes not my girlfriend he stated having decided in the blinking of an eye that there was no point lying about things they already knew she seems to think she is shes mistaken toure just her dealer then he scowled as though pained by this turn in the conversation what i am officer is the victim of a stabbing the painkillers im on make it highly unlikely that anything i say could be used in a court of law clever boy clarke said sounding admiring you know your loopholes learned the hard way she nodded slowly ive heard it was big ger cafferty got you started on the selling do you still see him dont know who youre talking about funny ive never heard of a stabbing affecting someones memory before clarke looked to hawes for confirmation of this think youve got the patter dont you sol goodyear was saying well try this for a payoff and with that he slammed the door in their faces from behind it as he started climbing the stairs again could be heard a stream of invective hawes raised an eyebrow bitches and lesbians she repeated always nice to learn something new about yourself isnt it so now weve got one brother involved i suppose that means the other has to be taken off the case thats a decision for dci macrae how come you didnt tell sol weve got todd working with us needtoknow basis phyl clarke stared at hawes you in a hurry to see the back of pc goodyear just so long as he remembers he is a pc now that the suites filling up hes looking too comfortable in that suit of his meaning what exactly some of us have worked our way out of uniform siobhan cids a closed shop is it clarke turned away from hawes and started moving but stopped abruptly at the corner from where she stood it was about sixty feet to the spot where alexander todorov was murdered what are you thinking hawes asked im wondering about nancy were assuming she was on her way to sols when she found the body but she couldve walked up here rung his bell a few times maybe thumped on his door not knowing hes been injured in a brawl exactly and meantime todorovs managed to stagger from the car park clarke was nodding tou think she saw something hawes added saw or heard maybe hid around this corner while todorovs attacker followed him and delivered the final blow and her reason for not telling us any of this fear i suppose fearll do it every time hawes concurred what was that line from todorovs poem he averted his eyesensuring he would not have to testify the sort of lesson nancy might have learned from sol goodyear yes clarke agreed tfes she might rebus was eating a bag of crisps and listening again to eddie gentrys cd on his car stereo except that it wasnt stereo exactly one of the speakers having packed in didnt really matter when it was just one man and his guitar hed already finished the first packet of crisps plus a curriedvegetable samosa bought from a corner shop in polwarth and washed down with a bottle of still water which he tried to persuade himself made it a balanced meal he was parked at the bottom end of caffertys street and as far as possible from any of the streetlamps for once he didnt want the gangster spotting him then again he couldnt even be sure cafferty was at home the mans car was in the driveway but that didnt mean much in itself some of the house lights were on but maybe just to deter intruders rebus couldnt see any sign of the bodyguard who lived in the coachhouse to the rear of the property cafferty never seemed to use him much leading rebus to believe he was on the payroll for reasons of vanity rather than necessity siobhan had texted a couple of times ostensibly to ask if he fancied supper one night he knew shed be wondering what he was up to two hours hed been parked there for no good reason the fifteenminute break spent at the corner shop had given cafferty ample time to head out without rebus being any the wiser maybe for once the gangster would be using his room at the caledonian as a surveillance it was laughable but then he wasnt even sure it was a surveillance might be it was just a pretext for not going home where the only thing waiting was a reissue of johnny cashs live at san quentin that he hadnt got round to playing kept forgetting to put it in the car and wondered how it would sound on a single speaker first stereo hed ever owned one of the speakers had packed in after only a month there was a track on a velvet underground album all the instruments on one channel vocals on the other so that he couldnt listen to both together it had taken him ages to buy his first cd player and even now he preferred vinyl siobhan said it was because he was wilful either that or ive just not got the herd mentality hed argued back these days she had an mp player and bought stuff online he would tease her by asking if he could take a look at the album cover or lyric sheet toure missing the big picture hed told her a good album should be more than the sum of its parts like police work shed guessed smiling he hadnt bothered admitting that he was just coming to that hed finished the crisps and folded the bag into a narrow strip so he could tie it into a knot didnt know why he did that just seemed neater somehow a mate back in army days had done it and rebus had followed suit it made a change from putting a match under the empty packet and watching it shrivel to a miniature version of itself like something from a dolls house simple pleasures same as sitting in a car on a quiet nighttime street music playing and belly full he would give it another hour he had the whos endless wire for when he got fed up of gentry hadnt yet worked out what the title meant but because hed bought the cd at least he had the lyrics a car was reversing out of some gates up the road looked to rebus very much like caffertys gates caffertys car being driven by the bodyguard because there was a reading light on in the back seat illuminating caffertys dome of a head he seemed to be peering at some papers rebus waited the car was turning downhill meaning it would drive straight past him he ducked down waiting until its lights had passed it signalled right and rebus turned the ignition doing a threepoint turn and following at the granville terrace junction caffertys car jumped out in front of a doubledecker bus rebus had to wait for traffic to clear but knew there was nothing cafferty could do now until leven street he stayed behind the bus until it signalled to pick up passengers then moved out and past it there was a gap of a hundred yards between him and the car in front eventually its brake lights glowed as it reached the traffic lights at the kings theatre as rebus crawled nearer he saw that something was wrong it wasnt caffertys car he drew up behind it the car in front of it stopped on red wasnt cafferty either no way the bodyguard could have passed both cars and got through the lights while they were still on green rebus had been behind the bus for maybe a couple of minutes there had been the viewforth crossroads but hed looked both ways and seen no sign of cafferty had to have turned sharpish down one of the narrow side streets but which one he did another threepoint turn a taxi sounding a complaint as it waited to follow him back along gilmore place there were a few boarding houses whose front gardens had been paved and turned into car parking but none of the vehicles matched caffertys bentley you wait two solid hours and then you lose him at the first hurdle rebus muttered to himself there was a convent its gates open but rebus doubted hed find the gangster there roads off to left and right but none looked promising at the viewforth traffic lights he turned the car again this time he signalled left and headed down a narrow oneway street towards the canal it wasnt well lit and wouldnt be used much this time of night meaning hed stick out like a sore thumb so when a kerbside parking space appeared he reversed into it there was a bridge across the canal but it was blocked to everything except bikes and pedestrians as rebus headed that way on foot he finally saw the bentley it was parked up next to some wasteland a couple of canal boats were moored for the night smoke billowing from the chimney of one of them rebus hadnt been down this way in ages new blocks of flats had appeared from somewhere but it didnt look as though many of them were occupied then he saw a sign stating that they were serviced apartments the leamington lift bridge was a construction of wrought iron with a wooden roadway it could be raised to let barges and pleasure boats through but otherwise lay level with either bank of the canal two men were standing in the middle of it their shadows thrown on to the water by a nearas dammit full moon cafferty was doing the talking throwing out his arms to illustrate each point the focus of his interest seemed to be the canals far bank there was a walkway stretching from fountainbridge to the city limits and beyond at one time it had been a treacherous spot but a new footpath had been built and the canal seemed a lot cleaner than rebus remembered it beyond the footpath stood a high wall behind which rebus knew was one of edinburgh s redundant industrial sites until about a year back it had been a brewery but now most of the buildings were in the process of being dismantled the steel mash tuns removed time was the city had boasted thirty or forty breweries now rebus seemed to think there was just the one not too far away on slateford road when the other man half turned to concentrate on what cafferty was saying rebus recognised the silhouette of sergei andropovs distinctive face the door to caffertys car opened but only so his driver could get out to light a cigarette rebus heard another door almost like an echo of the first he decided to pretend he was on his way home tucked his hands into his jacket hunched his shoulders and started walking risking just the one glance back over his shoulder he saw that there was another car parked alongside caffertys andropovs driver had decided on a cigarette break too cafferty and the russian meantime had crossed the bridge and were still deep in conversation rebus wished hed thought to bring a microphone of some kind the engineer at riordans studio would have obliged as it was he couldnt make out anything what was more he was headed away from the scene and it would raise suspicions were he suddenly to turn and retrace his steps he passed a car workshop locked up tight for the night past it were some tenement flats he thought about going inside climbing a flight and peering from the stairwell window instead he stopped and lit a cigarette then pretended to take a phone call holding the mobile close to his face he started walking again but slowly aware of the two men on the opposite bank andropov gave a whistle and gestured to the drivers to stay put rebus saw that the canal was coming to an end at a recently completed basin complete with a couple of more permanentlooking barges one of which had a for sale sign taped to its only window new buildings had been thrown up here too office blocks restaurants and a bar with plenty of glass frontage and outside tables which were being used tonight only by hardened smokers one of the units was still to let and rebus couldnt see much action in the restaurants the bar had a cash machine to one side of it and he paused to use it risking another glance towards the approaching figures but they werent there any more he looked in through the windows of the bar and saw that they were removing their coats even from here rebus could hear pounding music several tv sets were also on the go and the clientele was predominantly young and studenty the only person who paid attention to the new arrivals was their waitress who bounded over with a smile and took their order no way rebus could go in the place wasnt so busy that hed be able to hide in the throng and even supposing he did go in hed never get close enough to hear anything cafferty had chosen wisely not even riordan would have stood a chance the two men could have a chat without fear of eavesdroppers what to do next plenty of dark corners out here meaning he could bide his time and freeze his backside or he could retreat to his car the two men would have to return to their own cars eventually with a hundred quid extracted from the machine rebus made his choice he walked back along the other side of the canal crossed at the leamington bridge and hummed to himself as he passed the piece of wasteground not that the two drivers paid any attention they were too busy talking to one another rebus doubted caffertys man spoke any russian meaning andropovs driver must have a decent grasp of english once installed in the saab rebus considered switching the engine on so he could have some heat but an idling motor might make the guards curious so he rubbed his hands together and drew his coat more tightly around him it was a further twenty minutes before anything happened he hadnt caught sight of andropov and cafferty but both cars were on the move he followed them back to gilmore place they signalled to turn right at the viewforth junction and then right again at dundee street two minutes later they were pulling to a halt outside the bar while one of its sides faced the canal the other fronted fountainbridge traffic here was busier with plenty of parked cars rebus found a space near the old coop funeral home major works were in progress and one building had lost everything but its facade while a new construction rose up to fill the space behind it was all insurance companies and banks around here rebus seemed to think which made him think also of sir michael addison stuart janney and roger anderson first albannach men all in his wing mirror he could see that the two cars were idling but hadnt bothered to switch off their lights or engines give it a couple of years hed probably be empowered to arrest them under some co injunction except that he wouldnt be here in a couple of years bingo he said to himself as andropov and cafferty emerged they got into their separate cars and headed off passing rebus and making towards lothian road again rebus followed harder to lose them this time as they passed the end of kings stables road rebus felt his stomach tighten at the prospect that they might end up at the car park but they stayed on the main drag and turned into princes street charlotte square and queen street when passing young street rebus glanced down it towards the oxford bar not tonight my love he cooed blowing it a kiss at the end of queen street they forked left on to leith walk passing gayfield square great junction street north junction street and they were on the waterfront to the west of leith itself more redevelopment was happening here blocks of apartments rising from what had been dockland and industrial estates hardly the tourist trail sergei rebus muttered as the cars pulled over again there was another car already sitting there hazard lights on rebus drove past no way he could park the streets were deserted instead he took the first turning he came to did another of the threepointers he was becoming so expert in and crawled back to the junction he signalled right and passed the three cars same deal cafferty and andropov standing on the pavement cafferty with his arms stretched wide as if to encompass everything but this time with two new attendants stuart janney and nikolai stahov the consular official stood with his gloved hands behind his back a cossack hat on his head janney looked thoughtful arms folded nodding to himself gangs all here rebus commented there was a petrol station with its lights still on so he pulled into the forecourt and dribbled some unleaded into the tank bought chewing gum from the cashier when he paid and stood beside the pump unwrapping a piece slowly and making as if to check messages on his phone the cashier kept staring out at him and he knew this wasnt an act he could keep up for long he looked back along the street but couldnt make out much cafferty still seemed to be holding the floor a car had pulled up at the pump behind him two men got out one busied himself with the nozzle while the other gave a few stretches and started walking towards the kiosk but then seemed to change his mind and headed towards rebus instead evening he said he was big bigger than rebus his belt was on its last notch and looked ready to snap his head was shaved some grey showing through pudgy face like an overfed baby who still objected every time the breast was taken away rebus just nodded a reply flicking the gum wrapper into a bin the new arrival was studying rebuss car bit of a clunker he offered even as saabs go rebus looked back at the mans own car vauxhall vectra with a black paint job least i own mine he said the man gave a smile and a nod as if to admit that yes indeed his belonged to the company he wants a word he said giving a flick of the head in the vectras direction oh aye rebus seemed more interested in the packet of gum maybe you should talk to him di rebus the man continued a gleam in his eye as he clocked the effect an emergency stop on the gumchewing who are you rebus asked hell tell you ive got to pay for the petrol the man moved off rebus stood his ground a moment the cashier was looking interested the man at the vectra was concentrating on the pumps meter rebus decided to go see him you wanted me he said believe me rebus youre the last thing i want the man was neither tall nor short fat nor thin his hair was brown eyes somewhere between brown and green and set in the blandest of faces always blending in and instantly forgettable perfect for surveillance work im assuming youre cid rebus went on dont know you though which means youre from out of town the man released his grip on the pump as the meter hit thirty pounds dead he seemed satisfied with this outcome and replaced the nozzle in its holster only then as he replaced the cap and wiped his hands on his handkerchief did he deign to focus his attention on the man standing before him toure detective inspector john rebus he stated based at gayfield square police station b division edinburgh let me write this down in case i forget rebus made show of reaching into a pocket for his notebook tou have a problem with authority the man went on which is why everyones so relieved youre about to retire theyve only just stopped short of putting up bunting at fettes hq seems you know all there is to know about me rebus conceded and so far all i know about you is that you drive the sort of overpowered cockmobile favoured by a certain type of cop usually the kind whos happiest investigating other cops you think were the complaints maybe not but you seem to know who they are ive been on their receiving end a couple of times myself the jfman confided youre not a proper cop otherwise makes me a proper cop then rebus added i know the man said quietly now get in and lets do some proper talking my cars but as rebus looked over his shoulder he saw that the babyfaced giant had somehow squeezed in behind the saabs steering wheel and was turning the ignition dont worry rebuss new friend assured him andy knows a thing or two about cars he was getting back into the vectras driving seat rebus walked around to the passenger side and climbed in the big man andy had left a dent in the seat rebus looked around for clues as to the mens identity i like your thinking the driver admitted but when youre undercover you try not to give the game away i cant be much good then seeing how you had no trouble spotting me not much good no while your pal andy couldnt look more like a copper if he had the word tattooed on his forehead some people think he looks like a bouncer bouncers tend to have that bit more refinement the man had lifted a mobile phone for rebus to see want me to relay that to him while hes in charge of your vehicle maybe later rebus said so who are you then were scd the stranger said short for scdea the scottish crime and drugs enforcement agency im di stone and andy ds prosser what can i do to help you di stone tou can start by calling me calum and i hope its all right to call you john nice and friendly eh calum lets just aim for civil and see how it goes the saab was already signalling to turn off the main road they entered the car park of a casino not far from ocean terminal where the saab pulled to a stop stone drawing up alongside andy seems to know his way around rebus commented football routes only andys a dunfermline fan comes through here to watch his team play hibs and hearts not for much longer the way the pars are struggling a sore point ill bear that in mind stone had turned in his seat the better to meet rebus face to face im being straight with you because i think any other approach might see your hackles rise i hope youll offer me the same courtesy he paused for a moment why are you so interested in cafferty and the russian a case im working the todorov killing rebus nodded last drink he had before he died happened to be with cafferty andropov was in the bar at the same time you think the pair of them are in cahoots i just wasnt sure how and now andropovs looking to buy a huge swathe of edinburgh rebus guessed with cafferty as his middleman could be stone conceded rebus was looking out of the passengerside window towards his own car prosser seemed to be thumping the dodgy speaker with his foot not sure andy shares my taste in music rebus commented depends on whether you listen to nothing but strathspey reels we may have a problem stone pretended to laugh bit unusual isnt it he asked a oneman stakeout is cid around these parts really that short of bodies not everyone wants to work nights tell me about it wifes sometimes so surprised to see me i keep thinking she must have the milkman hidden in the wardrobe you dont wear a wedding ring no i dont while you john are divorced with a grownup daughter anyone would think it was me you were interested in rather than andropov i couldnt care less about andropov authorities in moscow are a gnats bollock away from charging him with godknowswhat fraud and deception and bribery he seems pretty relaxed about it is that because hes thinking of relocating wait and see but for what its worth whatever the reason for him being here it seems legit even with cafferty in tow thing about crooks john ninety per cent of everything they do is completely kosher rebus considered for a moment the word overworld reverberating in his head so if its not andropov youre after weve got your friend cafferty in our sights john and this time hes going down reason your name flashed on the radar all those runins down the years but hes ours john six of us have been slaving over him these past seven months weve got phone taps and forensic accountants and a lot more besides and we aim to have him in jail shortly with his illgot gains reverting to the exchequer stone looked pleased with himself but his eyes were cold bright marbles only thing that could mess it up is someone blundering in hellbent on their own halfbaked theories and stoked by longheld prejudice stone was shaking his head slowly cant let that happen john or in other words butt out if i told you to do that stone continued quietly i have the suspicion youd do exactly the opposite just for the hell of it in the saab prossers head had disappeared from view as he wrestled with the door panel what are you going to charge cafferty with maybe drugs maybe moneylaundering tax evasions always a good one he doesnt think we know about his various offshore accounts those forensic accountants you were mentioning theyre so good they have to stay anonymous thered be a price on their heads otherwise i can imagine rebus was thoughtful for a moment anything tying cafferty and andropov to alexander todorov only that andropov knew him in moscow knew todorov from years back same school or college or something so you know a bit about andropov tell me whats his connection to cafferty i mean hes a different league isnt he listen to yourself john pushing sixty and frisky as a pup stone laughed again but this time it sounded genuine you want cafferty put away that much is clear but the best chance we have of giving you that little retirement gift is if you leave us to get on with it caffertys not going to go to jail because youve been busy tailing him hes going to be brought down by a paper trail shell companies vat dodges banks in bermuda and lithuania sweeteners and payoffs and doctored balance sheets that why youre busy tailing him we heard cafferty on the phone to his lawyer saying youd pulled him in lawyer wanted to make an official complaint called it harassment cafferty wouldnt have it said it was actually a bit flattering thats what got us worried john dont want a loose cannon out there not when were readying to attack we know youve been watching caffertys house weve seen you do it but im betting youve never seen us thats because youre so much better at it than i am rebus said you better believe it stone leaned back in his seat a gesture which seemed to have some significance for prosser the saabs door opened and the fat man got out tugging at the handle on the vectras passenger side hows my hifi rebus asked him good as new rebus turned his attention back to stone the detective handed him his business card be good stone said leave the stakeouts to the professionals ill sleep on it was all rebus said he got into his saab and tried the stereo the wonky speaker was working again no sign of damage to the grille or door panel had to admit he was impressed with that but he managed not to let it show reversed out of the car park and made his way back to the main road his options a left turn into the city or a right towards where hed last seen cafferty and andropov he signalled left and waited for the traffic to clear then took the right turn but all three cars had gone rebus cursed under his breath he could keep cruising or maybe try the caledonian hotel he could head to caffertys house and check if he was back just go home john he told himself so that was what he did working his way through canonmills and the new town and the old town along the meadows and then left into marchmont itself and arden street where a parking space the universes small reward for his labours awaited him as did two flights of stairs he wasnt breathing too hard at the top got a glass of water from the kitchen and gulped it then poured in a fresh inch to carry through to the living room added the same amount of whisky and stuck johnny cash on the hifi before collapsing into his chair but the man in black wasnt right rebus felt a bit guilty ejecting the cd cash had fife roots he seemed to i recall photos of him in some old newspaper visiting his hereditary home in falkland rebus stuck john martyn on instead grace and i danger one of the great breakup albums dark and brooding and i feeling just about perfect fuck rebus announced the single word summing up the days adventures he didnt know how to feel about the scd men yes he wanted cafferty taken out of the game but suddenly it was important that it be him making the bonecrunching tackle so it couldnt just be about cafferty it was about the means and method too years hed been fighting the bastard and now technology and some bespectacled penpusher might end up finishing the job no mess no fuss no blood there should be mess there should be fuss john martyn was singing about some people being crazy a little later he would move on to grace and danger itself followed by johnny too bad singing my whole life story john rebus told his whisky glass what the hell was he going to do with himself if cafferty was out of bounds if stone and his men did actually manage to put the gangster away cleanly and coldly there should be mess there should be fuss there should be blood day seven thursday november rebus was parked on the other side of gayfield square from the police station he had a pretty good view of the news crews tv cameras were being erected or dismantled depending on how early the teams had arrived journalists paced the pavement mobile phones pressed to their ears keeping a respectful distance from each other so as not to be tempted into a bit of eavesdropping photographers were wondering how to get anything usable from the dismal copshop frontage rebus had watched a trickle of suits climb the steps and enter the building he recognised some ray reynolds for example others were new to him but they all looked like cid meaning theyd been seconded to the team rebus bit into the remains of his breakfast roll and chewed slowly when buying the roll hed added a coffee newspaper and orange juice to the order skimming through the paper hed found more news of the ailing litvinenko the poisoning still a mystery but no mention of todorov and only a paragraph on charles riordan at the foot of which he was directed to the obituary columns further back he learned that riordan had worked on various rock tours in the s including big country and deacon blue one of the musicians was quoted as saying that charlie could mix a sweet sound in an aircraft hangar further back in time hed been a session musician appearing on albums by nazareth frankie miller and the sutherland brothers which meant rebus probably owned stuff hed played on wish id known hed said to himself staring out at the media scrum he wondered who had leaked the information that the todorov and riordan deaths were being linked didnt really matter bound to come out sooner or later but it did mean hed lost an opportunity for leverage there was a favour he was after and it would have been nice to offer the titbit in return still no sign of his quarry however but an officiallooking car had drawn up corbyn stepping out pausing for photos in his smart uniform shiny cap and black leather gloves a morale booster for the troops would be the excuse but rebus knew corbyn would have been alerted to the media nothing warmed a chief constable more than a hungry news gathering hed have them eating out of his hand rebus punched siobhans number into his phone high hiedyin alert he warned her who and where corbyn himself posing for the press give him two minutes and hell be in your face meaning youre nearby dont worry he cant see me hows it all going were going to have to speak to nancy sievewright yet again has she had any more grief from the banker not that i know of clarke paused so what else are you up to apart from this mornings stakeout to tell you the truth im just relieved i dont have to come in not with officers of the calibre of ratarse reynolds to contend with dont thought i saw young todd heading inside too clean suit and everything tes i was thinking you mightve dropped him now his brothers part of the deal phyl shares your interest but todds busy reviewing about two hundred hours of committee tapes made by charles riordan should keep him out of harms way and youve kept the chief informed thats my call not yours rebus tutted and watched as corbyn gave a final wave to the reporters before entering the reception area hes inside he said into the mouthpiece suppose id better get ready to look surprised pleasantly surprised shiv might get you an extra brownie point im going to talk to him about your suspension youll be on a hiding to nothing even so she drew in some breath and talk of the devil the phone went dead in rebuss hand he nipped it shut and drummed his fingers against the steering wheel where are you mairie he muttered but just as he uttered these words mairie henderson appeared around the corner from east london street moving briskly uphill towards the police station she had a notebook in one hand pen and dictaphone in the other and a large black satchel slung over one shoulder rebus sounded his horn but she paid no heed he tried again with the same lack of effect and didnt want to attract any attention other than hers so he gave up and got out of the car taking up position next to it with hands in pockets henderson was in conversation with one of her colleagues then she collared a photographer and asked him what shots hed been taking rebus recognised him thought his name was mungo or something knew hed worked with mairie in the past a text arrived on her phone and she checked it while still talking to the snapper before punching some buttons and making a call phone to her ear she moved away from the melee towards the patch of grass which sat in the middle of gayfield square there was some litter there empty wine bottles and fastfood wrappers which she frowned at as she spoke then she lifted her eyes and saw rebus he was smiling she kept her gaze on him as she spoke conversation over she skirted the patch of grass rebus was back in the car no point letting anyone else see him mairie henderson climbed into the passenger seat holding her satchel on her lap whats up she said and hello to you mairie hows the newspaper business crumbling at the seams she admitted between the freesheets and the internet readers willing to pay for their news are rapidly disappearing and ad revenue with them rebus guessed meaning cutbacks she sighed not so much work for a freelancer like yourself there are still plenty of stories john its just that the editors are loath to pay for them havent you noticed the tabloids they advertise for readers to send in news and pics she rested her head against the back of the seat closing her eyes for a moment rebus felt an unexpected jab of sympathy hed known mairie for years during which time theyd traded tips and information hed never before known her to sound so beaten maybe i can help he offered todorov and riordan she guessed opening her eyes and turning to face him the very same how come youre out here rather than in there she gestured towards the police station because im after a favour meaning you want me to do some digging tou know me too well mairie i know ive done you plenty of favours in the past john and the scales never seem to balance might be different this time she laughed tiredly another line you always use all right then call it your retirement gift to me she studied him more closely id forgotten you were on your way out im already out corbyns suspended me why did he do that i badmouthed a pal of his called sir michael addison the banker her intonation lifted along with her spirits theres a tie a loose tie between him and todorov how loose the whole six degrees intriguing nevertheless knew youd think so and youll tell me the story ill tell you what i can rebus corrected her in return for what exactly a man called andropov hes the russian industrialist thats right recently in town as part of a trade delegation they all went home andropov stayed i didnt know that she pursed her lips so what is it you want to know who he is and how he got his money again theres a hookup to todorov in that theyre both russian ive heard they knew one another back in the mists of time and and the night todorov died he was drinking in the same bar as his old classmate mairie henderson let out a low sustained whistle no one else has this rebus shook his head and theres plenty more if i run a story your bosses are bound to guess the source the source is back to being a civilian in a couple of days meaning no comebacks no comebacks he agreed her eyes narrowed im betting theres plenty more dirt you could be dishing saving it for my memoirs mairie she studied him again youll be needing a ghostwriter she informed him didnt sound like she was joking the scotsman newspaper was based in an uptodate facility at the bottom of holyrood road opposite the bbc and the parliament building although mairie henderson had left her fulltime job there several years back she was still a known face and carried her own security pass how did you wangle that rebus asked as he signed himself in at reception henderson tapped the side of her nose as rebus pinned on his visitor badge the office behind the reception desk was large and openplan and seemed to be staffed by a skeleton crew of only nine or ten bodies rebus said as much and henderson told him that he was living in the past doesnt take many hands to produce a paper these days tou dont sound too enthusiastic the old building had a bit of character to it and so did the old newsroom everyone scuttling around like mad trying to put a story together editor with his sleeves rolled up effing and blinding subs smoking like chimneys and trying to sneak puns into the copy cutting and pasting by hand everythings just gotten so she sought the right word efficient she eventually said being a cop was more fun in the old days too rebus assured her but we also made more mistakes at your age youre allowed to be nostalgic but youre not she just shrugged and sat herself at a vacant computer gesturing for him to pull up a chair a middleaged man with a scraggy beard and wearing halfmoon glasses walked past and said hello hiya gordon henderson replied remind me of the password will you connery he said she thanked him and then watching him leave gave a little smile half the people in here she told rebus her voice lowered think im still on the payroll handy to be able to waltz in he watched her tap in the password and start to search the computer for the name andropov first name she asked sergei she searched again halving the initial results we could have logged on to the internet anywhere rebus told her this isnt the internet as such its a database of news stories from the scotsman and every other paper you can think of she tapped the screen just over five hundred hits she stated seems a lot she gave him a look its minuscule want me to print the pages or are you happy to scroll lets see how i get on she rose from her chair and slid it aside so rebus could roll his own chair closer to the screen im going to do the rounds see what the gossip is what do i say if anyone asks me what im up to she thought for a moment tell them youre the economics editor fair enough she left him to it climbing the stairs to the next level rebus started clicking and reading the first few stories concerned andropovs business dealings with perestroika had come a loosening of state controls on industry allowing men like andropov to buy into base metals mining and the rest andropov had specialised in zinc copper and aluminium before branching out into coal and steel ventures into gas and oil had stalled but in other areas hed made a killing too big a killing perhaps leading the authorities to investigate him for corruption depending on which investigative journalist you turned to andropov was either a martyr or a crook after twenty minutes rebus tried refining the search by adding background to the keywords he was rewarded with a potted biography of andropov born the same year as alexander todorov in the zhdanov suburb of moscow also the same as todorov well well rebus muttered to himself there was no information as to which schools or colleges andropov had attended his early life it seemed hadnt been investigated at all rebus tried cross referencing andropovs name with todorov but drew a blank but while he was looking at the entries for todorov seventeen thousand of them worldwide mairie had been right about andropovs five hundred being small beer he tried finding information on the poets university career some of his lectures could be downloaded but there was no mention of improprieties with students maybe andropov had been spinning him a line hello the bearded man was back morning rebus said he seemed to remember that the mans name was gordon and gordon was now peering over his shoulder at the screen i thought sandy was covering the todorov story he commented tes rebus said im just adding background ah gordon nodded slowly as though this made sense so sandy s still stuck outside gayfield square last i heard rebus agreed whats the betting the cops screw it up as per i wouldnt risk my shirt on it rebus said voice hardening well shoulder to the grindstone nose to the mill gordon was laughing as he moved away prick rebus said just loud enough to be overheard gordon stopped in his tracks but didnt turn round and started walking again after a moment either thought hed misheard or didnt want to start something rebus got back to his reading switching from todorov to andropov again and almost immediately came across a name he recognised roddy denholm seemed that russia s new rich liked to buy art the prices paid at auction were hitting record highs a plutocrat wasnt a plutocrat without the obligatory picasso or matisse rebus put some of the news stories on to the screen they were accompanied by photos taken at sales in moscow new york and london five million there ten million here andropov was mentioned only tangentially as someone with a taste for uptotheminute art predominantly british as such he bought judiciously from galleries and shows rather than the likes of sothebys or christies recent purchases included two alison watts and work by callum innes david mach douglas gordon and roddy denholm siobhan had mentioned denholm to rebus the guy doing the art show at the parliament riordan working for him the journalist writing the piece had added that as all these artists are scottish mr andropov may be starting to specialise rebus jotted down the names and started some new searches a further fifteen minutes passed before mairie henderson returned with two coffees milk no sugar itll do i suppose rebus said by way of thanks what did you say to gordon she had pulled her chair in next to his why seemed to think youd taken against him some people are touchy whatever you said hes come to the conclusion you must be management i always thought i had it in me rebus glanced away from the screen long enough to give her a wink if i hit the print button where do the pages appear that machine over there she pointed towards a corner of the room so id have to walk all the way over there to collect them youre management john get someone to do it for you the reporters had drifted away from gayfield square maybe because it was approaching lunchtime or some other story had broken siobhan clarke had been in a meeting with dci macrae and the chief constable corbyn wasnt enthusiastic about leaving her in charge despite macraes spirited defence lets get di starr back from fettes corbyn had insisted yes sir macrae had said capitulating at the last afterwards hed sighed and told clarke the chief constable was right clarke had just shrugged and watched him pick up the phone asking to be connected to derek starr within half an hour starr himself coiffeured and cufflinked was in the cid suite and gathering the team together for what he termed a pep talk isnt a pep a pension scheme hawes asked beneath her breath her way of telling clarke she was on her side clarke smiled back to let her know she appreciated it having had only the briefest of briefings in macraes office starr focused on the tenuous links between the two deaths and insisted that they not read too much into them at this early stage he i wanted the team divided in two with one group concentrating on todorov and the other on riordan then turning his attention to siobhan clarke youll be the nexus ds clarke meaning if there points of connection between the two cases youll collate them aking around the room he asked if everyone understood how he ranted things to work the murmurs of assent were drowned out a sustained belch from ray reynolds chilli con carne he stated by way of apology as officers nearby notebooks and sheets of paper the phone on clarkes desk and she picked it up pressing a finger in her other ear to le the rest of starrs oration ds clarke she announced is di rebus there not at the moment can i help at all its stuart janney ah yes mr janney this is ds clarke we met at the parliament well ds clarke your man rebus asked for details of alexander todorovs bank account youve got them i know its taken a while but there were protocols clarke caught hawess eye where are you just now mr janney bank hq could a couple of my colleagues come and collect them dont see why not save me a trip janney sniffed as he spoke thank you sir will you be there for the next hour if im not ill leave the envelope with my assistant very kind of you hows the investigation going were making progress glad to hear it papers this morning seem to think youre connecting todorovs death to that house fire dont believe everything you read extraordinary nevertheless if you say so mr janney thanks again clarke put the phone down and turned back to phyllida hawes im getting you and col out of here go to first albannachs hq and pick up todorovs bank details from a man called stuart janney thank you hawes mouthed and while youre gone i might make myself scarce too nancy sievewrights going to be sick of the sight of me starr was clapping his hands signalling that the meeting was at an end unless anyones got a really stupid question his eyes raked the room daring any hand to be raised right then he barked lets go to work hawes rolled her eyes and squeezed through the throng to where colin tibbet was standing seemingly in thrall to derek starr siobhan clarke found todd goodyear sidling up next to her you think di starrs going to want me kept on he asked quietly just keep your head down and hope he doesnt notice you and how do i do that toure going through all those committee tapes right she watched goodyear nod just keep doing that and if he asks who you are explain that youre the only sod willing to take on such a thankless task im still not sure what it is you think i might find search me clarke confessed but you never know your luck okay then goodyear sounded far from convinced and youre going to be liaison between the two halves of the inquiry always supposing thats what a nexus is does that mean youll be giving the press conferences clarke responded with a snort derek starrs not going to let anyone hog the cameras except him he looks more like a salesman than a detective goodyear commented thats because he is clarke agreed and the thing hes selling is himself problem is hes bloody good at it youre not jealous they were being jostled by other detectives as everyone tried to find a patch of office they could claim as their own di starr will go far she said leaving it at that goodyear watched as she slung her bag over one shoulder toure going somewhere he stated well spotted anything i can help with touve got all those tapes to listen to todd whats happened to di rebus hes in the field clarke explained reckoning the fewer people who knew about the suspension the better especially when rebus despite or more accurately because of the suspension was most definitely still on the case nancy sievewright hadnt been at all happy when clarke had announced herself at the intercom but at last shed come downstairs and told the detective that she wanted hot chocolate theres a place near the top of the street inside the cafe they ordered their drinks and settled on opposing leather couches sievewright looked like shed not had enough sleep she was still wearing a short skirt threads trailing from it and a thin denim jacket but her legs were wrapped in thick black tights and there were knitted fingerless gloves on her hands shed asked for whipped cream and marshmallows in her drink and cupped the mug between her palms as she sipped and chewed any more grief from mr anderson clarke asked sievewright just shook her head we spoke to sol goodyear clarke continued tou didnt tell us he lived in the same street the body was found why should i clarke just shrugged he doesnt seem to see himself as your boyfriend hes protecting me sievewright snapped back from what clarke asked but the young woman wasnt about to answer that there was music playing quite loudly and a speaker in the ceiling directly overhead it was some sort of dance track with a pulsing rhythm and it was giving clarke a headache she went to the counter and asked for it to be turned down the assistant obliged albeit grudgingly and with minimal effect why i like this place sievewright said the surly staff the music sievewright peered at clarke over the rim of her mug so what did sol say about me just that youre not his girlfriend speaking to him got me wondering though what about about the night of the attack it was some nutter in a pub i dont mean the attack on sol im talking about the poet you were on your way to buy stuff from sol so you either stumbled across the body on your way up the lane or on your way back down whats the difference sievewright was shuffling her feet looking down at them as if they were no longer under her control quite a big difference actually remember when i came to your flat that first time sievewright nodded there was something you said the way you said something and i was thinking about it yesterday after id been talking to sol the young woman took the bait what she asked trying not to sound too interested you told us i didnt see anything but you put the stress on see when im guessing most people would have emphasised the anything made me wonder if you were doing that thing of not quite telling the truth but at the same time managing not to tell an outright lie youve lost me sievewrights knees were bouncing like pistons i think maybe youd gone to sols door rung the bell and waited you knew he was expecting you maybe you stood there for a while thinking hed be back soon maybe you tried his mobile but he wasnt answering because he was getting himself stabbed clarke nodded slowly so youre outside his flat and suddenly you hear something at the bottom of the lane you go to the corner and take a look but sievewright was shaking her head emphatically okay then clarke conceded you dont see anything but you do hear something dont you nancy the young woman looked at her for a long time then broke off eye contact and took another slurp of hot chocolate when she spoke the music covered whatever it was she said i didnt catch that clarke apologised i said yes you heard something a car it pulled up and she paused lifting her eyes to the ceiling in thought eventually she looked at clarke again first off there was this groaning i thought maybe a drunk was about to be sick his words seemed all slurred could have been saying something in russian though that would make sense wouldnt it she seemed keen for clarke to agree so clarke nodded again and then a car she prompted it pulled up door opened and i heard this noise just a dull sort of thump and no more groans how can you be sure it was a car didnt sound like a van or a lorry tou didnt look by the time i turned the corner it was gone there was just a body slumped next to the wall i think i know why you screamed clarke stated you thought jit was sol at first yes but when i got close i saw it wasnt why didnt you run that couple arrived i did try to leave but the man told me i lould stay if id scarpered itd have looked bad for me wouldnt t and he couldve given you my description true enough clarke admitted what made you think it might sol when you deal drugs you make enemies such as the bastard who knifed him outside the pub clarke was nodding thoughtfully any others sievewright saw what she was getting at you think maybe they killed the poet by mistake im not sure how much sense did it make the trail of blood led back to the multistorey meaning whoever had attacked todorov mustve known he wasnt sol goodyear but as for the coup de grace well it could have been the same person but not necessarily and sievewright was spot on dealers made enemies maybe she would put that point to sol himself see if he had any names for her likelihood was of course that hed keep them to himself maybe intent on exacting his own revenge she imagined sol rubbing at the ragged line of stitches as if trying to erase them imagined the two boys growing up sol and his wee brother todd grandad dead in jail and parents going to pieces at what point had todd decided to cut his brother adrift and had sol suffered as a result can i get another sievewright was asking lifting her empty mug your turn to pay clarke reminded her ive got no money clarke sighed and handed her a fiver and get me another cappuccino she said hes a hard man to pin down terence blackman said fluttering his hands blackman ran a gallery of contemporary art on william street in the citys west end the gallery consisted of two rooms with white walls and sanded wooden flooring blackman himself was barely five feet tall skinny with a slight paunch and was probably thirty or forty years older than he dressed the thatch of brown hair looked dyed and might even have been an expensive weavejob an assortment of nips and tucks had stretched the skin tight over the face so that blackmans range of expressions was limited according to the web he acted as roddy denholms agent so where is he now rebus asked stepping around a sculpture which looked like a mass brawl of wire coat hangers melbourne i think could be hong kong any of his stuff here today theres actually a waiting list half a dozen buyers money no object russians rebus guessed blackman stared at him im sorry inspector why was it you wanted to see roddy hes been working on a project at the parliament an albatross around all our necks blackman sighed mr denholm needed bits and pieces of recording done and the responsible has turned up dead what tub names charles riordan dead im afraid so there was a fire blackman slapped his palms to his cheeks are the tapes all right rebus stared at him nice of you to show concern sir oh well yes of course its a terrible tragedy for the family and um i think the recordings are fine blackman gave silent thanks and then asked what this had to do with the artist mr riordan was murdered sir were wondering if hed recorded something he shouldnt have at the parliament you mean any reason why mr denholm chose the urban regeneration committee for his project ive not the faintest idea then you see why i need to talk to him maybe youve got a number for his mobile he doesnt always answer nevertheless a message could be left i suppose so blackman didnt sound keen so if you could give me the number rebus pressed the dealer sighed again and gestured for rebus to follow him unlocking a door at the back of the room it was a cramped office the size of a box room and with unframed canvases and uncanvased frames everywhere blackmans own phone was charging but he unplugged it and pressed the keys until the artists number showed on the screen rebus punched it into his own phone while asking how much denholms work tended to fetch depends on size materials manhours a ballpark figure between thirty and fifty thousand pounds rebus awaited the dealers nodded confirmation and how many does he knock out each year blackman scowled as i told you theres a waiting list so which one did andropov buy sergei andropov has a good eye id happened to acquire an early example of roddys work in oils probably painted the year he left glasgow school of art blackman lifted a postcard from the desk it was a reproduction of the painting its called hopeless to rebus it looked as if a child had taken a line for a walk hopeless just about summed it up fetched a record price for one of roddys prevideo works the dealer added and how much did you pocket mr blackman a percentage inspector now if youll excuse me but rebus wasnt about to let go nice to see my taxes going into your pocket if you mean the parliament commission youve no need to worry first albannach bank is underwriting the whole thing as in paying for it blackman nodded abruptly now you really must excuse me generous of them rebus commented fab is a tremendous patron of the arts it was rebuss turn to nod just a couple more questions sir any idea why andropov is moving into scottish art because he likes it is the same true of all these other russian millionaires and billionaires ive no doubt some are buying for investment others for pleasure and some as a way of letting everyone else know how rich they are blackman offered the thinnest of smiles there may be an element of that same as with their caribbean yachts mines bigger than yours and the mansions in london the jewellery for the trophy wife im sure youre right still doesnt explain the interest in scotland theyd moved back out of the office into the gallery space there are old ties inspector russians revere robert burns for example perhaps seeing him as an ideal of communism i forget which leader it was lenin maybe who said that if there was to be a revolt in europe it would most likely start in scotland but thats all changed hasnt it were talking capitalists not communists old ties blackman repeated maybe they still think theres a revolution on the cards and he smiled wistfully making rebus think the man had at one time been a cardcarrier hell why not rebus had grown up in fife solidly working class and full coal mines fife had elected britains first maybe even the nly communist mp in the s and s thered been plenty of smmunist councillors rebus wasnt old enough for the general pstrike but he remembered an aunt telling him about it barricades erected towns and villages cut off udi basically the peoples kingdom of fife he had a little smile to himself nodding at terence blackman by revolution you mean independence could hardly make a worse fist of it than the current lot blackmans mobile was ringing and he pulled it from his pocket walking away from rebus and giving a little flick of the hand hinting at dismissal thanks for your time rebus muttered heading for the door on the pavement outside he tried the artists number it rang and rang until an automated voice told him to leave a message he did so then tried another number siobhan clarke picked up enjoying your leisure time she asked toure one to talk is that an espresso machine i hear had to get out of the station corbyns brought derek starr back we knew it would happen we did she conceded so im having a bit of a blether with nancy sievewright she tells me that the night of the todorov killing she was at sols house trying to get some stuff only sol was otherwise occupied as we now know but nancy heard a car draw up and someone jump out and whack our poet across the back of the head so he was attacked twice it would seem so same person each time dont know i was beginning to wonder if sol himself might have been the intended target second time around its a possibility tou sound sceptical is nancy in earshot popped to the loo well for what its worth how about this todorovs jumped in the car park that much we know he staggers into the night but the attacker calmly gets into his or her car and follows decides to finish the job meaning the car was in the multistorey not necessarily couldve been parked on the street is it worth another trip to the city chambers go back through the video up till now we were looking at pedestrians ask your friend at central monitoring to bring us numberplates for any cars going in or out of kings stables road she seemed to be considering it thing is starrs busily rewinding to the mugging scenario youve not told him about the car not yet are you going to he asked teasingly the alternative being keep it to myself just like you would then if im right and hes wrong i get the applause youre learning ill have to mull it over but he could tell she was already half convinced so what are you up to i hear traffic bit of windowshopping pull the other one she paused again nancys coming back i better hang up tell me did starr make one of his into the breach speeches what do you think ill bet goodyear lapped it up im not so sure col liked it though ive sent him and phyl to first albannach janneys got todorovs account details took him long enough well hes had a lot on his plate wining and dining the russians at gleneagles not to mention rebus could have added hanging around the granton seafront with cafferty and andropov instead he said his goodbyes and hung up looked around him at the small shops womens boutiques mostly realised he was a twominute walk from the caledonian hotel why the hell not he asked himself answer no reason at all at reception he asked for mr andropovs room but no one was answering the clerk asked if he wanted to leave a message but he shook his head and sauntered into the bar it wasnt freddie serving this bartender was young and blonde and had an east european accent to her opening question rebus replied that hed have a highland park she offered him ice and he sensed she was new either to the job or to scotland he shook his head and asked where she was from cracow she said in poland rebus just nodded his ancestors had come from poland but that was as much as he knew about the place he slid on to a stool and scooped up some nuts from a bowl here we are she said placing the drink in front of him and some water please of course she sounded flustered annoyed to have made the mistake about a pint of tap water arrived in a jug rebus added the merest dribble to the glass and swirled it in his hand meeting someone she asked hes here to see me i think rebus turned towards the speaker andropov must have been sitting in the same booth the one with the blind spot he managed a smile but his eyes were cold henchman not with you rebus asked andropov ignored this another bottle of water he told the barkeeper and no ice this time she nodded and took the bottle from a fridge unscrewing it and pouring so inspector andropov was saying is it really me youre looking for just happened to be in the area i was visiting terence blackmans gallery you like art andropovs eyebrows had gone up im very keen on roddy denholm especially those early ones where he got the preschool kids to do some doodles i think you are being mocking andropov had picked up his drink on my room he instructed the bartender then to rebus join me please this is the same booth rebus asked as they got settled im not sure i understand the booth you were in the night alexander todorov was here i didnt even know he was in the bar cafferty paid for his drink after the poet had gone cafferty then came over here and joined you rebus paused you and the minister for economic development im impressed andropov seemed to admit really i am i can see you are not a man to cut corners cant be bought off either im sure of that too the russian gave another smile again it didnt reach his eyes so what were you chatting about with jim bakewell strange as it may seem we were discussing economic development toure thinking of investing in scotland i find it such a welcoming country but weve none of the stuff youre interested in no gas or coal or steel you do have gas and coal actually and oil of course about twenty years worth in the north sea yes but youre forgetting the waters to the west plenty of oil in the atlantic inspector and eventually we will master the technology allowing us to extract it then there are the alternative energies wind and wave dont forget all that hot air in the parliament rebus took a sip of his drink savouring it doesnt explain why youre eyeing up derelict land in edinburgh tou do keep a watchful eye dont you comes with the territory is it because of mr cafferty could be how did you two get to know one another through business inspector all of it above board i assure you that why the authorities back in moscow are preparing to take you down politics andropov explained with a pained expression and a refusal to grease the necessary palms so youre being made an example of events will run their course he lifted his glass to his lips a lot of rich men are in jail in russia youre not scared of joining them andropov just shrugged lucky youve made plenty of friends here not just labour but the snp too must be nice to feel so wanted still the russian said nothing so rebus decided on a change of topic tell me about alexander todorov what would you like to know you mentioned that he got kicked out of his teaching post for being too friendly with the students tea im not finding anything about it in the records it was hushed up but plenty of people in moscow knew funny though that youd tell me that and forget to mention that the two of you grew up together same age same neighbourhood andropov looked at him once again i admit im impressed how well did you know him hardly at all im afraid i came to represent everything alexander detested he would probably use words like greed and ruthlessness while i prefer selfreliance and dynamism he was an oldfashioned communist tou know the english word bolshie it has its roots in bolshe vism a russian word the bolsheviks were fairly ruthless them elves but these days bolshie just means awkward or stubborn thats what alexander was you knew he was living in edinburgh i think i saw it mentioned in a newspaper did the two of you meet no funny he started drinking here is it andropov shrugged again and took another sip of water so here you both are in edinburgh two men who grew up together famous in your separate ways and you didnt think to get in touch we would have had nothing to say to one another andropov declared then would you like another drink inspector rebus noticed that hed finished the whisky he shook his head and started to rise from the booth ill be sure to mention to mr bakewell that you dropped by andropov was saying mention it to cafferty too if you like rebus retorted hell tell you once i get my teeth into something i dont let go and yet the pair of you seem very similar a pleasure talking to you inspector outside rebus tried to get a cigarette lit in the swirling breeze he had his head tucked into his jacket when the taxi pulled up which meant he escaped the attention of megan macfarlane and roddy liddle the msp and her assistant marching into the hotel lobby eyes fixed ahead of them rebus blowing smoke skywards wondered if sergei andropov would hesitate to tell them too about his recent visitor as siobhan clarke walked into the narrow cid room at west end police station there was applause only two of the six desks were occupied but both men wanted to show their appreciation feel free to keep ray reynolds as long as you like di shug davidson added with a grin before introducing her to a detective constable called adam bruce davidson had his feet up on the desk chair tilted back nice to see you hard at it clarke commented wheres everyone else probably getting some christmas shopping done can i expect a little something from you this year shiv i was thinking of sticking some giftwrap on ray and posting him back dont you dare any joy with sol goodyear im not sure joy is quite the right word hes a sod isnt he couldnt be more different from his brother you know todd goes to church on a sunday so he said talk about chalk and cheese davidson was shaking his head slowly can we talk about larry fintry instead what about him is he on remand davidson gave a snort cells are bursting at the seams shiv you know that as well as i do so hes out on bail anything short of genocide and cannibalism these days bails a npp so where can i find him hes in a hostel up in bruntsfield what sort of hostel addiction problems doubt hed be there this time of day though davidson checked his watch hunter square or the meadows maybe i was just in a cafe off hunter square see any nutters hanging around i saw a few street people clarke corrected him shed noticed that although bruce was glued to a computer screen he was actually playing minesweeper the benches behind the old hospital davidson was saying he likes to hang out there sometimes might be a bit chilly though dropin centres on the grassmarket and cowgate are another possibility what is it you want him for im starting to wonder if there might be a price on sol goodyears head davidson gave a hoot little turds not worth it all the same and no one in their right mind would give crazy larry the job all this comes down to shiv is sol hassling larry for money owed it was probably when sol said thered be no more dope coming that larry blew one of his last remaining fuses rewiring thats what the guy needs dc bruce added eyes still fixed on the game in front of him if you want to go traipsing after crazy larry davidson said thats fine but dont expect to get anything out of him and i still dont see sol goodyear as the target of a hit he must have enemies but hes got friends too clarke narrowed her eyes meaning word is hes back in big gers employ well not employ exactly but selling with caffertys blessing any proof of that davidson shook his head after we spoke on the phone i made a few calls and thats what i started to hear tell you something else though what birdies are saying derek starrs been brought back from fettes to head your inquiry at the next desk bruce started to make a little clucking sound bit of a kick in the teeth isnt it davidson added stands to reason derek would take over hes a rank above me didnt seem to bother the bosses when it was you and a certain di called rebus i really am going to send reynolds back here clarke warned him youll have to ask derek starrs permission she stared him out and he burst into a laugh have your fun while you can she told him heading for the door back in her car she wondered what else she could do to keep away from gayfield square answer not much rebus had mentioned cctv maybe she could make a detour by way of the city chambers and put in that request or she could call megan macfarlane and arrange another meeting this time to talk about charles riordan and his taping of her committee then there was jim bakewell rebus wanted her to ask about the drink hed had with sergei andropov and big ger cafferty cafferty he seemed to loom over the city and yet very few of edinburghs citizens would even know of his existence rebus had spent half his career trying to bring the gangster down with rebus retired the problem would become hers not because she wanted it but because she doubted rebus would let it go hed want her to finish what he couldnt she thought again of the nights theyd been staying late at the office rebus running his most galling unsolveds past her what was she supposed to do with them these legacies they felt to her like unwanted baggage she had a pair of ugly pewter candlesticks at home gifted to her in an aunts will couldnt bring herself to throw them out so they lay tucked away at the back of a drawer also she felt the best place for rebuss old casenotes her phone rang prefix someone was calling from gayfield square she thought she could guess who hello sure enough it was derek starr youve snuck out on me he said trying to inject some surface levity into the accusation had to go talk to west end what about sol goodyear there was a momentary silence remind me he said lives close to where todorov was found it was a friend of his who discovered the body and just wanted to confirm a few details he would know damned well she was holding something back just as she knew there was nothing he could do about it so when can we expect to see you back in the body of the kirk ds clarke ive got one more stop to make at the city chambers cctv he guessed thats right i should only be half an hour or so heard anything from rebus not a dickybird dci macrae tells me hes been suspended thats about the size of it not much of a swansong is it was there anything else derek toure my number two siobhan thats how it stays unless i think youre playing away meaning what exactly dont want you picking up any more bad habits from rebus unable to take any more she ended the call pompous git she muttered turning the ignition so what did you get up to last night then hawes asked she was in the passenger seat colin tibbet driving couple of drinks with some mates he glanced in her direction tou jealous phyl jealous of you and your beery pals sure am col thought so he said with a grin they were heading for the southeast corner of the city towards the bypass and the green belt it hadnt surprised too many of the locals when fab had been granted permission to construct their new hq on what had previously been designated as protected land a badgers sett had been relocated and a ninehole golf course purchased for the exclusive use of employees the huge glass building was just under a mile from the new royal infirmary which hawes guessed was handy for any bank employees suffering paper cuts from counting all those notes on the other hand it wouldnt surprise her if the fab compound turned out to have its own bupa sickbay i stayed in since you ask she said now watching col slow to a halt as the lights ahead turned red he did that thing they taught you in driving schools not braking hard but changing back down through the gears up till now everyone shed met had started ignoring the manoeuvre as soon as they passed their test but not colin she bet he ironed his underpants too it was really starting to rile her that despite each deepseated fault she located she still fancied him maybe it was a case of any port in a storm she hated the idea that she couldnt live her life perfectly adequately without a bloke in tow but it was beginning to look that way anything good on the box he asked her a documentary about how men are becoming women he looked at her trying to work out whether she was lying its true she insisted all that oestrogen in the tap water you lot gulp it down and then start growing breasts he concentrated for a moment how does oestrogen get into the tap water do i have to spell it out she mimed the action of flushing a toilet then theres all the additives in meat its changing your chemical balance i dont want my chemical balance changed she had to laugh at that might explain something though she teased him what why youve started fancying derek starr he scowled and she laughed again way you were watching him give that speech mightve been russell crowe in gladiator or mel gibson in braveheart i saw braveheart in the cinema tibbet told her the audience were on their feet cheering and punching the air never seen anything like it thats because scots dont often get to feel good about themselves tou think we need independence maybe she conceded just so long as people like first albannach dont go scuttling south what was their profit last year eight billion something like that tou mean eight million eight billion she repeated that cant be right you calling me a liar she was wondering how hed managed to turn the conversation around without her noticing makes you wonder doesnt it he asked now wonder what where the real power is he took his eyes off the road long enough to glance at her want to do something later with you you mean he offered a shrug christmas fair opens tonight we could go take a look we could and a bite of supper after ill think about it they were signalling to turn in at the gates of first albannach banks hq ahead of them lay a glass and steel structure four storeys high and as long as a street a guard emerged from the gatehouse to take their names and the cars registration parking bay sixoheight he told them and though there were plenty of spaces closer to their destination hawes watched her colleague head obediently towards dont worry she told him as he pulled on the handbrake i can walk from here and walk they did passing serried ranks of sports cars family saloons and xs the grounds were still being landscaped and just behind one corner of the main complex could be glimpsed gorse bushes and one of the golf courses fairways when the doors slid open they were in a tripleheight atrium there was an arcade of shops behind the reception desk pharmacy supermarket cafe newsagent a noticeboard provided information about the creche gym and swimming pool escalators led to the next level up with glassfronted lifts serving the floors above that the receptionist beamed a smile at them welcome to fab she said if youll just sign in and show me some photo id they did so and she announced that mr janney was in a meeting but his secretary was expecting them third floor shell meet you at the lift they were handed laminated passes and another smile a security guard processed them through a metaldetector after which they scooped up keys phones and loose change expecting trouble hawes asked the man code green he intoned solemnly a relief to us all the lift took them to the third floor where a young woman in a black trousersuit was waiting the asized manila envelope was held out in front of her as hawes took it the woman nodded once then turned and marched back down a seemingly endless corridor tibbet hadnt even had a chance to exit the lift and as hawes stepped back into it the doors slid shut and they were on their way back down again no more than three minutes after entering the building they were out in the cold and wondering what had just happened thats not a building hawes stated its a machine tibbet signalled his agreement by whistling through his teeth then scanned the car park which bay are we in again the one at the end of the universe hawes told him starting to cross the tarmac back in the passenger seat she pulled open the envelope and xbrought out a dozen sheets photocopied bank statements there was a yellow postit stuck to the front the handwritten message speculated that todorov had funds elsewhere as indicated by the client when he opened his account there was a single transfer involving a bank in moscow the note was signed stuart janney he was comfortable enough hawes announced six grand in the current account and eighteen in savings she checked the transaction dates no significant deposits or withdrawals in the days leading up to his death and no transactions at all thereafter whoever took his cash card they dont seem to be using it they could have cleaned him out tibbet acknowledged twenty four k so much for the starving artist garrets mustnt be as fashionable these days hawes agreed she was punching a number into her phone clarke picked up and hawes relayed the highlights to her took out a hundred the day he was killed where from machine at waverley station hawes frowned suddenly why did he leave edinburgh from one station but come back to the other he was meeting charles riordan i think riordan frequented some curry house nearby cant really check with him though can we not really clarke admitted hawes could hear voices in the background all the same it sounded a lot calmer than gayfield square where are you shiv she asked city chambers asking about cctv how long till youre back at base an hour maybe you sound inconsolable any word from our favourite di assuming you mean rebus rather than starr the answers no tell her tibbet said about the bank colin says to tell you we enjoyed our visit to first albannach plush was it ive stayed at worse resorts they had everything in there but flumes did you see stuart janney he was in a meeting to tell the truth it was a real production line number in and out and thank you very much theyve got shareholders to protect when your profits are hitting ten billion you dont want any bad publicity hawes turned to colin tibbet siobhan she told him says the profit last year was ten billion give or take clarke added give or take hawes repeated for tibbets benefit makes you wonder tibbet repeated quietly with a slow shake of the head hawes stared at him kissable lips she was thinking younger than her and less experienced there was material there she could work with maybe starting tonight talk to you later she told clarke ending the call dr scarlett colwell was waiting for rebus at her office in george square she was on one of the upper floors meaning the view would have been great if not for the buildup of condensation between the layers of doubleglazing depressing isnt it she apologised constructed forty years ago and fit for nothing but demolition rebus turned his attention instead to the shelves of russian textbooks plaster busts of marx and lenin were being used as bookends on the wall opposite posters and cards had been pinned up including a photograph of president yeltsin dancing colwells desk was next to the window but facing into the room two tables had been pushed together leaving just enough room for eight chairs to be arranged around them there was a kettle on the floor and she crouched down next to it spooning coffee granules into two mugs milk she asked thanks rebus said glancing towards her shock of hair her skirt was stretched tight delineating the line of a hip sugar just milk the kettle finished boiling and she poured handing him his cup before getting back to her feet they stood very close to one another until she apologised again for the lack of space and retreated behind her desk rebus content to rest his backside against the table thanks for seeing me she blew on her coffee not at all i was devastated to hear about mr riordan you met him at the poetry library rebus guessed she nodded then had to push the hair away from her face and at word power it was rebuss turn to nod thats the bookshop where mr todorov did a reading colwell pointed towards the wall this time when rebus looked he picked out the photograph of alexander todorov in full poetic flow one arm dramatically raised mouth agape doesnt look like a bookshop rebus declared they moved it to a bigger venue cafe on nicolson street even so it was packed hes in his element isnt he rebus was studying the picture more closely did you take this dr colwell im not very good she started to apologise im the last one to judge he turned and gave her a smile so charles riordan taped this session too thats right she paused in fact its a happy coincidence that you called me inspector oh because i was on the verge of phoning you to ask a favour what is it i can do for you dr colwell theres a magazine called the london review of books they saw the obituary i wrote in the scotsman and they want to publish one of alexanders poems with you so far rebus lifted the cup to his lips its a new poem in russian one he recited at the poetry library she gave a little laugh in fact i think hed only just finished it that day point being i dont have a copy of it im not sure anyone does have you had a look through his wastepaper bin would it sound heartless if i said yes not at all but you didnt find it no which is why i spoke to a nice man at mr riordans studio thatll be terry grimm she nodded again pushed her hair back again he said there was a recording rebus thought of the hour hed spent in siobhans car the pair of them listening to a dead man tou want to borrow it he guessed remembering that todorov had indeed recited some of the poems in russian just long enough to write a translation it would be my memorial to him i suppose i cant see a problem with that she beamed and he got the feeling that if the desk hadnt been there she might even have reached over and hugged him instead she asked if she would have to listen to the cd at the station or would it be possible to take it away with her the station one place rebus couldnt be seen i can bring it to you he said and her smile widened before melting away deadlines next week she suddenly realised no problem rebus assured her and im sorry we havent tracked down mr todorovs killer yet her face fell further im sure youre doing your utmost thanks for the vote of confidence he paused touve still not asked me why im here i was thinking youd get round to telling me ive been researching mr todorovs life looking for enemies alexander made an enemy of the state inspector that much i believe but one story ive been hearing is that he was dismissed from a lectureship for getting too friendly with his students thing is i think the person who told me that was trying to sell me a pup but she was shaking her head actually its true alexander told me about it himself the charges were trumped up of course they just wanted him out by fair means or foul she sounded aggrieved on the poets behalf do you mind if i ask did he ever try anything with you dr colwell i have a partner inspector with respect dr colwell youre a beautiful woman and i get the impression alexander todorov liked women im not sure the existence of any partner short of a ninja assassin would have deterred him she gave another perfect smile lowering her lashes in feigned modesty well she admitted youre right of course after a few drinks alexanders libido seemed always to be refreshed a nice way of putting it are the words his all my own work inspector he seems to have thought of you as a friend though or he wouldnt have taken you into his confidence im not sure he had any real friends writers are like that sometimes they see the rest of us as source material can you imagine being in bed with someone and knowing theyre going to write about it afterwards knowing the whole world will be reading about that most intimate of moments i take your point rebus paused to clear his throat but he must have had some way of quenching that libido you mentioned oh he had women inspector students here in edinburgh i couldnt say or how about abigail thomas at the poetry library you seemed to think she had a crush on him probably not reciprocated colwell said dismissively then after a moments thought tou really think alexander was killed by a woman rebus shrugged he was thinking of todorov more than a few drinks under his belt weaving his way down kings stables road a woman suddenly offering him nostrings sex would he have gone with a stranger probably but even more likely with someone hed known did mr todorov ever mention a man called andropov he asked she mouthed the name several times deep in thought then gave up sorry she saidi another long shot how about someone called cafferty im not really helping am i she said as she shook her head sometimes the things we rule out are as important as the ones we rule in he reassured her like in sherlock holmes she said when youve eliminated the she broke off with a frown i can never remember that quote but you must know it he nodded not wanting her to think him illread every day on his way to work he passed a statue of sherlock holmes by the roundabout on leith street turned out it was marking the spot where theyd knocked down conan doyles childhood home what is it then she was asking he gave a shrug im like you never seem to get it right she rose from her chair and came around the desk her skirt brushing against his legs as she squeezed past she lifted a book from one of the shelves from the spine rebus could tell it was a collection of quotations she found the doyle section and ran a finger down it finding what she was looking for when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth she frowned again thats not how i remember it i thought it was to do with eliminating the possible rather than its opposite mmm rebus said hoping shed think he was agreeing with her he placed his empty mug on the table well dr colwell seeing how ive done you a favour quid pro quo she clapped the book shut dust rose from its pages i was just wondering if i could have the key to todorovs flat as it happens youre in luck someone from building services was supposed to stop by and get it but so far no sign what will they do with all his stuff the consulate said theyd take it he must have some family back in russia shed gone behind the desk again and opened a drawer bringing out the keychain rebus took it from her with a nod of thanks theres a servitor on the ground floor here she explained if im not around you can always leave it with him she paused and you wont forget that recording trust me its just that the studio seemed pretty sure its the only copy left poor mr riordan what a terrible way to die back outside again rebus descended the steps from george square to buccleuch place there were a few students around they looked the only word for it was studious he stopped at the bottom of the steps to light a cigarette but the temperature was sinking and he decided he might as well smoke it indoors todorovs flat seemed unchanged from his first visit except that the scraps of paper from the bin had been laid flat on the desk scarlett colwell most probably seeking the elusive poem rebus had forgotten about those six copies of astapovo blues had to find someone with an ebay account so he could shift them looking more closely at the room he decided someone had removed some of the poets book collection colwell again or some other member of staff rebus wondered if hed been beaten to it a glut of todorov memorabilia bringing prices down he realised his phone was ringing and took it out didnt recognise the number but it had the international code on the front detective inspector rebus speaking he said hello its roddy denholm returning your mysterious call the voice was an educated angloscots drawl not too much of a mystery mr denholm and i do appreciate you taking the trouble youre lucky im a night owl inspector its the middle of the day here but not in singapore mr blackman thought either melbourne or hong kong denholm laughed a smokers throaty laugh i suppose i could be anywhere actually couldnt i i could be around the next corner for all you know bloody wonderful things mobile phones if you are around the next corner sir be cheaper to do this in person tou could always hop on a jet to singapore trying to lower my carbon footprint sir rebus blew cigarette smoke towards the livingroom ceiling so where are you right now inspector buccleuch place ah yes the university district standing in a dead mans flat not a sentence i think ive ever heard the artist sounded duly impressed he wasnt quite in your line of work sir poet called alexander todorov ive heard of him he was killed just over a week ago and your name has cropped up in the inquiry do tell it sounded as though denholm was getting himself comfortable on a hotel bed rebus likewise sat down on the sofa an elbow on one knee youve been doing a project at the parliament there was a man making some sound recordings for you charlie riordan im afraid hes dead too rebus heard low whistling on the line someone torched his house are the tapes okay as far as we know sir denholm caught rebuss tone i must sound an insensitive bastard he admitted dont fret it was the first thing your dealer asked too denholm chuckled poor guy though you knew him not until the parliament project seemed likeable capable didnt really talk to him that much well mr riordan had also been doing some work with alexander todorov christ does that mean im next rebus couldnt tell if he was joking or not i wouldnt have thought so sir youre not phoning to warn me i just thought it an interesting coincidence except that i didnt know alexander todorov from adam maybe not but one of your fans did sergei andropov i know the name he collects your work russian businessman grew up with mr todorov rebus heard another whistle youve never met him not that i know of there was silence for a moment ttou think this andropov guy killed the poet were keeping an open mind was it some obscure isotope like that guy in london he was beaten to a pulp before someone caved his skull in not exactly subtle then not exactly tell me something mr denholm how did you come to choose the urban regeneration committee for your project they chose me inspector we asked if anyone would be interested in taking part and their chairman said she was up for it megan macfarlane no shortage of ego there inspector i speak as one who knows im sure you do sir rebus heard something like a doorbell thatll be room service denholm explained ill let you go then rebus said thanks for calling mr denholm no problem one last thing though rebus paused just long enough to ensure he had the artists full attention before you let them in best check that it really is room service he snapped shut his phone and allowed himself a little smile cant be that much of it if it fits on to one of these siobhan clarke commented she was back in the cid suite and dci macrae being elsewhere had commandeered his room the better to accommodate terry grimm seated at her bosss desk she held the clear plastic memory stick between thumb and forefinger angling it in the light ttoud be surprised grimm said im guessing theres about sixteen hours on there could have squeezed more in if there had been anything usable unfortunately the heat of the fire had done for most of it hed brought the evidence sacks with him they were tied shut but still carried the faintest aroma of charcoal did anything catch your eye clarke paused or ear i suppose i should say grimm shook his head tell you what i did do though he reached into his inside pocket and drew out a cd in a plastic wallet charlie taped the russian poet at another event few weeks back happened to come across it at the studio so i burned you a copy he handed it over thanks she said some lecturer at the university was after the other show charlie taped but as far as i know youve got the only existing copy nameofcolwell thats it he stared at the backs of his hands any nearer to finding out who killed him she gestured in the direction of the main office you can see were not exactly resting on our laurels he nodded but his eyes never left hers good way of avoiding an answer he stated its a case of finding the why mr grimm if you can help shed some light wed be incredibly grateful ive been turning it over in my head hazel and me have bounced it around too still doesnt make any sense well if you do think of anything she was rising to her feet signalling that the meeting was over through the glass partition she could see that there was a hubbub in the outer office out of it emerged todd goodyear he knocked once and entered closing the door after him if im going to manage to actually hear whats on those committee recordings im going to need to shift my stuff he complained its like the monkey house out there he recognised terry grimm and gave a little nod of greeting the parliament tapes grimm guessed toure still trawling through them still trawling goodyear had a sheaf of paper under one arm he held the sheets out for clarke to take she saw that he had typed up his detailed notes on the contents of each tape there was screeds of the stuff in her early days as a detective she too would have been this meticulous back before rebus showed her how to cut corners thanks she said and this is for you handing him the memory stick mr grimm reckons theres about sixteen hours worth goodyear gave a protracted sigh and asked terry grimm how things were at the studio just about coping thanks clarke was sifting the typed sheets did anything here jump out at you she asked goodyear not one single thing he informed her imagine how we felt grimm added sitting there for days on end listening to politician after politician drone on goodyear just shook his head unwilling to imagine himself in that role what you got was the good stuff grimm assured him clarke noticed that it had quietened down in the main office what was the noise about she asked goodyear bit of a freeforall at the mortuary he explained casually tossing the memory stick into the air and catching it someones trying to claim todorovs body di starr wanted to know who was the fastest driver another toss another catch dc reynolds claimed he was not everyone agreed he had been slow to notice that clarke was glaring at him but now his voice trailed off i should have told you straight off he guessed thats right she answered in a voice of quiet menace and then to terry grimm pc goodyear will see you out thanks again for coming she marched downstairs to the car park and got into her car started the ignition and drove she wanted to ask starr why he hadnt said anything why he hadnt asked her giving the job to one of his boys instead ray reynolds at that was it because shed gone off without telling him was it so shed know her place in future she had plenty of questions for di derek starr she turned right at the top of leith street then hard left on to north bridge straight across at the tron and a righthand turn crossing oncoming traffic and on to blair street passing nancy sievewrights flat again if talking heads really did reckon london a small city they should try edinburgh no more than eight minutes after leaving gayfield square she was pulling into the mortuary car park stopping alongside reynoldss car and wondering if shed beaten his time there was another car a big old mercedes benz parked between two of the mortuarys anonymous white transit vans clarke stalked past it to the door marked staff only turned the handle and went in there was no onen the corridor and no one in the staff room though steam was rising from the spout of a recently boiled kettle she moved through the holding area and opened another door into a further corridor up some stairs to the next level this was where the public entrance was it was where relatives waited to identify their loved ones and where the subsequent paperwork was taken care of usually it was a place of low sobbing quiet reflection utter and ghastly silence but not today she recognised nikolai stahov straight off he wore the same long black coat as when theyd first met alongside him stood a man who also looked russian maybe five years younger but almost as many inches taller and broader stahov was remonstrating in english with derek starr who stood with arms folded legs apart as if ready for a ruck next to him was reynolds and behind them the four mortuary staff we have right stahov was saying constitutional right moral right a murder inquiry is ongoing starr explained the body has to stay here in case further tests are required stahov glancing to his left had noticed clarke help us please he implored her she took a few steps forward what seems to be the problem starr glared at her the consulate wants to repatriate mr todorovs remains he explained alexander needs to be buried in his homeland stahov stated is there anything in his will to that effect clarke asked will or no will his wife is buried in moscow something ive been meaning to ask clarke interrupted stahov had turned completely towards her which seemed to annoy starr what actually happened to his wife cancer stahov told her they could have operated but she would have lost the baby she was carrying so she continued with the pregnancy stahov offered a shrug the baby was stillborn and by then the mother only had a few days to live the story seemed to have calmed the whole room clarke nodded slowly why the sudden urgency mr stahov alexander died eight days ago why wait till now all we want is to return him home with due respect to his international stature i wasnt sure he had that much stature in russia didnt you say that the nobel prize isnt such a big deal in moscow these days governments can have changes of heart what youre saying is youre under orders from the kremlin stahovs eyes gave nothing away there being no next of kin the state becomes responsible i have the authority to request his body but we have no authority to release it starr countered having shuffled around towards clarke the better to meet stahovs eyeline youre a diplomat you must be aware that there are protocols meaning what exactly meaning clarke explained well be hanging on to the body until instructed otherwise by judgment or decree it is scandalous stahov busied himself tugging at the cuffs of his coat im not sure how such a situation can be kept from public view go crying to the papers starr taunted him see where it getsyou start the process clarke counselled the russian thats all you lean do stahov met her eyes again and nodded slowly then turned on his heels and headed for the exit followed by his driver as soon as both men had left starr grabbed clarke by the arm what are you doing here he hissed she twisted out of his grip im where i should have been all along derek i left you in charge at gayfield you left without so much as a word perhaps starr sensed that this was not an argument he could win he glanced around at the onlookers reynolds the mortuary staff and allowed his face to soften a discussion for another time perhaps he offered clarke though shed already decided not to push it let him sweat for a moment as she pretended to think it over fine she said at last he nodded and turned to the mortuary attendants you did the right thing calling us if they try anything else you know where we are think theyll sneak him out in the middle of the night one of the men speculated one of his colleagues gave a chuckle been a while since weve had one of those davie he commented siobhan clarke decided not to ask they gathered around a table in the back room of the oxford bar word had gone out that john rebus needed a bit of privacy meaning they had the space to themselves nevertheless they kept their voices low first thing rebus had done was explain his suspension and admit that it was dangerous for them to be seen with him clarke had sipped her tonic water no gin tonight colin tibbet had looked to phyllida hawes for a lead if i have to choose between derek starr and yourself no contest hawes had decided no contest tibbet had echoed without sounding completely convinced whats the worst they can do to me todd goodyear had added send me back to uniform at west end its going to happen anyway and hed raised his halfpint of beer in rebuss direction after which theyd started detailing the days events rebus careful to edit his own version since he was supposed to be on suspension youve still not talked to megan macfarlane or jim bakewell he asked clarke ive been a bit busy john sorry goodyear said almost choking on a mouthful of ale that reminds me while you were at the mortuary bakewells office called theres a meeting with him pencilled in for tomorrow thanks for the headsup todd he winced visibly hawes was saying something about being thankful for any excuse to get out of the office isnt space to swing a cat tibbet concurred i opened my desk drawer this afternoon somebody had left half a sandwich in it did they treat you to lunch at the bank rebus asked just a couple of foie gras baps hawes informed him to be honest the place reminded me of a very slick and upmarket production line but a production line nonetheless ten billion in profits tibbet still couldnt take it in more than some countries gdps goodyear added heres hoping they stick around if we get independence rebus said put them and their nearest competitor together well its not a bad start for a wee country clarke was looking at him you think thats why stuart janneys staying close to megan macfarlane rebus shrugged nationalists wouldnt want the likes of fab packing up and shipping out that gives the bank a bit of leverage i didnt see any levers sticking out of ms macfarlane but she is the future isnt she banks dont make profits without playing a long game sometimes a very long game he grew thoughtful maybe theyre not the only ones at that his phone started to vibrate so he checked the number another mobile one he didnt know he flipped the phone open hello strawman caffertys pet name for rebus its origins all but lost down the years rebus was on his feet making for the front bar down the couple of steps and then out into the night youve changed your number rebus told the gangster every few weeks but i dont mind friends knowing it thats nice since he was outside rebus took the opportunity to get a cigarette going theyll be the death of you you know we all have to go sometime rebus was remembering what stone had said about taps on caffertys phones could they listen in on a mobile maybe another reason cafferty kept changing numbers i want to see you the gangster was saying when now of course any particular reason just come to the canal whereabouts on the canal you know cafferty drawled ending the conversation rebus stared at the phone before snapping it shut he had wandered out into the lane no problem this time of night no traffic and if any cars did venture along young street the noise they made was a giveaway so he stood there in the middle of the road smoking his cigarette and facing charlotte square one of the regulars had told him a while back that the georgian building facing him at the far end of the street was the residence of the first minister he wondered what the countrys leader made of the occasional motley crews to be found smoking outside the oxford bar the door opened and siobhan clarke emerged sliding her arms into the sleeves of her coat todd goodyear was right behind her a single halfpint having provided ample sufficiency that was cafferty rebus told them he wants to see me you two headed somewhere got to meet my girlfriend goodyear explained going to see the christmas lights its still november rebus complained they were switched on at six tonight and i thought id start heading home clarke added rebus wagged a finger should never leave a pub together people will talk why does cafferty want to see you clarke asked he didnt say are you going to go dont see why not wheres the meeting somewhere well lit i hope the canal near that bar at the fountainbridge basin what are phyl and col up to thinking about princes street gardens goodyear said ferris wheel and the ice rink are open for business clarkes eyes were fixed on rebus you after some backup the look on his face was answer enough well goodyear was turning up his collar as he examined the weather see you in the morning eh keep your nose clean todd rebus advised him watching as the young man headed towards castle street hes all right isnt he he offered clarke however was not to be deflected you cant just go meeting cafferty by yourself its not like its the first time but any one of them could be the last if im found floating at least youll know who to pull in dont you dare joke about this he rested the palm of his hand against her shoulder siobhan its fine he assured her but there is a fly of sorts in the ointment scd could be watching cafferty what i had a runin with them last night seeing the look on her face he withdrew his hand and held it up in a show of appeasement ill explain later but the thing is they want me keeping my distance then thats what you should do absolutely he said making to hand her stones business card and what i want you to do is ring this guy stone and tell him di rebus needs an urgent word what use the phone in the ox dont want him tracing your mobile you stay anonymous say rebus wants a meet at the petrol station then hang up christs sake john she was staring at the card hey another fortyeight hours and ill be out of your hair youre suspended from duty and youre still in my hair like a brush through the tangles eh rebus said with a smile more like malfunctioning curling tongs clarke told him but she headed back into the bar anyway to make the call took your time was caffertys opening line he was on the same footbridge across the canal hands in the pockets of his long camel hair coat wheres your car rebus asked glancing back towards the deserted patch of wasteland i walked only takes ten minutes and no bodyguard no need cafferty stated rebus lit another cigarette so you knew i was here the other night it was sergeis driver who recognised you the one whod stared daggers at rebus that night at the hotel were you with us all the way to granton it was a nice night for a drive rebus tried blowing smoke towards caffertys face but the breeze whipped it away its all legit you know follow us all you like thanks i will sergei loves scotland thats what it comes down to his dad used to read him treasure island i had to take him to queen street gardens pond theres supposed to be what gave robert louis stevenson the idea fascinating rebus was staring at the canals glassy surface might only be three or four feet deep but hed known men drown in it hes thinking of bringing his businesses here cafferty said didnt know we had a lot of tin and zinc mines well maybe not all his businesses i cant see the point really its not as if we dont have an extradition treaty with russia you sure about that cafferty said with a teasing smile anyway we do have a policy on political asylum dont we not sure your pal fits the bill cafferty just smiled again that night in the hotel rebus pushed on you and todorov then you and andropov plus a government minister called bakewell what was that really all about i thought id already explained id no idea who it was i bought a drink for tfou didnt know that todorov and andropov grew up together no rebus nicked ash into the air so what was it you were discussing with the minister for economic development im betting youve asked sergei the same question how do you think he answered he probably told you they were talking about economic development it happens to be true you seem to be in the market for a lot of land cafferty andropov puts up the money you act as his factor all above board does he know about your history as a landlord flats stuffed with tenants fire risks ignored dole cheques lifted and cashed you really are clutching at straws arent you anyone would think you were in there cafferty jabbed a finger towards the canal you own a flat on blair street its let to nancy sievewright and eddie gentry just the two tenants now rebus thought of it unusual for one of caffertys fire traps nancys friendly with sol goodyear he went on so friendly in fact that she gets her gear from him same night sol gets himself stabbed in haymarket inancy trips over todorovs body at the foot of sols lane rebus i had brought his face close to the gangsters see what im getting f t he hissed not really and now the consulate want to spirit todorovs body away those straws i mentioned rebus im losing count of them theyre not straws cafferty theyre chains and guess who it is they seem to be winding themselves around steady cafferty cautioned with language like that you might want to start writing a bit of poetry yourself problem with that is the only words i can find to rhyme with cafferty are evil and bastard the gangster grinned showing off expensive dental work then he sniffed the air and strolled to the far side of the bridge i grew up not too far from here did you know that i thought it was craigmillar but id an aunt and uncle in gorgie they looked after me when my mum was working dad legged it a month before i was due he turned towards rebus you didnt grow up in the city did you fife rebus stated tou wont remember the abattoir then occasionally youd get a bull making a break for it the alarm would sound and us kids would be kept indoors until the sharpshooter arrived i remember one time i watched from the window bloody great beast it was with snot and steam belching from it kicking up its legs at the thought of all that bloody freedom he paused right up until the moment the gunman went down on one knee got his aim right and shot it in the head those legs buckled and the gleam left its eyes for a time there i used to think that was me the last free bull toure full of bull all right rebus retorted thing is cafferty said with a smile that was almost ruful nowadays i think maybe its you rebus youre bucking and kicking and snorting because you cant deal with the idea of me being legit thats because idea is as far as it gets he paused nicking the remains of his cigarette into the water why the hell did you bring me here cafferty the gangster shrugged not too many chances left for these little teteatetes and when sergei told me youd followed us that night well maybe i was just looking for the opportunity im touched i heard on the news that di starrs been shipped in to head up the inquiry theyve already put you out to pasture havent they just as well the pensions healthy and all of it clean siobhans got her chance to shine now shes a match for you cafferty lets wait and see just so long as ive got a ringside seat caffertys attention had shifted to the high brick wall beyond which lay the development site nice talking to you rebus enjoy that walk into the sunset but rebus didnt budge have you heard about the russian guy in london got to be careful who you play with cafferty no ones about to poison me rebus sergei and me we see things the same way few years from now scotlands going to be independent not a shred of doubt about that sitting on thirty years worth of north sea oil and god alone knows how much more in the atlantic worstcase scenario we do a deal with westminster and end up with eighty or ninety per cent of the cut cafferty gave a slow shrug and then well go and spend the money on our usual leisure pursuits booze drugs and gambling put a supercasino in every city and watch the profits stack up another of your silent invasions eh soviets always did think thered be revolution in scotland wont matter to you though will it youll be out of the game for good cafferty gave a little wave of the hand and turned his back rebus stood his ground a bit longer but knew there was little to be gained from sticking around all the same he hesitated the cafferty of the other evening had been an actor on a stage with props including the car and the driver tonights cafferty was different more reflective lots of faces in caffertys wardrobe a mask for every occasion rebus considered offering him a lift home but why the hell would he want to do that instead he turned and headed back to his car lighting another cigarette on the way the gangsters story about the bull stayed with him was that how retirement would feel all that strange and disconcerting freedom but brutally short no leonard cohen for you when we get home he chided himself youre morbid enough as it is i instead he played rory gallagher big guns and bad penny kickback city and sinnerboy the whisky slipped down just the three large ones with about as much water again and after rory came jackie leven and page and plant after that he thought about calling siobhan then decided against it let her have a bit of a break from john rebuss worries he hadnt eaten anything but didnt feel hungry when his phone rang hed probably been asleep for the best part of an hour the whisky glass was still there on the arm of the chair his hand gripped around it didnt spill a drop john he congratulated himself hoisting his phone in his free hand hiya shiv he said having recognised her number checking up on me john her tone of voice said it all something had happened something bad spit it out he told her rising from the chair caffertys in intensive care she left it at that for a moment rebus clawed his free hand through his hair then realised he shouldnt have a free hand the glass had dropped to the carpet meaning he now had splashes of whisky on his shoes what happened he asked precisely the question i was about to ask you she blurted out what the hell happened at the canal we just talked talked cross my heart mustve been a pretty robust exchange then seeing how hes got a fractured skull plus broken bones contusions rebuss eyes narrowed he was found by the canal too right he was is that where you are now shug davidson took the trouble to call me ill be there in five minutes no you wont youve been drinking john your voice goes nasal after the first four or five so send a car for me john just send a fucking car siobhanp he ran the hand through his hair again pulling at it im being set up here he told himself john how can shug let you near far as hes concerned youre going to be a suspect if he lets a suspect walk into a crime scene tfes fine absolutely rebus was looking at his watch its about three hours since i left him when was the body found two and a half hours ago thats not good his mind was whirling he started towards the kitchen thinking maybe a gallon of tap water would help did you send calum stone on that wild goose chase yes shit hes here right now along with his partner rebus squeezed his eyes shut dont speak to them bit late for that i was talking to shug when they arrived stone introduced himself and guess what his first words to me were something along the lines of gosh you sound just like the woman who sent me on a wild goose chase to a petrol station in granton thats about the size of it all you can do is tell the truth shiv i ordered you to make that call and you were on suspension at the time something knew fine well christ im sorry siobhan the tap was still running the sink almost full maybe eight inches deep hed known men drown in far far less when the taxi dropped him at the leamington lift bridge she was waiting arms folded for all the world like the bouncer outside some exclusive club you cant be here she reiterated through gritted teeth i know he said plenty of onlookers people whod been heading home from a night out locals from the neighbouring tenements even a couple from one of the canal boats they stood on deck holding mugs of steaming liquid whys your hair wet clarke asked didnt have time to dry it he answered he could see everything no need to get closer socos shining their torches against the surface of the opposite footpath arc lamps being plugged into some sort of mooring point probably how the boats hooked up to electricity during their stay lots of quietly busy people there was a huddle around one particular area of walkway that where they found him he asked clarke nodded pretty much where he was when i left him couple on their way home stumbled across him one of the medics recognised the face west end came running and shug thought maybe id want to know there were socos up to their waists in the canal they wore the same sort of protection as anglers complete with braces holding up their oilskin trousers theyll find one of my cigarette butts rebus told clarke unless its floated away or been eaten by a duck thatll be nice when they trace the dna he turned towards her gripping one of her arms im not saying i wasnt here im saying he was right as rain when i left him she couldnt meet his eyes and he let her go dont think what youre thinking he said quietly tou dont know what im thinking he turned away again and saw di shug davidson giving orders to some of the uniforms from west end stone and prosser were just behind him deep in a discussion of their own any second now theyll see you clarke warned rebus nodded hed already taken a couple of steps back into the crowd of onlookers she followed him until they were standing to the rear this was where hed parked his car the time hed followed cafferty his head was thumping got any aspirin he asked no never mind i know where i can find some she caught his meaning youve got to be joking never more serious in my life she fixed her eyes on him then glanced back towards the canal and made her mind up ill drive you she said my cars on gilmore place they didnt say much on the way to the western general cafferty had been taken there not only because it was closer than the infirmary but also because it specialised in head injuries did you see him rebus asked as they reached the hospital car park clarke shook her head when shug called me he thought he was the bearer of glad tidings he knows theres history between us and cafferty rebus agreed but he could tell straight away something was up tou told him id gone to meet cafferty she shook her head again i havent told anyone well you better had only way to keep your head above the shit stones going to work it out before long wait till they find out ive done a runner she pulled into a parking bay and turned off the ignition then slid around to face him okay she said tell me he met her eyes i didnt touch him so what did you talk about andropov and bakewell sievewright and sol goodyear he shrugged deciding to omit the abattoir bull funny thing is i almost offered him a lift home i wish you had she sounded slightly more mollified does that mean you believe me ive got to havent i all weve been through if i cant believe you what the hell else is there thanks he said quietly squeezing her hand ttou still owe me the story of your runin with the scdea she removed her hand from beneath his theyve had cafferty under surveillance heard id been watching him and warned me off he shrugged again thats about the size of it and being bullheaded you did exactly the opposite rebus had a sudden image the bull with its legs buckling a bullet between its eyes he shook himself free of it lets go see what the damage is he said inside the hospital the first question they were asked was are you family hes my brother rebus stated this seemed to oil the wheels and they were shown to a waiting area deserted this time of night rebus picked up a magazine it was page after page of celebrity gossip but as it was also six months out of date chances were the celebrities had already been returned to obscurity he offerecl it to clarke but she shook her head tour brother she said rebus just shrugged his real brother had died a year and a half back over the past couple of decades rebus had paid him a lot less attention than cafferty probably spent less time with him too you cant choose your family he thought to himself but you can choose your enemies what if he dies clarke asked folding her arms she had her legs stretched out crossed at the ankles and was slumped low in the chair im not that lucky rebus told her she glowered at him so who do you reckon is behind it can we make that a multiplechoice question he asked how many names have you got depends if hes gone upsetting his russian friends andropov for starters scd reckoned they were close to having cafferty in the bag might be a lot of people out there who couldnt let that happen he broke off as an unfeasibly young doctor in the traditional white coat pushed through the swinging doors at the end of the corridor and notes in one hand pen between his teeth marched up to them he removed the pen and popped it into his top pocket toure the patients brother he asked rebus nodded well mr cafferty i dont have to tell you that morris seems blessed with an unusually resistant skull we call him ger rebus said sometimes big ger the young doctor nodded consulting his notes but is he okay clarke asked far from it well do another scan in the morning hes still unconscious but theres enough brain activity to be going on with he paused as if deciding how much more they needed to know when the skull is hit with tremendous force the brain shuts down automatically so as to protect itself or at least limit and assess the damage the problem we sometimes have is getting it to restart like rebooting a computer clarke offered the doctor seemed to agree and its too early yet to say whether theres any damage to your uncle he told her no blood clots that we could see but well know more tomorrow hes not my uncle she said sternly rebus patted her arm shes upset he explained to the doctor and then as clarke pulled her arm away so he was hit hard with something two or three times probably the doctor agreed attacked from behind the doctor was growing less comfortable with each new question the blows were to the back of the skull yes rebus was looking at siobhan clarke alexander todorov too had been hit hard from behind hard enough to kill can we see him doc rebus asked as i say hes not awake at present but all the same the doctor was looking worried now is there a problem with that rebus persisted look ive been told who mr cafferty is i know he has a certain reputation in edinburgh and rebus asked the doctor moistened his dry lips well youre his brother asking all these questions please tell me youre not going to go after whoever did this he decided some levity might help wards are crowded enough as it is he said with a weak smile wed just like to see him thats all rebus assured him patting the youngsters arm to reinforce the point then ill see what i can do you can wait here if you like rebus answered by sitting down again they watched the doctor depart through the swing doors but as the doors came to rest a face appeared at one of their portholeshaped windows oh christ rebus said alerting clarke to the new arrivals di calum stone and ds andy prosser this is where you tell them the whole story shiv and if you dont i will she nodded her understanding well well stone said sauntering forward hands in pockets what brings you here di rebus same as you i reckon rebus replied standing up again so here we all are stone continued rocking back on his heels tou to check if the victim still has a pulse and us to start figuring out if weve just watched several thousand manhours get flushed down the pan shame you pulled the surveillance rebus commented stones face grew red with rage because you wanted a meet he pointed towards clarke got your girlfriend here to send us down to granton im not denying it rebus said quietly i ordered ds clarke to make that call and why would you do that stones eyes were drilling into rebuss cafferty wanted to see me didnt say why but i wasnt keen on having you lot in the vicinity why not because id have been on the lookout for you wondering where you were hiding cafferty might have noticed hes got pretty good antennae not good enough to stop him getting whacked prosser added rebus couldnt disagree im going to tell you what i told ds clarke here he continued if i was going to thump cafferty why would i tell anyone about the meeting either someones setting me up or were talking about a coincidence a coincidence rebus shrugged someone planned to hit him anyway just happened to coincide stone had turned to his partner tou buying any of this andy prosser shook his head slowly and stone turned back to rebus andy doesnt buy it and neither do i you wanted cafferty for yourself didnt like the thought of us nabbing him your gold watch is on the horizon so youre pretty desperate you go there to talk to him and something happens you lose it next thing hes sparked out and youre in trouble except it didnt happen like that so what did happen we talked and i left him went home and stayed there what was so urgent that he needed to see you not a lot really prosser gave a little snort of disbelief while stone had a chuckle to himself you know rebus that canals not really a canal at all not where youre concerned so what is it shit creek stone said triumphantly rebus turned his head towards clarke and they say vaudeville is dead its not dead she replied as hed known she would just smells funny stone stabbed a finger in her direction dont go thinking youre not in the swill too ds clarke ive already told you rebus interrupted i take full responsibility listen to yourself stone hissed bailing out your girlfriend here is the last thing you should be focusing on right now im not his girlfriend the blood had risen up clarkes neck then youre his patsy which is almost as bad stone rebus growled i swear to god im going to instead of finishing the sentence he started balling both hands into fists the only thing youre going to do rebus is make a statement and pray theres a lawyer out there desperate enough to want to represent you calum prosser offered as warning to his colleague the bastards going to have a pop at you prosser edged forward eager to get his retaliation in first all four of them froze for a moment as they watched the doors swinging closed a nurse was standing there looking bemused rebus willed her not to say anything but she said it anyway mr cafferty aiming the words at rebus and no one else if youre quite finished here we can let you see your brother now day eight friday november when rebus woke up next morning it was to an insistent buzzing from the entryphone he rolled over in bed and checked his watch not yet seven still dark outside and a few more minutes until the timer would kick the central heating into action the room was cold the hall floor sucking heat from his feet as he padded down it and picked up the phone next to the door this better be good he croaked depends on your point of view rebus recognised the voice but couldnt place it come on john the man drawled its shug davidson up with the lark shug ive not been to bed yet bit early for a social call isnt it now how about letting me in rebuss finger hesitated above the entry button he sensed that if he pressed it his whole world would start to change and probably not for the better problem was what was the alternative he pressed the button di shug davidson was one of the good guys the force believed that human existence could be divided into two straightforward camps good guys and bad davidson had made few enemies and many friends he was conscientious and pragmatic humane and sympathetic but he had a serious look on his face this morning only some of which could be attributed to lack of sleep he also had a uniformed constable with him rebus had left the door ajar while he retreated to the bedroom to put some clothes on yelling that davidson could make tea if he liked but davidson and the uniform seemed content to stand in the hallway so that rebus had to squeeze past them to get to the bathroom he brushed his teeth with more care than usual staring at himself in the mirror above the sink he was still staring at the reflection as he wiped his mouth dry back in the hall he said the word shoes and made for the living room finding them next to his chair do i take it rebus asked as he wrestled with the laces west end has need of my finely honed detective skills stones told us all about your rendezvous with cafferty davidson stated and siobhan mentioned the cigarette butt not the only thing we found floating in the canal though oh we found a polythene overshoe john looks like there might be some blood on it the sort of overshoes the socos wear the socos wear them yes but so do we rebus nodded slowly i keep some in the boot of the saab mine are in the vws glovebox just the place for them when you think of it finally rebus seemed happy with the knots he stood up and made eye contact with davidson am i a suspect then shug bit of questioning should put everyones minds at rest glad to help di davidson there was a bit more work to be done finding keys and phone picking out a coat to wear over his suit jacket but then they were ready rebus locked the front door after him and followed davidson downstairs the constable bringing up the rear heard about the poor sod in london davidson asked litvinenko recently deceased theyve ruled out thallium whatever that is turned out the two detectives were expected to sit in the back of the passat while the uniform did the driving marchmont to torphichen place was a tenminute ride melville drive was quiet the morning rush hour not yet begun there were joggers busy on the meadows the cars headlights picking out the reflective strips on their shoes they waited at the tollcross junction for the light to change to green drove round the oneway into fountainbridge and were soon passing the wine bar at the canal basin this was where rebus had waited for cafferty and andropov to come out the night hed followed them to granton rebus was trying to remember if there was any cctv on the canal itself he didnt think so but maybe thered be cameras outside the wine bar just because he hadnt noticed any didnt mean they werent there unlikely theyd have spotted him loitering in the vicinity but you never knew the leamington lift bridge wasnt much used at night but it was used drunks congregated with their bottles youths walked to and fro looking for action might someone have seen something a figure running away the tenement on leamington road where hed parked his car that first night if a neighbour had been peering from their window at the right moment i think im being fitted up shug rebus said as the car took a right at the roundabout squeezing down the narrow arc of gardners crescent and signalling left at the next lights into morrison street they were back into the oneway system and would have to take a couple more rights to bring them to c division hq lot of people davidson said are going to think he deserves a medal the guy who clobbered cafferty i mean he paused fixing rebus with a look just for the record i dont happen to be among them i didnt do it shug then youll be fine wont you were cops john we know the innocent always go free they were silent after that until the patrol car drew up outside the police station no media for which rebus was thankful but as they entered the lobby he saw derek starr having a whispered confab with calum stone nice day for a lynching rebus told them davidson just kept moving so rebus followed reminds me davidson was saying i think the complaints are after a word too the complaints internal affairs cops who liked nothing more than dustbinning their own seems you were suspended a few days back davidson added but didnt take it to heart hed paused at the door to one of the interview rooms in here john the door opened outwards reason for that was a prisoner couldnt barricade himself in usual arrangement of table and chairs with tape recorders and even a video camera bolted high up on the wall above the door aimed at the table the accommodations fine rebus said but does it come with breakfast i can probably summon a bacon roll with brown sauce rebus stated tea or coffee with that milky tea i think garqon no sugar ill see what i can do davidson closed the door after him and rebus sat down at the table resting his head on his arms so what if a soco had found an overshoe could be that one of the socos themselves had left it there bloodstains might well turn out to be bits of bark or rust plenty of both in the canal cops and socos used overshoes but who else some hospitals maybe the mortuary places that needed to be kept sterile he thought of the lock on the saabs boot and how hed been meaning to get it fixed it would close eventually but only with persistence and even then it would spring open with minimal effort cafferty knew rebuss car stone and prosser knew it too had andropovs driver clocked it that day outside the city chambers no because theyd been in siobhans car hadnt they but rebus had left the saab kerbside while hed followed cafferty and andropov to the wine bar an opportunity for either of the bodyguards to swipe anything they liked from the boot cafferty himself had said it andropovs driver had recognised rebus a bloodstained overshoe what were the chances of finding anything on it leading back to rebus hed no way of knowing tour last days as a cop john he told himself savour them the door opened and a woman constable appeared with a polystyrene beaker tea he speculated sniffing the contents if you say so she responded before making a tactical retreat he took a sip and decided to be satisfied when the door next opened it was shug davidson carrying in a third chair strangest bacon butty ive ever seen rebus told him rolls are coming davidson placed the chair next to his own then sat down he produced two cassette tapes from his pocket unwrapped them and slotted them into the machine do i need a lawyer shug toure the detective you tell me davidson answered and then the door opened once more and di calum stone made his entry he carried a case file with him and wore a grim look on his face touve handed over control rebus guessed eyes on davidson but it was stone who replied scd takes precedence feel free to help yourselves to some of my stations case load too rebus told him stone just smirked and opened the file it was dogeared and coffeestained and bore the hallmarks of having been pored over many times in pursuit of a fresh angle on cafferty funny thing was rebus kept a file much like it at home right then di davidson stone said adjusting his jacket and shirt cuffs as he made himself comfortable switch that tape machine on and lets get down to business half an hour later the rolls arrived stone rose to his feet and began pacing not quite managing to look sanguine that he had not been included in the food order rebuss was cold and the sauce was tomato rather than brown but he attacked it with exaggerated zeal this is delicious he would say one minute and proper butter too the next davidson had offered to split his own helping with stone but stone had waved it aside another cup of teas what we need rebus suggested and davidson finding his mouth full of stodgy dough was forced to agree so another round of teas arrived and they washed down the last remnants of roll with them rebus daintily brushing bits of flour from the corners of his mouth before declaring himself ready for round two the machine was switched on again and rebus went back to defending siobhan clarkes role in the previous evenings events she does whatever you tell her stone insisted im sure di davidson here will vouch that ds clarke is very much her own woman rebus broke off and watched davidson nod di davidson nods he added for the benefit of the tapes then he rubbed a finger across the bridge of his nose look heres the bottom line ive not tried to hide anything from you i admit i saw cafferty last night i was there by the canal with him but i didnt attack him tou admit you led an scd surveillance unit away from the scene stupid in retrospect rebus agreed but thats all you did thats all i did stone looked to davidson and then back at rebus in which case inspector you wont mind if we go down to the processing area rebus stared at stone are you charging me were asking you to volunteer your fingerprints davidson explained and a dna swab stone added for purposes of elimination john and if i refuse why would an innocent man refuse stone asked the smirk was back again siobhan clarke knew damned well she wouldnt find a space in the car park at gayfield square all those new arrivals driving in from all over the city her own flat was only a fiveminute walk her car parked kerbside in a residents bay so she walked to work taking with her a personal cd player shed found it under her bed coated with dust replaced the batteries and found that the earphones from her ipod fitted the socket on her way to work she picked up coffee from the broughton street basement cafe seemed like an age since shed met todd goodyear there derek starr still didnt seem to have noticed her new recruit plenty of bodies in the cid suite meaning todd might go undetected a while longer when she arrived there was someone at her desk she flung her shoulder bag on to the floor next to the chair hoping it might act as a hint when it didnt she flicked the officers ear he looked up from the call he was making and she gestured for him to vamoose he didnt seem happy about it but got up anyway continuing the conversation as he moved away todd goodyear was standing in front of her with more sheets of transcript from the urban regeneration committee doesnt seem quite as busy in here clarke commented noting that starr was in earnest conversation with macrae in the dcis office weve requisitioned two of the interview rooms he explained numbers one and two threes too cold apparently then after a meaningful pause whats this i hear about cafferty did your girlfriend tell you clarke took a sip of cappuccino goodyear was nodding she was summoned to the canal he confirmed that must have put a damper on your evening part and parcel of the job he paused she saw you there too how do you want to play it she didnt get his meaning at first then realised that todd had been present outside the pub he too knew that rebus had been on his way to a rendezvous with cafferty anyone asks she told him you tell them just as much as you know for what its worth di rebus has already talked to the inquiry team goodyear expelled some air is he a suspect clarke shook her head but she knew damned well the possibility was being discussed in macraes room as soon as goodyear had retreated she reached into her bag for the cd player and took the disc from the top drawer of her desk todorovs recital for the benefit of the word power bookshop she plugged herself in cranked up the volume and closed her eyes a cafe the espresso machine was hissing somewhere in the distance charles riordan had to be positioned near the front of the audience she could hear todorov clearing his throat one of the booksellers gave the welcome and made some introductory remarks clarke knew the cafe it was near the old odeon cinema popular with students big comfy sofas and mood music the sort of place where you felt guilty ordering anything not fairtrade or organic didnt sound like there was amplification for the poet riordans mic was good though when he changed its positioning she could sense individuals in the audience a cough here a sniffle there murmurs and whispers riordan seemed almost as interested in these as in the main event figured the man did like to eavesdrop when the poet started speaking he covered almost identical ground to his recital at the poetry library made the same icebreaking jokes said how welcoming he found scottish people clarke could imagine his eyes scanning the audience for any women who might like to take the welcome a little further he veered a few times from the poetry library script announcing at one point that he would next read a poem by robert burns it was called farewell to all our scottish fame todorov read it in heavily accented english having apologised for anglicising certain words farewell to all our scottish fame farewell our ancient glory farewell even to the scottish name so famed in martial story now sark runs over the solway sands and tweed runs to the ocean to mark where englands province stands such a parcel of rogues in a nation there were two further verses each ending with the same last line applause and a couple of whoops when the poet had finished todorov then went back to poems from astapovo blues and ended by saying that copies were available for sale at the door after the ovation had died down riordans mic made another circuit of the room catching reactions to the recital going to buy a copy then ten quids a bit steep anyway weve heard most of them now which pub you headed for pear tree probably what did you think bit pompous we on for saturday depends on the kids has it started raining ive got the dog in the car and then the ringing of a mobile phone silenced when the recipient answered answered in what sounded to clarke suspiciously like russian only a couple of words before the voice was muffled did the poet himself possess a mobile phone not as far as she knew meaning someone in the audience yes because now the mic was sweeping back round again catching todorov being thanked by the bookseller and if youd be happy to sign some stock afterwards she was asking absolutely my pleasure then a drink on us at the pear tree youre sure we cant tempt you to supper i try to avoid temptation my dear its not good for a poet of my advancing years but then todorovs attention was deflected ah mr riordan isnt it how did the recording go it was great thank you dead men talking clarke couldnt help thinking the mic itself cut out after that the timer on the player told her shed been listening for the best part of an hour macraes office was empty no sign of starr anywhere nearby clarke removed her earphones and checked her mobile for messages there were none she tried rebuss home number but got his machine he wasnt answering his mobile either she was tapping the phone against her pursed lips when todd goodyear reappeared girlfriends just given me a tipoff he said remind me of her name sonia and what does sonia tell you when they were searching the canal they came up with an overshoe you know the polythene sort with the elastic around the ankle talk about contaminating the crime scene he caught her meaning no he clarified it wasnt dropped by a soco there were spots of blood on it well thats what they think anyway meaning the assailant wore it goodyear was nodding sceneof crime clothing protective overalls hats overshoes and disposable gloves the whole lot designed so as not to leave trace evidence yes but that worked both ways didnt it meant the investigators didnt leave anything that could be misconstrued meant anyone wearing the getup could mount an attack without fear of getting the victims blood or hair or fibres on them dump the overalls or better still burn them and you had a good chance of getting away with it dont go thinking what youre thinking clarke warned goodyear the same words rebus had used on her this had nothing to do with di rebus not saying it did goodyear seemed stung by the accusation what else did sonia say he shrugged by way of an answer clarke made a flicking motion with her fingers and he took the hint turning and finding that the desk hed been using had found a new owner in his absence as he walked away readying to remonstrate clarke picked up her bag and coat headed downstairs and out into gayfield square rebus was parked by the kerb she gave the briefest of smiles and opened the passengerside door climbing in tour phones off she told him havent got round to switching it on have you heard theyve found an overshoe shugs already dragged me in for questioning rebus admitted punching his pin into his mobile stone was there too enjoying every bastard minute what did you tell them the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth this is serious john who knows that better than me he muttered but it only becomes problematic when they trace the overshoe to the boot of my car she stared at him when she echoed think about it shiv only reason to leave the shoe was to stick me more firmly in the frame the saabs boot hasnt shut properly for months and theres nothing in there but crimescene kit and that old pair of hiking boots she corrected him aye he agreed and if a hiking boot would have served the purpose you can bet theyd have taken that instead so whos the they you still think andropov he dragged his palms down his face accentuating the bloodshot and darkringed eyes the days worth of grey stubble proving it is going to be the killer he replied at last clarke nodded her agreement and they sat in silence for a while until rebus asked how everything else was shaping up starr and macrae started the day with a good old chinwag no doubt my name featured on the agenda all ive been doing is listening to that other recording of todorov nice to see you breaking a sweat riordans mic picked up some of the audience i think i heard a russian voice oh thought i might nip over to word power and ask them need a lift sure do me a favour first will you i need the cd of todorovs other performance why he explained about scarlett colwell and the new poem so youre keeping in her good books eh just go fetch it she opened the car door but then paused the show todorov did for word power he read out a poem by burns farewell to all our scottish fame rebus nodded i know that one its about the english buying us off scotland lost all its money in a panama landgrab england suggested a union of the two countries what was so bad about that i keep forgetting youre english we ceased to be a nation siobhan and became a parcel of rogues instead according to burns yes sounds to me as if todorov was a bit of a scot nat maybe he just looked at this country and saw a version of his own bought and sold for gold tin zinc gas andropov again rebus offered a shrug go get that cd he told her the bookshop was small and cramped rebus feared that if he so much as turned around he would topple a display the woman behind the till had her nose in a copy of something called labyrinth she only worked there parttime and hadnt been to the todorov reading weve got some of his books though rebus looked in the direction she was pointing are they signed he asked for his troubles clarke poked him in the ribs before asking the assistant if any photos had been taken on the night she nodded and muttered something about the shops website clarke looked to rebus shouldve thought of that first she told him so they drove back to her flat rebus deciding to doublepark rather than seek a space further afield a while since ive been here he said as she led him down the narrow hallway it was much the same layout as his own flat but with meaner proportions its nothing personal she apologised just that i dont entertain much they were in the living room by now chocolate wrappers on the rug next to the sofa alongside an empty wine glass on the sofa itself sat a large venerablelooking teddy bear rebus picked it up its a steiff clarke told him had him since i was a kid has he got a name tea going to tell me what it is no shed gone over to the computer desk by the window and switched on the laptop which rested there she had one of those sshaped stools that were supposed to be good for your back but sat with her feet on the bit that was meant for her knees within a matter of moments she had found the word power website clicked on recent events and then photo gallery and started a slow scroll and there was todorov being introduced to the crowd they were seated on the floor and standing at the back and all had about them the aura of the converted how are we supposed to spot the russians rebus asked leaning his hands against the edge of the desk cossack hats ice picks in their ears we never did take a proper look at that list clarke said what list the one stahov brought russian residents in edinburgh he even had his own name on it remember wonder if his drivers on it too she was tapping the screen only his face was visible he was seated on a brown leather sofa but with people crouched and seated on the floor in front of him the photographer was no professional everyone had been given red eyes remember that stooshie at the mortuary stahov wanted todorovs remains repatriated im pretty sure our friend here was with him she tapped the screen again rebus leaned in further for a better look hes andropovs driver he said we went eyeballtoeyeball in the lobby of the caledonian hotel must be working for two masters then because stahov got into the back of his old merc and this guy got behind the wheel she turned her head and looked up at him reckon hell talk to us rebus shrugged maybe hell claim diplomatic immunity was he with andropov that night in the bar no ones mentioned him might have been waiting outside with the car she glanced at her watch what now rebus asked ive got that appointment with jim bakewell msp where are you meeting him the parliament building tell him you need a coffee ill be at the next table over havent you got anything better to do like what finding out whos behind the attack on cafferty you dont think theres a link we dont know i could really use a shot of that parliamentary espresso rebus told her she couldnt help smiling all right then she said and i really will have you over to supper one night promise best give me plenty of warning diarys going to be bursting at the seams retirements a whole new beginning for some people she agreed i dont plan on twiddling my thumbs he assured her clarke had risen from the stool she stood in front of him arms by her sides eyes fixed on his the silence lasted fifteen or twenty seconds rebus smiling at the end feeling theyd shared a long conversation without the need for words lets go he said breaking the spell they called the western general from the car checking on caffertys progress hes not woken up rebus said relaying the message for clarkes benefit due another scan later today and theyve got him on drugs to prevent a blood clot think we should send him flowers bit early for a wreath theyd taken a short cut down calton road parked in one of the residential streets at abbeyhill clarke told him to give her a fiveminute start which gave rebus enough time for a cigarette tourists were milling around a few interested in the parliament building but the majority keener on the palace of holyrood across the street one or two seemed to be puzzling over the vertical bamboo bars across some of the parliaments windows join the club rebus muttered stubbing the cigarette and heading inside as he emptied his pockets and prepared for the metal detector at security he asked one of the guards about the bamboo search me the man said isnt that supposed to be my line rebus replied on the other side of the detector he scooped up his stuff and made for the coffee bar clarke was in the queue and he took his place directly behind her wheres bakewell he asked on his way down hes not a coffee person apparently but i said it was for my benefit rather than his she ordered her cappuccino and got out some money might as well add mine to the order rebus said and make it a double want me to drink it for you too could be the last espresso you ever buy me he chided her they found two adjacent tables and settled at them rebus still wasnt sure about this vast echoing interior if someone had told him he was in an airport he might have believed them he couldnt tell what sort of statement it was supposed to be making one newspaper report from a few years back had stuck in his mind the journalist speculating that the building was too elaborate for its actual purpose and was in fact an independent parliament in waiting made sense when you remembered that the architect was catalan detective sergeant clarke jim bakewell shook clarkes hand and she asked him if he wanted anything we could take your drink to my office was all he said yes but now that were here bakewell sighed and sat down adjusting his glasses he wore a tweed jacket and what looked like a tweed tie over a check shirt wont take long sir clarke was telling him wanted to ask you a couple of questions about alexander todorov i was sorry to hear about him bakewell declared but he was adjusting the creases in his trousers as he spoke you shared a platform with him on question time thats correct can i ask for your general impression of him bakewells eyes were milkyblue he nodded a greeting to a passing flunky before addressing the question i was late arriving got held up in traffic barely had time to shake hands with him before we were ushered into the hall he wouldnt wear any makeup i remember that much he removed his glasses and started polishing them with a handkerchief seemed quite brusque with everybody but he was fine in front of the cameras he put his glasses back on and tucked the handkerchief into a trouser pocket and afterwards clarke asked i seem to think he shot off nobody really hangs around it would mean making small talk with each other fraternising with the enemy clarke offered along those lines yes so is that how you see megan macfarlane megans a lovely woman but youre not dropping round one anothers houses for a chin wag not exactly bakewell said with a thin smile ms macfarlane seems to think the snp will win mays election nonsense you dont think scotlands going to want to give blair a bloody nose over iraq theres no appetite for independence bakewell stated gruffly no appetite for trident either labour will do just fine come may sergeant please dont lose any sleep on our behalf clarke seemed to be collecting her thoughts and what about the last time you saw him i dont think i understand the night mr todorov was killed hed just been having a drink in the caledonian hotel you were there too mr bakewell was i bakewell furrowed his brow as if trying to remember tfou were seated in one of the booths with a businessman called sergei andropov was that the same night he watched clarke nod slowly well ill take your word for it mr andropov and mr todorov grew up together thats news to me you didnt see todorov in the bar i did not he was bought a drink by a local gangster called morris gerald cafferty mr cafferty did join us at the table but he didnt have anyone with him had you met him before no but you knew his reputation i knew he was well gangster is maybe a bit strong sergeant but hes a reformed character now the politician paused unless you have evidence to the contrary what were the three of you talking about trade the commercial climate bakewell shrugged nothing very riveting and when cafferty joined you he didnt happen to mention alexander todorov not that i remember what time did you leave the bar sir bakewell puffed out his cheeks with the effort of remembering quarter past eleven some time around then andropov and cafferty were still there yes clarke paused for a moments thought how well did cafferty seem to know mr andropov i couldnt say but it wasnt the first time theyd met mr caffertys company is representing mr andropov in some development projects why did he choose cafferty bakewell gave an irritated laugh go ask him yourself im asking you sir i get the feeling youre fishing sergeant and none too subtly at that as development minister its my job to discuss future planning potential with businesspersons of good standing so you had your advisers with you clarke watched bakewell try to form an answer if you were there in your official capacity she pressed im assuming youd have a team backing you up it was an informal meeting the politician snapped is that a regular occurrence sir in your line of work bakewell was about to remonstrate either that or retreat he had his hands pressed to his knees readying to rise to his feet but there was a woman approaching and she was already addressing him jim where have you been hiding yourself megan macfarlane turned towards clarke and her face fell oh its you im being grilled about alexander todorov bakewell explained and sergei andropov macfarlane glowered at clarke and seemed ready to attack but clarke didnt give her the chance im glad i caught you ms macfarlane she said i wanted to ask about charles riordan who he was recording your committee for an art installation roddy denholms project you mean macfarlane sounded interested what about it mr riordan was friends with alexander todorov and now both men are dead but if clarke had hoped to divert macfarlanes attention shed failed the msp stabbed a finger in rebuss direction whats he doing skulking there bakewell turned towards rebus but had no idea who he was im at a loss he admitted thats her boss macfarlane explained looks to me like your private chat wasnt so private jim bakewell stopped looking puzzled and started to look furious instead is this true he asked clarke but macfarlane clearly enjoying every moment was speaking again whats more i hear hes been suspended from duty pending retirement and how did you hear that ms macfarlane rebus asked i had a meeting with your chief constable yesterday and happened to mention your name she made a tutting sound hes not going to be pleased about this is he its an outrage bakewell spluttered finally rising to his feet ive james corbyns number if you need it macfarlane was telling her colleague as she waved her phone at him her assistant roddy liddle had arrived by her side laden with files and folders an outrage bakewell repeated causing heads to turn two security guards were looking particularly interested shall we clarke suggested to rebus he still had half a shot of espresso left but thought it only good manners to accompany her as she stalked towards the exit what now rebus asked as he drove her back towards gayfield square talk to stahovs driver i suppose think the consulate will let you have you got a better idea he shrugged just that it might be easier to grab him on the street what if he doesnt speak english i think he does rebus stated remembering the cars parked by the canal caffertys bodyguard in conversation with andropovs driver and if he doesnt we both know a friendly translator rebus gestured towards the back seat where hed slung the cd and shes about to owe us a favour so i just grab the driver off the street and interrogate him she was staring at rebus how much more trouble do you want me to be in the saab crossed at the regent road lights and headed into royal terrace how much can you take he eventually asked not much more she admitted you think bakewell will talk to the chief constable he might then ill probably be sharing that suspension with you he glanced at her wont that be fun i think youre getting demobhappy john a patrol car was suddenly behind them its lights flashing christ what now rebus complained to no one in particular he pulled over just short of the next roundabout and got out the patrolman took a bit of time adjusting the cap hed just fixed to his head he wasnt anyone rebus knew di rebus the officer checked rebus nodded his confirmation got orders to bring you in bring me where west end shug davidsons throwing me a surprise party i wouldnt know about that maybe not but rebus did they had something to pin on him and the bookies were giving a million to one on it being a medal rebus turned towards clarke she was out of the car now resting her hands against its roof pedestrians had paused for a moment to watch the drama take the saab rebus told her see that dr colwell gets the cd what about the chauffeur some things youre going to have to decide for yourself he got into the back of the patrol car blues and twos lads he said cant keep shug davidson waiting but it wasnt davidson waiting for him at torphichen place it was di calum stone seated behind the interview rooms only table while ds prosser stood in the corner hands in pockets seems ive got a fan club rebus commented sitting down opposite stone got a bit of news for you stone responded it was caffertys blood on that overshoe dna usually takes longer than that all right then caffertys blood type i sense a but no usable prints stone admitted meaning you cant prove it came from the boot of my car rebus clapped his hands together once and began getting to his feet well nice of you to let me know sit down rebus rebus considered for a few seconds then sat caffertys still unconscious stone explained theyre not talking coma yet but i know theyre thinking it doctor says he could end his days a vegetable his eyes narrowed so it looks like we might not get to steal your glory after all you still think i did it i bloody well know you did and i told ds clarke all about it because i needed her to phone you and get you away from the stakeout rebus watched stones slow sustained nod you used your crimescene kit so you wouldnt get any blood on you prosser snapped from the corner shoe blew into the canal and you couldnt risk going in after it weve been through this rebus spat back no doubt well go over it again stone warned soon as weve completed our inquiries i can hardly wait this time rebus did rise to his feet that all you wanted me for stone just nodded again then waited until rebus reached the door before firing another question at him officers who brought you in say there was a woman in the car with you ds clarke i presume of course not liar prosser shot back at him youre still on suspension rebus stone was saying do you really want to take her down with you funny she asked me much the same thing not half an hour ago rebus pushed open the door and made good his escape dr scarlett colwell was at her computer when siobhan clarke arrived to clarkes mind the woman used a touch too much makeup and would look better without it nice hair though even if she suspected there might be a bit of dye in it ive brought the cd of the poetry reading clarke said placing it on the desk thank you so much colwell picked it up and studied it can i ask you to take a look at something of course ill need to use your computer the academic gestured for clarke to sit at the desk clarke squeezed past her colwell standing at her shoulder as she accessed the word power site and clicked the photo gallery option bringing up the pictures from the cafe that picture she said nodding towards the wall and the shot of todorov did you happen to take any others they were so bad i deleted them im not great with cameras clarke nodded and pressed a finger against the screen remember him she asked colwell peered at the chauffeurs face he was there yes but you dont know who he is should i did todorov speak to him i couldnt say who is he a russian he works at the consulate colwell stared more intently at the face tou know she said i think he was at the poetry library too clarke turned towards her are you sure him and another man but she started to shake her head actually im not certain take your time clarke invited so colwell ran both hands through her tresses and did some more thinking im really not sure she confessed after a pause letting the hair fall around her face again i could be conflating the two readings do you see what i mean imagining the man into the one because you know he was at the other exactly so do you have any other photos of him no but clarke started typing again entering the name nikolai stahov into the search engine she drew a blank so described the consular official to colwell instead doesnt ring any bells the academic apologised so clarke tried again this time with a description of andropov when colwell gave another shrug clarke tried the website for the evening news skipping back through the days until shed found the story about the russians and their blowout meal tapping one of the faces in the onscreen photograph he does look familiar colwell admitted from the poetry library the academic shrugged and gave a long sigh clarke told her not to worry and called the poetry library on her mobile ms thomas she asked when her call was answered not in today another female voice reported can i help my names detective sergeant clarke im investigating alexander todorovs murder and i need to ask her something shes at home today do you have her number clarke jotted the number down then made the call she asked abigail thomas if she had easy access to the web then talked her through the links to word power and the newspaper mm yes thomas eventually said both of them i think seated near the front second row maybe youre sure of that fairly sure just to check ms thomas no one took photos that night the odd person could have used their cameraphone i suppose and youve no cctv in the library its a library abigail thomas stressed just a thought thanks for your help clarke ended the call why is it so important colwell asked breaking clarkes reverie might not be the detective admitted but todorov and andropov had a drink in the same bar the night the poet was killed judging by the news story mr andropov is some sort of businessman they grew up in the same part of moscow di rebus says they knew one another oh clarke saw that shed struck a nerve what is it she asked might help to explain something colwell mused and whats that dr colwell the academic picked up the cd alexanders extempore poem she walked over to a set of shelves and crouched down in front of it there was a portable hifi there and she slotted home the recording then pressed play the room was filled with the sounds of the audience finding their seats and clearing their throats about halfway through colwell added holding down the skip button but this took her directly to the end of the recording forgot she said theres only the one continuous track so she went back to the start and this time used the fastforward facility first time i listened clarke said i noticed he performed some poems in english some in russian colwell nodded the new poem was in russian ah here it is she trotted back to her desk and brought out a pad of paper and a pen concentrating hard as she started to write eventually she told clarke to press rewind they listened again clarke hitting pause when she felt colwell was falling behind i really need more time the academic apologised this isnt the ideal way to translate a poem call it a work in progress clarke cajoled her colwell pushed a hand through her mane of hair and started again after twenty minutes she tossed the pen back on to the desk on the cd todorov was using english to tell the audience that the next poem was from astapovo blues he didnt say anything about the new work clarke realised nothing colwell agreed didnt introduce it either colwell shook her head then pushed her hair back into place again im not sure how many people would have realised it was a new piece how can you be sure it was new there dont seem to be any drafts in his flat and i know his published work rather well clarke nodded her understanding and held her hand out may i the academic seemed reluctant but eventually handed the pad over its really very rough ive no idea where the line breaks would go clarke ignored her and started reading winters tongue licks the children of zhdanov the devils tongue licks mother russia coating tastebuds with precious metals heartless appetite the guts greed knows no fullness no still moment no love desire ripens but only to blight there are morsels here for all in the heat of famine penances for all as the winters shadow falls such a package of scoundrels in my country clarke read it through twice more then met colwells eyes its not very good is it its a bit rough at the edges the academic said defensively i dont mean your translation clarke assured her colwell nodded eventually but theres an anger to it clarke remembered professor gatess words at the todorov autopsy theres a fury here tes she agreed and all that imagery of food colwell cottoned on the news story but surely that appeared after alexander died true but the dinner itself was a few days earlier maybe hed found out about it so youre saying this is a poem about the businessman composed on the spot just to get up his nose andropov made his fortune from those precious metals todorov mentions making him the devil iom dont sound wholly convinced the translation is rough im guessing at some of the phrases i really need more time with it clarke nodded slowly then remembered something can i try another cd with you she found what she was looking for in her ibag and knelt down next to the hifi again it took a little while ito find the moment when at the word power reading charles riordans roving mic picked up the russian voice there clarke said its only a couple of words colwell said hes answering a phone call all he says is hello and yes worth a try clarke said with a sigh ejecting the disc and rising to her feet she reached for the pad of paper again can i take the poem with me meantime leave you to get on with something you feel is more accurate there was bad blood between alexander and this businessman im not sure but its a motive right and if they met again in that bar clarke held up a hand in warning weve no evidence that they even saw one another in that bar which is why id be grateful if you kept all of this to yourself dr colwell otherwise you could jeopardise the inquiry i understand the academic nodded her agreement clarke tore the sheet from the pad and folded it into four one little piece of advice clarke said as she finished folding the final line of the poem hes quoting from robert burns its not a package of scoundrels its a parcel of rogues rebus sat by the bedside of morris gerald cafferty hed shown his warrant card and asked the day shift if cafferty had had any other visitors the nurse had shaken her head no because despite his goading of rebus cafferty had no friends his wife was dead his son murdered years back his trusted lieutenant of long standing had disappeared after a fallingout there was just the one bodyguard at the house and right now his main concern was probably where his next paycheque was coming from doubtless there would be accountants and lawyers stone would have the details but these werent the sort of men to pay respects cafferty was still in intensive care but rebus had heard two staff members discussing a looming bed crisis maybe they would move him back to an open ward or if his finances could be unlocked a private room as of now he seemed content with the tubes machines and flickering screens there were wires attached to his skull measuring brain activity fluids were being dripfed into one arm cafferty seemed to be wearing some sort of gown with a front but rebus guessed no back his arms were bare and the hairs covering them were like silver wires rebus stood up and leaned down over caffertys face wondering if the machine might suddenly register awareness of his proximity but there was no change in the readout he traced the route from caffertys body to the machines and from there to the wall sockets cafferty wasnt dying the doctor had confided that much another reason to move him from intensive care how intensively did you have to tend a vegetable rebus looked at caffertys knuckles and fingernails the thick wrists the dry white skin on each elbow he was a large man yes but not particularly muscular there were lines around the neck like the circles on a freshly felled tree the jaw was slack the mouth open to accommodate a tube there was a single track down the side of the face where some saliva had dried to a crust with eyes closed cafferty looked harmless enough what little hair there was on his scalp needed a wash the charts at the end of the bed had told rebus nothing they were just a way of reducing the patients life to a series of numbers and graphs impossible to tell if a line angling upwards was a good sign or a bad wake up you old bastard rebus whispered into the gangsters ear playtimes over not a nicker no point you hiding there inside that thick skull of yours im waiting for you out here nothing apart from a gurgling in the throat and cafferty was making that same sound every thirty seconds or so rebus slumped back into his chair when hed arrived a nurse had asked if he was the patients brother does it matter hed asked her its just that you do look like him shed said waddling away he decided that it was a story worth sharing with the patient but before he could start there was a trembling in his shirt pocket he took his mobile out checking to left and right for anyone who might disapprove whats up shiv he asked andropov and his driver were in the audience at the poetry library todorov made up a poem on the spot and i think andropov was its target interesting have they given you a break it took a moment for rebus to realise what she meant im not being grilled nothing on the overshoe but blood same type as cafferty so where are you now visiting the patient christ john hows that going to look i wasnt planning on sticking a pillow over his face but say he snuffs it while youre there not a bad point ds clarke so walk away where do you want to meet i have to get back to gayfield square i thought we were going to pick up the chauffeur we are doing no such thing meaning youre going to run it past derek starr tea he doesnt know this case like we do siobhan john as of now weve got precisely nothing i disagree the connections are beginning to come together dont tell me you cant sense it hed risen from his chair again but only to bend over caffertys face one of the machines gave a loud beep to which clarke added a voluble sigh youre still by his bed she stated thought i saw his eyelids flicker so where is it were going to meet let me talk it through with starr and macrae give it to stone instead she was silent for a moment i must have misheard scd has more clout than us give him the todorovandropov connection why because it might help stone build his case against cafferty andropovs a businessman businessmen like to cut deals you know thats not going to happen then why am i wasting my breath because you think i need stone to be my friend hes got it in mind that i helped you get to cafferty only way i can show him otherwise is to give him this sometimes youre too clever for your own good he paused but you should still talk to him if the consulate starts pleading diplomatic immunity scds got a stronger hand than us meaning meaning channels to special branch and the spooks are you going all james bond on me theres only one james bond shiv he told her hoping for a laugh which didnt come ill mull it over she conceded instead if you promise to be out of that hospital in the next five minutes already on my way he lied ending the call his mouth was dry and he didnt reckon the patient would mind if he borrowed some of the water on the bedside cabinet there was a clear plastic jug with a tumbler next to it rebus drank two glasses then decided to take a look inside the cabinet itself he wasnt expecting to find caffertys watch wallet and keys but since they were there he flipped open the wallet and found that it contained five tenpound notes a couple of credit cards and some scraps of paper with phone numbers on none of them meaning anything to rebus the watch was a rolex naturally and he weighed it in his hand to confirm that it was the real deal then he picked up the keys there were half a dozen of them they chinked and clinked as he rolled them between palm and fingers house keys chinked them and clinked them and kept staring at cafferty any objections he asked quietly and then after a further moment didnt think so his luck just kept getting better and better no one had bothered to set the alarm and caffertys bodyguard was elsewhere having entered by the front door the first thing rebus did was check the corners of the ceiling for security cameras there werent any so he padded into the drawing room the house was victorian the ceilings high with ornate cornicing cafferty had started collecting art big splashy paintings which hurt rebuss eyes he wondered if any of them were by roddy denholm the curtains were closed and he left them that way turning on the lights instead tv and hifi and three sofas nothing on the marbletopped coffee table but a couple of old newspapers and a pair of spectacles the gangster too vain to wear them anywhere outside the privacy of his home there was a door to the right of the fireplace and rebus opened it caffertys booze cupboard big enough to contain a double fridge and assorted wine racks with bottles of spirits lining a shelf resisting temptation he closed the door again and headed back into the hall more doors off a huge kitchen a conservatory with a pool table laundry room bathroom office yet another less formal living room he wondered if the gangster really enjoyed rattling around in a place this size course you do he said answering his own question the stairs were wide and carpeted next floor up two bedrooms with bathrooms attached a home cinema fortytwoinch plasma screen flush with the wall and what seemed to be a storeroom filled with boxes and tea chests most of them empty there was a womans hat on the top of one box photo albums and shoes beneath this rebus guessed was all that remained of the late mrs cafferty there was a dartboard on one wall with puncture marks around its circumference evidence that someone needed to improve their throwing rebus guessed that the dartboard would have fallen into disuse once the room changed identity the last door off the landing led to a narrow winding stairwell more rooms at the top of the house one containing a fullsize snooker table covered with a dustsheet the other a wellstocked library rebus recognised the shelves hed bought the same ones from ikea the books were mostly dusty paperbacks thrillers for the gentleman and romances for the lady there were also some childrens books which had probably belonged to caffertys son the house felt little used the floorboards creaking underfoot he reckoned the gangster seldom took the trouble to climb this final set of stairs heading back down rebus returned to caffertys office it was a goodsized room with a window looking on to the back garden again the curtains were closed but rebus risked easing them open so he could take a look at the coachhouse two cars parked in front of it the bentley and an audi and no sign of the bodyguard rebus closed the curtains again and switched on the light there was an old bureau in the centre of the room covered with paperwork domestic bills by the look of it rebus sat in the leather chair and started opening drawers the first thing he came across was a gun a pistol of some kind with what looked like russian lettering along the barrel little present from your pal rebus guessed there was however no ammo in the clip and no sign of any bullets in the drawer it was a long time since rebus had held a firearm he tested it for weight and balance then used his handkerchief to place it back where hed found it financial statements in the next drawer down cafferty had sixteen grand in his current account and a further quarter of a million earning him interest on the money market his portfolio of shares added another hundred thousand to the pot rebus saw no sign of any mortgage payments meaning cafferty probably owned the house outright this part of town it had to be worth a million and a half nor would this be the end of the gangsters wealth stone had hinted at various shell companies and offshore holdings cafferty owned bars clubs the lettings agency and a snooker hall he was rumoured to hold a stake in a cab company rebus suddenly noticed something in the corner a venerable safe with a tumbler lock it was the colour of verdigris and came from kentucky walking over to it he was unsurprised to find it locked the only combination he could think of to try was caffertys birthday eighteen ten fortysix rebus pulled the handle and the heavy door swung open he allowed himself a smile couldnt think why he had memorised that number but it hadnt been wasted inside the safe two boxes of ninemil ammo four thick wads of notes twenties and fifties some business ledgers computer disks a jewellery box containing the late wifes necklaces and earrings rebus lifted out caffertys passport and flicked through it no visits to russia birth certificate for the man himself birth and death for the wife and son the wedding certificate showed that cafferty had married in at the registry office in edinburgh he replaced each item and studied the disks no labels no writing there wasnt even a computer in the office point of fact he hadnt seen one anywhere in the house on the bottom shelf of the safe sat a small cardboard box rebus lifted it out and opened it it contained two dozen shiny silver discs cds he thought at first but holding one up to the light he saw that it was marked dvdr g rebus was no technophile but he reckoned whatever this was it would play on the system upstairs there was no writing on any of the discs but coloured dots had been added to each one some green some blue some red some yellow rebus closed the safe and spun the dial then switched off the light and padded back upstairs the box of discs in his hand the home cinema boasted shuttered windows and a row of leather recliners behind which was a further row comprising two doubleseater sofas he crouched down in front of the battery of machines and slotted the dvd home then switched on the screen and retreated to one of the chairs it took him three different remotes to get everything screen dvd player and loudspeakers working seated on the edge of the black leather chair he began to watch what appeared to be surveillance footage a room a living room untidy and with bodies sprawled two of the bodies disentangled themselves and headed elsewhere holding hands there was a sudden cut to a bedroom the same two figures appearing peeling off their clothes as they started to kiss teenagers rebus recognised neither of them didnt recognise the setting either somewhere a lot tattier than caffertys own house okay so the gangster got his jollies from amateur porn rebus skipped ahead but the action stayed with the couple and their coupling they were filmed from above and from the side another skip and the girl was in a bathroom seated on the pan and then stripping off again to take a shower she was skinny almost emaciated and had bruises on her arms he skipped again but there was nothing else on the disc next one with a blue dot rather than a green different yet similar location different yet alltoofamiliar action showing your pervy side cafferty rebus muttered ejecting the disc he tried another green dot back to the characters from the first disc pattern emerging john red dot another flat some communal dopesmoking a girl having a bath a guy pleasuring himself in his bedroom rebus wasnt looking for any surprises from the yellow dot immediately he was launched into the same setups as previously but with one important difference he knew both the flat and the actors nancy sievewright eddie gentry the flat on blair street the flat which belonged to mgc lettings well well rebus said to himself there was footage of a party in the living room dancing and booze and what looked to rebus like a few lines of coke to go with the dope a blowjob in the bathroom a punchup in the hall next disc sol goodyear had come to pay his respects rewarded with a romp in nancys bedroom and some shared moments in the cramped shower cubicle after hed gone she settled down with the hash hed left and rolled herself a healthy joint living room bathroom her bedroom the hallway everything but the kitchen rebus paused the kitchen he repeated to himself and eddie gentrys bedroom by the time hed reached the final disc in the box hed grown bored it was like watching one of those tv reality shows but with no adverts to break the monotony this last disc was different though no little colourcoded sticker and it had sound rebus found himself watching the same room he was sitting in the chairs and sofas had been filled by men cigarsmoking men men slurping wine from crystal glasses voluble slurred happy men who were being shown a dvd wonderful meal that one of them told the host there were grunts of agreement smoke billowing the camera was pointing at the men meaning it had to be rebus got to his feet and approached the plasma screen there was a small hole drilled into the wall just above one corner of the tv youd never see it or else you might take it for a bit of botched diy rebus peered into it but couldnt see anything he exited the room and entered the one next door en suite bathroom cabinet attached to a mirrored wall inside the cabinet nothing no camera no wires he put his eye to the peephole and was looking into the screening room back in the home cinema the mens comments left rebus in no doubt that they were watching some of the same footage hed just viewed wish my wife was that dirty maybe if you plied her with class a rather than chardonnay worth a shot i suppose and they dont know youre watching them morris caffertys voice from the back of the room not a clue he growled happily didnt chuck berry get in trouble for something like this getting a few ideas for the good lady roger married twentyodd years stuart til take that as a no rebus found himself on his knees in front of the screen roger and stuart with their wine and cigars stuffed to the gills by cafferty and now enjoying this very different form of corporate hospitality roger anderson stuart janney first albannachs brightest and best michael will be gutted he missed this janney added with a laugh meaning no doubt sir michael addison but rebus reckoned janney was dead wrong he ejected the disc and went back to the one with the party on it bathroom blowjob the donor bearing an uncanny resemblance to gill morgan aspiring actress and sir michaels pampered stepdaughter same head had been bent over one of the coke trails in the living room rebus went back to the footage of the home cinema tried to work out which dvd the group was watching kept his eyes glued to the two bankers wondering if either of them would exhibit signs of clocking their bosss stepkid grounds for a revenge attack on cafferty maybe so but what were they doing there in the first place rebus could think of several reasons from the bank statements rebus now knew that cafferty kept his various onshore accounts with fab added to which he was going to introduce a new and wealthy client to the bank sergei andropov and maybe the pair of them would be looking to do a deal with fab a vast commercial loan to help them buy up hundreds of acres of edinburgh andropov was relocating ducking out of russia altogether to escape prosecution maybe he thought the scottish parliament could be persuaded not to extradite him maybe he was buying his way into a forthcoming independent scotland small country easy to become a very big fish cafferty oiling the wheels hosting a memorable party and secretly taping it for his own satisfaction or to be used against the men themselves rebus couldnt see it having much effect on the likes of janney and anderson but now another man was rising to his feet from one of the sofas looked to rebus as if only cafferty and this man had been occupying the back row bathroom he enquired across the hall his host obliged yes cafferty wouldnt want him using the en suite through the wall couldnt risk the camera being found wont ask why you need it jim stuart janney commented to a few rugbyclub guffaws nothing sordid stuart the man called jim responded making his exit jim bakewell minister for economic development meaning bakewell had lied at the parliament telling siobhan hed not met cafferty until that night at the hotel try making a complaint to the chief constable now jimbo rebus muttered stabbing a finger in bakewells direction there wasnt an awful lot more to the dvd after half an hour the spectators had wrung as much interest as possible from the show there were three further members of the party who were new to rebus they looked like business types ruddyfaced and bigbellied builders contractors maybe even councillors rebus knew he could probably find out but that would mean taking the recording which was fine so long as no one noticed it was missing if anyone found out rebus had been here caffertys defence team would have a field day oh aye john what defence team is that then yes because where was the crime bugging flats you were renting small beer the magistrate would watch the dvds with a good deal of interest then stick the gangster with a pittance of a fine rebus made sure everything was switched off no prints left behind then headed downstairs and unlocked the safe again replacing the box keeping just the one disc for himself down the white marble hall and out into the sweetsmelling air door secure behind him hed have to get caffertys keys back to him but first he had some thinking to do he took a left out of the gate and another left at the top of the road heading for bruntsfield place and the first available taxi eddie gentry replete with eyeliner and the red bandanna opened the door to him nancys out he said have you patched things up we had a frank exchange of views rebus smiled going to invite me in eddie and by the way i liked your cd gentry considered his options then turned and pushed open the livingroom door rebus followed him inside ever watch big brother eddie rebus was making a circuit of the room hands in pockets lifes too short it is that rebus seemed to agree tell you something i didnt spot when i was here before what rebus looked up your ceilings have been lowered yeah rebus nodded done before you moved in suppose so there might be original features cornices ceiling roses why do you reckon the landlord would want them covered up insulation how so gentry shrugged makes the rooms smaller meaning easier to heat the rooms are all the same then fake ceilings im not an architect rebus locked eyes with the young man saw the slightest twitch at a corner of his mouth eddie gentry was not feeling comfortable the detective gave a low drawnout whistle tou know dont you he asked touve known all along known what caffertys got you wired cameras in the ceiling in the walls he pointed towards a corner of the room see that hole looks like someones botched a bit of drilling gentrys face gave nothing away theres a lens pointing at us but you already know that for all i know maybe its even your job to set the camera rolling gentry had folded his arms across his chest that session you did at cr studios im betting it didnt come cheap did cafferty pay for it was that part of the deal bit of money in your pocket cheap rent no overcrowding and all you had to do was throw a few parties rebus was thinking it through dope provided by sol goodyear and im betting it came cheap too know why why because sol works for cafferty hes the dealer youre the pimp fuck you careful son rebus jabbed his forefinger towards the young man have you heard what happened to cafferty i heard maybe someone didnt like what hed been doing remember that party with gill morgan what about it that the only footage of her you got ive no idea rebus looked disbelieving i never watched any of it just handed it over eh no harm done was there i dont think youre qualified to judge that eddie does nancy know gentry shook his head just you eh did he tell you he was doing the selfsame thing in some of his other flats you mentioned big brother earlier whats the difference rebus was standing close to the young man when he answered difference is they know theyre being watched i cant really decide whos the sleazier you or cafferty he was watching complete strangers but you eddie were filming your mates is there a law against it oh im fairly sure there is how often does the taping happen three or four times tops because by then cafferty was bored and moved on to a new flat new tenants new faces and bodies rebus walked into the hallway looked for the hole and found it nancys bedroom again the false ceiling again the neatly drilled hole the bathroom was the same when rebus emerged into the hallway gentry was leaning against the wall arms still folded jaw jutting defiantly wheres the hardware rebus asked mr c took it when few weeks back like i told you it was only three or four times doesnt make it any less sordid lets take a look at your room rebus didnt wait for an invitation opened the door to gentrys bedroom and asked where the cables were they used to come down from the ceiling had them hooked up to a dvd recorder if anything interesting was happening i only had to press the record button and now the whole lots been installed in some other flat so your landlord can show a fresh slice of grainy porn to his sweaty pals rebus was shaking his head slowly wouldnt want to be in your shoes when nancy finds out gentry didnt so much as flinch i think its time you were leaving he stated shows over rebus responded by getting right into the young mans face tou couldnt be more wrong eddie this particular shows only just getting started he squeezed past out into the hallway pausing by the front door i lied by the way that music of yours is going nowhere youve just not got the talent pal closed the door after him and stood for a moment at the top of the stairs reaching into his pocket for his cigarettes job done the cid suite at gayfield square might as well have been a swimming pool all they were doing was treading water derek starr knew it and was having trouble motivating the group there wasnt enough for them to do no exciting new leads on either todorov or riordan forensics had produced a partial fingerprint from the small bottle of cleaning fluid but all they knew so far was that it belonged neither to riordan nor to anyone on the database terry grimm had supplied information that riordans house was visited weekly by a team of cleaners from an agency though they were usually told not to bother with the livingroomcumstudio but any one of them could have left the print no one was about to claim for certain that it belonged to the arsonist it looked like another dead end same went for the efit of the hooded woman outside the multistorey officers had taken copies doortodoor returning to the station with nothing but sore feet having gone through the proper channels starr had at last secured cctv footage from the few cameras in and around portobello but no one was very hopeful all they showed was earlymorning traffic again without knowing how the attacker had reached riordans house it was needleinahaystack stuff the way starr himself kept looking at siobhan clarke he knew she was holding back on him twice in the space of half an hour hed asked her what she was working on going through the riordan tapes shed explained not a word of truth in it todd goodyear was typing up the last batch of transcripts looking worn down by the whole experience he kept staring into space as if thinking himself into a better place clarke meantime was waiting for stone to get back to her having left a message on his mobile she was still wondering if it was such a good idea stone and starr seemed pretty pally chances were anything she said to the one would get back to the other she had yet to mention to starr the appearance of sergei andropov and his driver in the poetry library audience there were no longer any members of the media hanging about outside the station the last mention of either death had been an inchlong paragraph on one of the evening newss inside pages starr was currently in another meeting with dci macrae maybe later today they would announce that the inquiry was being split into two since no evidence had come to light connecting the todorov murder to riordans fate the team would be broken up the riordan case would go back to leith cid unless clarke did something about it it took her a further ten minutes to decide starr was still in his meeting so she grabbed her coat and wandered over to the desk where goodyear was working going somewhere he asked somewhat forlornly we both are she said brightening his day the drive across town to the consulate took only ten minutes it was housed on a grand georgian terrace within sight of the episcopalian cathedral the street was wide enough to accommodate a row of parking bays in the middle of the road and a car was pulling out of one bay as they arrived while goodyear put money in the meter clarke studied the car next to hers it looked very much like the one andropov had been using at the city chambers and nikolai stahov at the mortuary an old black merc with darkened rear windows the licence plate however wasnt the diplomatic kind so clarke called the station and asked for a check the car was registered to mr boris aksanov with an address in cramond clarke jotted down the details and ended the call you reckon theyll let us question him goodyear asked on his return she gave a shrug lets see shall we she crossed to the consulate climbed its three stone steps and pressed the buzzer the door was opened by a young woman with the fixed smile of the professional greeter clarke already had her warrant card open im here to see mr aksanov she stated mr aksanov the smile stayed fixed tour driver clarke turned her head his cars over there well hes not here clarke stared at the woman you sure about that of course what about mr stahov hes also not here at present whens he due back later today i think clarke was looking over the womans shoulder the entrance hall was large but barren with peeling paintwork and faded wallpaper a curving staircase led upwards but she had no view of the landing and mr aksanov i dont know hes not driving mr stahov then the smile was having a bit of trouble im afraid i cant help aksanovs driving sergei andropov is he the young womans hand was gripping the edge of the door clarke could tell she wanted to close it in their faces i cant help she repeated instead is mr aksanov a consular employee but now the door really was being closed slowly but determinedly well come back later clarke stressed the door clicked shut but she continued to stare at it she had frightened eyes goodyear commented clarke nodded her agreement waste of money too i put half an hour on the meter claim it back from the inquiry clarke turned and started towards the car but paused at the merc and checked her watch when she got in behind the steering wheel goodyear asked if they were headed back to gayfield square clarke shook her head parking wardens round here are vicious she said and that merc goes into the red in exactly seven minutes meaning someones going to have to feed the meter he guessed but clarke shook her head again its illegal to do that todd if they dont want a ticket theyre going to have to move the car she turned her key in the ignition i thought embassies never paid their fines anyway true enough if they have diplomatic plates clarke put the car into gear and moved out of the parking bay but only to stop again kerbside a few dozen yards further along worth a bit of a wait wouldnt you say she asked if it keeps me away from those transcripts goodyear agreed detective work losing its allure todd i think im ready to go back into uniform he drew back his shoulders working the muscles any news of di rebus they pulled him in again are they thinking of charging him reason they pulled him in was to tell him theres no evidence they didnt get a match from that overshoe no do they have anyone else in mind christ todd i dont know the silence in the car lasted half a dozen beats before clarke expelled air noisily look im sorry im the one who should be apologising he assured her couldnt help sticking my nose in no its me i could be in trouble how scdea were watching cafferty john got me to send them elsewhere the young mans eyes had widened bloody hell he said language she warned him they had surveillance on cafferty that has to look bad for di rebus clarke gave a shrug surveillance on cafferty goodyear repeated to himself shaking his head slowly clarkes attention had been diverted by movement along the street a man was exiting the consulate this looks promising she said same man whod been with stahov at the mortuary same man whod been photographed at the word power event aksanov unlocked the car and got in clarke decided to let her engine idle until she knew what he was going to do move to a different bay or head elsewhere when he passed his third vacant bay she had her answer were going to follow him goodyear asked fastening his seat belt well spotted and then what i was thinking of pulling him over on some trumpedup charge is that wise dunno yet lets see what happens the merc had signalled left into queensferry street heading out of town goodyear guessed aksanov lives in cramond maybe hes going home queensferry street became queensferry road looking at her speedometer clarke saw that he was staying within the limit when the traffic lights ahead turned red she watched his brake lights but they were both in good working order if cramond was his destination hed probably keep going till the barnton roundabout then take a right question was did she want him getting that far every few hundred yards on queensferry road there seemed to be another set of lights as the merc stopped at the next red clarke brought her own car up close behind it reach over into the back seat will you todd she asked on the floor there he had to undo his seatbelt in order to twist his body around sufficiently this what you want he asked plug it into the socket there she told him then put your window down theres a magnet on the base he guessed thats right the moment the flashing blue light was plugged in it began working goodyear reached out of the window and attached it to the roof the light ahead was still red clarke sounded her horn and watched the driver examine her in his rearview mirror she signalled with her hand for him to pull over when the light turned green that was exactly what he did crossing the junction and bumping his passengerside tyres up on to the pavement clarke passed him and then did the same with her car traffic slowed to watch but kept moving the driver was out of the merc he wore sunglasses and a suit and tie he was standing on the pavement when clarke reached him she had her id open for inspection is there a problem he asked his english heavily accented mr aksanov we met at the mortuary i asked what the problem was toure going to have to come to the station what have i done wrong he had lifted a mobile phone from his pocket i will speak to the consulate wont do you any good she warned him thats not an official car which makes me think youre selfemployed no immunity mr aksanov i am a driver for the consulate but not just the consulate now get in the car there was steel in her voice he was still holding the phone but had yet to do anything with it and if i refuse youll be charged with obstruction and anything else i can think of ive done nothing wrong thats all we need to hear but we need to hear it at the station my car he complained itll still be here well bring you back afterwards she managed a nice friendly smile promise how come you started driving sergei andropov around clarke asked i drive people for a living they were in an interview room at west end police station clarke not wanting to take the russian to gayfield square shed sent goodyear off to fetch coffee there was a tape deck on the table but she wasnt using it no notebook either aksanov had asked to smoke and she was letting him your english is good theres even a trace of local accent im married to a girl from edinburgh ive been here almost five years he inhaled some smoke and blew it ceilingwards is she a poetry fan too aksanov stared at clarke well she prompted she reads books mostly novels so its just you that likes poetry he shrugged but said nothing read any seamus heaney lately or how about robert burns why are you asking me this just that you were spotted at poetry readings twice in as many weeks or maybe its just that you really like alexander todorov people say he is russias greatest poet do you agree aksanov gave another shrug and examined the tip of his cigarette did you buy a copy of his latest book i dont see why this is any of your business can you remember what its called i dont have to talk to you im investigating two murders mr aksanov and what is that to me the russian was growing angry but then the door opened and goodyear came in with two drinks black two sugars he said placing one in front of aksanov white with none the second styrofoam cup was handed to clarke she nodded her thanks then gave the slightest flick of the head goodyear took the hint and walked to the far wall resting his back against it hands clasped in front of him aksanov had stubbed out the cigarette and was readying to light another second time you went she told him you took sergei andropov with you did i according to witnesses another mighty shrug this time accompanied by downturned mouth are you saying you didnt clarke asked im saying nothing makes me wonder what it is youre trying to hide were you on duty the night mr todorov died i dont remember im only asking you to think back a little over a week sometimes i work at night sometimes not andropov was at his hotel he had a meeting in the bar theres nothing i can tell you why did you go to those poetry readings mr aksanov clarke asked quietly did andropov ask you to go did he ask you to take him if i have done anything wrong go ahead and charge me is that what you want i want to get away from here the fingers which gripped the fresh cigarette were starting to shake a little do you remember the recital at the poetry library clarke asked keeping her voice low and level the man who was recording it hes been murdered too i was at the hotel all night she hadnt quite understood the caledonian she guessed gleneagles he corrected her the night of that fire it was early morning actually night morning i was at gleneagles all right she said wondering at his sudden increase in agitation who was it you were driving andropov or stahov both they travelled together i was there all the time so you keep saying because it is the truth but the night mr todorov died you dont recall if you were working or not no its quite important mr aksanov we think whoever killed todorov was driving a car i had nothing to do with it i find these questions totally unacceptable do you unacceptable and unreasonable finished already she asked after fifteen seconds of silence his brow furrowed tour cigarette she pointed out youd only just started it the russian stared at the ashtray where most of an entire cigarette smouldered having just been stubbed out having arranged for a patrol car to drop aksanov at queensferry road clarke wandered back down the corridor towards where goodyear was sharing gossip with two other constables before she could reach him however her mobile rang she didnt recognise the callers number hello she asked turning so her back was to goodyear and his colleagues detective sergeant clarke hello dr colwell i had half a mind to call you myself oh thought i might need a translator false alarm as it turned out what can i do for you ive just been listening to that cd still wrestling with the new poem to start with yes but i ended up listening to the whole thing had the same effect on me clarke admitted remembering back to when rebus and she had spent the hour in her car right at the end colwell was saying in fact after the recital and the q and a have finished yes the mic picks up some bits of conversation i remember doesnt the poet start muttering to himself thats just what thought and it was difficult to make out but its not alexanders voice then whose is it no idea but its in russian right oh its definitely russian and after a few plays i think ive worked out what hes saying clarke was thinking of charles riordan pointing his allhearing microphone towards various audience members picking up their comments so what is he saying she asked something along the lines of i wish he was dead clarke froze would you mind repeating that please rebus rendezvoused with her at colwells office and they listened to the cd together doesnt sound like aksanov clarke stated her phone started to ring and she gave a little growl as she answered the voice in her ear identified the caller as di calum stone tou wanted to speak to me he said ill have to phone you back later she cut the connection and shook her head slowly letting rebus know it was nothing important hed asked for the relevant section of the recording to be played again id lay money on it being andropov he muttered afterwards he was leaning forward in his chair elbows on knees hands clasped completely focused on the recording and seemingly immune to scarlett colwell who was crouched not three feet away next to the cd player face hidden by the curtain of hair and youre sure youve got the words right clarke asked the academic positive colwell said she repeated the russian it was written on a pad which clarke was now holding the same pad which had once held the translated poem i wish he was dead rebus checked not i want him killed or im going to kill him slightly less inflammatory colwell said pity rebus turned towards clarke plenty to be going on with though plenty she agreed say it is andropov whos he talking to has to be aksanov hasnt it and youve just let him go she nodded slowly we can always pick him up again hes pretty well settled here doesnt mean the consulate wont kick him on to a plane bound for moscow rebus stared at her know what i reckon andropov would love to have someone on the inside at the consulate that way hed know how the land lies back home if they planned to put him on trial consulate would be among the first to know aksanov as his eyes and ears clarke nodded her agreement fair enough but is he anything else executioner you mean rebus pondered this for a moment then realised that a tear was running down scarlett colwells face sorry he apologised to her i know this cant be easy just catch whoever did this to alexander she dabbed at her face with the back of her hand just do that please thanks to you he assured her weve come a step closer he picked up her translation of the poem andropov would have been furious about this calling him greedy and a blight and part of the whole parcel of rogues furious enough to want the poet dead clarke agreed but does that mean he did it rebus stared up at her again maybe we should ask him he said it had taken well over an hour for siobhan clarke to lead di derek starr through the story even then hed complained for a further fifteen minutes about being kept out of the loop before agreeing that sergei andropov should be brought in for questioning they had to shoo three detectives out of the interview room the men had set up base there and complained at having to move their stuff smells like a propforwards jockstrap in here starr commented i wouldnt know clarke replied with a thin smile shed bumped into goodyear in the cid suite and he too had voiced a complaint about being abandoned at the west end copshop true enough colwells phone call had led clarke straight out to her car goodyear still chatting to his pals in the corridor even so shed studied the young mans scowl and offered him four evenly spaced words get used to it to which hed replied that he really was ready to go back to torphichen and his constables uniform both they had dispatched a patrol car to the caledonian hotel forty minutes later it was back and discharging its unhappy human cargo it was almost eight oclock the sky black and the temperature falling do i have the right to a lawyer was sergei andropovs first question think you need one starr shot back hed borrowed a cd player and was tapping it with one finger andropov considered starrs question then took off his coat placed it over the back of the chair and sat down clarke was seated next to starr notebook and mobile phone in front of her she was hoping rebus stationed outside in his car would manage to keep quiet when youre ready ds clarke starr said pressing his hands together mr andropov she began i spoke to boris aksanov earlier today tes we were talking about the recital at the scottish poetry library i believe you were there did he tell you that there are plenty of witnesses sir she paused for a moment we already know that you knew alexander todorov in moscow and that the pair of you werent exactly friends again who told you this clarke ignored the question tou went to the reading with mr aksanov and then had to sit and listen as the poet extemporised a new piece clarke unfolded the translation heartless appetite the guts greed knows no fullness such a parcel of rogues not exactly a love letter is it its only a poem but directed at you mr andropov arent you one of the children of zhdanov like many thousands of others andropov gave a little laugh his eyes were shining by the way clarke said i should have offered commiserations at the start for what the eyes had narrowed and darkened your friends injuries have you visited him in hospital tou mean cafferty he seemed dismissive of the tactic hell survive a cause for celebration im sure what the hell is she getting at andropov directed the question at starr but it was clarke who answered f would you mind taking a listen to this on cue starr hit the play button the noise of the todorov recitals conclusion filled the room people rising from their seats commenting on the evening planning drinks and supper and then the burst of russian recognise it mr andropov clarke asked as starr paused the recording no sure about that maybe if di starr plays it back look what are you getting at we have a forensics facility here in the city mr andropov they have a pretty good track record when it comes to voicepattern recognition what do i care tou care because thats you on the recording expressing to boris aksanov your desire to see the poet alexander todorov dead the poet who had just humiliated you the poet who opposed everything you stand for she paused again and the very next night that same man was dead meaning i killed him andropovs laughter this time was louder and more sustained and when exactly did i do this did i spirit myself away from the hotel bar did i hypnotise your development minister so that he would not notice my disappearance others could have acted on your behalf starr stated icily well thats something youre going to have a great deal of trouble proving since it happens to be untrue why did you go to the recital clarke asked andropov stared at her and decided he had nothing to lose from answering boris told me hed been to one a few weeks before i was intrigued i had never seen alexander read in public mr aksanov didnt strike me as a poetry buff andropov shrugged maybe the consulate asked him to go why would they do that to ascertain how much of an irritant alexander intended to be during his stay in the city andropov shifted in his seat alexander todorov was a professional dissident its how he made his living picking the pockets of bleedingheart liberals all over the western world clarke waited to see if andropov had anything more to add and when you heard his latest poem she asked into the silence the shrug this time was conciliatory toure right i was angry with him what do poets give to the world do they provide jobs energy raw material no merely words and often well remunerated in the process certainly lionised above their due alexander todorov had been suckled by the west precisely because he pandered to its need to see russia as corrupt and corrosive andropov had made a fist of his right hand but then decided against thumping the desk instead he took a deep breath and exhaled noisily through his nostrils did say that i wished he was dead but those too were merely words nevertheless could boris aksanov have acted on them have you met boris he is no killer hes a teddy bear bears have claws starr felt it necessary to comment andropov glowered at him thank you for that information being a russian of course i would not have known that starr had started blushing to deflect attention from the fact he hit the play button again and they eavesdropped once more pausing the recording starr tapped the machine again id say weve got grounds to charge you he stated really well let us see what one of your famed edinburgh barristers will say about that we dont have barristers in scotland starr spat back theyre called advocates clarke explained but actually at this point its a solicitor youd want if we were charging you her words were aimed at starr appealing for him not to take it any further not just yet well andropov taking her meaning was asking the question of derek starr starrs mouth twitched but he said nothing in other words i am free to leave andropov had moved his attention to clarke but it was starr who barked out a response just dont leave the country there was more laughter from the russian i have no intention of departing your splendid country inspector nice warm gulag waiting for you back home clarke couldnt help adding that comment cheapens you andropov sounded disappointed in her going to drop by the hospital sometime she added funny isnt it how people around you seem to end up either dead or in a coma andropov was rising to his feet lifting his coat from the chair starr and clarke shared a look but neither could think of any tactic to delay his departure goodyear was just outside the door ready to show the russian out well talk again starr assured andropov i look forward to it inspector and we want you to surrender your passport was clarkes final salvo andropov gave a little bow of the head and was gone starr who had risen to his feet closed the door walked around the desk and sat down again facing clarke pretending to check for messages on her phone shed just broken the connection to rebus if its anyone starr was telling her its the driver even then a bit of hard evidence might be useful clarke had placed her notebook and mobile back in her bag andropovs right about aksanov i dont see him as an assassin then we need to look at the hotel angle again see if theres any way andropov could have followed the poet cafferty was there too dont forget one or the other then the problem she sighed is that weve got a third man jim bakewells already said the three of them were in that booth till gone eleven by which time todorov was dead so were back to square one starr didnt bother masking his exasperation were rattling the cage clarke corrected him then after a moments thought thanks for sticking with it derek starr thawed perceptibly tou should have come to me sooner siobhan i want a break on this as much as you do i know but youre going to split the two investigations arent you dci macrae thinks it would help she nodded as if agreeing with the analysis do we work tomorrow she asked weekend overtime has been approved john rebuss last day she stated quietly incidentally starr added ignoring her the officer who showed andropov out is he new to the team west end sent him she blithely lied starr was shaking his head cid he stated gets younger looking every year how did i do clarke asked sliding into the passenger seat three out often she stared at him gee thanks slammed shut the door rebuss car was parked directly outside the station he was thrumming his fingers against the steering wheel eyes straight ahead i nearly came running in there he went on how could you have missed it missed what only now did he deign to turn his head towards her that night in the poetry library andropov was only a couple of rows from the front no way he couldnt have seen the mic so so you were asking the wrong questions todorov got him riled he blurted out that he wanted him dead no harm done at the time the only other russianspeaker was his driver but then todorov does end up dead and suddenly our friend andropov has a problem the recording rebus nodded because if we ever heard it and got it translated hang on a second clarke pinched the skin either side of her nose and screwed shut her eyes got any aspirin glovebox maybe she looked and found a strip with two tablets left rebus handed her a bottle of water its seal broken if you dont mind a few germs he said her shake of the head told him she didnt she swallowed the tablets and gave her neck a few rotations i can hear the gristle from here he commiserated never mind that are you saying andropov didnt kill todorov suppose he didnt what would he be most afraid of he gave her a moment to answer then ploughed on hed be afraid of us thinking he had and wed have his own words as evidence bringing us to charles riordan clarkes mind was moving now aksanov got agitated about that when i questioned him kept going on about how hed been at gleneagles all the time maybe afraid that wed be putting him in the frame tou think andropov rebus shrugged rather depends on whether we can prove he left gleneagles that night or early morning wouldnt he just have phoned cafferty instead got him to do something about it possible rebus admitted still tapping out a rhythm on the steering wheel they were silent for the best part of a minute collecting their thoughts remember the trouble we had getting the caledonian hotel to cough up details of their guests dont suppose gleneagles will be any easier but weve got a secret weapon clarke said remember during the g dci macraes pal was in charge of security at the hotel macrae even got a tour of the premises meaning he may have met the manager got to be worth a try they fell back into silence you know what this means clarke finally asked rebus nodded again we still dont know who killed todorov whichever way you look at it andropov said he wanted him dead doesnt mean he turned words into deeds if i topped someone every time i cursed them thered be precious few students and cyclists left in edinburgh or anyone else for that matter would i still be here she asked probably he allowed despite the three out of ten dont push your luck ds clarke todd goodyear not joining us rebus asked has he grown on you they were in kays bar a compromise it did decent grub but the beer was good too slightly larger than the oxford bar but managing to be cosy at the same time the predominant colour was red extending to the pillars which separated the tables from the actual bar clarke had ordered chilli rebus declaring that salted peanuts would be enough for him youve managed to keep him below derek starrs radar rebus asked in place of an answer to her question di starr thinks todd is cid she stole another of rebuss peanuts do i get to dunk my fingers in your chilli when it comes ill buy you another packet he swallowed a mouthful of ipa she was drinking a toxic looking mix of lime juice and soda water anything planned for tomorrow he asked the teams on duty all day so no surprise party for the old guy tou didnt want one so youve just chipped in and bought me something nice meant digging deep into the overdraft what time does your suspension end around lunchtime i suppose rebus thought back to the scene in corbyns office sir michael addison storming out sir michael was gill morgans stepfather gill knew nancy sievewright nancy and gill and eddie gentry had been spied on the recording watched by roger anderson stuart janney and jim bakewell everything in edinburgh seemed connected as a detective rebus had noticed time and again how true this was everything and everyone todorov and andropov andropov and cafferty the overworld and the underworld sol goodyear knew nancy and her crew too sol was todd goodyears brother and todd led back to siobhan and to rebus himself shifting partners in one of those endurance dances what was the film something about shooting horses dance and keep on dancing because nothing else matters problem was rebus was about to bow out siobhans chilli had arrived and he watched her unfold a paper napkin on to her lap day after tomorrow hed be seated at the edge of the dancefloor give it a few weeks and hed be yet further back merging with the other spectators no longer a participant hed seen it with other cops they retired and promised to keep in touch but each visit to the old gang merely underlined how far apart theyd grown there would be an arrangement to share drinks and gossip one night a month then itd be once every few months then not at all clean break was the best thing so hed been told siobhan was asking if he wanted some of her food grab a fork and tuck in im fine he assured her tou were in a world of your own there its the age im at so youll come to the station tomorrow lunchtime no parties right she shook her head in agreement and by end of play well have closed all the cases of course we will he gave a wry smile ill miss you you know she kept her eyes on the food as she scooped it up for a little while maybe he conceded waving his empty glass at her time for a refill toure driving remember thought you could give me a lift in your car til get you a taxi home after thats mighty generous didnt say id pay for it rebus told her heading for the bar he did though pressing a tenpound note into her hand and saying hed see her tomorrow shed found a parking space for his saab near the top of arden street hed been about to invite her in when a black cab rumbled into view its roof light on siobhan clarke had given the driver a wave then handed rebus his car keys bit of luck shed said referring to the taxi rebus had held out the tenner and shed eventually taken it straight home mind hed warned her watching the cab pull away he wondered if he was going to take his own advice it was almost ten the temperature well above zero he walked down the hill towards his door staring up at the bay window of his living room darkness up there no one waiting to welcome him he thought about cafferty wondered what dreams the gangster would be having did you dream in a coma did you do anything else rebus knew he could visit him sit with him maybe one of the nurses would bring a cup of tea maybe shed be a good listener alexander todorovs skull had been smashed from behind cafferty had been attacked from behind but attacked cleanly while the poet had been roughed up first rebus kept trying to see the connection andropov was the obvious one andropov with his friends in high places megan macfarlane jim bakewell cafferty hosting parties wining and dining bakewell and the bankers all lads together andropov readying to bring his business to scotland where his new friends would cosset him protect him business was business after all what did it matter if andropov faced corruption charges back home rebus realised that he was still staring at his flats unlit and unwelcoming windows nice night for a walk he told himself continuing downhill with hands in pockets marchmont itself was quiet melville drive devoid of vehicles jawbone walk the path leading through the meadows boasted only a handful of pedestrians students heading home from nights out rebus walked beneath the arches created from an actual whales jawbone and wondered not for the first time at its purpose when his daughter was a kid he would pretend they were being swallowed by the whale like jonah or pinocchio there was some drunken singing in the distance from a couple of tramps on a bench worldly goods stacked in bags by the side of them the old infirmary compound was being transformed into new apartment blocks changing the skyline he kept walking reaching forrest road instead of heading straight on in the direction of the mound he took a fork at greyfriars bobby and descended into the grassmarket plenty of pubs still open and people loitering outside the homeless hostels when hed first moved to edinburgh the grassmarket had been a dump much of the old town in fact had been in dire need of a facelift hard now to remember just how bad it had all been there were people who said that edinburgh never changed but this was patently untrue it was changing all the time smokers were standing in clusters outside the beehive and last drop pubs the fish n chip shop had a queue a gust of fatfrying hit rebus as he walked past and he breathed deeply savouring it at one time the grassmarket had boasted a gallows dozens upon dozens of covenanters dying there maybe todorovs ghost would bump into them another fork in the road was approaching he took the righthand option into kings stables road passing the car park he stopped for a moment there was just the one vehicle on level zero the ground floor driver would have to get a move on the place was due to close in the next ten or so minutes the car was parked in the bay next to where todorov had been attacked there was no sign of any hooded woman begging for sex rebus lit a cigarette and kept moving he didnt know what his plan was kings stables road would join lothian road in a minute and hed be facing the caledonian hotel was sergei andropov still there did rebus really intend a further confrontation nice night for it he repeated to himself but then he thought of those grassmarket pubs it would make more sense to retrace his steps have a nightcap and take a taxi home he turned on his heels and started back as he approached the car park again he saw the last car leaving it stopped kerbside and its driver got out retreating to the exit he unlocked some metal shutters which started to creep downwards with an electric hum the driver didnt wait to watch them drop he was in the car and heading towards the grassmarket the goodlooking security guard gary walsh parked on level zero hadnt he told rebus he always parked next to the security cabin on the next floor up the shutters were closed now but there was a little viewing window at chest height rebus crouched a little so he could peer inside the lights were still on maybe they stayed that way all night up in the corner he could see the security camera he remembered what walshs colleague had said camera used to point pretty much at that spot but it gets moved around made sense to rebus if you worked in a multistorey youd want your car where the cameras could keep an eye on it sod anyone else just so long as your car was safe macraes words less to this than meets the eye all those connections cath mills aka the reaper asking rebus about onenight stands and flings with workmates alexander todorov on his way back from a day in glasgow a curry with charles riordan one drink on caffertys tab and semen on his underpants the woman in the hood less to this than meets the eye cherchez la femme the poet and his libido there was a leonard cohen album called death of a ladies man one of its tracks dont go home with your hardon another true love leaves no traces trace evidence blood on the car park floor oil on the dead mans clothes semen stains cherchez la femme the answer was so close rebus could almost taste it day nine saturday november bright and early that morning rebus took his ticket from the machine and watched the barrier shudder upwards he had entered by the car parks top level on castle terrace but followed the signs to the next level down there were plenty of empty bays near the guardroom rebus walked over to the door and gave a knock before pushing it open whats up joe wills asked hands cupped around a mug of black tea his eyes narrowed as he placed rebus hello again mr wills rough night was it wills hadnt shaved his eyes were redrimmed and bleary and he hadnt got round to putting his tie on yet few drinks i was having the man started to explain and the reaper catches me on the mobile bill prentice has gone and pulled a sickie and can i do his morning shift and despite everything you were happy to oblige thats what i call loyalty rebus saw the newspaper on the worktop polonium was being blamed for litvinenkos death rebus had never heard of it what do you want anyway joe wills was asking thought you lot had finished rebus noticed that willss mug was emblazoned with the name of a local radio station talk dont suppose youve any milk on you the man asked but rebuss attention was on the cctv screens do you drive to work mr wills sometimes i remember you saying youd had a prang car still runs is it here just now no whys that then but rebus held up a finger toud still not pass a breathalyser am i right he watched wills nod very sensible of you sir but the times you do drive to work im betting you keep the car where you can see it sure wills took a sip of tea squirming at its bitterness covered by one of the cameras in other words rebus nodded towards the bank of screens always park in the same spot depends how about your colleague would i be right in thinking mr walsh prefers the ground floor how do you know that again rebus ignored the question when i was here the first time he said instead day after the murder if you remember tes the cameras downstairs werent covering the spot where the attack took place he gestured towards one of the screens you told me one camera used to but it got moved around but now i see its been shifted again so its covering heres another wild guess coming up the bay where mr walsh parks is this going anywhere rebus managed a smile just wondering this mr wills when exactly did that camera get moved he was leaning over the figure of the guard last shift you did before the murder im betting it was pointing where it is now between times someone tampered with it i told you it gets moved around rebus wasnt six inches from wills when he next spoke tfou know dont you youre not the sharpest tack in the carpet but you worked it out before any of us have you told anyone mr wills or are you good at keeping secrets maybe you just want the quiet life a few drinks at night and some milk to go with your tea youre not about to grass up a mate are you but heres my advice mr wills and it really would be in your interest to take it rebus paused ensuring he had the mans undivided attention dont say a fucking word to your workmate because if you do and i get to hear about it ill have you in the cells rather than him understood wills had stopped moving the mug trembling slightly in his hands do we have an understanding rebus persisted the guard did no more than nod but rebus hadnt quite finished with him an address he said placing his notebook on the worktop write it down for me he watched joe wills put down the mug and start to comply walshs batch of cds was in its usual place rebus doubted wills would have much use for them and one last thing he said taking the notebook back when my saab reaches the exit i want you to override the barrier for me money you charge in this place is absolutely criminal shandon was on the west side of the city tucked in between the canal and slateford road not much more than a fifteenminute drive especially at the weekend rebus had switched on his cd player only to find himself listening to eddie gentry he ejected the disc and tossed it on to the back seat replacing it with tom waits but the patented gravel of waitss voice was too obtrusive so he settled for silence instead gary walsh lived at number a terraced house in a narrow street there was a space next to walshs car so rebus parked the saab and locked it the upstairs window at number was curtained stood to reason when a man worked the late shift he slept late too rebus decided to leave the doorbell alone and knocked instead when the door opened a woman in full makeup stood there her hair was immaculate and she was dressed for work minus her shoes mrs walsh rebus said yes im detective inspector rebus as she studied his warrant card he studied her latethirties or early forties meaning maybe ten years older than her partner gary walsh it seemed was a toyboy but when joe wills had called mrs walsh a stoater he hadnt been kidding she was well preserved and glowing with life ripe was the word rebus found himself thinking on the other hand those looks wouldnt last much longer nothing stayed ripe for ever mind if i come in he asked whats it about the murder mrs walsh her green eyes widened the one at your husbands place of work gary didnt say anything the russian poet found dead at the bottom of raeburn wynd it was in the papers the attack started in the car park her eyes were losing some of their focus it was last wednesday night just before your husband finished work he paused for a moment you really dont know do you he didnt tell me some of the colour had drained from her face rebus went into his notebook and pulled out a newspaper cutting it showed a photo of the poet taken from one of his book jackets his name was alexander todorov mrs walsh but she had dashed back into the house not quite closing the door behind her rebus paused for a moment then pushed it open again and followed her inside the hallway was small with half a dozen coats hanging on hooks next to the staircase two doors off kitchen and living room she was in the latter seated on the edge of the settee as she tied a pair of highheeled shoes around her ankles im going to be late she muttered where do you work rebus was scanning the room big tv big hifi and shelves filled to the brim with cds and tapes perfume counter she was saying i dont suppose five minutes will hurt garys sleeping you can come back later hes got to take the car to the garage though get the player fixed her voice trailed off what is it mrs walsh she was rubbing her hands together as she got to her feet rebus doubted that her unsteadiness was due to the heels nice duffel coat by the way he told her she looked at him as though hed started using a foreign language in the hall he explained the black one with the hood looks right cosy he smiled without humour ready to tell me about it mrs walsh theres nothing to tell she was looking around the room as if for an escape hatch we have to get the car fixed so you keep saying rebus narrowed his eyes and peered out of the window towards the ford escort what is it youve remembered mrs walsh maybe we should wake gary eh i have to get to work there are some questions that need answering first less than meets the eye those words kept bouncing around the inside of rebuss skull todorov had led him to cafferty and andropov and hed latched on to both because they were the ones who interested him because they were the ones he wanted to be guilty seeing conspiracies and coverups where none existed andropov had panicked because of that single outburst didnt mean hed killed the poet how did you find out about gary and cath mills rebus asked quietly cath mills admitting to rebus that night in the bar that shed almost given up on onenight stands walshs wife gave a look of horror and slumped on to the sofa again face in hands smearing the perfect makeup started muttering the words oh god over and over then eventually he kept telling me it had just been that one time just the once and a mistake at that a huge mistake but you thought you knew better rebus added yes gary walsh would be tempted again would stray again he was young and chiselled and rockstar handsome whereas his wife was getting older by the day makeup doing only so much to cover the working of time a pretty desperate measure rebus stated quietly wearing that hood so hed get the message hanging around the street offering yourself to strangers smudgy tears were coursing down both cheeks her shoulders heaving alexander todorov wrong place wrong time a voluptuous woman offering nostrings sex leading him into the car park where theyd be in full view of the camera gary walshs car their destination not that todorov was to know that screwing a man shed only just met so that her watching husband would know the price of further infidelity did you do it against the car he asked on the bonnet maybe he was still peering out at the escort thinking fingerprints blood maybe even semen inside her voice wasnt much more than a whisper inside i had a set of keys is that where he didnt need to finish the sentence she was nodding meaning walsh and the reaper had enjoyed their tryst in the same place not my idea she said and rebus had to strain to make out the words the man youd picked up he realised he wanted to do it inside the car she nodded again bit more comfortable i suppose he offered but then a thought hit him the missing cd todorovs final performance as recorded by charles riordan car to the garage get the player fixed whats wrong with the cd player mrs walsh rebus asked keeping his voice level its his cd isnt it he wanted to hear it while you were she stared at him through a mess of mascara and eyeliner its stuck in the machine but i didnt know i didnt know didnt know he was dead she shook her head wildly from side to side and rebus believed her all shed needed was a man any man and when it was over shed pushed it from her mind hadnt asked his name or nationality probably hadnt looked at his face maybe shed taken a couple of strong drinks for courage and her husband hadnt wanted to talk about it afterwards hadnt told her anything rebus stood by the window deep in thought so many domestics down the years partners abusing partners lies and deceit fury and festering resentment theres a fury here sudden or protracted violence mind games power struggles love turning sour or stale as the years passed and now here came sleepyfaced gary walsh descending the staircase calling out to his wife tou still here through the hall and into the living room barefoot in faded denims and with his torso naked rubbing one hand up and down his hairless chest as he wiped at his eyes with the other blinking as he realised there was a stranger in the room looking to his wife for an explanation her face creased in pain tears dripping from her chin then back to rebus placing him now eyes turning towards the door in contemplation of flight with no shoes on gary rebus chided him i could outrun you in diving boots you fat bastard walsh sneered and theres that sudden rage weve been looking forward to rebus said with just a hint of a smile care to tell your wife what happened to alexander todorov when you got hold of him he fell asleep in the car mrs walsh was saying playing the scene back in her mind eyes stinging and red but fixed on her young husband i realised he was drunk couldnt rouse him so i left him gary had leant his head against the door frame arms behind him hands pressed to the jamb i dont know what shes talking about he eventually drawled really i dont rebus had his mobile in his hand punching in the necessary number he kept his eyes on walsh walsh staring back at him still thinking about doing a runner rebus pressed the phone to his ear siobhan he said bit of news to brighten your morning hed started giving the address when gary walsh spun round hand snaking ahead of him readying to unlock the front door it was a few inches open freedom shining in when rebuss weight smashed into him from behind expelling all the air from walshs chest and the power from his legs the door slammed shut again and he slid on to his knees coughing and spluttering and with blood dripping from his crumpled nose his wife appeared not to have noticed wrapped up in her own drama as she sat head in hands on the sofas edge rebus picked his mobile up from the carpet aware of the adrenalin pounding through him his heart racing one perk of the job he really was going to miss sorry about that he told clarke just ran into someone the forensics team had come for the ford escort their mechanic taking only a few minutes to extract the stuck cd it played perfectly on the machine at gayfield square there was nothing written on it but the single word riordan same as on the copy riordan himself had made for siobhan clarke more good news looked like the toolbox in the boot would be helpful walsh had rinsed the blood from the claw hammer but there were spots elsewhere the rest of the car in and out would be dusted tested and checked by ray duff and his lab boys back at their howdenhall hq it was as even derek starr admitted a result starr hadnt been expecting much of anything from the day except overtime instead of which he was bouncing on his toes and had called the chief constable at home before anyone else had a chance much to the annoyance of dci macrae starrs very next call gary walsh was in ir and louisa walsh in ir telling their separate stories the husbands resistance crumbled only by degrees as he was presented with one piece of evidence after another the hammer the blood the moving of the camera afterwards to make it seem as though he could not have witnessed the attack a search warrant was being issued the detectives asked walsh if they might conceivably find the items stolen from alexander todorov hidden somewhere in or around his home or place of work but hed shaken his head didnt mean to murder him just wanted him out of my car sleeping like a baby after shagging my wife stinking of booze and sweat and her perfume smacked him around a bit and he staggered off into the night i got in the car and started driving then noticed hed done something to the cd player it wasnt working any more the final fucking straw saw him at the bottom of that alley and i just lost it i lost it thats all and its all her fault thought if i took a few things away with me itd look like a mugging theyre at the foot of castle rock i chucked them over the wall so siobhan clarke said after everything weve gone through it boils down to a domestic she sounded dazed and devastated unwilling to believe rebus shrugged in sympathy he was back inside gayfield square di derek starr himself having granted permission saying hed deal with any and all repercussions big of you rebus had muttered he has a fling clarke continued for herself more than rebus admits it to the wife who acts out her revenge husband sees red and the poor drunken sap shes cajoled into having sex with her ends up on a slab she started shaking her head slowly a cold cleansed death rebus commented thats a line of todorovs clarke told him and there was nothing cleansed about it rebus gave a slow shrug andropov told me cherchez la femme he was trying to muddy the water but turns out he was right the drink with cafferty riordan recording the recital andropov stahov macfarlane and bakewell she counted the names off on her fingers nothing to do with it rebus admitted in the end it came down to a jammed cd and a man brought to the boil they were standing in the corridor outside the interview rooms keeping their voices low aware of the presence behind the nearest doors of walsh and his wife clarke was having a desolate little laugh to herself as one of the uniforms appeared around the corner rebus recognised todd goodyear back in the old woolly suit rebus asked him goodyear brushed his hands down the front of his uniform im pulling a weekend shift at west end but when i heard i had to make a detour is it true seems to be clarke sighed the car park attendant he watched her nod so all those hours i spent on the riordan tapes were part of the process rebus assured him slapping a hand on the young mans shoulder goodyear stared at him toure back from suspension he realised not much escapes you lad goodyear held out a hand for rebus to shake im glad theyre looking elsewhere for whoever attacked cafferty not sure im totally off the hook but thanks anyway need to get the boot of your car fixed rebus chuckled toure right about that todd soon as i get a minute goodyear had turned towards clarke another handshake and a thank you for her help tou did okay kid she told him affecting an american accent the blood was creeping up his neck as he bowed his head a final time and headed back the way hed come god knows how much work he put into those parliament tapes clarke said under her breath all of it redundant part of lifes rich tapestry shiv you really should get that car of yours fixed he made show of checking his watch hardly matters does it few hours from now ill be binning the crime kit along with everything else well before you do that he looked at her tes touve shown me yours so im presuming youll want to see mine he folded his arms rocking on the balls of his feet explain he said last night we said we wanted everything wrapped up by end of play today indeed we did so lets go to the cid suite and see what that clever dci macrae has done rebus intrigued was happy to follow the empty room looked as if a bomb had hit it the todorovriordan team had left their mark not even anyone to crack a beer with rebus complained bit early clarke chided him besides i thought you didnt want a party but to celebrate our success with the todorov case call that success its a result and what do they add up to all these results he wagged a finger at her im leaving just in time a few more weeks and youd be jaundiced beyond saving be nice to think we made a difference though wouldnt it she answered with another sigh i thought that was what you were about to prove to me she gave a smile eventually and sat down at her computer i did it by the book asked dci macrae to see if his pal would put in a word for us at gleneagles they promised theyd email me the details first thing this morning details of what exactly guests who left the hotel late at night or early morning just before riordan was killed ones who checked out and ones who came back she was making rapid clicks with her mouse rebus moved around the desk to stand behind her so he could see what she was seeing whos your money on andropov or his driver got to be one or the other but then she opened the email and her mouth fell open well well was all rebus said it took them the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon to put everything together they had the information from gleneagles and had pushed their luck still further by asking for the guests licence plate armed with this graeme macleod at central monitoring pulled from a golf game at rebuss request had gone back to the cctv tapes from joppa and portobello seeking a particular vehicle now which made the task a whole lot easier meantime gary walsh had been charged his wife released rebus had studied both parties statements while clarke showed more interest in some rugby match on the radio scotland being tanked by australia at murrayfield it was pm by the time they entered ir thanking the uniformed officer and telling him he could go rebus had stepped outside half an hour earlier for a cigarette surprised to find it already dark the day had sped past unnoticed just one more thing hed miss about the job but there was still time for a bit of fun as the door to ir started to close rebus whispered in clarkes ear asking for two minutes alone with the suspect adding that he wasnt about to do anything daft she hesitated but then relented rebus made sure the door was closed then walked over to the table and pulled out the metallegged chair making sure its feet scraped the floor with maximum discord ive been trying to work out he began what your connection with sergei andropov is and ive decided it comes down to this you want his money doesnt matter to you or your bank how he made it were not in the business of dealing with crooks inspector stuart janney stated he was wearing a blue cashmere poloneck and peagreen twilled trousers with brown leather slipon shoes yet this weekend attire was too studied and selfconscious to be truly casual feather in your cap though rebus said bringing in a multimillionaire and all his chattels business has never been better at fab eh mr janney profits in the billions but its still a cutthroat world dog eat dog and all that you always have to make sure your names up there in lights im not exactly sure where all this is headed janney admitted folding his arms impatiently sir michael addison probably thinks youre one of his golden boys but not for much longer stuart want to know why janney leaned back in his chair seemingly unconcerned and not about to take the bait ive seen the film rebus told him in a voice just above a whisper what film janneys eyes met rebuss and stayed fixed on them the film of you watching another film cafferty bugged his own screening room if you can believe that and there you are getting your jollies watching amateurhour porn rebus had lifted the dvd from his pocket an indiscretion janney conceded for most people maybe but not for you rebus gave the coldest of smiles making sure the glint from the silver disc played across janneys face causing him to blink see what you did stuart goes way beyond indiscretion rebus pushed his elbows against the table leaning further across it that party the scene in the bathroom know who the gobbler was the druggedup gobbler her names gill morgan ring any bells you watched your chiefs beloved stepdaughter snorting coke and doling out blowjobs hows that going to play next time you bump into sir mike at a corporate beanfeast the blood was draining so rapidly from janneys face he might have had a tap attached to either foot rebus got up tucking the disc back into his jacket and walked to the door opening it for siobhan clarke she gave him a stare but saw she wasnt going to be enlightened instead she replaced rebus in the chair placing a folder and some photographs on the table in front of her rebus watched as she took a moment to compose herself she gave another look in his direction and offered a smile he nodded his reply your turn now he was telling her on the night of monday november the twentieth clarke began you were staying at gleneagles hotel in perthshire but you decided to leave early why was that mr janney i wanted to get back to edinburgh and thats why you packed your things at three am and asked for your bill to be made up there was a pile of work waiting for me in the office but not so much rebus reminded him that you didnt have time to drop off mr stahovs list of russians to us thats right janney said still trying to take in some news rebus had given him clarke could see that the banker had been shaken by whatever rebus had said good she thought knocks him off balance i think she said you brought us that list precisely because you wanted to know what was happening about charles riordan what ever heard of the dog returning to its vomit its shakespeare isnt it the bible actually rebus corrected him book of proverbs not quite the scene of the crime clarke continued but a chance for you to ask a few questions see how things were going im still not sure what youre getting at clarke gave a fourbeat pause then checked the contents of the folder you live in barnton mr janney thats right handy for the forth road bridge i suppose so and thats the way you came back from gleneagles is it i think so alternative would be stirling and the m clarke informed him or rebus added at a pinch you could do the kincardine bridge but whatever route you might happen to take clarke continued would bring you into town from the west or the north and leave you close to home she paused again which is why were scratching our heads to comprehend what your silver porsche carrera might have been doing in portobello high street an hour and a half after you checked out of gleneagles she slid the cctv image towards janney youll see that its timestamped and dated yours is pretty much the only car on the road mr janney care to tell us what you were up to there must be some mistake janney was staring off to one side concentrating on the floor rather than the evidence in front of his eyes thats what youll say in court is it rebus teased him thats what your ruinously expensive defence lawyer will stand up and tell judge and jury maybe i just didnt feel like going home janney offered causing rebus to clap his hands together thats more like it he said car like that you just wanted to keep on driving down the coast maybe you wouldnt stop till the border but heres what we actually think happened mr janney clarke interrupted sergei andropov was fretting about a recording at the mention ofrecording janneys eyes darted to rebus and rebus offered a slow exaggerated wink back maybe he mentioned it to you clarke continued or it could have been his driver the problem was hed made a remark about wanting alexander todorov dead and now todorov was dead if the tape came to light mr andropov would be in the frame might have to leave the country or end up being deported scotlands supposed to be his refuge his safe haven only thing waiting for him in moscow is a show trial and if he leaves all those potentially lucrative deals go with him all his tens of millions go with him thats why you decided to go have a word with charles riordan the chat didnt work and he ended up unconscious i didnt even know charles riordan funny rebus said mockcasually your banks the main sponsor of an art installation he was doing at the parliament i reckon if we ask around well find that youd met him at some point i dont think you meant to kill him clarke added trying to add some empathy to her voice tou just wanted that recording destroyed you knocked him out and looked for the tape but it was needleinahaystack stuff thousands upon thousands of tapes and cds in that house of his so then you set that little fire not the kind that would consume a building and turn anyone inside into crispy strips it was just the tapes you wanted too many for you to cart them away and not enough time to go through them all so you stuck some paper into a bottle of cleaner lit it and walked away this is nonsense janney said in a voice cracking with emotion problem was clarke went on ignoring him all that acoustic baffling proved to be a fire hazard with riordan dead we were looking for a suspect in both killings and andropov still seemed to fit the bill so all your hard work was in vain mr janney charles riordan died and died for nothing i didnt do it is that the truth janney nodded eyes everywhere but on either detective okay then clarke told him youve nothing to worry about she closed the folder and gathered together the photos janney could hardly believe it clarke was getting to her feet that pretty much takes care of it she confirmed well just head along to processing and then youll be on your way janney was standing but with his hands pressing against the tabletop helping him stay upright processing he queried just a formality sir rebus assured him we need to take your fingerprints janney had made no attempt to move whatever for clarke supplied the answer there was a print left on the bottle of solvent it has to belong to whoever started the fire but it cant be yours stuart can it rebus asked you were out enjoying a drive down our beautiful coastline in the crisp predawn air fingerprint the word slid out of janneys mouth like a small scuttling creature i like to do a bit of motoring myself rebus was saying todays my retirement means i can do a lot more of it in the future maybe youll show me the route you took why are you sitting down again stuart is there anything we can get you mr janney clarke asked solicitously stuart janney looked at her and then at rebus before deciding that the ceiling merited his full attention when he spoke his throat was so stretched neither detective could quite make out the words mind repeating that clarke asked politely you can get me a lawyer janney duly obliged whenever anyone retires or resigns in the movies siobhan clarke said they always seem to carry a box out of the building thats true rebus agreed hed been through his desk and found precisely nothing of a personal nature turned out he didnt even have a mug of his own just drank from whichever one was available at the time in the end he pocketed a couple of cheap ballpoint pens and a sachet of lemsip a full year past its sellby you had the flu last december clarke reminded him still dragged my sorry carcass into work though and sneezed and groaned for a full week phyllida hawes added hands on hips passing the germs to me colin tibbet stated ah the fun weve had rebus said with an affected sigh there was no sign of dci macrae though hed left a note telling rebus to leave his warrant card on the desk in his office derek starr was absent too gone six oclock meaning hed be in a club or wine bar celebrating the days results and trying the usual chatup lines rebus looked around the cid suite you really didnt buy me anything you miserable shower of bastards have you seen the price of gold watches clarke said with a smile on the other hand the back room of the ox has been reserved for the night and theres a hundred quids worth of a tab what we dont get through tonight is yours for afterwards rebus considered this so thats what it comes down to after all these years you want me drinking myself to death and weve booked the cafe st honore for nine oclock staggering distance from the ox and staggering distance back again hawes added just the four of us rebus asked a few more faces might drop by macraes promised to look in tarn banks and ray duff professor gates and dr curt todd and his girlfriend i hardly know them rebus complained clarke folded her arms he needed a bit of persuading so dont think im suddenly going to uninvite them my party but your rules eh and shug davidsons coming too hawes reminded clarke rebus rolled his eyes im still a bloody suspect for the assault on cafferty shug doesnt seem to think so clarke said what about calum stone didnt think hed want to come you know full well what i mean are we ready for the off hawes asked they all looked at rebus and he nodded really he wanted five minutes on his own to say a proper goodbye to the place but he didnt suppose it mattered gayfield square was just another copshop this old priest rebus had known dead several years back had said that cops were like the priesthood the world their confessional stuart janney had yet to confess he would have a night in the cells to consider his options tomorrow or monday with a lawyer present and siobhan clarke seated opposite he would lay out his version of the story rebus didnt suppose siobhan saw herself as any kind of a priest he watched her now as she slipped her arms into her coat and made sure everything she needed was in her shoulder bag their eyes met for a moment and they shared a smile rebus walked into macraes office and placed his warrant card on the corner of the desk he thought back to all the police stations hed known great london road st leonards craigmillar gayfield square men and women hed worked with most retired some of them long dead cases solved and left unresolved days in court hours spent waiting to give testimony paperwork and legal wrangling and cockups tearstained evidence from victims and their families sneers and denials from the accused human folly exposed all those biblical deadly sins laid bare with a few more besides monday morning his alarm clock would be redundant he could spend all day over breakfast stick his suit back in the wardrobe to be pulled out again only for funerals he knew all the scare stories people who left work one week and were in a wooden box by the next loss of work equalling loss of purpose in the great scheme of things hed wondered often if the only thing for it was to clear out of the city altogether his flat would buy him a fairsized house elsewhere the fife coastline or west to one of the distillerystrewn islands or south into reiver country but he couldnt see himself ever leaving edinburgh it was the oxygen in his bloodstream but still with mysteries to be explored hed lived there for as long as hed been a cop the two job and city becoming intertwined each new crime had added to his understanding without that understanding ever coming near to completion bloodstained past mingling with bloodstained present covenanters and commerce a city of banking and brothels virtue and vitriol underworld meeting overworld penny for them it was siobhan standing in the doorway youd be wasting your money he told her somehow i very much doubt that are you ready hoisting her bag on to her shoulder as ill ever be he decided this much was true there were just the four of them at the oxford bar to start with the back room had indeed been set aside for their use with the help of strips of crimescene tape nice touch rebus admitted hoisting his first pint of the evening after the best part of an hour they headed to the restaurant a bag of gifts was waiting there from siobhan an ipod rebus protested that he would never master the technology ive already loaded it she told him the stones who wishbone ash you name it john martyn jackie leven even a bit of hawkwind my exit music rebus commented with a look close to contentment from hawes and tibbet a bottle of yearold malt and a book of historical walks through edinburgh rebus kissed the bottle and patted the book then insisted on wearing headphones for the first part of the meal listening to jack bruce beats you lot any day he explained just the two bottles of wine with dinner then back to the ox where gates curt and macrae had arrived the bar providing a couple of bottles of champagne todd goodyear and his girlfriend sonia were the last to arrive it was almost eleven and rebus was on his fourth pint colin tibbet was outside taking gulps of fresh air while phyllida hawes rubbed his back encouragingly looks in a bad way goodyear commented seven double brandies will do that to a man there was no music but then it wasnt needed the various conversations were unforced and full of laughter anecdotes were recounted with the two pathologists telling the best of them macrae shook rebuss hand warmly and told him he had to get home remember to drop by and see us were his parting words derek starr was standing in a corner discussing work with a boredlooking shug davidson the fact hed come at all meant his wine bar chatups had failed yet again each time davidson glanced over rebus offered him a winced commiseration when a tray appeared with the next round of drinks rebus found himself next to sonia todd tells me you work sceneofcrimes he said thats right sorry i dont recognise the face ive usually got a hood over my head she said with a shy smile she was short maybe five feet with cropped blonde hair and green eyes the dress she was wearing looked japanese and suited her slight thinboned figure how long have you and todd been an item a year and a bit rebus looked over to where goodyear was handing out drinks must be doing something right he commented hes quite brilliant you know cids got to be the next step might be a vacancy rebus conceded so how do you like sceneofcrimes its all right i heard you were at raeburn wynd the night todorov was killed she nodded and at the canal too i was on callout mucked up your plans with todd rebus sympathised how do you mean her eyes had narrowed nothing rebus said wondering if maybe hed started slurring his words it was me who found the overshoe she added then her eyes widened and she put her free hand to her mouth dont worry about it rebus assured her im no longer in the frame apparently she relaxed and gave a little laugh but it says a lot about todds skills dont you think absolutely rebus agreed anything floating in that part of the canal chances are it would end up getting stuck under the bridge thats what he said and he was right rebus admitted which is why cid would be mad not to take him our sanitys often been questioned rebus warned her but you got a result on todorov she stated yes we did rebus agreed with a tired smile goodyear was chatting to siobhan clarke now whatever he said made her laugh rebus decided it was time for a cigarette break and reached out to take sonias hand planting a kiss on the back of it the perfect gentleman she was saying as he moved towards the door if only you knew kid hawes and tibbet were at the far end of the street tibbet with his back to the wall hawes in front of him stroking the hair back from his forehead a couple of other smokers were watching the show a while since that happened to me one said which his neighbour asked feeling like spewing or having a woman run her fingers through your hair rebus joined in the laughter and then busied himself with the cigarette at the other end of the street the lights were on in the first ministers residence a labour enclave since devolution it was now under threat from the nationalists in fact rebus couldnt think of a time when scotland hadnt returned a labour majority he had voted only three times in his life each time for a different party by the time of the devolution referendum hed lost all interest hed met plenty of politicians since megan macfarlane and jim bakewell were merely the latest examples but reckoned half the regulars in the ox would make better legislators the likes of bakewell and macfarlane were a constant and though stuart janney would go to prison rebus doubted it would have any real effect on first albannach they would continue to work with people like sergei andropov and morris gerald cafferty continue to rake in the bad money with the good jobs and prosperity the majority didnt care how they came into being or were sustained edinburgh had been built on the invisible industries of banking and insurance who cared if a few bribes oiled the wheels what did it matter if some men got together to watch secretly filmed videos andropov had said something about poets seeing themselves as unacknowledged legislators but surely that title belonged to the men in the pinstripe suits reckon shes trying to kiss it better one of the smokers asked hawes and tibbet were now in an embrace of sorts faces pressed together good luck to them rebus thought to himself police work had wedged itself into his own marriage cracking it wide open but that didnt have to be the case he knew plenty of cops who were still married some of them even wedded to other cops they seemed to make it work shes doing a good job of it the other smoker was answering his neighbour the door was pulled open behind them and siobhan clarke appeared there you are she said here i am rebus agreed we were worried youd sloped off ill just be a minute he said showing her the remaining inch of cigarette she had wrapped her arms around herself protection against the cold dont worry she said were not having speeches or anything touve judged it just right shiv he assured her thanks she accepted the praise with a twitch of her mouth hows colin doing i think phyls resuscitating him rebus nodded in the direction of the two figures who had now more or less merged into one i hope they dont regret it in the morning she muttered whats life without a few regrets one of the smokers challenged her theyll put that on my headstone his companion stated rebus and clarke locked eyes again for a few silent moments come back into the warm she told him he gave her a slow nod stubbed out the remains of his cigarette and did as he was told it was gone midnight when his taxi pulled up outside the western general hospital he got as far as the corridor to caffertys ward before one of the nurses stopped him touve been drinking she scolded him since when did nurses start making diagnoses ill have to call security what for w j tou cant go visiting a patient in the middle of the night not in that state why not because people are sleeping im not going to start playing the drums he protested she pointed to the ceiling rebus looked too and saw that a camera was trained on them youre being monitored she warned him a guard will be here any moment christs sake the doors behind her the doors to caffertys ward swung open a man was standing there ill handle this he said who are you she asked turning to him who gave you permission to but his warrant card silenced her di stone he explained this mans known to me ill see he doesnt cause further disturbance stone nodded towards a row of chairs meant for visitors rebus decided he could do with a sit down so didnt argue when he was seated stone nodded letting the nurse know everything was under control as she headed off he sat beside rebus leaving one of the chairs empty between them he started to tuck his id back into his pocket i used to have one of those rebus told him whats in the bag stone asked my retirement that explains a lot rebus tried focusing on him such as the amount youve put away for one thing six pints three shorts and half a bottle of wine and the mans still standing stone shook his head in disbelief so what brings you here bit of unfinished business still niggling you rebus had started opening his cigarettes until he remembered where he was how do you mean he asked planning to unhook a few of caffertys plugs and tubes it wasnt me at the canal a bloodspattered overshoe says otherwise didnt know inanimate objects could talk rebus was thinking back to his chat with sonia theyve got a language all of their own rebus stone clarified and forensics to do the translating yes rebus thought his mind clearing a little and socos to pick them up in the first place socos like little sonia can i assume he said that youve been visiting the patient yourself trying to change the subject just wondering stone nodded eventually the whole surveillance is in cold storage till he wakes up means im headed back home in the morning di davidson will keep me informed of developments i wouldnt try asking him any difficult questions tomorrow rebus gave warning he was last seen dancing his way down young street ill bear that in mind stone was rising to his feet now come on ill give you a lift my flats the other end of town rebus stated ill phone for a taxi then ill wait with you till it comes not that you dont trust me di stone stone didnt bother answering rebus had taken a couple of steps towards the ward but only to peer through one of the portholestyle windows he couldnt figure out which bed was caffertys some of them had screens around them anyway what if youve pulled the plug on him rebus asked youve got yourself the perfect fallguy but stone shook his head and like the nurse before him gestured towards the security camera cctv would prove you never crossed the threshold havent you heard that old saying the camera never lies ive heard it rebus stated but i know better than to believe it having said which he picked up his bag and preceded stone back along the corridor towards the exit touve known cafferty a long time stone said nigh on twenty years tou first gave evidence against him in glasgow high court thats right bloody lawyer got me mixed up with the previous witness called me mr stroman after that caffertys nickname for me was strawman like in the wizard ofozt have i managed to tell you something that wasnt in your files you have as a matter of fact nice to know i still have the odd trick up my sleeve i get the feeling youre not going to let him go cafferty rebus watched as stone nodded or maybe youve readied ds clarke to enter the fray on your behalf stone waited for a response but rebus didnt seem to have one now youre leaving the force you reckon that leaves a gap thatll never be filled im not quite that conceited maybe the sames true of cafferty when he pegs it the vacancy wont stay open for long plenty smalltimers out there young and lean and hungry not my problem rebus said then the only thing spoiling your party is cafferty himself they had reached the main doors of the hospital rebus had his phone in his hand readying to call for a cab tou really going to wait with me he asked nothing better to do stone answered but that offer of a lift still stands this time of night taxis are bound to be thin on the ground it took rebus half a minute to decide having nodded his agreement he reached into the bag pulling out the bottle of speyside monday november epilogue there was a row of taxicabs parked outside haymarket railway station but rebus managed to squeeze his saab into a space next to them he sounded the horn and rolled down the window there were two uniformed officers standing by the stations exit doors monday morning the day crisp and bright the constables wore padded black jackets over their stab vests they paid rebus no heed whatsoever as he sounded the horn again but then a parking warden homed in having noted the double yellow line alongside the saab this drew the officers attention one of them said something to his companion and wandered over ill deal with this he told the warden before crouching down so that his head was level with the window i dont suppose i can call you di rebus any more todd goodyear said not any more rebus agreed sonia and me both enjoyed the party if not the hangovers didnt actually notice you drinking todd i mean you had a drink in your hand but it never quite made it as far as your lips you dont miss much goodyear conceded with a smile actually son i miss all sorts of things cid for one goodyear guessed not quite what i was thinking of rebus peered over goodyears shoulder towards the young mans colleague any chance i could borrow you for half an hour goodyear looked puzzled what for something i want to talk to you about im on duty i know but rebus didnt look as if hed take no for an answer goodyear straightened up went and spoke to the other officer then returned to the car removing his cap before climbing into the passenger seat do you miss it rebus asked tou mean cid it was interesting i enjoyed my little chat with sonia at the ox shes great i can see that rebus paused as he manoeuvred the car out of its space and into the traffic where are we headed have you heard about andropov rebus asked ignoring the question hes being sent home as an undesirable i got that from siobhan yesterday she was in work giving stuart janney the chance to confess the girl never switches off tells me stahov turns out to be one of the good guys hed been keeping a close eye on andropov didnt want him infecting scotland like hed done russia stahov was liaising with stone rebus paused but then you never knew di stone did you he watched goodyear shake his head he was the one who was watching cafferty okay goodyear still seemed puzzled andropov rebus went on will face corruption charges in moscow he was planning on claiming political asylum if you can credit that using all his useful contacts as referees might be true of course maybe his life is in danger back in russia rebus sniffed loudly not our problem though where are we headed goodyear asked again again rebus ignored him know what i did yesterday while siobhan was grafting went to oxgangs and watched them demolish a couple of tower blocks i could remember making a few arrests there down the years but not the exact details guess that really does mean my times past todd theres a story in the paper this morning that more english voters than scots think we should go independent rebus turned his head towards his passenger makes you think eh makes me think youve yet to sober up from saturday sorry todd im rattling on arent i been doing a lot of mulling stuff over brought me back to a couple of things i should have spotted a lot sooner what sorts of things im right in thinking youre a christian todd tfou know i am but then there are different types of christian and id say you tend towards the old testament variety eye for an eye and all that ive no idea what you mean cant say i blame you of course give me the old testament any time good and evil clear as day and night i think you should drop me back at haymarket but rebus had no intention of doing that saturday morning he said in the corridor outside the interview rooms do you remember you were back in uniform and ready to say your goodbyes i remember you told me i needed to get the saabs boot fixed rebus looked at his passenger havent got round to it yet by the way despite having time on your hands rebus started to laugh but then ceased abruptly thing i was wondering is how did you know know what about that dodgy boot of mine ive asked siobhan and she doesnt recall saying anything to you about it and im pretty sure it never cropped up when you and me had our various chats that night at the todorov murder scene goodyear explained rebus nodded slowly the very conclusion i came to you were already there at raeburn wynd when shiv and me arrived meant you saw us getting the crime kit out of the car saw me failing to shut the boot properly so what well thats what im not sure of but heres what i am sure of your grandad was put away with my help and when he died it pulled your family apart that sort of thing leaves a pain that can last for years todd your brother sol went off the rails with the help of big ger cafferty you knew the rumours about me and cafferty siobhan confirms that you were asking her about us she feels bad about that actually why she thinks maybe it was all because she told you i hated caffertys guts to your way of thinking that put me in the frame as caffertys assailant he paused oh and she also feels a bit guilty for bringing you into the team in the first place feels she was suckered into it because you managed to hide your ulterior motive where are we going goodyear had a hand on his radio it was attached to his shoulder by a clip and kept crackling with static noise see ive talked it through with her rebus was saying she says it makes sense what does that night of the party i got talking to sonia so youve said the night cafferty was attacked you said you were heading off to meet her rebus paused again she didnt seem to remember that besides which she said it was your idea to look beneath the footbridge what she found that overshoe because you told her where to look for it now hang on but heres the thing you werent even there at the scene todd way i see it she maybe called to say she was headed to a job at the canal thats when you told her to check the bridge you knew there was a bridge and you knew what shed find underneath it stop the car going to report me for abduction todd rebus gave another cold smile di john rebus and big ger cafferty your familys biggest enemies as far as you were concerned and suddenly you saw a way to get revenge on one of them while implicating the other you reckoned there was a chance my prints would be on the overshoe could have taken it from the boot any time you liked there were three of us outside the ox that night todd you me and siobhan we all knew where i was headed no one else did you hoofed it after me waited till cafferty was alone and crept up behind him siobhan tells me you were shocked to learn thered been a surveillance on cafferty if i hadnt tricked stone away from the scene hed have had you bang to rights rubbish todd goodyear spat doesnt really matter one way or the other since i cant prove a single bloody word he turned towards the young man again congratulations youre getting away with it todd must mean the big mans looking out for you i look out for myself rebus me and my family both the tone of voice had changed hardening along with the look in goodyears eyes id been thinking about cafferty for a long time then when sol got stabbed it really started to rankle thinking of how different things couldve been for my folks i knew you were close to cafferty so had to get close to you he was staring at the road ahead then you told me youd been the one in the witness box the one whod worked so hard to put my grandad away and suddenly it all seemed to connect i could take out you and cafferty both like i say an eye for an eye traffic ahead was thickening rebus eased his foot off the accelerator so you must be feeling pretty good now cleansed vindicated avenged all that sort of stuff i am pure from my sin another of your bible quotes rebus nodded to himself slowly thats all well and good but its not enough to save you not by a long chalk red light goodyear stated meaning that they had to stop at the junction ahead with the car stationary goodyear pushed open his door i was planning on visiting cafferty rebus told him thought maybe youd want to see him again doctors say hes improving goodyear was out of the car but when rebus yelled his name he leaned down into it again when cafferty comes round rebus told him the first face hes going to see is mine and guess what ill be telling him better watch your back goodyear and your front if it comes to that cafferty may be a lot of things but hes not the sort of coward wholl whack you from behind goodyear slammed the door shut just as the lights turned green rebus pushed his foot down on the accelerator watching in his rearview as goodyear fixed his cap back on to his head he was staring at the car as the distance between them grew rebus exhaled noisily and wound the window down a little hed got the garage to connect his new ipod to the stereo he pressed play and turned up the volume rory gallagher sinner boy all the way to caffertys hospital bed siobhan clarke was waiting for him there did you talk to him she asked he nodded eyes on caffertys seemingly lifeless form the regular bleeping and blinking from the machines providing slivers of reassurance the gangster had been moved from intensive care but bringing all the peripheral equipment with him i hear your team drew rebus commented to clarke two up till the seventieth sodding minute not that i was taking much of it in well you were a bit busy with stuart janney no confession yet itll come she paused how about goodyear is he going to own up todd knows better than that i still cant believe i hell with it shiv how were you supposed to know rebus seated himself on the chair next to hers if its anybodys fault its mine she stared at him want any more weight on those shoulders im serious things went wrong for todd and his family from the minute the grandad was sent down and i helped that happen that doesnt but she broke off as he turned towards her they found class a in that pub shiv but todds grandad wasnt shifting anything half that serious what are you saying rebus gazed at the wall opposite back then cafferty had cops on his payroll guys in cid whod plant whatever he told them to tou rebus shook his head thanks for the vote of confidence though but you knew it had happened he nodded slowly and did nothing about it thats the way things were back then cafferty wouldve been dealing and not liking it that he was being undercut in harry goodyears pub he puffed out his cheeks and let the air burst from them before continuing a while back you asked me about my first day in cid i lied and said i couldnt remember what really happened was i walked out of police college and into the station canteen and the first thing i was told was forget everything youve just had drilled into you this is where the game begins son and theres only two teams us and them he risked another glance towards her tfou covered for mates whod had too many whiskies with lunch or gone a bit too far on an arrest prisoners falling downstairs or stumbling into walls you covered for everybody on your team i stood in that witness box knowing damned well i was covering for a colleague whod set the old guy up she was still staring at him so why tell me what the hell am i supposed to do with this youll think of something thats so bloody typical of you john its ancient history but you couldnt just keep it to yourself you had to dump it on me hoping for absolution youre in the wrong place for that she fell silent for a moment shoulders slumped then after a deep breath nurse tells me you came straight here after the party reeking of booze so there was another detective stone rebus acknowledged he wanted to make sure i wasnt going to pull the plug on the patient theres not a shred of subtlety in your whole damned body is there are you saying im like a bull in a china shop what do you think he considered the question for all of five seconds maybe the bulls just running from the abattoir he told her readying to get to his feet clarke got up too looking bemused and watching as he leaned over the bed willing cafferty to wake up youre really going to tell him what goodyear did she asked whats the alternative the alternative is you leave it to me theyd started heading for the exit little turds not going to get away with this things have changed john no coverups no turning a blind eye that reminds me he said i paid a visit to the andersons yesterday she stared at him having fully apprised them of your non combat status their daughter was home from college she really does look a lot like nancy what are you saying i took roger anderson outside and told him i reckoned hed recognised nancy that night recognised her from the dvd i mean he liked the feeling of power it gave him knowing something she didnt thats why he kept pestering her he didnt like it when i added that maybe it also had something to do with her resemblance to his daughter he allowed himself a smile at the memory thats when i told him who the girl in the bathroom was his eyes met clarkes and he broke off abruptly knowing what she was about to say she said it anyway what dvd he made show of clearing his throat forgot i hadnt told you he was holding the door open for her but she was standing her ground tell me now she demanded it would just be more baggage shiv trust me youre better off without it tell me anyway rebus had just started to open his mouth when a highpitched alarm sounded from inside the ward no expert in medical equipment he reckoned he still knew a flatline when he heard one and coming from the equipment next to caffertys bed he stormed back in hauling himself up on to the bed straddling the prone figure started pumping both hands down on caffertys chest kiss of life he yelled at clarke every third beat staff are coming she told him we should leave it to them damned if this bastards going to give up the ghost on me now flecks of rebuss saliva hit caffertys forehead he pumped his hands again one palm on top of the other counted it out one two three one two three one two three knew people whod recovered from cpr but with a rib or two broken from the effort push hard he told himself dont you bloody well dare he hissed from between gritted teeth saw the first nurse on the scene draw back thinking the words were meant for her blood rushing through rebuss ears almost deafening him no cold cleansed death for you he was thinking one two three one two three after all weve been through cant end with a couple of whacks from todd goodyear one two three one two three there should be mess and fuss and blood one two three john one two three john siobhans voice seemed to be coming to him from some fardistant place thats enough now you can let go now the machines were making noises sweat in his eyes and the hissing in his ears couldnt tell if they were good news or not in the end it took two doctors an attendant and a nurse to drag him off the bed is he going to be all right he heard himself ask tell me hes going to be all right
