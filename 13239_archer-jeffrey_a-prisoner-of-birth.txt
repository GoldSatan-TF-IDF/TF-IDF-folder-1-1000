jeffrey archer a prisoner of birth to jonathan and marion acknowledgments i would like to thank the following for their invaluable advice and help with this book the hon michael beloff qc kevin robinson simon bainbridge rosie de courcy mari roberts and billy little lvcm hons bsc hons soc sci open dip sp amp c open prologue yes said beth she tried to look surprised but wasnt all that convincing as she had already decided that they were going to be married when they were at secondary school however she was amazed when danny fell on one knee in the middle of the crowded restaurant yes beth repeated hoping hed stand up before everyone in the room stopped eating and turned to stare at them but he didnt budge danny remained on one knee and like a conjurer produced a tiny box from nowhere he opened it to reveal a simple gold band boasting a single diamond that was far larger than beth had expectedalthough her brother had already told her that danny had spent two months wages on the ring when danny finally got off his knee he took her by surprise again he immediately began to tap a number on his mobile beth knew only too well who would be on the other end of the line she said yes danny announced triumphantly beth smiled as she held the diamond under the light and took a closer look why dont you join us danny added before she could stop him great lets meet at that wine bar off the fulham road the one we went to after the chelsea game last year see you there mate beth didnt protest after all bernie was not only her brother but dannys oldest friend and hed probably already asked him to be his best man danny turned off his phone and asked a passing waiter for the bill the maître d bustled across its on the house he said giving them a warm smile it was to be a night of surprises when beth and danny strolled into the dunlop arms they found bernie seated at a corner table with a bottle of champagne and three glasses by his side fantastic news he said even before they had sat down thanks mate said danny shaking hands with his friend ive already phoned mum and dad said bernie as he popped the cork and filled the three champagne glasses they didnt seem all that surprised but then it was the worstkept secret in bow dont tell me theyll be joining us as well said beth not a chance said bernie raising his glass youve only got me this time to long life and west ham winning the cup well at least one of those is possible said danny i think youd marry west ham if you could said beth smiling at her brother could do worse said bernie danny laughed ill be married to both for the rest of my life except on saturday afternoons bernie reminded him and you might even have to sacrifice a few of those once you take over from dad said beth danny frowned he had been to see beths father during his lunch break and had asked for permission to marry his daughtersome traditions die hard in the east end mr wilson couldnt have been more enthusiastic about danny becoming his soninlaw but went on to tell him that he had changed his mind about something danny thought theyd already agreed on and if you think im gonna call you guv when you take over from my old man said bernie breaking into his thoughts you can forget it danny didnt comment is that who i think it is said beth danny took a closer look at the four men standing by the bar it certainly looks like im looks like who asked bernie that actor what plays dr beresford in the prescription lawrence davenport whispered beth i could always go and ask for his autograph said bernie certainly not said beth although mum never misses an episode i think you fancy him said bernie as he topped up their glasses no i dont said beth a little too loudly causing one of the men at the bar to turn around and in any case she added smiling at her fiancé dannys far better looking than lawrence davenport dream on said bernie just because danny boys shaved and washed his hair for a change dont think hes gonna make a habit of it sis no chance just remember that your future usband works in the east end not the city danny could be anything he wanted to be said beth taking his hand whatve you got in mind sis tycoon or tosser said bernie thumping danny on the arm dannys got plans for the garage that will make you shh said danny as he refilled his friends glass hed better have cause gettin spliced dont come cheap said bernie to start with where you goin to live theres a basement flat just round the corner thats up for sale said danny but have you got enough readies demanded bernie cause basement flats dont come cheap even in the east end weve saved enough between us to put down a deposit said beth and when danny takes over from dad lets drink to that said bernie only to find that the bottle was empty id better order another no said beth firmly ive got to be on time for work tomorrow morning even if you havent to hell with that said bernie its not every day that my little sister gets engaged to my best mate another bottle he shouted the barman smiled as he removed a second bottle of champagne from the fridge below the counter one of the men standing at the bar checked the label pol roger he said before adding in a voice that carried wasted on them bernie jumped up from his place but danny immediately pulled him back down ignore them he said theyre not worth the space the barman walked quickly across to their table dont lets be havin any trouble lads he said as he removed the cork one of thems celebratin his birthday and frankly theyve had a bit too much to drink beth took a closer look at the four men while the barman refilled their glasses one of them was staring at her he winked opened his mouth and ran his tongue around his lips beth quickly turned back relieved to find that danny and her brother hadnt noticed so where you two goin on honeymoon saint tropez said danny thatll set you back a bob or two and youre not coming along this time said beth the sluts quite presentable until she opens her mouth said a voice from the bar bernie leaped to his feet again to find two of them staring defiantly at him theyre drunk said beth just ignore them oh i dont know said the other man there are times when i quite like a sluts mouth to be open bernie grabbed the empty bottle and it took all of dannys strength to hold him down i want to leave said beth firmly i dont need a bunch of publicschool snobs ruining my engagement party danny immediately jumped up but bernie just sat there drinking his champagne come on bernie lets get out of here before we do somethin we regret said danny bernie reluctantly stood up and followed his friend but he never once took his eyes off the four men at the bar beth was pleased to see that they had turned their backs on them and appeared to be deep in conversation but the moment danny opened the back door one of them swung around leaving are we he said he took out his wallet and added when youve finished with her my friends and i have just enough left over for a gang bang youre full of shit said bernie then why dont we go outside and sort it out be my guest dickhead said bernie as danny shoved him through the door and out into the alley before he had the chance to say anything else beth slammed the door behind them and began walking down the alley danny gripped bernie by the elbow but they had only gone a couple of paces before he shook him off lets go back and sort them not tonight said danny not letting go of bernies arm as he continued to lead his friend on down the alley when beth reached the main road she saw the man bernie described as dickhead standing there one hand behind his back he leered at her and began licking his lips again just as his friend came rushing around the corner slightly out of breath beth turned to see her brother legs apart standing his ground he was smiling lets go back inside beth shouted at danny only to see that the other two men from the bar were now standing by the door blocking the path fuck em said bernie its time to teach the bastards a lesson no no pleaded beth as one of the men came charging up the alley toward them you take dickhead said bernie and ill deal with the other three beth looked on in horror as dickhead threw a punch that caught danny on the side of the chin and sent him reeling back he recovered in time to block the next punch feint and then land one that took dickhead by surprise he fell on one knee but was quickly back on his feet before taking another swing at danny as the other two men standing by the back door didnt seem to want to join in beth assumed the fight would be over fairly quickly she could only watch as her brother landed an uppercut on the other man the force of which almost knocked him out as bernie waited for him to get back on his feet he shouted to beth do us a favor sis grab a cab this aint gonna last much longer and then we need to be out of ere beth turned her attention to danny to make such he was getting the better of dickhead dickhead was lying spreadeagled on the ground with danny on top of him clearly in control she gave them both one last look before reluctantly obeying her brother beth ran off down the alley and once she reached the main road began searching for a taxi she only had to wait a couple of minutes before she spotted a familiar yellow for hire sign beth flagged down the cabbie as the man bernie had felled staggered past her and disappeared into the night where to luv asked the cabbie bacon road bow said beth and two of my friends will be along in a moment she added as she opened the back door the cabbie glanced over her shoulder and down the alley i dont think its a taxi theyll be needing luv he said if they were my friends id be phoning for an ambulance book one the trial chapter one not guilty danny cartwright could feel his legs trembling as they sometimes did before the first round of a boxing match he knew he was going to lose the associate recorded the plea on the indictment and looking up at danny said you can sit down danny collapsed onto the little chair in the center of the dock relieved that the first round was over he looked up at the referee who was seated on the far side of the courtroom in a highbacked green leather chair that had the appearance of a throne in front of him was a long oak bench littered with case papers in ring binders and a notebook opened at a blank page mr justice sackville looked across at danny his expression revealing neither approval nor disapproval he removed a pair of halfmoon spectacles from the end of his nose and said in an authoritative voice bring in the jury while they all waited for the twelve men and women to appear danny tried to take in the unfamiliar sights and sounds of court number four at the old bailey he looked across at the two men who were seated at either end of what hed been told was counsels bench his young advocate alex redmayne looked up and gave him a friendly smile but the older man at the other end of the bench whom mr redmayne always referred to as prosecution counsel never once glanced in his direction danny transferred his gaze up into the public gallery his parents were seated in the front row his fathers burly tattooed arms were resting on the balcony railing while his mothers head remained bowed she raised her eyes occasionally to glance down at her only son it had taken several months for the case of the crown versus daniel arthur cartwright finally to reach the old bailey it seemed to danny that once the law became involved everything happened in slow motion and then suddenly without warning the door in the far corner of the courtroom opened and the usher reappeared he was followed by seven men and five women who had been selected to decide his fate they filed into the jury box and sat in their unallocated placessix in the front row six behind them strangers with nothing more in common than the lottery of selection once they had settled the associate rose from his place to address them members of the jury he began the defendant daniel arthur cartwright stands before you charged on one count of murder to that count he has pleaded not guilty your charge therefore is to listen to the evidence and decide whether he be guilty or no chapter two mr justice sackville glanced down at the bench below him mr pearson you may open the case for the crown a short rotund man rose slowly from the counsels bench mr arnold pearson qc opened the thick file that rested on a lectern in front of him he touched his wellworn wig almost as if he were checking to make sure hed remembered to put it on then tugged on the lapels of his gown a routine that hadnt changed for the past thirty years if it please your lordship he began in a slow ponderous manner i appear for the crown in this case while my learned friendhe glanced to check the name on the sheet of paper in front of himmr alex redmayne appears for the defense the case before your lordship is one of murder the coldblooded and calculated murder of mr bernard henry wilson in the public gallery the parents of the victim sat in the far corner of the back row mr wilson looked down at danny unable to mask the disappointment in his eyes mrs wilson stared blankly in front of her whitefaced not unlike a mourner attending a funeral although the tragic events surrounding the death of bernie wilson had irrevocably changed the lives of two east end families who had been close friends for several generations it had hardly caused a ripple beyond a dozen streets surrounding bacon road in bow during the course of this trial you will learn how the defendant continued pearson waving a hand in the direction of the dock without bothering even to glance at danny lured mr wilson to a public house in chelsea on the night of saturday september eighteenth where he carried out this brutal and premeditated murder he had earlier taken mr wilsons sisteronce again he checked the file in front of him elizabeth to lucios restaurant in fulham road the court will learn that cartwright made a proposal of marriage to miss wilson after she had revealed that she was pregnant he then called her brother mr bernard wilson on his mobile phone and invited him to join them at the dunlop arms a public house at the back of hambledon terrace chelsea so that they could all celebrate miss wilson has already made a written statement that she had never visited this public house before although cartwright clearly knew it well which the crown will suggest was because he had selected it for one purpose and one purpose only its back door opens on to a quiet alleyway an ideal location for someone with murderous intent a murder that cartwright would later blame on a complete stranger who just happened to be a customer at the dunlop arms that night danny stared down at mr pearson how could he possibly know what had happened that night when he wasnt even there but danny wasnt too worried after all mr redmayne had assured him that his side of the story would be presented during the trial and he mustnt be too anxious if everything appeared bleak while the crown was presenting its case despite his barristers repeated assurances two things did worry danny alex redmayne wasnt much order than he was and had also warned him that this was only his second case as leader but unfortunately for cartwright continued pearson the other four customers who were in the dunlop arms that night tell a different story a story which has not only proved consistent but which has also been corroborated by the barman on duty at the time the crown will present all five as witnesses and they will tell you that they overheard a dispute between the two men who were later seen to leave by the rear entrance of the bar after cartwright had said then why dont we go outside and sort it out all five of them saw cartwright leave by the back door followed by bernard wilson and his sister elizabeth who was clearly in an agitated state moments later a scream was heard mr spencer craig one of the customers left his companions and ran out into the alley where he found cartwright holding mr wilson by the throat while repeatedly thrusting a knife into his chest mr craig immediately dialed on his mobile phone the time of that call mlord and the conversation that took place were logged and recorded at belgravia police station a few minutes later two police officers arrived on the scene and found cartwright kneeling over mr wilsons body with the knife in his handa knife that he must have picked up from the bar because dunlop arms is engraved on the handle alex redmayne wrote down pearsons words members of the jury continued pearson once again tugging at his lapels every murderer has to have a motive and in this case we need look no further than the first recorded slaying of abel by cain to establish that motive envy greed and ambition were the sordid ingredients that when combined provoked cartwright to remove the one rival who stood in his path members of the jury both cartwright and mr wilson worked at wilson s garage in mile end road the garage is owned and managed by mr george wilson the deceaseds father who had planned to retire at the end of the year when he intended to hand over the business to his only son bernard mr george wilson has made a written statement to this effect which has been agreed by the defense so we shall not be calling him as a witness members of the jury you will discover during this trial that the two young men had a long history of rivalry and antagonism which stretched back to their schooldays but with bernard wilson out of the way cartwright planned to marry the bosss daughter and take over the thriving business himself however everything did not go as cartwright planned and when he was arrested he tried to place the blame on an innocent bystander the same man who had run out into the alley to see what had caused miss wilson to scream but unfortunately for cartwright it was not part of his plan that there would be four other people who were present throughout the entire episode pearson smiled at the jury members of the jury once you have heard their testimony you will be left in no doubt that daniel cartwright is guilty of the heinous crime of murder he turned to the judge that concludes the prosecution opening for the crown mlord he tugged his lapels once more before adding with your permission i shall call my first witness mr justice sackville nodded and pearson said in a firm voice i call mr spencer craig danny cartwright looked to his right and watched as an usher at the back of the courtroom opened a door stepped out into the corridor and bellowed mr spencer craig a moment later a tall man not much older than danny dressed in a blue pinstriped suit white shirt and mauve tie entered the courtroom how different he looked from when theyd first met danny hadnt seen spencer craig during the past six months but not a day had passed when he hadnt visualized him clearly he stared at the man defiantly but craig didnt even glance in dannys directionit was as if he didnt exist craig walked across the courtroom like a man who knew exactly where he was going when he stepped into the witness box he immediately picked up the bible and delivered the oath without once looking at the card the usher held up in front of him mr pearson smiled at his principal witness before glancing down at the questions he had spent the past month preparing is your name spencer craig yes sir he replied and do you reside at fortythree hambledon terrace london sw i do sir and what is your profession asked mr pearson as if he didnt know i am a barrister at law and your chosen field criminal justice so you are well acquainted with the crime of murder unfortunately i am sir i should now like to take you back to the evening of september eighteenth last year when you and a group of friends were enjoying a drink at the dunlop arms in hambledon terrace perhaps you could take us through exactly what happened that night my friends and i were celebrating geralds thirtieth birthday gerald interrupted pearson gerald payne said craig hes an old friend from my days at cambridge we were spending a convivial evening together enjoying a bottle of wine alex redmayne made a notehe needed to know how many bottles danny wanted to ask what the word convivial meant but sadly it didnt end up being a convivial evening prompted pearson far from it replied craig still not even glancing in dannys direction please tell the court what happened next said pearson looking down at his notes craig turned to face the jury for the first time we were as i said enjoying a glass of wine in celebration of geralds birthday when i became aware of raised voices i turned and saw a man who was seated at a table in the far corner of the room with a young lady do you see that man in the courtroom now asked pearson yes replied craig pointing in the direction of the dock what happened next he immediately jumped up continued craig and began shouting and jabbing his finger at another man who remained seated i heard one of them say if you think im gonna call you guv when you take over from my old man you can forget it the young lady was trying to calm him down i was about to turn back to my friendsafter all the quarrel was nothing to do with mewhen the defendant shouted then why dont we go outside and sort it out i assumed they were joking but then the man who had spoken the words grabbed a knife from the end of the bar let me stop you there mr craig you saw the defendant pick up a knife from the bar asked pearson yes i did and then what happened he marched off in the direction of the back door which surprised me why did it surprise you because the dunlop arms is my local and i had never seen the man before im not sure im following you mr craig said pearson who was following his every word the rear exit is out of sight if youre sitting in that corner of the room but he seemed to know exactly where he was going ah i understand said pearson please continue a moment later the other man got up and chased after the defendant with the young lady following close behind i wouldnt have given the matter another thought but moments later we all heard a scream a scream repeated pearson what kind of scream a highpitched womans scream replied craig and what did you do i immediately left my friends and ran into the alley in case the woman was in any danger and was she no sir she was screaming at the defendant begging him to stop stop what asked pearson attacking the other man they were fighting yes sir the man id earlier seen jabbing a finger and shouting now had the other chap pinned up against the wall with his forearm pressed against his throat craig turned to the jury and raised his left arm to demonstrate the position and was mr wilson trying to defend himself asked pearson as best he could but the defendant was thrusting a knife into the mans chest again and again what did you do next asked pearson quietly i phoned the emergency services and they assured me that they would send police and an ambulance immediately did they say anything else asked pearson looking down at his notes yes replied craig they told me under no circumstances to approach the man with the knife but to return to the bar and wait until the police arrived he paused i carried out those instructions to the letter how did your friends react when you went back into the bar and told them what you had seen they wanted to go outside and see if they could help but i told them what the police had advised and that i also thought it might be wise in the circumstances for them to go home in the circumstances i was the only person who had witnessed the whole incident and i didnt want them to be in any danger should the man with the knife return to the bar very commendable said pearson the judge frowned at the prosecuting counsel alex redmayne continued to take notes how long did you have to wait before the police arrived it was only a matter of moments before i heard a siren and a few minutes later a plainclothes detective entered the bar through the back door he produced his badge and introduced himself as detective sergeant fuller he informed me that the victim was on his way to the nearest hospital what happened next i made a full statement and then ds fuller told me i could go home and did you yes i returned to my house which is only about a hundred yards from the dunlop arms and went to bed but i couldnt sleep alex redmayne wrote down the words about a hundred yards understandably said pearson the judge frowned a second time so i got up went to my study and wrote down everything that had taken place earlier that evening why did you do that mr craig when you had already given a statement to the police my experience of standing where you are mr pearson has made me aware that evidence presented in the witness box is often patchy even inaccurate by the time a trial takes place several months after a crime has been committed quite so said pearson turning another page of his file when did you learn that daniel cartwright had been charged with the murder of bernard wilson i read the details in the evening standard the following monday it reported that mr wilson had died on his way to chelsea and westminster hospital and that cartwright had been charged with his murder and did you regard that as the end of the matter as far as your personal involvement was concerned yes although i knew that i would be called as a witness in any forthcoming trial should cartwright decide to plead not guilty but then there was a twist that even you with all your experience of hardened criminals could not have anticipated there certainly was responded craig two police officers visited my chambers the following afternoon to conduct a second interview but you had already given verbal and written statements to ds fuller said pearson why did they need to interview you again because cartwright was now accusing me of killing mr wilson and was even claiming that i had picked up the knife from the bar had you ever come across mr cartwright or mr wilson before that night no sir replied craig truthfully thank you mr craig the two men smiled at each other before pearson turned to the judge and said no more questions mlord chapter three mr justice sackville turned his attention to the counsel at the other end of the bench he was well acquainted with alex redmaynes distinguished father who had recently retired as a high court judge but his son had never appeared before him mr redmayne intoned the judge do you wish to crossexamine this witness i most certainly do replied redmayne as he gathered up his notes danny recalled that not long after hed been arrested an officer had advised him to get himself a lawyer it had not proved easy he quickly discovered that lawyers like garage mechanics charge by the hour and you only get what you can afford he could afford ten thousand pounds a sum of money he had saved over the past decade intending to use it as the deposit on a basement flat in bow where beth he and the baby would live once they were married every penny of it had been swallowed up long before the case had come to court the solicitor he selected a mr makepeace had demanded five thousand pounds up front even before he took the top off his fountain pen and then another five once hed briefed alex redmayne the barrister who would represent him in court danny couldnt understand why he needed two lawyers to do the same job when he repaired a car he didnt ask bernie to lift the bonnet before he could take a look at the engine and he certainly wouldnt have demanded a deposit before he picked up his toolkit but danny liked alex redmayne from the day he met him and not just because he supported west ham he had a posh accent and had been to oxford university but he never once spoke down to him once mr makepeace had read the charge sheet and listened to what danny had to say he had advised his client to plead guilty to manslaughter he was confident that he could strike a deal with the crown which would allow danny to get away with a sentence of six years danny turned the offer down alex redmayne asked danny and his fiancée to go over what had taken place that night again and again as he searched for any inconsistencies in his clients story he found none and when the money ran out he still agreed to conduct his defense mr craig began alex redmayne not tugging his lapels or touching his wig i am sure it is unnecessary for me to remind you that you are still under oath and of the added responsibility that carries for a barrister tread carefully mr redmayne interjected the judge remember that it is your client who is on trial not the witness we shall see if you still feel that way mlord when the time comes for your summing up mr redmayne said the judge sharply it is not your responsibility to remind me of my role in this courtroom your job is to question the witnesses mine to deal with any points of law that arise and then let us both leave the jury to decide on the verdict if your lordship pleases said redmayne turning back to face the witness mr craig what time did you and your friends arrive at the dunlop arms that evening i dont recall the exact time craig replied then let me try and jog your memory was it seven seventhirty eight oclock nearer eight i suspect so you had already been drinking for some three hours by the time my client his fiancée and his closest friend walked into the bar as i have already told the court i did not see them arrive quite so said redmayne mimicking pearson and how much drink had you consumed by lets say eleven oclock ive no idea it was geralds thirtieth birthday so no one was counting well as we have established that you had been drinking for over three hours shall we settle on half a dozen bottles of wine or perhaps it was seven even eight five at the most retorted craig which is hardly extravagant for four people i would normally agree with you mr craig had not one of your companions said in his written statement that he drank only diet coke while another just had one or two glasses of wine because he was driving but i didnt have to drive said craig the dunlop arms is my local and i live only a hundred yards away only a hundred yards away repeated redmayne when craig didnt respond he continued you told the court that you were not aware of any other customers being in the bar until you heard raised voices that is correct when you claim you heard the defendant say then why dont we go outside and sort it out that is also correct but isnt it the truth mr craig that it was you who started this whole quarrel when you delivered another unforgettable remark to my client as he was leavinghe glanced down at his notes when youve finished with her my friends and i have just enough left over for a gang bang redmayne waited for craig to reply but again he remained silent can i assume from your failure to respond that i am correct you can assume nothing of the sort mr redmayne i simply didnt consider your question worthy of a response replied craig with disdain i do hope that you feel mr craig that my next question is worthy of a response because i would suggest that when mr wilson told you that you were full of shit it was you who said then why dont we go outside and sort it out i think that sounds more like the kind of language one would expect from your client responded craig or from a man who had had a little too much to drink and was showing off to his drunken friends in front of a beautiful women i must remind you once again mr redmayne interjected the judge that it is your client who is on trial in this case not mr craig redmayne gave a slight bow but when he raised his eyes he noticed that the jury was hanging on his every word i suggest mr craig he continued that you left by the front door and ran around to the back because you wanted a fight i only went into the alley after id heard the scream was that when you picked up a knife from the end of the bar i did no such thing said craig sharply your client grabbed the knife when he was on his way out as i made clear in my statement is that the statement you so carefully crafted when you couldnt get to sleep later that night asked redmayne again craig didnt respond perhaps this is another example of something thats unworthy of your consideration redmayne suggested did any of your friends follow you out into the alley no they did not so they didnt witness the fight you had with mr cartwright how could they when i did not have a fight with mr cartwright did you get a boxing blue when you were at cambridge mr craig craig hesitated yes i did and while at cambridge were you rusticated for is this relevant demanded mr justice sackville i am happy to leave that decision to the jury mlord said redmayne turning back to craig he continued were you rusticated from cambridge after being involved in a drunken brawl with some locals whom you later described to the magistrates as a bunch of yobs that was years ago when i was still an undergraduate and were you years later on the night of september eighteenth picking another quarrel with another bunch of yobs when you resorted to using the knife youd picked up from the bar as ive already told you it wasnt me who picked up the knife but i did witness your client stabbing mr wilson in the chest and then you returned to the bar yes i did when i immediately called the emergency services let us try to be a little more accurate shall we mr craig you didnt actually call the emergency services in fact you phoned a detective sergeant fuller on his mobile thats correct redmayne but you seem to forget that i was reporting a crime and was well aware that fuller would alert the emergency services indeed if you recall the ambulance arrived before the detective sergeant some minutes before emphasized redmayne however im curious to know how you were so conveniently in possession of a junior police officers mobile phone number we had both been recently involved in a major drugs trial that required several lengthy consultations sometimes at very short notice so ds fuller is a friend of yours i hardly know the man said craig our relationship is strictly professional i suggest mr craig that you knew him well enough to phone and make sure that he heard your side of the story first fortunately there are four other witnesses to verify my side of the story and i look forward to crossexamining each one of your close friends mr craig as im curious to discover why after you had returned to the bar you advised them to go home they had not witnessed your client stabbing mr wilson and so were not involved in any way said craig and i also considered they might be in some danger if they stayed but if anyone was in danger mr craig it would have been the only witness to the murder of mr wilson so why didnt you leave with your friends craig once again remained silent and this time not because he considered the question unworthy of a reply perhaps the real reason you told them to leave said redmayne was because you needed them out of the way so that you could run home and change out of your bloodcovered clothes before the police turned up after all you only live as you have admitted a hundred yards away you seem to have forgotten mr redmayne that detective sergeant fuller arrived only a few minutes after the crime had been committed responded craig scornfully it was seven minutes after you phoned the detective sergeant that he arrived on the scene and he then spent some considerable time questioning my client before he entered the bar do you imagine that i could afford to take such a risk when i knew the police could be turning up at any moment craig spat out yes i do replied redmayne if the alternative was to spend the rest of your life in prison a noisy buzz erupted around the court the jurors eyes were now fixed on spencer craig but once again he didnt respond to redmaynes words redmayne waited for some time before adding mr craig i repeat that i am looking forward to crossexamining your friends one by one turning to the judge he said no more questions mlord mr pearson said the judge you will no doubt wish to reexamine this witness yes mlord said pearson there is one question im keen to have answered he smiled at the witness mr craig are you superman craig looked puzzled but aware that pearson would be trying to assist him replied no sir why do you ask because only superman having witnessed a murder could have returned to the bar briefed his friends flown home taken a shower changed his clothes flown back to the pub and been casually sitting at the bar by the time ds fuller appeared a few members of the jury tried to suppress smiles or perhaps there was a convenient telephone box near at hand the smiles turned to laughter pearson waited for them to die down before he added allow me mr craig to dispense with mr redmaynes fantasy world and ask you one serious question it was pearsons turn to wait until every eye was concentrated on him when scotland yards forensic experts examined the murder weapon was it your fingerprints they identified on the handle of the knife or those of the defendant they certainly werent mine said craig otherwise it would be me who was seated in the dock no more questions mlord said pearson chapter four the cell door opened and an officer handed danny a plastic tray with several little compartments full of plastic food which he picked at while he waited for the afternoon session to begin alex redmayne skipped lunch so he could read through his notes had he underestimated the amount of time craig would have had before ds fuller had walked into the bar mr justice sackville took lunch along with a dozen other judges who didnt remove their wigs or discuss each others cases as they munched through a meal of meat and two veg mr pearson ate lunch on his own in the bar mess on the top floor he considered that his learned friend had made a bad mistake when questioning craig about the timing but it wasnt his duty to point that out he pushed a pea from one side of the plate to the other while he considered the ramifications once two oclock struck the ritual began again mr justice sackville entered the courtroom and gave the jury the flicker of a smile before taking his place he looked down at both counsel and said good afternoon gentlemen mr pearson you may call your next witness thank you mlord said pearson as he rose from his seat i call mr gerald payne danny watched a man enter the courtroom whom he didnt immediately recognize he must have been around five feet nine inches tall prematurely balding and his wellcut beige suit was unable to disguise the fact that hed lost a stone since danny had last seen him the usher guided him toward the witness box handed him a copy of the bible and held up the oath although payne read from the card he displayed the same selfconfidence as spencer craig had shown that morning you are gerald david payne and you reside at sixtytwo wellington mews london w that is correct replied payne in a firm voice and what is your profession i am a land management consultant redmayne wrote down the words estate agent next to paynes name and which firm do you work for inquired pearson i am a partner with baker tremlett and smythe you are very young to be a partner of such a distinguished firm suggested pearson innocently i am the youngest partner in the firms history replied payne delivering a wellrehearsed line it was obvious to redmayne that someone had been tutoring payne long before he entered the witness box he knew that for ethical reasons it couldnt have been pearson so there was only one other possible candidate my congratulations said pearson get on with it mr pearson said the judge i do apologize mlord i was simply trying to establish the credibility of this witness for the jury then you have succeeded said mr justice sackville sharply now get on with it pearson patiently took payne through the events of the night in question yes he confirmed craig mortimer and davenport had all been present at the dunlop arms that evening no he had not ventured out into the alley when he heard the scream yes they had gone home when advised to do so by spencer craig no he had never seen the defendant before in his life thank you mr payne concluded pearson please remain there redmayne rose slowly from his place and took his time rearranging some papers before he asked his first questiona trick his father had taught him when they had conducted mock trials if youre going to open with a surprise question my boy his father used to say keep the witness guessing he waited until the judge the jury and pearson were all staring at him only a few seconds but he knew it would seem a lifetime to anyone standing in the box mr payne said redmayne finally looking up at the witness when you were an undergraduate at cambridge were you a member of a society known as the musketeers yes replied payne looking puzzled and was that societys motto all for one and one for all pearson was up on his feet even before payne had a chance to reply my lord i am puzzled to know how the past membership of a university society can have any bearing on the events of september eighteenth last year i am inclined to agree with you mr pearson replied the judge but no doubt mr redmayne is about to enlighten us i am indeed mlord redmayne replied his eyes never leaving payne was the musketeers motto all for one and one for all redmayne repeated yes it was replied payne with a slight edge to his voice what else did the members of that society have in common asked redmayne an appreciation of dumas justice and a bottle of fine wine or perhaps several bottles of fine wine suggested redmayne as he extracted a small light blue booklet from the pile of papers in front of him he began to turn its pages slowly and was one of the societys rules that if any member found himself in danger it was the duty of all other members to come to his assistance yes replied payne i have always considered loyalty to be the benchmark by which you can judge any man do you indeed said redmayne was mr spencer craig by any chance also a member of the musketeers he was replied payne in fact hes a past chairman and did you and your fellow members come to his assistance on the night of september eighteenth last year my lord said pearson leaping to his feet once again this is outrageous what is outrageous mlord retorted redmayne is that whenever one of mr pearsons witnesses looks as if he might be in some trouble he leaps to their assistance perhaps he is also a member of the musketeers several of the jurors smiled mr redmayne said the judge quietly are you suggesting that the witness is committing perjury just because he was a member of a society while he was at university if the alternative was life imprisonment for his closest friend mlord then yes i do think it might have crossed his mind this is outrageous repeated pearson still on his feet not as outrageous as sending a man to jail for the rest of his life said redmayne for a murder he did not commit no doubt mlord said pearson we are about to discover that the barman was also a member of the musketeers no we are not responded redmayne but we will contend that the barman was the only person in the dunlop arms that night who did not go out into the alley i think you have made your point said the judge perhaps its time to move on to your next question no more questions mlord said redmayne do you wish to reexamine this witness mr pearson i do mlord said pearson mr payne can you confirm so that the jury are left in no doubt that you did not follow mr craig out into the alley after you had heard a woman scream yes i can said payne i was in no condition to do so quite so no more questions mlord you are free to leave the court mr payne said the judge alex redmayne couldnt help noticing that payne didnt look quite as selfassured as he walked out of the courtroom as he had done when hed swaggered in do you wish to call your next witness mr pearson asked the judge i had intended to call mr davenport mlord but you might feel it would be wise to begin his crossexamination tomorrow morning the judge didnt notice that most of the women in the courtroom seemed to be willing him to call lawrence davenport without further delay he looked at his watch hesitated then said perhaps it would be better if we were to call mr davenport first thing tomorrow morning as your lordship pleases said pearson delighted with the effect the prospect of his next witnesss appearance had already had on the five women on the jury he only hoped that young redmayne would be foolish enough to attack davenport in the same way he had gerald payne chapter five the following morning a buzz of expectation swept around the courtroom even before lawrence davenport made his entrance when the usher called out his name he did so in a hushed voice lawrence davenport entered the court stage right and followed the usher to the witness box he was about six foot but so slim he appeared taller he wore a tailored navy blue suit and a cream shirt that looked as if it had been unwrapped that morning he had spent a considerable time debating whether he should wear a tie and in the end had accepted spencers advice that it gave the wrong impression if you looked too casual in court let them go on thinking youre a doctor not an actor spencer had said davenport had selected a striped tie that he would never have considered wearing unless he was in front of a camera but it was not his outer garments that caused women to turn their heads it was the piercing blue eyes thick wavy fair hair and helpless look that made so many of them want to mother him well the older ones the younger ones had other fantasies lawrence davenport had built his reputation playing a heart surgeon in the prescription for an hour every saturday evening he seduced an audience of over nine million his fans didnt seem to care that he spent more time flirting with the nurses than performing coronary artery bypass grafts after davenport had stepped into the witness box the usher handed him a bible and held up a cue card so that he could deliver his opening lines as davenport recited the oath he turned court number four into his private theater alex redmayne couldnt help noticing that all five women on the jury were smiling at the witness davenport returned their smiles as if he were taking a curtain call mr pearson rose slowly from his place he intended to keep davenport in the witness box for as long as he could while he milked his audience of twelve alex redmayne sat back as he waited for the curtain to rise and recalled another piece of advice his father had given him danny felt more isolated in the dock than ever as he stared across at the man he recalled so clearly seeing in the bar that night you are lawrence andrew davenport said pearson beaming at the witness i am sir pearson turned to the judge i wonder mlord if you would allow me to avoid having to ask mr davenport to reveal his home address he paused for obvious reasons i have no problem with that replied mr justice sackville but i will require the witness to confirm that he has resided at the same address for the past five years that is the case my lord said davenport turning his attention to the director and giving a slight bow can you also confirm said pearson that you were at the dunlop arms on the evening of september eighteenth yes i was replied davenport i joined a few friends to celebrate gerald paynes thirtieth birthday we were all up at cambridge together he added in a languid drawl that he had last resorted to when playing heathcliff on tour and did you see the defendant that night asked pearson pointing toward the dock sitting on the other side of the room no sir i was unaware of him at that time said davenport addressing the jury as if they were a matinee audience later that night did your friend spencer craig jump up and run out of the back door of the public house yes he did and that was following a girls scream that is correct sir pearson hesitated half expecting redmayne to leap up and protest at such an obvious leading question but he remained unmoved emboldened pearson continued and mr craig returned to the bar a few moments later he did replied davenport and he advised you and your other two companions to go home said pearson continuing to lead the witnessbut still alex redmayne didnt move a muscle thats right said davenport did mr craig explain why he felt you should leave the premises yes he told us that there were two men fighting in the alley and that one of them had a knife what was your reaction when mr craig told you this davenport hesitated not quite sure how he should reply to this question as it wasnt part of his prepared text perhaps you felt you should go and see if the young lady was in any danger prompted pearson helpfully from the wings yes yes responded davenport who was beginning to feel that he wasnt coming over quite so well without an autocue to assist him but despite that you followed mr craigs advice said pearson and left the premises yes yes thats right said davenport i followed spencers advice but then he ishe paused for effectlearned in the law i believe that is the correct expression wordperfect thought alex aware that davenport was now safely back on his crib sheet you never went into the alley yourself no sir not after spencer had advised that we should not under any circumstances approach the man with the knife alex remained in his place quite so said pearson as he turned the next page of his file and stared at a blank sheet of paper he had come to the end of his questions far sooner than hed anticipated he couldnt understand why his opponent hadnt attempted to interrupt him while he so blatantly led this witness he reluctantly snapped the file closed please remain in the witness box mr davenport he said as im sure my learned friend will wish to crossexamine you alex redmayne didnt even glance in lawrence davenports direction as the actor ran a hand through his long fair hair and continued to smile at the jury do you wish to crossexamine this witness mr redmayne the judge asked sounding as if he was looking forward to the encounter no thank you mlord replied redmayne barely shifting in his place few of those present in the court were able to hide their disappointment alex remained unmoved recalling his fathers advice never to crossexamine a witness the jury likes especially when they want to believe everything they have to say get them out of the witness box as quickly as possible in the hope that by the time the jury came to consider the verdict the memory of their performanceand indeed it had been a performancemight have faded you may leave the witness box mr davenport said mr justice sackville somewhat reluctantly davenport stepped down he took his time trying to make the best of his short exit across the courtroom and out into the wings once he was in the crowded corridor he headed straight for the staircase that led to the ground floor at a pace that wouldnt allow any startled fan time to work out that it really was dr beresford and ask for an autograph davenport was happy to be out of that building he had not enjoyed the experience and was grateful that it was over far more quickly than he had anticipated more like an audition than a performance he hadnt relaxed for a moment and wondered if it had been obvious that he hadnt slept the previous night as davenport jogged down the steps and on to the road he checked his watch he was going to be early for his twelve oclock appointment with spencer craig he turned right and began to walk in the direction of inner temple confident that spencer would be pleased to learn that redmayne hadnt bothered to crossexamine him he had feared that the young barrister might have pressed him on the subject of his sexual preferences which had he told the truth would have been the only headline in tomorrows tabloidsunless of course hed told the whole truth chapter six toby mortimer did not acknowledge lawrence davenport as he strode past him spencer craig had warned them that they should not be seen in public together until the trial was over he had phoned all three of them the moment he got home that night to tell them that ds fuller would be in touch the following day to clear up a few points what had begun as a birthday celebration for gerald had ended as a nightmare for all four of them mortimer bowed his head as davenport passed by he had been dreading his spell in the witness box for weeks despite spencers constant reassurance that even if redmayne found out about his drug problem he would never refer to it the musketeers had remained loyal but none of them pretended that their relationship could ever be the same again and what had taken place that night had only made mortimers craving even stronger before the birthday celebration he was known among dealers as a weekend junkie but as the trial drew nearer he had come to need two fixes a dayevery day dont even think about shooting up before you go into the witness box spencer had warned him but how could spencer begin to understand what he was going through when he had never experienced the craving a few hours of sheer bliss until the high began to wear off followed by the sweating then the shakes and finally the ritual of preparation so he could once again depart from this worldinserting the needle into an unused vein the plunge as the liquid found its way into the bloodstream quickly making contact with the brain then finally blessed releaseuntil the cycle began again mortimer was already sweating how long before the shakes would begin as long as he was called next a surge of adrenaline should get him through the courtroom door opened and the usher reappeared mortimer jumped up in anticipation he dug his nails into the palms of his hands determined not to let the side down reginald jackson bellowed the usher ignoring the tall thin man who had risen the moment he appeared the manager of the dunlop arms followed the usher back into the courtroom another man mortimer hadnt spoken to for the past six months leave him to me spencer had said but then even at cambridge spencer had always taken care of mortimers little problems mortimer sank back onto the bench and gripped the edge of the seat as he felt the shakes coming on he wasnt sure how much longer he could lastthe fear of spencer craig was being rapidly overtaken by the need to feed his addiction by the time the barman reemerged from the courtroom mortimers shirt pants and socks were soaked in sweat despite its being a cold march morning pull yourself together he could hear spencer saying even though he was a mile away sitting in his chambers probably chatting to lawrence about how well the trial had gone so far they would be waiting for him to join them the last piece in the jigsaw mortimer rose and began pacing up and down the corridor as he waited for the usher to reappear he checked his watch praying that there would be time for another witness to be called before lunch he smiled hopefully at the usher as he stepped back into the corridor detective sergeant fuller he bellowed mortimer collapsed back onto the bench he was now shaking uncontrollably he needed his next fix just as a baby needs the milk from its mothers breast he stood up and headed unsteadily off in the direction of the washroom he was relieved to find the white tiled room was empty he selected the farthest cubicle and locked himself inside the gap at the top and bottom of the door made him anxious someone in authority could easily discover that he was breaking the lawin the central criminal court but his craving had reached the point where common sense was rapidly replaced by necessity whatever the risk mortimer unbuttoned his jacket and extracted a small canvas pouch from an inside pocket the kit he unfolded it and laid it out on the top of the lavatory seat part of the excitement was in the preparation he picked up a small mg vial of liquid cost it was clear highquality stuff he wondered how much longer hed be able to afford such expensive gear before the small inheritance his father had bequeathed him finally ran out he stabbed the needle into the vial and drew back the plunger until the little plastic tube was full he didnt check to see if the liquid was flowing freely because he couldnt afford to waste even a drop he paused for a moment sweat pouring off his forehead when he heard the door at the far end of the room open he didnt move waiting for the stranger to carry out a ritual for which the lavatory had been originally intended once he heard the door close again he took off his old school tie pulled up a trouser leg and began to search for a vein a task that was becoming more difficult by the day he wrapped the tie around his left leg and pulled it tighter and tighter until at last a blue vein protruded he held the tie firmly with one hand and the needle in the other he then inserted the needle into the vein before slowly pressing the plunger down until every last drop of liquid had entered his bloodstream he breathed a deep sigh of relief as he drifted into another worlda world not inhabited by spencer craig i am not willing to discuss the subject any longer beths father had said earlier that day as he took his seat at the table and his wife put a plate of eggs and bacon in front of him the same breakfast she had cooked for him every morning since the day they were married but dad you cant seriously believe that danny would kill bernie they were best friends since their first day at clem attlee ive seen danny lose his temper when demanded beth in the boxing ring against bernie which is why bernie always beat him perhaps danny won this time because he had a knife in his hand beth was so stunned by her fathers accusation that she didnt reply and have you forgotten he continued what happened in the playground all those years ago no i havent said beth but danny was coming to bernies rescue at the time when the headmaster turned up and found a knife in his hand have you forgotten said beths mother that bernie confirmed dannys story when he was later questioned by the police when once again a knife was found in dannys hand but ive told you a hundred times that a complete stranger stabbed your brother to death yes he did said beth and danny did nothing to provoke him or make him lose his temper no he didnt said beth trying to remain calm and i believe her said mrs wilson as she poured her daughter another coffee you always do with good reason mrs wilson responded ive never known beth to lie mr wilson remained silent as his untouched meal went cold and you still expect me to believe that everyone else is lying he eventually said yes i do said beth you seem to forget that i was there so i know danny is innocent its four to one against said mr wilson dad this isnt a dog race were discussing its dannys life no its my sons life were discussing said mr wilson his voice rising with every word he was my son as well said beths mother just in case youve forgotten and have you also forgotten said beth that danny was the man you were so keen for me to marry and who you asked to take over the garage when you retired so whats suddenly stopped you believing in him theres something i havent told you said beths father mrs wilson bowed her head when danny came to see me that morning to tell me he was going to ask you to marry him i thought it was only fair to let him know that id changed my mind changed your mind about what asked beth who would be taking over the garage when i retired chapter seven no more questions my lord said alex redmayne the judge thanked detective sergeant fuller and told him he was free to leave the court it had not been a good day for alex lawrence davenport had mesmerized the jury with his charm and good looks ds fuller had come across as a decent conscientious officer who reported exactly what hed seen that night and the only interpretation he could put on it and when alex pressed him on his relationship with craig he simply repeated the word professional later when pearson asked him how long it was between craig making the call and fuller entering the bar fuller had said he couldnt be sure but he thought it would have been around fifteen minutes as for the barman reg jackson he just repeated parrotlike that he was only getting on with his job and hadnt seen or heard a thing redmayne accepted that if he was to find a chink in the armor of the four musketeers his only hope now rested with toby mortimer redmayne knew all about the mans drug habit although he had no intention of referring to it in court he knew that nothing else would be on mortimers mind while he was being crossexamined redmayne felt that mortimer was the one crown witness who might buckle under pressure which was why he was pleased hed been kept waiting in the corridor all day i think we have just enough time for one more witness said mr justice sackville as he glanced at his watch mr pearson didnt appear quite as enthusiastic to call the crowns last witness after reading the detailed police report he had even considered not calling toby mortimer at all but he knew that if he failed to do so redmayne would become suspicious and might even subpoena him pearson rose slowly from his place i call mr toby mortimer he said the usher stepped into the corridor and roared toby mortimer he was surprised to find that the man was no longer seated in his place hed seemed so keen to be called earlier the usher checked carefully up and down the benches but there was no sign of him he shouted the name even louder a second time but still there was no response a pregnant young woman looked up from the front row unsure if she was allowed to address the usher the ushers eyes settled on her have you seen mr mortimer madam he asked in a softer tone yes she replied he went off to the toilets some time ago but he hasnt returned thank you madam the usher disappeared back into the courtroom he walked quickly over to the associate who listened carefully before briefing the judge well give him a few more minutes said mr justice sackville redmayne kept glancing at his watch becoming more anxious as each minute slipped by it didnt take that long to go to the lavatoryunless pearson leaned across smiled and helpfully suggested perhaps we should leave this witness until first thing in the morning no thank you redmayne replied firmly im happy to wait he went over his questions again underlining relevant words so that he wouldnt have to keep glancing down at his crib sheet he looked up the moment the usher came back into court the usher hurried across the courtroom and whispered to the associate who passed the information on to the judge mr justice sackville nodded mr pearson he said the prosecution counsel rose to his feet it appears that your final witness has been taken ill and is now on his way to hospital he didnt add with a needle sticking out of a vein in his left leg i therefore intend to close proceedings for the day i would like to see both counsel in my chambers immediately alex redmayne didnt need to attend chambers to be told that his trump card had been removed from the pack as he closed the file marked crown witnesses he accepted that the fate of danny cartwright now rested in the hands of his fiancée beth wilson and he still couldnt be sure if she was telling the truth chapter eight the first week of the trial was over and the four main protagonists spent their weekends in very different ways alex redmayne drove down to somerset to spend a couple of days with his parents in bath his father began quizzing him about the trial even before hed closed the front door while his mother seemed more interested in finding out about his latest girlfriend some hope he said to both parental inquiries by the time alex left for london on sunday afternoon he had rehearsed the questions he intended to put to beth wilson the following day with his father acting as the judge not a difficult task for the old man after all that was exactly what he had done for the past twenty years before retiring sackville tells me youre holding your own his father reported but he feels you sometimes take unnecessary risks that may be the only way i can find out if cartwright is innocent thats not your job responded his father thats for the jury to decide now youre sounding like mr justice sackville alex said with a laugh its your job continued his father ignoring the comment to present the best possible defense for your client whether he is guilty or not his father had clearly forgotten that hed first proffered this piece of advice when alex was seven years old and had repeated it countless times since by the time alex went up to oxford as an undergraduate he was ready to sit his law degree and beth wilson what sort of witness do you imagine shell make his father asked a distinguished silk once told me replied alex tugging the lapels of his jacket pompously that you can never anticipate how a witness will turn out until they enter the box alexs mother burst out laughing touché she said as she cleared the plates and disappeared into the kitchen and dont underestimate pearson said his father ignoring his wifes interruption hes at his best when it comes to crossexamining a defense witness is it possible to underestimate mr arnold pearson qc asked alex smiling oh yes i did so to my cost on two occasions so were two innocent men convicted of crimes they didnt commit asked alex certainly not replied his father both of them were as guilty as sin but i still should have got them off just remember if pearson spots a weakness in your defense hell return to it again and again until hes sure that its the one point the jury remember when they retire can i interrupt learned counsel to ask how susan is asked his mother as she poured alex a coffee susan said alex snapping back into the real world that charming girl you brought down to meet us a couple of months ago susan rennick ive no idea im afraid weve lost touch i dont think the bar is compatible with having a personal life heaven knows how you two ever got together your mother fed me every night during the carbarshi trial if i hadnt married her i would have died of starvation that easy said alex grinning at his mother not quite that easy she replied after all the trial lasted for over two yearsand he lost no i didnt said his father placing an arm around his wifes waist just be warned my boy pearsons not married so hell be spending his entire weekend preparing devilish questions for beth wilson they hadnt granted him bail danny had spent the past six months locked up in belmarsh highsecurity prison in southeast london he languished for twentytwo hours a day in a cell eight foot by six the sole furnishings a single bed a formica table a plastic chair a small steel washbasin and a steel lavatory a tiny barred window high above his head was his only view of the outside world every afternoon they allowed him out of the cell for fortyfive minutes when he would jog around the perimeter of a barren yarda concrete acre surrounded by a sixteenfoot wall topped with razor wire im innocent he repeated whenever anyone asked to which the prison staff and his fellow inmates inevitably responded thats what they all say as danny jogged around the yard that morning he tried not to think about how the first week of the trial had gone but it proved impossible despite looking carefully at each member of the jury he had no way of knowing what they were thinking it might not have been a good first week but at least beth would now be able to tell her side of the story would the jury believe her or would they accept spencer craigs version of what had happened dannys father never stopped reminding him that british justice was the best in the worldinnocent men just dont end up in prison if that was true he would be free in a weeks time he tried not to consider the alternative arnold pearson qc had also spent his weekend in the country at his cottage in the cotswolds with its fourandahalfacre gardenhis pride and joy after tending the roses he attempted to read a wellreviewed novel which he ended up putting to one side before deciding to go for a walk as he strolled through the village he tried to clear his mind of everything that had been taking place in london that week although in truth the case rarely strayed from his thoughts he felt that the first week of the trial had gone well despite the fact that redmayne had proved to be a far doughtier opponent than he had expected certain familiar phrases obvious hereditary traits and a rare gift of timing brought back memories of redmaynes father who in arnold s opinion was the finest advocate he had ever come up against but thank heavens the boy was still green he should have made far more of the time issue when craig was in the witness box arnold would have counted the paving stones between the dunlop arms and the front door of craigs mews house with a stopwatch as his only companion he would then have returned to his own home undressed showered and changed into a new set of clothes while once again timing the entire exercise arnold suspected that the combined times would amount to less than twenty minutescertainly no more than thirty after he had picked up a few groceries and a local paper from the village store he set off on the return journey he stopped by the village green for a moment pearson smiled as he recalled the he had scored against brocklehurst some twenty years beforeor was it thirty all that he loved about england was embodied in the village he looked at his watch and sighed as he accepted that it was time to return home and prepare for the morrow after tea he went to his study sat down at his desk and ran an eye over the questions he had prepared for beth wilson he would have the advantage of hearing redmayne examine her before he had to ask his first question like a cat ready to pounce he would sit silently at his end of the bench waiting patiently for her to make some tiny mistake the guilty always make mistakes arnold smiled as he turned his attention to the bethnal green and bow gazette confident that redmayne would not have come across the article that had appeared on the front page some fifteen years ago arnold pearson may have lacked mr justice redmaynes elegance and style but he made up for it with the hours of patient research which had already uncovered two further pieces of evidence that would surely leave the jury in no doubt of cartwrights guilt but he would save both of them for the defendant whom he was looking forward to crossexamining later in the week on the day alex was bantering with his parents over lunch in bath danny was running around the exercise yard at belmarsh prison and arnold pearson was visiting the village store beth wilson had an appointment with her local gp just a routine check the doctor assured her with a smile but then the smile turned to a frown have you been under any unusual stress since i last saw you he asked beth didnt burden him with an account of how she had spent the past week it didnt help that her father remained convinced danny was guilty and would no longer allow his name to be mentioned in the house even though her mother had always accepted beths version of what had taken place that night but was the jury made up of people like her mother or her father every sunday afternoon for the past six months beth had visited danny in belmarsh prison but not this sunday mr redmayne had told her that she would not be allowed to have any further contact with him until the trial was over but there was so much she wanted to ask him so much she needed to tell him the baby was due in six weeks time but long before then he would be free and this terrible ordeal would finally be over once the jury had reached their verdict surely even her father would accept that danny was innocent on monday morning mr wilson drove his daughter to the old bailey and dropped her outside the main entrance to the courts he only uttered three words as she stepped out of the car tell the truth chapter nine he felt sick when their eyes met spencer craig glared down at him from the public gallery danny returned the stare as if he was standing in the middle of the ring waiting for the bell to sound for the first round when beth entered the courtroom it was the first time hed seen her for two weeks he was relieved that she would have her back to craig while she was in the witness box beth gave danny a warm smile before taking the oath is your name elizabeth wilson inquired alex redmayne yes she replied resting her hands on her stomach but im known as beth and you live at number twentyseven bacon road in bow east london yes i do and bernie wilson the deceased was your brother yes he was said beth and are you currently the personal assistant to the chairman of drakes marine insurance company in the city of london yes i am when is the baby due asked redmayne pearson frowned but he knew he dare not intervene in six weeks beth said bowing her head mr justice sackville leaned forward and smiling down at beth said would you please speak up miss wilson the jury will need to hear every word you have to say she raised her head and nodded and perhaps youd prefer to be seated the judge added helpfully being in a strange place can sometimes be a little disconcerting thank you said beth she sank onto the wooden chair in the witness box and almost disappeared out of sight damn muttered alex redmayne under his breath the jury could now barely see her shoulders and would no longer be continually reminded that she was seven months pregnant a vision he wanted implanted in the minds of the only twelve people who mattered he should have anticipated the gallant mr justice sackville and advised beth to decline the offer of a seat if shed collapsed the image would have lingered in the jurys minds miss wilson continued redmayne would you tell the court what your relationship is with the accused danny and i are going to be married next week she replied a gasp could be heard around the courtroom next week repeated redmayne trying to sound surprised yes the final banns were read yesterday by father michael our parish priest at st marys but if your fiancé were to be convicted you cant be convicted for a crime you didnt commit responded beth sharply alex redmayne smiled wordperfect and she had even turned to face the jury how long have you known the defendant as long as i can remember replied beth his family have always lived across the road from us we went to the same school clement attlee comprehensive said redmayne looking down at his open file thats right confirmed beth so you were childhood sweethearts if we were said beth danny wasnt aware of it because he hardly ever spoke to me while we were at school danny smiled for the first time that day remembering the little girl with pigtails who was always hanging around her brother but did you try to speak to him no i wouldnt have dared but i always stood on the touchline and watched whenever he played football were your brother and danny in the same team right through school replied beth danny was captain and my brother was the goalkeeper was danny always captain oh yes his mates used to call him captain cartwright he captained all the school teamsfootball cricket even boxing alex noticed that one or two of the jury were smiling and did your brother get on well with danny danny was his best friend said beth did they regularly quarrel as my learned friend has suggested asked redmayne glancing in the direction of the crown prosecutor only about west ham or bernies latest girlfriend a member of the jury just managed to stifle a laugh but didnt your brother knock danny out in the first round of the bow street boys club boxing championship last year yes he did but bernie was always the better boxer and danny knew it danny once told me that hed be lucky to make the second round if they met in the final so there was no bad feeling between them as has been suggested by my learned friend mr pearson how could he know asked beth he never met either of them danny smiled again miss wilson said the judge not quite so gently please concentrate on answering the questions what was the question asked beth sounding a little flummoxed the judge glanced down at his notebook was there any bad feeling between your brother and the defendant no said beth ive already told you they were best mates you also told the court miss wilson said redmayne trying to steer her back on to the script that danny never spoke to you while you were at school yet you ended up engaged to be married thats right said beth looking up at danny what caused this change of heart when danny and my brother left clem attlee they both went to work in my dads garage i stayed on at school for another year before going on to sixthform college and then exeter university from where you graduated with an honors degree in english yes i did replied beth and what was your first job after leaving university i became a secretary at drakes marine insurance company in the city surely you could have obtained a far better position than that remembering your qualifications perhaps i could have admitted beth but drakes head office is in the city and i didnt want to be too far from home i understand and how many years have you worked for the company five replied beth and during that time you have risen from being a secretary to the chairmans personal assistant yes how many secretaries are employed at drakes insurance asked redmayne im not sure of the exact number beth replied but there must be over a hundred but it was you who ended up with the top job beth didnt reply after you returned from university to live in london again when did you next see danny soon after id started working in the city said beth my mother asked me to drop off my dads lunchbox at the garage one saturday morning danny was there with his head under a car bonnet to begin with i thought he hadnt noticed me because he could only have seen my legs but then he looked up and banged his head on the bonnet and was that when he asked you out for the first time pearson leaped to his feet mlord is this witness to be prompted line by line as if she were in a dress rehearsal for an amateur dramatic society production not bad thought alex the judge might have agreed with him if he hadnt heard pearson deliver the same line several times during the past decade however he still leaned forward to chastise counsel mr redmayne in future please stick to asking the witness questions and dont resort to giving answers that you hope or expect miss wilson will agree with i apologize mlord said redmayne i will try not to displease your lordship again mr justice sackville frowned recalling redmaynes father delivering that line with the same lack of sincerity when did you next see the defendant redmayne asked beth that same evening he invited me to go to the hammersmith palais said beth he and my brother used to go to the palais every saturday nightmore birds per acre than youll find in the fens bernie used to say how often did you see each other following that first date inquired redmayne almost every day she paused until they locked him up im now going to take you back to the evening of september eighteenth last year said redmayne beth nodded i want you to tell the jury in your own words exactly what took place that night it was dannys idea beth began looking up at the defendant and smiling that we should go for dinner in the west end as it was a special occasion a special occasion prompted redmayne yes danny was going to propose how could you be so sure of that i heard my brother telling mum that danny had spent two months wages on the ring she held up her left hand so that the jury could admire the single diamond on a gold band alex waited for the murmurs to die down before he asked and did he ask you to be his wife yes he did replied beth he even got down on one knee and you accepted of course i did said beth i knew we were going to be married the first day i met him pearson noted her first mistake what happened next before we left the restaurant danny called bernie to tell him the news he agreed to join us later so we could all celebrate and where did you arrange to meet up for this celebration the dunlop arms on hambledon terrace in chelsea why did you choose that particular venue danny had been there once before after watching west ham play chelsea at stamford bridge he told me it was very classy and he thought id like it what time did you arrive im not sure said beth but it cant have been before ten and your brother was already there waiting for you hes at it again mlord objected pearson i do apologize mlord said redmayne he turned back to beth when did your brother arrive he was already there said beth did you notice anyone else in the room yes said beth i saw the actor lawrence davenportdr beresfordstanding at the bar with three other men do you know mr davenport of course not said beth id only ever seen him on the tv so you must have been quite excited to see a television star on the night you became engaged no i wasnt that impressed i remember thinking that he wasnt as goodlooking as danny several members of the jury took a closer look at the unshaven man with short spiky hair who was wearing a west ham tshirt that looked as if it hadnt been ironed recently alex feared that not many of the jurors would agree with beths judgment what happened next we drank a bottle of champagne and then i thought we ought to go home and did you go home no bernie ordered a second bottle and when the barman took the empty one away i heard someone say wasted on them how did danny and bernie react to that they didnt hear it but i saw one of the men at the bar staring at me he winked then opened his mouth and started circling his tongue round his lips which of the four men did that mr craig danny looked up into the gallery to see craig scowling down at beth but fortunately she couldnt see him did you tell danny no the man was obviously drunk besides you hear worse than that if youve been brought up in the east end and i knew only too well how danny would react if i told him pearson didnt stop writing so you ignored him yes said beth but then the same man turned to his friends and said the sluts quite presentable until she opens her mouth bernie did hear that then one of the other men said i dont know there are times when i quite like a sluts mouth to be open and they all began laughing she paused except for mr davenport who looked embarrassed did bernie and danny also laugh no bernie grabbed the champagne bottle and stood up to face him pearson wrote down her exact words as she added but danny pulled him back down and told him to ignore them and did he yes but only because i said i wanted to go home as we were on our way out i noticed that one of the men was still staring at me he said leaving are we in a loud whisper then when youre finished with her my friends and i have just enough left over for a gang bang a gang bang repeated mr justice sackville looking bemused yes mlord its when a group of men have sex with the same woman said redmayne sometimes for money he paused while the judge wrote down the words alex looked across at the jury none of whom appeared to require any further explanation can you be sure those were his exact words asked redmayne its not something im likely to forget said beth sharply and was it the same man who said this yes said beth mr craig how did danny react this time he continued to ignore themafter all the man was drunkbut my brother was the problem and it didnt help when mr craig added then why dont we go outside and sort it out then why dont we go outside repeated redmayne and sort it out yes said beth not quite sure why he was repeating her words and did mr craig join you outside no but only because danny pushed my brother into the alley before he could retaliate and i quickly closed the door behind us pearson picked up a red pen and underlined the words pushed him out into the alley so danny managed to get your brother out of the bar without any further trouble yes said beth but bernie still wanted to go back and sort him and sort him yes said beth but you walked on down the alley yes i did but just before i reached the road i found one of the men from the bar was standing in my way which one mr craig what did you do i ran back to join danny and my brother i begged them to return to the bar that was when i noticed the other two menone of them was mr davenportwere standing by the back door i turned round to see that the first man had been joined by his mate at the far end of the alley and they were now walking towards us what happened next asked redmayne bernie said you take dickhead and ill deal with the other three but before danny could reply the one my brother called dickhead came running towards him and threw a punch that caught danny on the chin after that an almighty fight broke out did all four of the men join in no said beth mr davenport remained by the back door and one of the others a tall skinny guy hung back and when my brother nearly knocked out the only other man willing to fight bernie told me to go and get a taxi as he was confident it would be all over fairly quickly and did you yes but not until i was sure that danny was getting the better of craig and was he no contest said beth how long did it take you to find a taxi only a few minutes said beth but when the cabbie drew up to my surprise he said i dont think its a taxi youll be needing luv if they were my friends id be phoning for an ambulance and without another word he shot off has any attempt been made to locate the taxi driver concerned asked the judge yes mlord replied redmayne but so far no one has come forward so how did you react when you heard the taxi drivers words redmayne asked turning back to beth i swung round to see my brother lying on the ground he appeared to be unconscious danny was holding bernies head in his arms i ran back down the alley to join them pearson made another note and did danny give an explanation as to what had happened yes he said that they had been taken by surprise when craig produced a knife he had tried to wrestle it from him when he was stabbing bernie and did bernie confirm this yes he did so what did you do next i phoned the emergency services please take your time miss wilson before you answer my next question who turned up first the police or an ambulance two paramedics said beth without hesitation and how long was it before they arrived seven perhaps eight minutes how can you be so sure i never stopped looking at my watch and how many more minutes passed before the police arrived i cant be certain said beth but it must have been at least another five and how long did detective sergeant fuller remain with you in the alley before he went into the bar to interview mr craig at least ten minutes said beth but it might have been longer but quite long enough for mr spencer craig to leave return home a mere hundred yards away change his clothes and be back in time to give his version of what had taken place before the detective sergeant went into the bar mlord said pearson leaping up from his place this is an outrageous slur on a man who was doing no more than carrying out his public duty i agree with you said the judge members of the jury you will ignore mr redmaynes last comments never forget that it is not mr craig who is on trial he glared down at redmayne but the lawyer didnt flinch well aware that the jury would not forget the exchange and that it might even sow some doubt in their minds i do apologize mlord he said in a contrite voice it wont happen again be sure that it doesnt said the judge sharply miss wilson while you were waiting for the police to arrive did the paramedics put your brother on a stretcher and take him to the nearest hospital yes they did everything they could to help said beth but i knew it was too late hed already lost so much blood did you and danny accompany your brother to the hospital no i went on my own because detective sergeant fuller wanted to ask danny some more questions did that worry you yes because danny had also been wounded hed been thats not what i meant said redmayne not wanting her to finish the sentence were you anxious that the police might consider danny to be a suspect no said beth it never crossed my mind i had already told the police what happened in any case he always had me to back up his story if alex had looked across at pearson he would have seen the rare flicker of a smile appear on the prosecutors face sadly your brother died on the way to chelsea and westminster hospital beth began to sob yes i rang my parents who came immediately but it was too late alex made no attempt to ask his next question until she had composed herself did danny join you at the hospital later no he didnt why not because the police were still questioning him when did you next see him the following morning at chelsea police station chelsea police station repeated redmayne feigning surprise yes the police came round to my house first thing in the morning they told me theyd arrested danny and charged him with bernies murder that must have come as a terrible shock mr pearson leaped up how did you react to this piece of news asked redmayne quickly in total disbelief i repeated exactly what had happened but i could see they didnt believe me thank you miss wilson no more questions mlord danny breathed a sigh of relief as beth stepped down from the witness box what a diamond she smiled anxiously up at him as she passed the dock miss wilson said the judge before she had reached the door she turned back to face him would you be kind enough to return to the witness box i have a feeling mr pearson may have one or two questions for you chapter ten beth walked slowly back to the witness box she looked up at her parents in the public galleryand then she saw him glaring down at her she wanted to protest but realized that it would serve no purpose and nothing would please spencer craig more than to know the effect his presence had on her she stepped back into the witness box more determined than ever to defeat him she remained standing and stared defiantly at mr pearson who was still seated in his place perhaps he wasnt going to ask her any questions after all the old prosecutor rose slowly from his seat without glancing at beth he began to rearrange some papers he then took a sip of water before finally looking across at her miss wilson what did you have for breakfast this morning beth hesitated for a moment while everyone in the court stared at her alex redmayne cursed he should have realized that pearson would try to throw her off guard with his first question only mr justice sackville didnt look surprised i had a cup of tea and a boiled egg beth eventually managed nothing else miss wilson oh yes some toast how many cups of tea one no two said beth or was it three no no it was two and how many slices of toast she hesitated again i cant remember you cant remember what you had for breakfast this morning and yet you can recall in great detail every sentence you heard six months ago beth bowed her head again not only can you recall every word mr spencer craig uttered that night but you can even remember such details as him winking at you and rolling his tongue round his lips yes i can insisted beth because he did then lets go back and test your memory even further miss wilson when the barman picked up the empty bottle of champagne mr craig said wasted on them yes thats right but who was it who saidpearson leaned forward to check his notes there are times when i quite like a sluts mouth to be open im not sure if that was mr craig or one of the other men youre not sure one of the other men do you mean the defendant cartwright no one of the men at the bar you told my learned friend that you didnt react because youd heard worse in the east end yes i have in fact thats where you heard the phrase in the first place isnt it miss wilson said pearson tugging the lapels of his black gown what are you getting at simply that you never heard mr craig deliver those words in a bar in chelsea miss wilson but you have heard cartwright say them back in the east end many times because thats the sort of language he would use no it was mr craig who said those words you also told the court that you left the dunlop arms by the back door yes why didnt you leave by the front door miss wilson i wanted to slip out quietly and not cause any more trouble so you had already caused some trouble no we hadnt caused any trouble then why didnt you leave by the front door miss wilson if you had you would have found yourself on a crowded street and could have slipped away to use your words without causing any more trouble beth remained silent then perhaps you can also explain what your brother meant said pearson checking his notes when he said to cartwright if you think im gonna call you guv you can forget it he was joking said beth pearson stared at his file for some time before saying forgive me miss wilson but i cant see anything humorous in that remark thats because you dont come from the east end said beth neither does mr craig responded pearson before quickly adding and then cartwright pushes mr wilson towards the back door was that when mr craig heard your brother say then why dont i join you and we can sort it it was mr craig who said then why dont i join you and we can sort it out because thats the kind of language they use in the west end bright woman thought alex delighted that shed picked up his point and rammed it home and when you were outside said pearson quickly you found mr craig waiting for you at the other end of the alley yes i did how long was it before you saw him standing there i dont remember replied beth this time you dont remember it wasnt that long said beth it wasnt that long repeated pearson less than a minute i cant be sure but he was standing there miss wilson if you were to leave the dunlop arms by the front door make your way through a crowded street then down a long lane before finally reaching the end of the alley youd find its a distance of two hundred and eleven yards are you suggesting that mr craig covered that distance in under a minute he must have done and his friend joined him a few moments later said pearson yes he did said beth and when you turned round the other two men mr davenport and mr mortimer were already positioned by the back door yes they were and this all took place in under a minute miss wilson he paused when do you imagine the four of them found time to plan such a detailed operation i dont understand what you mean said beth gripping the rail of the witness box i think you understand only too well miss wilson but for the benefit of the jury two men leave the bar by the front door go around to the rear of the building while the other two station themselves by the back door all in under a minute it could have been more than a minute but you were keen to get away pearson reminded her so if it had been more than a minute you would have had time to reach the main road and disappear long before they could have got there now i remember said beth danny was trying to calm bernie down but my brother wanted to go back to the bar and sort craig so it must have been more than a minute or was it mr cartwright he wanted to sort out asked pearson and leave him in no doubt who was going to be the boss once his father retired if bernie had wanted to do that said beth he could have flattened him with one punch not if mr cartwright had a knife responded pearson it was craig who had the knife and it was craig who stabbed bernie how can you be so sure miss wilson when you didnt witness the stabbing because bernie told me thats what happened are you sure it was bernie who told you and not danny yes i am youll forgive the cliché miss wilson but thats my story and im sticking to it i am because its the truth said beth is it also true that you feared your brother was dying miss wilson yes he was losing so much blood i didnt think he could survive replied beth as she began sobbing then why dont you call for an ambulance miss wilson this had always puzzled alex and he wondered how she would respond she didnt which allowed pearson to add after all your brother had been stabbed again and again to quote you i didnt have a phone she blurted but your fiancé did pearson reminded her because he had called your brother earlier inviting him to join you both at the pub but an ambulance arrived a few minutes later replied beth and we all know who phoned the emergency services dont we miss wilson said pearson staring at the jury beth bowed her head miss wilson allow me to remind you of some of the other halftruths you told my learned friend beth pursed her lips you said i knew we were going to be married the first day i met him yes thats what i said and thats what i meant said beth defiantly pearson looked down at his notes you also said that in your opinion mr davenport wasnt as goodlooking as mr cartwright and he isnt said beth and that if anything went wrong he always had me to back up his story yes he did whatever that story was i didnt say that protested beth no i did said pearson because i suggest youd say anything to protect your husband but he isnt my husband but he will be if he is acquitted yes he will how long has it been since the night your brother was murdered just over six months and how often have you seen mr cartwright during that period ive visited him every sunday afternoon said beth proudly how long do those visits last about two hours pearson looked up at the ceiling so youve spent roughly he calculated fifty hours together during the past six months ive never thought of it that way said beth but now you have wouldnt you agree that would it be quite long enough for the two of you to go over your story again and again making sure that it was wordperfect by the time you appeared in court no thats not true miss wilson when you visited mr cartwright in prisonhe pausedfor fifty hours did you ever discuss this case beth hesitated i suppose we must have of course you did said pearson because if you didnt perhaps you can explain how you recall every detail of what happened that night and every sentence delivered by anyone involved while you cant remember what you had for breakfast this morning of course i remember what happened on the night my brother was murdered mr pearson how could i ever forget in any case craig and his friends would have had even more time to prepare their stories because they had no visiting hours or any restrictions on when or where they could meet bravo said alex loud enough for pearson to hear let us return to the alley and test your memory one more time miss wilson said pearson quickly changing the subject mr craig and mr payne having arrived in the alley in under a minute began walking towards your brother and without any provocation started a fight yes they did said beth with two men theyd never seen before that night yes and when things began to go badly mr craig pulls a knife out of thin air and stabs your brother in the chest it wasnt out of thin air he must have picked it up from the bar so it wasnt danny who picked up the knife from the bar no i would have seen it if it had been danny but you didnt see mr craig pick up the knife from the bar no i didnt but you did see him one minute later standing at the other end of the alley yes i did did he have a knife in his hand at that time pearson leaned back and waited for beth to reply i dont remember then perhaps you can remember who had the knife in his hand when you ran back to join your brother yes it was danny but he explained that he had to get hold of it when craig was stabbing my brother but you didnt witness that either no i didnt and your fiancé was covered in blood of course he was said beth danny was holding my brother in his arms so if it was mr craig who stabbed your brother he must also have been covered in blood how could i know hed disappeared by then into thin air said pearson so how do you explain that when the police arrived a few minutes later mr craig was sitting at the bar waiting for the detective and there was not a sign of blood anywhere this time beth didnt have a reply and may i remind you continued pearson who it was that called for the police in the first place not you miss wilson but mr craig a strange thing to do moments after youve stabbed someone and your clothes are covered in blood he paused to allow the image to settle in the jurys mind and waited for some time before he asked his next question miss wilson was this the first time your fiancé had been involved in a knife fight and you had come to his rescue what are you getting at said beth redmayne stared at beth wondering if there was something she hadnt told him perhaps the time has come to test your remarkable memory once again said pearson the judge the jury and redmayne were now all staring at pearson who didnt seem to be in any hurry to reveal his trump card miss wilson do you by any chance recall what took place in the playground of the clement attlee comprehensive school on february twelfth but thats nearly fifteen years ago protested beth indeed it is but i think its unlikely that you would forget a day when the man you always knew you were going to marry ended up on the front page of your local paper pearson leaned back and his junior passed him a photocopy of the bethnal green and bow gazette dated february he asked the usher to hand a copy to the witness do you also have copies for the jury asked mr justice sackville as he peered over his halfmoon spectacles at pearson i do indeed mlord pearson replied as his junior passed across a large bundle to the court usher who in turn handed one up to the judge before distributing a dozen copies to the jury and giving the final one to danny who shook his head pearson looked surprised and even wondered if cartwright couldnt read something hed follow up once he had him in the witness box as you see miss wilson this is a copy of the bethnal green and bow gazette in which there is a report of a knife fight that took place in the playground of clement attlee comprehensive on february twelfth after which daniel cartwright was questioned by the police he was only trying to help said beth getting to be a bit of a habit isnt it suggested pearson what do you mean demanded beth mr cartwright being involved in a knife fight and then you saying he was only trying to help but the other boy ended up in borstal and no doubt you hope that in this case it will be the other man who ends up in prison rather than the person you are hoping to marry yes i do im glad we have at least established that said pearson perhaps you would be kind enough to read out to the court the third paragraph on the front page of the newspaper the one that begins beth wilson later told the police beth looked down at the paper beth wilson later told the police that danny cartwright had not been involved in the fight but came to the aid of a classmate and probably saved his life would you agree that that also sounds a little familiar miss wilson but danny wasnt involved in the fight then why was he expelled from the school he wasnt he was sent home while an inquiry was carried out in the course of which you gave a statement which cleared his name and resulted in another boy being sent to borstal beth once again lowered her head lets return to the latest knife fight when once again you were so conveniently on hand to come to your wouldbe boyfriends rescue is it true said pearson before beth could respond that cartwright was hoping to become the manager of wilson s garage when your father retired yes my dad had already told danny that he was being lined up for the job but didnt you later discover that your father had changed his mind and told cartwright that he intended to put your brother in charge of the garage yes i did said beth but bernie never wanted the job in the first place he always accepted that danny was the natural leader possibly but as it was the family business wouldnt it have been understandable for your brother to feel resentful at being passed over no bernie never wanted to be in charge of anything then why did your brother say that night and if you think im going to call you guv if you take over from my old man you can forget it he didnt say if mr pearson he said when theres a world of difference alex redmayne smiled sadly we only have your word for that miss wilson while there are three other witnesses who tell a completely different story theyre all lying said beth her voice rising and youre the only one whos telling the truth responded pearson yes i am who does your father believe is telling the truth asked pearson suddenly changing tack mlord said alex redmayne jumping to his feet such evidence would not only be hearsay but also can have no bearing on the case i agree with my learned friend replied pearson before the judge could respond but as miss wilson and her father live in the same house i felt that perhaps the witness might at some time have been made aware of her fathers feelings on the subject that may well be the case said mr justice sackville but it is still hearsay and i therefore rule it to be inadmissible he turned to beth and said miss wilson you dont have to answer that question beth looked up at the judge my father doesnt believe me she said in between sobs hes still convinced danny killed my brother suddenly everyone in the court seemed to be chattering the judge had to call for order several times before pearson could resume do you want to add anything else that might assist the jury miss wilson asked pearson hopefully yes replied beth my father wasnt there i was and so was your fiancé interjected pearson i suggest that what started out as just another in a long line of quarrels ended in tragedy when cartwright fatally stabbed your brother it was craig who stabbed my brother while you were at the other end of the alley trying to hail a taxi yes thats right said beth and when the police arrived they found cartwrights clothes were covered in blood and the only fingerprints they could identify on the knife were your fiancés i have already explained how that happened said beth then perhaps you can also explain why when the police interviewed mr craig a few minutes later there was not a single drop of blood on his spotless suit shirt or tie he wouldve had at least twenty minutes to run home and get changed said beth even thirty added redmayne so you endorse the superman theory do you said pearson and he admitted he was in the alley added beth ignoring the comment yes he did miss wilson but only after hed heard you scream when he left his friends in the bar to find out if you were in any danger no he was already in the alley when bernie was stabbed but stabbed by whom asked pearson craig craig craig shouted beth how many times do i have to tell you who managed to reach the alley in less than a minute and then somehow found time to phone the police return to the bar ask his companions to leave go home change out of his bloodcovered clothes shower return to the bar and still be sitting around waiting for the police to arrive he was then able to give a coherent account of exactly what took place one which every witness who was in the bar that night was later able to verify but they werent telling the truth said beth i see said pearson so all the other witnesses were willing to lie under oath yes they were all protecting him and youre not protecting your fiancé no im telling the truth the truth as you see it said pearson because you didnt actually witness what took place i didnt need to said beth because bernie told me exactly what happened are you sure it was bernie and not danny no it was bernie she repeated just before he died yes shouted beth how convenient said pearson and once danny is in the witness box hell confirm my story after seeing each other every sunday for the past six months miss wilson i have no doubt he will said pearson no more questions mlord chapter eleven what did you have for breakfast this morning said alex not that hoary old chestnut said his father his voice booming down the phone whats so funny i should have warned you pearson has only two openings when it comes to crossexamining a defense witness as a young barrister he worked out that only the judge will have heard them before but to any unsuspecting witness not to mention a jury they will always come as a complete surprise and whats the other one asked alex whats the name of the street when you come out second on the left of your front door to go to work in the morning few witnesses manage to answer that one correctly as i know to my cost and i suspect that pearson walks the streets around the defendants home on the evening before he opens a crossexamination i bet youd find him prowling around the east end right now alex sank back in his chair well you did warn me not to underestimate the man sir matthew didnt reply immediately when he did eventually speak he raised a subject alex hadnt even considered are you going to put cartwright in the witness box of course said alex why wouldnt i because its the one element of surprise you have left pearson will be expecting cartwright to be in the witness box for the rest of the week but if you were to close your case tomorrow morning without any warning hed be on the back foot hes assuming that hell be crossexamining cartwright some time towards the end of the week perhaps even next week not to be asked to sum up for the prosecution first thing tomorrow but if cartwright doesnt give evidence surely the jury will assume the worst the law is quite clear on that point replied alexs father the judge will spell out that it is the prerogative of the defendant to decide if he wishes to enter the witness box and that the jury should not jump to conclusions based on that decision but they invariably do as youve warned me so many times in the past perhaps but one or two of the jury will have noticed that he wasnt able to read that article in the bethnal green and bow gazette and assume youve advised him not to face pearson especially after the grilling he gave his fiancée cartwright is every bit as bright as pearson said alex he just isnt as well educated but you mentioned that he has a short fuse only when someone attacks beth then you can be sure that once cartwrights in the witness box pearson will go on attacking beth until he lights that fuse but cartwright doesnt have a criminal record hes been in work since the day he left school and he was about to get married to his longterm girlfriend who just happens to be pregnant so now we know four subjects pearson wont mention in crossexamination but you can be sure hell question cartwright about the playground incident in his youth continually reminding the jury that a knife was involved and that his girlfriend conveniently came to his rescue well if thats my only problem began alex it wont be i can promise you replied his father because now that pearson has raised the knife fight in the playground with beth wilson you can be pretty confident that he has one or two other surprises in store for danny cartwright like what ive no idea said sir matthew but if you put him in the witness box no doubt youll find out alex frowned as he considered his fathers words somethings worrying you said the judge when alex did not reply pearson knows that beths father told cartwright he had changed his mind about appointing him as manager of the garage and intended to offer the job to his son instead yes said alex not helpful when it comes to motive true but perhaps ive also got one or two surprises for pearson to worry about said alex such as craig stabbed danny in the leg and hes got the scar to prove it pearson will say its an old wound but we have a doctors report to show it isnt pearson will blame it on bernie wilson so you are advising me not to put cartwright in the box not an easy question to answer my boy because i wasnt in court so i dont know how the jury responded to beth wilsons testimony alex was silent for a few moments one or two of them appeared sympathetic and she certainly came across as an honest person but then they might well conclude that even if she is telling the truth she didnt see what happened and is taking cartwrights word for it well you only need three jurors to be convinced that she was telling the truth and you could end up with a hung jury and at worst a retrial and if that turned out to be the result the cps might even feel that another trial was not in the public interest i should have spent more time pressing craig on the time discrepancy shouldnt i said alex hoping his father would disagree too late to worry about that responded his father your most important decision now is whether you should put cartwright in the witness box i agree but if i make the wrong decision danny could end up in prison for the next twenty years chapter twelve alex arrived at the old bailey only moments after the night porter had unlocked the front door following a long consultation with danny in the cells below he went to the robing room and changed into his legal garb before making his way across to court number four he entered the empty courtroom took his seat on the end of the bench and placed three files marked cartwright on the table in front of him he opened the first file and began to go over the seven questions hed written out so neatly the night before he glanced up at the clock on the wall it was am at ten minutes to the hour arnold pearson and his junior strolled in and took their places at the other end of the bench they didnt interrupt alex as he appeared to be preoccupied danny cartwright was the next to appear accompanied by two policemen he sat on a wooden chair in the center of the dock and waited for the judge to make his entrance on the stroke of ten the door at the back of the court opened and mr justice sackville entered his domain everyone in the well of the court rose and bowed the judge returned the compliment before taking his place in the center chair bring in the jury he said while he waited for them to appear he put on his halfmoon spectacles opened the cover of a fresh notebook and removed the top from his fountain pen he wrote down the words daniel cartwright examination by mr redmayne once the jury members were settled in their places the judge turned his attention to defense counsel are you ready to call your next witness mr redmayne he asked alex rose from his place poured himself a glass of water and took a sip he glanced toward danny and smiled he then looked down at the questions in front of him before turning the page to reveal a blank sheet of paper he smiled back up at the judge and said i have no further witnesses mlord an anxious look crossed pearsons face he swung quickly around to consult his junior who appeared equally bemused alex savored the moment while he waited for the whispering to die down the judge smiled down at redmayne who thought for a moment he might even wink once alex had milked every moment he felt he could get away with he said my lord that concludes the case for the defense mr justice sackville looked across at pearson who now resembled a startled rabbit caught in the headlamps of an advancing lorry mr pearson he said as if nothing untoward had taken place you may begin your closing speech for the crown pearson rose slowly from his place i wonder mlord he spluttered given these unusual circumstances if your lordship would allow me a little more time to prepare my closing remarks may i suggest that we adjourn proceedings until this afternoon in order that no mr pearson interrupted the judge i will not adjourn proceedings no one knows better than you that it is a defendants right to choose not to give evidence the jury and the court officials are all in place and i need not remind you how crowded the court calendar is please proceed with your closing remarks pearsons junior extracted a file from the bottom of the pile and passed it across to his leader pearson opened it aware that he had barely glanced at its contents during the past few days he stared down at the first page members of the jury he began slowly it soon became evident that pearson was a man who relied on being well prepared and that thinking on his feet was not his strong suit he stumbled from paragraph to paragraph as he read from his script until even his junior began to look exasperated alex sat silently at the other end of the bench concentrating his attention on the jury even the ones who were usually fully alert looked bored one or two occasionally stifling a yawn as their glazed eyes blinked open and closed by the time pearson came to the last page two hours later even alex was dozing off when pearson finally slumped back onto the bench mr justice sackville suggested that perhaps this might be a convenient time to take the lunch break once the judge had left the court alex glanced across at pearson who could barely disguise his anger he was only too aware that he had given an outoftown matinee performance to an openingnight audience in the west end alex grabbed one of his thick files and hurried out of the courtroom he ran down the corridor and up the stone steps to a small room on the second floor that he had booked earlier that morning inside were just a table and chair not even a print on the wall alex opened his file and began to go over his summingup key sentences were rehearsed again and again until he was confident that the salient points would remain lodged in the jurys mind as alex had spent most of the night as well as the early hours of the morning crafting and honing each and every phrase he felt well prepared by the time he returned to court number four an hour and a half later he was back in his place only moments before the judge reappeared once the court had settled mr justice sackville asked if he was ready to make his closing submission i am indeed mlord alex replied and poured himself another glass of water he opened his file looked up and took a sip members of the jury he began you have now heard alex did not take as long as mr pearson to present his closing argument but then for him it was not a dress rehearsal he had no way of knowing how his most important points were playing with the jury but at least none of them was nodding off and several were making notes when alex sat down an hour and a half later he felt he could reply yes should his father ask if he had served his client to the best of his ability thank you mr redmayne said the judge who then turned to the jury i think that will be enough for today he said pearson checked his watch it was only threethirty he had assumed the judge would spend at least an hour addressing the jury before they rose for the day but it was clear that he too had been taken by surprise with alex redmaynes morning ambush the judge rose from his place bowed and left the courtroom without another word alex turned to chat with his opposite number as an usher handed pearson a slip of paper after pearson had read it he jumped up and hurried out of the courtroom followed closely by his junior alex turned to smile at the defendant in the dock but danny cartwright had already been escorted back down the stairwell to be locked in the cells below alex couldnt help wondering which door his client would leave by tomorrow but then he had no idea why pearson had left the courtroom in such a hurry chapter thirteen mr pearsons clerk phoned mr justice sackvilles clerk at one minute past nine the following morning mr justice sackvilles clerk said he would pass on mr pearsons request and come straight back to him a few minutes later mr justice sackvilles clerk phoned back to inform mr pearsons clerk that the judge would be happy to see mr pearson in chambers at and he assumed given the circumstances that mr redmayne would also need to be present hell be my next call bill replied mr pearsons clerk before putting the phone down mr pearsons clerk then called mr redmaynes clerk and asked if mr redmayne would be free at to see the judge in chambers to discuss a matter of the utmost urgency so whats this all about jim mr redmaynes clerk asked no idea ted pearson never confides in me mr redmaynes clerk called mr redmayne on his mobile and caught him just as he was about to disappear below ground into pimlico tube station did pearson give any reason why he wants a meeting with the judge asked alex he never does mr redmayne replied ted alex knocked quietly on the door before entering mr justice sackvilles chambers he found pearson lounging in a comfortable chair chatting to the judge about his roses mr justice sackville would never have considered broaching the relevant subject until both counsel were present good morning alex said the judge waving him to an old leather armchair next to pearson good morning judge replied alex as we are due to sit in less than thirty minutes said the judge perhaps arnold you could brief us on why you requested this meeting certainly judge said pearson at the request of the cps i attended a meeting at their offices yesterday evening alex held his breath after a lengthy discussion with my masters i can report that they are willing to consider a change of plea in this case alex tried not to show any reaction although he wanted to leap up and punch the air but this was judges chambers and not the terraces at upton park what do they have in mind asked the judge turning his attention to redmayne they felt that if cartwright was able to plead guilty to manslaughter how do you feel your client might respond to such an offer asked the judge i have no idea admitted alex hes an intelligent man but hes also as stubborn as a mule hes stuck rigidly to the same story for the past six months and has never once stopped protesting his innocence despite that are you of a mind to advise him to accept the cpss offer asked pearson alex was silent for some time before he said yes but how does the cps suggest i dress it up pearson frowned at redmaynes choice of phrase if your client were to admit that he and wilson did go into the alley for the purpose of sorting out their differences and a knife ended up in wilson s chest asked the judge trying not to sound too cynical selfdefense mitigating circumstancesill leave redmayne to fill in the details thats hardly my responsibility the judge nodded i will instruct my clerk to inform the court officials and the jury that i do not intend to sithe glanced at his watchuntil eleven am alex will that give you enough time to instruct your client and then return to my chambers with his decision yes i feel sure that will be quite enough time replied alex if the mans guilty said pearson youll be back in two minutes chapter fourteen as alex redmayne left the judge a few moments later and made his way slowly across to the other side of the building he tried to marshal his thoughts within two hundred paces he exchanged the peaceful serenity of a judges chambers for cold bleak cells only occupied by prisoners he came to a halt at the heavy black door that blocked his way to the cells below he knocked twice before it was opened by a silent policeman who accompanied him down a narrow flight of stone steps to a yellow corridor known by the old lags as the yellow brick road by the time they reached cell number alex felt he was well prepared although he still had no idea how danny would react to the offer the officer selected a key from a large ring and unlocked the cell door do you require an officer to be present during the interview he asked politely that wont be necessary alex replied the officer pulled open the twoinchthick steel door do you want the door left open or closed sir closed replied alex as he walked into a tiny cell that boasted two plastic chairs and a small formica table in the middle of the room graffiti the only decoration on the walls danny rose as alex entered the room good morning mr redmayne he said good morning danny replied alex taking the seat opposite him he knew it would be pointless to ask his client once again to call him by his first name alex opened a file that contained a single sheet of paper i have some good news he declared or at least i hope youll feel its good news danny showed no emotion he rarely spoke unless he had something worthwhile to say if you felt able to change your plea to one of guilty of manslaughter continued alex i think the judge would only sentence you to five years and as youve already served six months with good behavior you could be out in a couple of years danny stared across the table at alex looked him straight in the eye and said tell im to fuck off alex was almost as shocked by dannys language as he was by his instant decision hed never heard his client swear once during the past six months but danny please give the offer a little more consideration pleaded alex if the jury finds you guilty of murder you could end up serving a life sentence with a tariff of twenty years perhaps more that would mean you wouldnt be released from prison until youre nearly fifty but if you accept their offer you could begin your life with beth in two years time what kind of life asked danny coldly one where everyone thinks i murdered my best mate and got away with it no mr redmayne i didnt kill bernie and if it takes me twenty years to prove it but danny why risk the whims of a jury when you can so easily accept this compromise i dont know what the word compromise means mr redmayne but i do know that im innocent and once the jury ears about this offer theyll never hear about it danny if you turn the offer down they wont be told why proceedings are being held up this morning and the judge will make no reference to it in his summing up the trial will just continue as if nothing has happened so be it said danny perhaps youd like a little more time to think about it said alex refusing to give up you could talk to beth or your parents im sure i could get the judge to hold things up until tomorrow morning which would at least give you time to reconsider your position ave you thought about what youre asking me to do said danny im not sure i understand said alex if i admit to manslaughter that would mean that everything beth said while she was in the witness box was a lie she didnt lie mr redmayne she told the jury exactly what appened that night danny you could spend the next twenty years regretting this decision i could spend the next twenty years living a lie and if it takes me that long to prove im innocent that as to be better than the world believing i killed my best mate but the world would quickly forget i wouldnt said danny and neither would my mates in the east end alex would like to have given it one last go but he knew it was pointless to try to change the mind of this proud man he rose wearily from his place ill let them know your decision he said before banging his fist on the cell door a key turned in the lock and moments later the heavy steel door was pulled open mr redmayne said danny quietly alex turned to face his client youre a diamond and im proud to ave been represented by you and not that mr pearson the door was slammed shut chapter fifteen never become emotionally involved in a case his father had often warned him although alex hadnt slept the previous night he still paid rapt attention to every word the judge had to say in his fourhour summingup mr justice sackvilles summary was masterful he first went over any points of law as they applied to the case he then proceeded to help the jury sift through the evidence point by point trying to make the case coherent logical and easy for them to follow he never once exaggerated or showed any bias only offering a balanced view for the seven men and five women to consider he suggested they should take seriously the testimony of three witnesses who had stated unequivocally that only mr craig had left the bar to go out into the alley and only then after hed heard a woman scream craig had stated on oath that he had seen the defendant stab wilson several times and had then immediately returned to the bar and called the police miss wilson on the other hand told a different story claiming that it was mr craig who had drawn her companions into a fight and it was he who must have stabbed wilson however she did not witness the murder but explained it was her brother who told her what had happened before he died if you accept this version of events the judge said you might ask yourselves why mr craig contacted the police and perhaps more important when ds fuller interviewed him in the bar some twenty minutes later why there was no sign of blood on any of the clothes he was wearing alex cursed under his breath members of the jury mr justice sackville continued there is nothing in miss wilsons past to suggest that she is other than an honest and decent citizen however you may feel that her evidence is somewhat colored by her devotion and longheld loyalty to cartwright whom she intends to marry should he be found not guilty but that must not influence you in your decision you must put aside any natural sympathy you might feel because miss wilson is pregnant your responsibility is to weigh up the evidence in this case and ignore any irrelevant side issues the judge went on to emphasize that cartwright had no previous criminal record and that for the past eleven years he had been employed by the same company he warned the jury not to read too much into the fact that cartwright had not given evidence that was his prerogative he explained although the jury might be puzzled by the decision if he had nothing to hide again alex cursed his inexperience what had been an advantage when he took pearson by surprise and had even caused the cps to come up with their offer to accept a guilty plea to a lesser charge might now be working against him the judge ended his summingup by advising the jury to take their time after all he emphasized a mans future was in the balance however they should not forget that another man had lost his life and if danny cartwright did not kill bernie wilson they might well ask who else could possibly have committed the crime at twelve minutes past two the jury filed out of the court to begin their deliberations for the next two hours alex tried not to remonstrate with himself for having failed to put danny in the witness box did pearson as his father had suggested really have other damning material that would have taken them both by surprise would danny have been able to convince the jury that he didnt murder his closest friend pointless questions that alex nevertheless continued to mull over as he waited for the jury to return it was just after five oclock when the seven men and five women returned to the court and took their places in the jury box alex couldnt interpret the blank looks on their faces mr justice sackville looked down from the bench and asked members of the jury have you reached a verdict the foreman rose from his new place at the end of the front row no mlord he responded reading from a prepared script we are still sifting through the evidence and will need more time before we can come to a decision the judge nodded and thanked the jury for their diligence im going to send you home now so that you can rest before you continue your deliberations tomorrow morning but be aware he added that once you leave this courtroom you should not discuss the case with anyone including your families alex returned home to his little flat in pimlico and spent a second sleepless night chapter sixteen alex was back in court and seated in his place by five minutes to ten the following morning pearson greeted him with a warm smile had the old codger forgiven him for his ambush or was he simply confident of the outcome as the two of them waited for the jury to return they chatted about roses cricket even who was most likely to be the first mayor of london but never once referred to the proceedings that had occupied every waking minute for the past two weeks the minutes turned into hours as there was no sign of the jury returning by one oclock the judge released everyone for an hours lunch break while pearson went off for a meal in the bar mess on the top floor alex spent his time pacing up and down the corridor outside court number four juries in a murder trial rarely take less than four hours to reach a verdict his father had told him over the phone that morning for fear that it might be suggested that they had not taken their responsibilities seriously at eight minutes past four the jury filed back into their places and this time alex noted that their expressions had changed from blank to bemused mr justice sackville had no choice but to send them home for a second night the following morning alex had only been pacing up and down the marble corridors for just over an hour before an usher emerged from the courtroom and shouted the jury are returning to court number four once again the foreman read from a prepared statement my lord he began his eyes never rising from the sheet of paper he was holding his hand trembling slightly despite many hours of deliberation we are unable to come to a unanimous decision and wish to seek your guidance on how we should proceed i sympathize with your problem responded the judge but i must ask you to try one more time to reach a unanimous decision i am loath to call a retrial only for the court to be put through the whole procedure a second time alex bowed his head he would have settled for a retrial if they gave him a second chance he wasnt in any doubt that the jury filed back out without another word and didnt reappear again that morning alex sat alone in a corner of the restaurant on the third floor he allowed his soup to go cold and shifted his salad around the plate before he returned to the corridor and continued his ritual pacing at twelve minutes past three an announcement came over the loudspeaker all those involved in the cartwright case please make their way back in to court number four as the jury is returning alex joined a stream of interested parties as they walked quickly down the corridor and filed back into the courtroom once they were settled the judge reappeared and instructed the usher to summon the jury as they entered the court alex couldnt help noticing that one or two of them looked distressed the judge leaned forward and asked the foreman have you been able to reach a unanimous verdict no mlord came back the immediate reply do you think that you might reach a unanimous verdict if i were to allow you a little more time no mlord would it help if i were to consider a majority verdict and by that i mean one where at least ten of you are in agreement that might solve the problem mlord the foreman replied then ill ask you to reconvene and see if you can finally come to a verdict the judge nodded to the usher who led the jury back out of court alex was about to rise and continue his perambulations when pearson leaned across and said stay still dear boy i have a feeling theyll be back shortly alex settled down on his corner of the bench just as pearson had predicted the jury were back in their places a few minutes later alex turned to pearson but before he could speak the elderly qc said dont even ask dear boy ive never been able to fathom the machinations of a jury despite almost thirty years at the bar alex was shaking as the usher stood and said would the foreman please rise have you reached a verdict the judge asked we have mlord replied the foreman and is it a majority of you yes mlord a majority of ten to two the judge nodded in the direction of the usher who bowed members of the jury he said do you find the prisoner at the bar daniel arthur cartwright guilty or not guilty of murder what seemed like an eternity to alex before the foreman responded was in fact no more than a few seconds guilty the foreman pronounced a gasp went up around the court alexs first reaction was to turn and look at danny he showed no sign of emotion above him in the public gallery came cries of no and the sound of sobbing once the courtroom had come to order the judge delivered a long preamble before passing sentence the only words that would remain indelibly fixed in alexs mind were twentytwo years his father had told him never to allow a verdict to affect him after all only one defendant in a hundred was wrongly convicted alex was in no doubt that danny cartwright was one in a hundred book two prison chapter seventeen welcome back cartwright danny glanced at the officer seated behind the desk in reception but didnt respond the man looked down at the charge sheet twentytwo years mr jenkins said with a sigh he paused i know how you must feel because thats just about the length of time ive been in the service danny had always thought of mr jenkins as old is that how ill look in twentytwo years he wondered im sorry lad the officer saidnot a sentiment he often expressed thanks mr jenkins danny said quietly now youre no longer on remand said jenkins youre not entitled to a single cell he opened a file which he studied for some time nothing moves quickly in prison he ran his finger down a long column of names stopping at an empty box im going to put you in block three cell number onetwonine he checked the names of the present occupants they should make interesting company he added without explanation before nodding to the young officer standing behind him look sharp cartwright and follow me said the officer danny had never seen before danny followed the officer down a long brick corridor that was painted in a shade of mauve no other establishment would have considered purchasing in bulk they came to a halt at a doublebarred gate the officer selected a large key from the chain that hung around his waist unlocked the first gate and ushered danny through he joined him before locking them both in then unlocking the second gate they now stepped into a corridor whose walls were painted greena sign that they had reached a secure area everything in prison is colorcoded the officer accompanied danny until they reached a second doublebarred gate this process was repeated four more times before danny arrived at block three it wasnt hard to see why no one had ever escaped from belmarsh the color of the walls had turned from mauve to green to blue by the time dannys keeper handed him over to a unit officer who wore the same blue uniform the same white shirt the same black tie and had the inevitable shaven head to prove that he was just as hard as any of the inmates right cartwright said his new minder casually this is going to be your home for at least the next eight years so youd better settle down and get used to it if you dont give us any trouble we wont give you any understood understood guv repeated danny using the title every con gives a screw whose name he doesnt know as danny climbed the iron staircase to the first floor he didnt come across another inmate they were all locked upas they nearly always were sometimes for twentytwo hours a day the new officer checked dannys name on the call sheet and chuckled when he saw which cell he had been allocated mr jenkins obviously has a sense of humor he said as they came to a halt outside cell number yet another key was selected from yet another ring this time one heavy enough to open the lock of a twoinchthick iron door danny stepped inside and the heavy door slammed shut behind him he looked suspiciously at the two inmates who already occupied the cell a heavily built man was lying halfasleep on a single bed facing the wall he didnt even glance up at the new arrival the other man was seated at the small table writing he put down his pen rose from his place and thrust out a hand which took danny by surprise nick moncrieff he said sounding more like an officer than an inmate welcome to your new abode he added with a smile danny cartwright danny replied shaking his hand he looked across at the unoccupied bunk as youre last in you get the top bunk said moncrieff youll have the bottom one in two years time by the way he said pointing to the giant who lay on the other bed thats big al dannys other cellmate looked a few years older than nick big al grunted but still didnt bother to turn around to find out whod joined them big al doesnt say a lot but once you get to know him hes just fine said moncrieff it took me about six months but perhaps youll be more successful danny heard the key turning in the lock and the heavy door was pulled open once again follow me cartwright said a voice danny stepped back out of the cell and followed another officer hed never seen before had the authorities already decided to put him in a different cell he wondered as the screw led him back down the iron staircase along another corridor and through a further set of doublebarred gates before coming to a halt outside a door marked stores the officer gave a firm rap on the little double doors and a moment later they were pulled open from the inside ck cartwright said the officer checking his charge sheet strip off said the stores manager you wont be wearing any of those clothes againhe looked down at the charge sheetuntil he laughed at a joke he cracked about five times a day only the year changed once danny had stripped he was handed two pairs of boxer shorts red and white stripes two shirts blue and white stripes one pair of jeans blue two tshirts white one pullover gray one donkey jacket black two pairs of socks gray one pair of shorts blue gym two singlets white gym two sheets nylon green one blanket gray one pillow case green and one pillow circular solid the one item he was allowed to keep were his trainersa prisoners only opportunity to make a fashion statement the stores manager gathered up all of dannys clothes and dropped them in a large plastic bag filled in the name cartwright ck on a little tag and sealed up the bag he then handed danny a smaller plastic bag which contained a bar of soap a toothbrush a plastic disposable razor one flannel green one hand towel green one plastic plate gray one plastic knife one plastic fork and one plastic spoon he ticked several boxes on a green form before swiveling it around pointing to a line with his forefinger and handing danny a wellbitten biro that was attached to the desk by a chain danny scrawled an illegible squiggle you report back to the stores every thursday afternoon between three and five said the stores manager when youll be given a change of clothes any damage and youll have the requisite sum deducted from your weekly wage and i decide how much that will be he added before slamming the doors closed danny picked up the two plastic bags and followed the officer back down the corridor to his cell he was locked up moments later without a single word having passed between them big al didnt seem to have stirred in his absence and nick was still seated at the tiny table writing danny climbed up onto the top bunk and lay flat on the lumpy mattress while hed been on remand for the past six months hed been allowed to wear his own clothes roam around the ground floor chatting to his fellow inmates watch television play table tennis even buy a coke and sandwich from a vending machinebut no longer now he was a lifer and for the first time he was finding out what losing your freedom really meant danny decided to make up his bed he took his time as he was beginning to discover just how many hours there are in each day how many minutes in each hour and how many seconds in each minute when youre locked up in a cell twelve foot by eight with two strangers to share your spaceone of them large once hed made the bed danny climbed back onto it settled down and stared up at the white ceiling one of the few advantages of being on the top bunk is that your head is opposite the tiny barred window the only proof that there is an outside world danny looked through the iron bars at the other three blocks that made up the spur the exercise yard and several high walls topped with razor wire that stretched as far as the eye could see danny stared back up at the ceiling his thoughts turned to beth he hadnt even been allowed to say goodbye to her next week and for the next thousand weeks hed be locked up in this hellhole his only chance of escape was an appeal mr redmayne had warned him that that might not be heard for at least a year the court lists were overcrowded and the longer your sentence the longer you had to wait before they got around to your appeal surely a year would be more than enough time for mr redmayne to gather all the evidence he needed to prove that danny was innocent moments after mr justice sackville had passed sentence alex redmayne left the courtroom and walked down a carpeted wallpapered corridor that was littered with pictures of former judges he knocked on the door of another judges chambers walked in slumped on a comfortable chair in front of his fathers desk and said simply guilty mr justice redmayne walked across to the drinks cabinet you may as well get used to it he said as he drew out the cork from the bottle hed selected that morning win or lose because i can tell you that since the abolition of capital punishment far more prisoners charged with murder have been convicted and almost without exception the jury gets it right he poured two glasses of wine and handed one to his son will you continue to represent cartwright when his case comes up for appeal he asked before taking a sip from his own glass yes of course i will said alex surprised by his fathers question the old man frowned then all i can say is good luck because if cartwright didnt do it who did spencer craig said alex without hesitation chapter eighteen at five oclock the heavy iron door was pulled open once again accompanied by a raucous bellow of association from a man whose previous occupation could only have been as a guards sergeant major for the next fortyfive minutes all the prisoners were released from their cells they were given two choices as to how they might spend their time they could as big al always did go down to the spacious area on the ground floor there he slumped in front of the television in a large leather chair that no other inmate would have considered occupying while others played dominoes with tobacco as the only stake if on the other hand you were willing to brave the elements you could venture out into the exercise yard danny was thoroughly searched before he stepped out of the block into the yard belmarsh like every other prison was awash with drugs and dealers who would hurriedly ply their trade during the only time in the day that prisoners from all four blocks came into contact with each other the system of payment was simple and accepted by all the addicts if you wanted a fixhash cocaine crack cocaine or heroinyou let the wing dealer know your requirements and the name of the person on the outside who would settle up with his contact once the money had changed hands the goods would appear a day or two later with a hundred remand prisoners being driven in and out of the jail to attend court every morning there were a hundred different opportunities to bring the gear back in some were caught redhanded which resulted in time being added to their sentence but the financial rewards were so high that there were always enough donkeys who considered it a risk worth taking danny had never shown any interest in drugs he didnt even smoke his boxing coach had warned him that he would never be allowed in the ring again if he were caught taking drugs he began to stride around the perimeter of the yard a patch of grass about the size of a football pitch he kept up a fast pace as he knew that this would be his only chance of getting any exercise other than a twiceweekly visit to an overcrowded gym during the day he glanced up at the thirtyfoot wall that circled the exercise yard although it was topped with razor wire that didnt stop him thinking about escape how else would he be able to seek revenge on the four bastards who were responsible for stealing his freedom he passed several other prisoners who were walking at a more leisurely pace no one overtook him he noticed a lone figure striding out in front of him who was keeping roughly the same speed it was some time before he realized that it was nick moncrieff his new cellmate who was clearly as fit as he was what could a guy like him have done to end up behind bars danny wondered he recalled the old prison rule that you never ask another con what hes in for always wait for him to volunteer the information himself danny glanced to his right to see a small group of black prisoners lying barechested on the grass sunbathing as if they were on a package holiday in spain he and beth had spent a fortnight last summer in westonsupermare where they made love for the first time bernie had come along too and every evening he seemed to end up with a different girl who had vanished by the light of day danny hadnt looked at another woman since the day he had seen beth at the garage when beth had told him she was pregnant danny had been surprised and delighted at the news hed even thought about suggesting going straight to the nearest register office and taking out a marriage license but he knew beth wouldnt hear of it and neither would her mother after all they were both roman catholics and therefore they must be married in st marys just as both of their parents had been father michael would have expected nothing less for the first time danny wondered if he should offer to break off the engagement after all no girl could be expected to wait for twentytwo years he decided not to make a decision until after his appeal had been heard beth hadnt stopped crying since the foreman had delivered the jurys verdict they didnt even allow her to kiss danny goodbye before he was taken down to the cells by two officers her mother tried to comfort her on the way home but her father said nothing this nightmare will finally be over once the appeal is heard her mother said dont count on it said mr wilson as he swung the car into bacon road a klaxon proclaimed that the fortyfive minutes set aside for association was over the prisoners were quickly herded back into their cells block by block big al was already slumbering on his bunk by the time danny walked back into the cell nick followed a moment later the door slamming behind him it wouldnt be opened again until teaanother four hours danny climbed back onto the top bunk while nick returned to the plastic chair behind the formica table he was just about to start writing again when danny asked what are you scribblin i keep a diary replied nick of everything that goes on while im in prison why would you want to be reminded of this dump it whiles away the time and as i want to be a teacher when im released its important to keep my mind alert will they let you teach after youve done a stretch in ere asked danny you must have read about the teacher shortage said nick with a grin i dont read a lot admitted danny perhaps this is a good chance to start said nick putting his pen down cant see the point said danny specially if im going to be banged up in ere for the next twentytwo years but at least youd be able to read your solicitors letters which would give you a better chance of preparing your defense when the case comes up for appeal ur yous ever gonnae stop talkin asked big al in a thick glaswegian accent that danny could barely translate not much else to do replied nick with a laugh big al sat up and removed a pouch of tobacco from a pocket in his jeans so whit you in fur cartwright he asked breaking one of prisons golden rules murder said danny he paused but i was stitched up aye thats whit they aw say big al took out a packet of cigarette papers from his other pocket extracted one and laid a pinch of tobacco on top of it maybe said danny but i still didnt do it he didnt notice that nick was writing down his every word what about you he asked me im a fuckin bank robber said big al licking the edge of the paper sometimes i pull it aff and get rich other times i get dinnae the judge gied me fourteen years this fuckin time so how long have you been banged up in belmarsh asked danny two years they transferred me tae an open prison for a while but i decided tae abscond so theyll no be takin that risk again huv yous no got a light i dont smoke said danny and neither do i as you well know added nick continuing to write his journal what a pair of numpties said big al noo ill no be able to huv a drag till efter tea so youll never be moved out of belmarsh asked danny in disbelief not until mah release date said big al wance yeve absconded fae a cat d they send you back tae a highsecurity nick cannae say i blame the fuckers if they transferred me id only try it again he placed the cigarette in his mouth still ive only got three years tae go he said as he lay back down and turned to face the wall what about you danny asked nick how much longer have you got two years four months and eleven days and you twentytwo years said danny unless i win my appeal naebdy wins their appeal said big al wance theyve got ye banged to rights theyre no going tae let you oot so yed better get used tae it he removed the cigarette from his lips before adding or top yersel beth was also lying on her bed staring up at the ceiling she would wait for danny however long it took she had no doubt that he would win his appeal and that her father would finally come around to realizing that both of them had been telling the truth mr redmayne assured her that he would continue to represent danny at the appeal and that she shouldnt worry about the cost danny was right mr redmayne was a real diamond beth had already spent all her savings and forgone her annual holiday so that she could attend every day of the trial what was the point of a holiday if she couldnt spend it with danny her boss could not have been more understanding and told her not to report back until the trial was over if danny was found not guilty mr thomas had told her she could take another fortnight off for the honeymoon but beth would be back at her desk on monday morning and the honeymoon would have to be postponed for at least a year although she had spent her life savings on dannys defense she still intended to send him some cash every month as his prison wages would be only twelve pounds a week do you want a cup of tea luv her mother shouted up from the kitchen tea hollered a voice as the door was unlocked for the second time that day danny picked up his plastic plate and mug and followed a stream of prisoners as they made their way downstairs to join the queue at the hotplate an officer was standing at the front of the queue allowing six prisoners up to the hotplate at any one time more fights break out over food than anything else explained nick as they waited in line other than in the gym said big al eventually danny and nick were told to join four others at the hotplate standing behind the counter were five prisoners dressed in white overalls and white hats wearing thin latex gloves whats the choice tonight asked nick handing over his plate you can ave sausages with beans beef with beans or spam fritters with beans take your choice squire said one of the inmates who was serving behind the counter ill have spam fritters without beans thank you said nick ill ave the same but with beans said danny and who are you asked the server his fuckin brother danny and nick both laughed although they were the same height around the same age and in prison uniform they didnt look unalike neither of them had noticed the similarity after all nick was always cleanshaven with every hair neatly in place while danny only shaved once a week and his hair in big als words looked like a bog brush ow do you get a job workin in the kitchen asked danny as they made their way slowly back up the spiral staircase to the first floor danny was quickly discovering that whenever youre out of your cell you walk slowly you have to be enhanced and how do you get enhanced just make sure youre never put on report said nick ow do you manage that dont swear at an officer always turn up to work on time and never get involved in a fight if you can manage all three in about a years time youll be enhanced but you still wont get a job in the kitchen why not because there ur a thousand other fuckin cons in this prison said big al following behind and nine hundred of thum want tae work in the kitchen yur oot of yer cell for most of the day and ye get the best choice of grub so ye can forget it danny boy in the cell danny ate his meal in silence and thought about how he could become enhanced more quickly as soon as big al had forked the last piece of sausage into his mouth he stood up walked across the cell pulled down his jeans and sat on the lavatory danny stopped eating and nick looked away until big al had pulled the flush big al then stood up zipped his jeans slumped back down on the end of his bunk and began rolling another cigarette danny checked his watch ten to six he usually went around to beths place around six he looked down at the unfinished scraps on his plate beths mum made the best sausage and mash in bow what other jobs are goin asked danny are yous still talking demanded big al nick laughed again as big al lit up his cigarette you could get a job in the stores said nick or become a wing cleaner or a gardener but most likely youll end up on the chain gang the chain gang asked danny whats that youll find out soon enough replied nick what about the gym asked danny ye have tae be enhanced for that said big al inhaling so what job ave you got asked danny you ask too many questions replied big al as he exhaled filling the cell with smoke big al is the hospital orderly said nick that sounds like a cushy number said danny i huv tae polish the floors empty the midgies prepare the morning rota and make tea fur every screw that visits matron i niver stop moving said big al im enhanced arent i very responsible job that said nick smiling you have to have an unblemished record when it comes to drugs and big al doesnt approve of junkies too fuckin right i dont said big al and ill thump anyone who tries tae steal any drugs fae the hospital is there any other job worth considerin asked danny desperately education said nick if you decided to join me you could improve your reading and writing and at the same time you get paid for it true but only eight quid a week chipped in big al ye get twelve fur every other job noo many of us like the squire here cin turn oor noses up at an extra four quid a week baccy money danny placed his head back on the rockhard pillow and stared out of the tiny curtainless window he could hear rap blaring from a nearby cell and wondered if hed be able to get to sleep on the first night of his twentytwoyear sentence chapter nineteen a key turned in the lock and the heavy iron door was pulled open cartwright youre on the chain gang report to the duty officer immediately but began danny no point arguing said nick as the officer disappeared stick with me and ill show you the drill nick and danny joined a stream of silent prisoners who were all heading in the same direction when they reached the end of the corridor nick said this is where you report at eight oclock every morning and sign up for your work detail what the ell is that asked danny staring up at a large hexagonal glass cubicle that dominated the area thats the bubble said nick the screws can always keep an eye on us but we cant see them theres screws in there said danny sure are replied nick about forty im told they have a clear view of everything going on in all four blocks so if a riot or any disturbance breaks out they can move in and deal with the problem within minutes ever been involved in a riot asked danny only once replied nick and it wasnt a pretty sight this is where we part company im off to education and the chain gang is in the opposite direction if you carry on down the green corridor youll end up in the right place danny nodded and followed a group of prisoners who clearly knew where they were going although their sullen looks and the speed at which they were moving suggested that they could think of better ways of spending a saturday morning when danny reached the end of the corridor an officer carrying the inevitable clipboard ushered all the prisoners into a large rectangular room about the size of a basketball court inside were six long formica tables with about twenty plastic chairs lined up on each side of them the chairs quickly filled up with inmates until almost every one was taken where do i sit asked danny wherever you like said an officer it wont make any difference danny found a vacant seat and remained silent as he watched what was going on around him youre new said the man seated on his left ow do you know that because ive been on the chain gang for the past eight years danny took a closer look at the short wiry man whose skin was as white as a sheet he had watery blue eyes and cropped fair hair liam he announced danny you irish asked liam no im a cockney born a few miles away from ere but my grandfather was irish thats good enough for me said liam with a grin so what appens next asked danny you see those cons standing at the end of each table said liam theyre the suppliers theyll put a bucket in front of us you see that stack of plastic bags at the other end of the table theyll be passed down the middle we drop whatevers in our bucket into each one and pass it on as liam was speaking a klaxon sounded brown plastic buckets were placed in front of each prisoner by inmates with yellow armbands dannys bucket was full of teabags he glanced across at liams which contained sachets of butter the plastic bags made their slow progress along the table from prisoner to prisoner and a packet of rice krispies a sachet of butter a teabag and tiny containers of salt pepper and jam were dropped into each one when they reached the end of the table another prisoner stacked them onto a tray and carried them into an adjoining room theyll be sent off to another prison liam explained and end up as some cons breakfast about this time next week danny was bored within a few minutes and would have been suicidal by the end of the morning if liam hadnt provided an endless commentary on everything from how to get yourself enhanced to how to end up in solitary which kept all those within earshot in fits of laughter have i told you about the time the screws found a bottle of guinness in my cell he asked no replied danny dutifully of course i was put on report but in the end they couldnt charge me why not asked danny and although everyone else at the table had heard the tale many times they still paid rapt attention i told the guvnor a screw planted the bottle in my cell because he had it in for me because youre irish suggested danny no id tried that line once too often so i had to come up with something a little more original like what said danny i said the screw had it in for me because i knew that he was gay and he fancied me but id always turned him down and was e gay asked danny several prisoners burst out laughing of course not you muppet said liam but the last thing a guvnor needs is a full investigation into the sexual orientation of one of his screws it only means mountains of paperwork while the screws suspended on full pay its all spelt out in prison regulations so what appened asked danny dropping another teabag into another plastic bag the numberone guvnor dismissed the charge and that screw hasnt been seen on my block since danny laughed for the first time since he had been in prison dont look up whispered liam as a fresh bucket of teabags was placed in front of danny liam waited until the prisoner wearing a yellow armband had removed their empty buckets before he added if you ever come across that bastard make yourself scarce why asked danny glancing across to see a thinfaced man with a shaven head and arms covered in tattoos leave the room carrying a stack of empty buckets his names kevin leach avoid him at all costs said liam hes troublebig trouble what kind of trouble asked danny as leach returned to the far end of the table and started stacking again he came home early from work one afternoon and caught his wife in bed with his best mate after hed knocked em both out he tied em to the bedposts and waited for em to come round then he stabbed em with a kitchen knifeonce every ten minutes he started at their ankles and moved slowly up the body till he reached the eart they reckon it must have been six or seven hours before they died he told the judge he was only tryin to make the bitch realize how much he loved er danny felt sick the judge gave him life with the recommendation that he should never be released he wont see the outside of this place until they carry im out feet first liam paused im ashamed to say hes irish so be careful they cant add another day to is sentence so he doesnt care who he cuts up spencer craig was not a man who suffered from selfdoubt or who panicked under pressure but the same could not be said of lawrence davenport or toby mortimer craig was aware of the rumors circulating around the corridors of the old bailey concerning the evidence he had given during the cartwright trial they were only whispers at the moment but he could not afford for those whispers to become legend he was confident that davenport wouldnt cause any trouble as long as he was playing dr beresford in the prescription after all he adored being adored by millions of fans who watched him every saturday evening at nine oclock not to mention an income that allowed him a lifestyle that neither of his parents a carpark attendant and a lollipop lady from grimsby had ever experienced the fact that the alternative could well be a spell in jail for perjury concentrated the mind somewhat if it didnt craig wouldnt hesitate to remind him what he could look forward to once his fellow cons discovered he was gay toby mortimer presented a different sort of problem hed reached the point where he would do almost anything to get his next fix craig was in no doubt that when tobys inheritance finally dried up he would be the first person his fellow musketeer would turn to only gerald payne remained resolute after all he still hoped to become a member of parliament but the truth was it would be a long time before the musketeers had the same relationship they had enjoyed before geralds thirtieth birthday beth waited on the pavement until she was certain there was no one left on the premises she looked up and down the street before she slipped into the shop beth was surprised at how dark the little room was and it took her a few moments before she recognized a familiar figure seated behind the grille what a pleasant surprise said mr isaacs as beth walked up to the counter what can i do for you i need to pawn something but i want to be sure that i can buy it back im not allowed to sell any item for at least six months said mr isaacs and if you needed a little more time that wouldnt be a problem beth hesitated for a moment before she slipped the ring off her finger and pushed it under the grille are you sure about this asked the pawnbroker i dont have much choice said beth dannys appeal is coming up and i need i could always advance you no said beth that wouldnt be right mr isaacs sighed he picked up an eyeglass and studied the ring for some time before he offered an opinion its a fine piece he said but how much were you expecting to borrow against it five thousand pounds said beth hopefully mr isaacs continued to make a pretense of studying the stone carefully although he had sold the ring to danny for four thousand pounds less than a year ago yes said mr isaacs after further consideration that seems to me to be a fair price he placed the ring under the counter and took out his checkbook can i ask a favor mr isaacs before you sign the check yes of course said the pawnbroker will you allow me to borrow the ring on the first sunday of every month that bad said nick worse if it adnt been for liam the tealeaf i would ave fallen asleep and ended up on report interesting case liam said big al stirring slightly but not bothering to turn around his whole family are tealeaves hes got six brothers and three sisters anwance five o the brothers and two o the sisters wur aw inside at the same time his fucking family must already have cost the taxpayer over a million quid danny laughed then asked big al what do you know about kevin leach big al sat bolt upright dont ever mention that name ootside o this cell hes a nutter hed cut yur throat fur a mars bar and if ye ever cross him he hesitated they hud tae shift him oot of garside nick just because another con gave him a v sign sounds a bit extreme said nick writing down big als every word no efter leach cut aff the two fingers thats what the french did to the english longbowmen at the battle of agincourt said nick looking up how interesting said big al the klaxon sounded and the cell doors were opened to allow them to go down and fetch their supper as nick closed his diary and pushed his chair back danny noticed for the first time that he was wearing a silver chain around his neck theres a rumor circulating the corridors of the old bailey said mr justice redmayne that spencer craig might not have been entirely forthcoming when he gave evidence in the cartwright case i hope its not you whos fanning that particular flame i dont have to alex replied that man has more than enough enemies willing to pump the bellows nevertheless as you are still involved in the case it would be unwise for you to let your views be known among our colleagues at the bar even if hes guilty even if hes the devil incarnate beth wrote her first letter to danny at the end of his first week hoping hed be able to find someone to read it to him she slipped in a tenpound note before sealing the envelope she planned to write once a week as well as visiting him on the first sunday of every month mr redmayne had explained that lifers can only have one visit a month during their first ten years the following morning she dropped the envelope in the post box at the end of bacon road before catching the number into the city dannys name was never mentioned in the wilson household because it only caused her dad to fly off the handle beth touched her stomach and wondered what future a child could possibly hope for who only came into contact with its father once a month while he was in prison she prayed that it would be a girl you need a haircut said big al what do you expect me to do about it said danny ask mr pascoe if i can take next saturday morning off so i can drop into sammys on mile end road and have my usual no necessary said big al jist book yersel in wi louis and whos louis asked danny prison barber said big al he usually gets through about five cons in forty minutes during association but hes so popular ye might huv tae wait for a month before he cin dae ye as yer no going anywhere fur the next twentytwo years that shouldnae be a problem but if ye want tae jump the queue he charges three fags for a bullet hied five for a short back and sides and the squire here he said pointing to nick who was propped up against a pillow on his bunk reading a book has tae hand over ten fags on account of the fact that he still wishes tae look like an officer and a gentleman a short back and sides will suit me just fine said danny but what does he use i dont fancy having my hair cut with a plastic knife and fork nick put down his book louis has all the usual equipmentscissors clippers even a razor how does he get away with that asked danny he disnae said big al a screw hands over the stuff at the beginning of association then collects it before we go back tae oor cells an before ye ask if anything went missing louis would lose his job and every cell wid be searched tiu the screws found it is e any good asked danny before he ended up in here said big al he used tae work in mayfair charging the likes of the squire here fifty quid a hied so how does someone like that end up in the nick asked danny burglary said nick burglary my arse said big al buggery mer like it caught wi his troosers doon on hampstead heath and he wasnae pishin when the polis turned up but if the cons know hes gay said danny how does he survive in a place like this good question said big al in maist nicks when a queer takes a shower the cons take turns to bugger um then tear um apart limb fae fucking limb so what stops them asked danny good barbers arent that easy to come by said nick the squires right said big al oor last barber was in fur grievous and the cons couldnae afford tae relax while he hud a razor in his hand in fact one or two of um ended up wi very long hair chapter twenty two letters for you cartwright mr pascoe the wing officer said as he passed a couple of envelopes across to danny by the way he continued we found a tenpound note attached to one of the letters the moneys been paid into your canteen account but tell your girlfriend that in future she should send a postal order to the governors office and theyll put the money straight into your account the heavy door slammed shut theyve opened my letters said danny looking at the torn envelopes they always do said big al they also listen in on your phone conversations why asked danny hoping to catch anyone involved in a drugs drop and last week they caught some stupid bastard planning a robbery for the day after he was due to be released danny extracted the letter from the smaller of the two envelopes as it was handwritten he assumed it had to be from beth the second letter was typed but this time he couldnt be sure who had sent it he lay silently on his bunk considering the problem for some time before he finally gave in nick can you read my letters to me he asked quietly i can and i will replied nick danny passed across the two letters nick put down his pen unfolded the handwritten letter first and checked the signature on the bottom of the page this ones from beth he said danny nodded dear danny nick read its only been a week but i already miss you so much how could the jury have made such a terrible mistake why didnt they believe me ive filled in the necessary forms and will come and visit you next sunday afternoon which will be the last chance i have to see you before our baby is born i spoke to a woman officer on the phone yesterday and she couldnt have been more helpful your mum and dad are both well and send their love and so does my mother im sure dad will come round given time especially after you win the appeal i miss you so much i love you i love you i love you see you on sunday beth xxx nick glanced up to see danny staring at the ceiling would you like me to read it again no nick unfolded the second letter its from alex redmayne he said most unusual what do you mean asked danny sitting up barristers dont usually write direct to their clients they leave it to the instructing solicitors its marked private and confidential are you sure you want me to know the contents of this letter read it said danny dear danny just a line to bring you up to date on your appeal i have completed all the necessary applications and today received a letter from the lord chancellors office confirming that your name has been entered on the list however there is no way of knowing how long the process will take and i must warn you that it could be anything up to two years i am still following up all leads in the hope that they might produce some fresh evidence and will write again when i have something more tangible to report yours sincerely alex redmayne nick put the two letters back in their envelopes and returned them to danny he picked up his pen and said would you like me to reply to either of them no said danny firmly id like you to teach me to read and write spencer craig was beginning to think it had been unwise to choose the dunlop arms for the musketeers monthly gettogether he had persuaded his fellow members that it would show they had nothing to hide he was already regretting his decision lawrence davenport had made some lame excuse for not attending claiming he had to be at an awards ceremony because hed been nominated for best actor in a soap craig wasnt surprised that toby mortimer hadnt shown uphe was probably lying in a gutter somewhere with a needle sticking out of his arm at least gerald payne made an appearance even if he had turned up late if there had been an agenda for this meeting disbanding the musketeers would probably have been item number one craig emptied the remainder of the first bottle of chablis into paynes glass and ordered another one cheers he said raising his glass payne nodded less than enthusiastically neither spoke for some time do you have any idea when cartwrights appeal is coming up said payne eventually no replied craig i keep an eye on the lists but i cant risk calling the criminal appeal office for obvious reasons the moment i hear anything youll be the first to know are you worried about toby asked payne no hes the least of our problems whenever the appeal does come up you can be sure hell be in no state to give evidence our only problem is larry he gets flakier by the day but the prospect of a spell in jail should keep him in line but what about his sister said payne sarah said craig whats she got to do with it nothing but if she ever found out what actually happened that night she might try to persuade larry that it was his duty to give evidence at the appeal telling them what really took place she is a solicitor after all payne took a sip of his wine didnt you two have a fling at cambridge i wouldnt call it a fling said craig shes not really my typetoo uptight thats not what i heard said payne trying to make light of it what did you hear asked craig defensively that she gave you up because you had some rather strange habits in the bedroom craig didnt comment as he emptied what remained of the second bottle another bottle barman he said the ninetyfive mr craig of course said craig nothing but the best for my friend no need to waste your money on me old fellow said payne craig didnt bother to tell him that it hardly mattered what was on the label because the barman had already decided how much he was going to charge for keeping shtum as he put it big al was snoring which nick had once described in his diary as sounding like a cross between an elephant drinking and a ships foghorn nick somehow managed to sleep through any amount of rap music emanating from the nearby cells but he still hadnt come to terms with big als snoring he lay awake and thought about dannys decision to give up the chain gang and join him at education it hadnt taken him long to realize that while danny might not have had much of a formal education he was brighter than anyone hed taught during the past two years danny was rapacious about his new challenge without having any idea what the word meant he didnt waste a moment always asking questions rarely satisfied with the answers nick had read about teachers who discovered that their pupils were cleverer than they were but he hadnt expected to come across that problem while he was in prison and it wasnt as if danny allowed him to relax at the end of the day no sooner had the cell door been slammed for the night than he was perched on the end of nicks bunk demanding that even more questions were answered and on two subjects maths and sport nick quickly found out that danny already knew far more than he did he had an encyclopedic memory that made it quite unnecessary for nick to look up anything in wisden or the fa handbook and if you mentioned west ham or essex danny was the handbook although he might not have been literate he was clearly numerate and had a grasp for figures that nick knew he could never equal are you awake asked danny breaking into nicks thoughts big als probably preventing anyone in the next three cells from sleeping said nick i was just thinkin that since i signed up for education ive told you a lot about me but i still know almost nothin about you i was just thinking and while i know almost nothing about you youre still dropping the g thinking nothing said danny what do you want to know asked nick for a start how did someone like you end up in prison nick didnt immediately respond dont tell me if you dont want to danny added i was courtmartialed while my regiment was serving with the nato forces in kosovo did you kill someone no but an albanian died and another was injured because of an error of judgment on my part it was dannys turn to remain silent my platoon was ordered to protect a group of serbs who had been charged with ethnic cleansing during my watch a band of albanian guerrillas drove past the compound firing their kalashnikovs in the air to celebrate the serbs capture when a car full of them came dangerously close to the compound i warned their leader to stop firing he ignored me so my staff sergeant fired a few warning shots which resulted in two of them ending up with gunshot wounds later one of them died in hospital so you didnt kill anyone said danny no but i was the officer in charge and you got eight years for that nick didnt comment i once thought about going into the army said danny youd have made a damn good soldier but beth was against it nick smiled said she didnt like the idea of my being overseas half the time when shed be worrying herself sick about my safety ironic really good use of the word ironic said nick how come you dont get no letters any letters i dont receive any letters why dont you receive any letters repeated danny how do you spell receive recieve no said nick try to remember i before e except after creceive there are some exceptions to that rule but i wont bother you with them tonight there was another long silence before nick eventually replied to dannys question ive made no attempt to stay in contact with my family since the court martial and theyve made no effort to get in touch with me even your mum and dad said danny my mother died giving birth to me im sorry is your father still alive as far as i know yes but he was colonel of the same regiment i served in he hasnt spoken to me since the court martial thats a bit rough not really the regiment is his whole life i was meant to follow in his footsteps and end up as the commanding officer not being courtmartialed any brothers or sisters no aunts and uncles one uncle two aunts my fathers younger brother and his wife who live in scotland and another aunt in canada but ive never met her no other relations relatives is a better word relations has a double meaning relatives no the only person ive ever really cared for was my grandfather but he died a few years ago and was your grandfather an army officer too no said nick laughing he was a pirate danny didnt laugh what sort of pirate he sold armaments to the americans during the second world war made a fortuneenough to retire on buy a large estate in scotland and set himself up as a laird a laird clan leader master of all he surveys does that mean youre rich unfortunately not nick replied my father somehow managed to squander most of his inheritance while he was colonel of the regimentmust keep up appearances old boy he used to say whatever was left over went on the upkeep of the estate so youre penniless youre like me no said nick im not like you youre more like my grandfather and you wouldnt have made the same mistake as i did but i ended up in ere with a twentytwoyear sentence in here dont drop the h in here repeated danny but unlike me you shouldnt be in here said nick quietly do you believe that said danny unable to hide his surprise i didnt until i read beths letter and clearly mr redmayne also thinks the jury made the wrong decision whats hanging from the chain round your neck asked danny big al woke with a start grunted climbed out of bed pulled down his boxer shorts and plonked himself on the lavatory once hed pulled the flush danny and nick tried to get to sleep before he started snoring again beth was on a bus when she first felt the pains the baby wasnt due for another three weeks but she knew at once that she would have to get to the nearest hospital somehow if she didnt want her first child to be born on the number help she moaned when the next wave of pain hit her she tried to stand when the bus came to a halt at a traffic light two older women seated in front of her turned around is that what i think it is said the first one no doubt about it said the second you ring the bell and ill get her off the bus nick handed louis ten cigarettes after hed finished brushing off the hair from his shoulders thank you louis said nick as if he were addressing his regular barber at trumpers in curzon street always a pleasure squire said louis as he threw a sheet around his next customer so whats your pleasure young man he asked running his fingers through dannys thick short hair you can cut that out for a start said danny pushing louiss hand away all i want is a short back and sides suit yourself said louis picking up his clippers and studying dannys hair more closely eight minutes later louis put down his scissors and held up a mirror so danny could see the back of his head not bad danny admitted as a voice shouted out back to your cells associations over danny slipped louis five cigarettes as an officer hurried across and joined them so whats it to be then guv short back and sides danny asked looking at mr hagens bald head dont get lippy with me cartwright back to your cell and be smart about it or you might just find yourself on report mr hagen placed the scissors razor clippers brush and an assortment of combs into a box which he then locked and took away see you in a months time said louis as danny hurried back to his cell chapter twentyone romans and c of e bellowed a voice that could be heard from one side of the block to the other danny and nick stood waiting by the door while big al happily snored away abiding by his longheld belief that while youre asleep youre not in prison the heavy key turned in the lock and the door swung open danny and nick joined a stream of prisoners making their way toward the prison chapel do you believe in god asked danny as they walked down the spiral staircase to the ground floor no said nick im an agnostic whats that someone who believes we cant know if theres a god as opposed to an atheist who is certain there isnt one but its still a good excuse to be out of the cell for an hour every sunday morning and in any case i enjoy singing not to mention the fact that the padre gives a damn good sermoneven if he does seem to spend an inordinate amount of time on remorse padre army term for a priest explained nick inordinate excessive longer than necessary what about you do you believe in god used to before all this appened happened said nick happened repeated danny beth and me are roman catholics beth and i are roman catholics you cant say me is a roman catholic beth and i are roman catholics so we know the bible almost off by heart even though i wasnt able to read it is beth still coming this afternoon of course said danny a smile appearing on his face i cant wait to see er her said nick her said danny dutifully dont you ever get fed up with me continually correcting you yes admitted danny but i know it will please beth because she always wanted me to better myself still im lookin forward to the day when i can correct you looking forward looking forward repeated danny as they reached the entrance to the chapel where they waited in line as each prisoner was given a body search before being allowed to enter why bother to search us before we go in asked danny because its one of the few occasions when prisoners from all four blocks can congregate in one place and have a chance to exchange drugs or information congregate get together a church has a congregation spell it demanded danny they reached the front of the line where two officers were carrying out searchesa short woman who was over forty and must have survived on a diet of prison food and a young man who looked as if he spent a lot of time benchpressing most of the prisoners seemed to want to be searched by the woman officer danny and nick strolled into the chapel another large rectangular room but this time filled with long wooden benches that faced an altar displaying a silver cross on the brick wall behind the altar was a huge mural depicting the last supper nick told danny it had been painted by a murderer and that the models for the disciples had all been inmates at the time its not bad said danny just because youre a murderer doesnt mean you cant have other talents said nick dont forget caravaggio i dont think ive met him admitted danny turn to page in your hymn books announced the chaplain and well all sing he who would valiant be ill introduce you to caravaggio as soon as were back in the cell promised nick as the little organ struck up the opening chord as they sang nick couldnt be sure if danny was reading the words or knew them off by heart after years of attending his local church nick looked around the chapel he wasnt surprised that the benches were as packed as a football stand on a saturday afternoon a group of prisoners huddled together in the back row were deep in conversation not even bothering to open their hymn books as they exchanged details of which new arrivals needed drugs theyd already dismissed danny as nomansland even when they fell on their knees they made no pretense of mouthing the lords prayer redemption wasnt on their minds the only time they fell silent was when the chaplain delivered his sermon dave whose name was printed in bold letters on a lapel badge pinned to his cassock turned out to be a good oldfashioned fire and brimstone priest who had chosen murder as his text for the day this drew loud cries of hallelujah from the first three rows mainly populated by boisterous afrocaribbeans who seemed to know a thing or two about the subject dave invited his captive audience to pick up their bibles and turn to the book of genesis then informed them that cain was the first murderer cain was envious of his brothers success he explained so decided to do away with him dave then turned to moses who he claimed killed an egyptian and thought hed got away with it but he hadnt because god had seen him so he was punished for the rest of his life i dont remember that bit said danny nor do i admitted nick i thought moses died peacefully in his bed at the age of one hundred and thirty now i want you all to turn to the second book of samuel continued dave where youll find a king who was a murderer hallelujah cried the first three rows if not in unison yes king david was a murderer said dave he bumped off uriah the hittite because he fancied his wife bathsheba but king david was very cunning because he didnt want to be seen to be responsible for another mans death so he placed uriah in the front line of the next battle to make sure that he was killed but god saw what he was up to and punished him because god sees every murder and will always punish anyone who breaks his commandments hallelujah chorused the first three rows dave ended the service with closing prayers in which the words understanding and forgiveness were repeated again and again he finally blessed his congregation probably one of the largest in london that morning as they filed out of the chapel danny commented theres a big difference between this service and the one i go to at st marys nick raised an eyebrow this lot dont take a collection they were all searched again on the way out and this time three prisoners were pulled over to one side before being marched off down the purple corridor whats that all about asked danny theyre off to segregation explained nick possession of drugs theyll get at least seven days in solitary it cant be worth it said danny they must think so said nick because you can be sure theyll be dealing again the moment theyre released danny was becoming more excited by the minute at the thought of seeing beth for the first time in weeks at two oclock an hour before visits were due to take place danny was pacing up and down the cell he had washed and ironed his shirt pressed his jeans and spent a long time in the shower washing his hair he wondered what beth would be wearing it was as if he were taking her out on a first date how do i look he asked nick frowned that bad its just that just what demanded danny i think beth might have expected you to shave danny looked at himself in the little steel mirror above the washbasin he quickly checked his watch chapter twentytwo another route march down another corridor but this time the line of prisoners was moving a little quicker no inmate wants to miss one second of a visit at the end of this corridor was a large waiting room with a wooden bench fixed to the wall there followed another long wait before prisoners names began to be called out danny spent the time trying to read the notices pinned to the wall there were several about drugs and the consequencesapplying to both prisoners and visitorsof trying to pass anything over during visits another concerned prison policy on bullying and a third was about discriminationa word danny wrestled with and certainly didnt know the meaning of he would have to ask nick when he got back to the cell after the visit it was nearly an hour before the name cartwright was announced over the loudspeaker danny leaped to his feet and followed a screw into a tiny box room where he was told to stand on a small wooden platform legs apart another screwofficerhe had never seen before gave him a body search that was far more rigorous than any hed experienced since being banged upimprisoned big al had warned him that the search would be even more thorough than usual because visitors often tried to transfer drugs money blades knives and even guns to prisoners during visits once the search was over the officer placed a yellow sash around dannys shoulder to identify him as a prisoner not unlike the fluorescent one his mother made him wear when he first learned to ride a bicycle he was then led into the largest room hed been in since arriving at belmarsh he reported to a desk that was raised on a platform about three feet above the floor another officer checked another list and said your visitor is waiting at e seven lines of tables and chairs were set out in long rows marked a to g the prisoners had to sit on red chairs that were bolted to the floor their visitors sat on the other side of a table on green chairs also bolted to the floor making it easier for the security staff to carry out surveillance assisted by several cctv cameras whirring above them as danny walked down the rows he noticed officers were keeping a close eye on both prisoners and visitors from a balcony above he came to a halt when he reached row e and searched for beth at last he saw her sitting on one of the green chairs despite having her photo sellotaped to the cell wall he had forgotten quite how beautiful she was she was carrying a parcel in her arms which surprised him as visitors are not allowed to bring in gifts for prisoners she leaped up the moment she saw him danny quickened his pace although he had been warned several times not to run he threw his arms around her and the parcel let out a cry danny stepped back to see his daughter for the first time shes beautiful he said as he took christy in his arms he looked up at beth im going to get out of here before she ever finds out her father was in jail how are when did they both began to speak at once sorry said danny you go first beth looked surprised why are you speaking so slowly danny sat down on the red chair and began to tell beth about his cellmates as he tucked into a mars bar and drained a can of diet coke that beth had purchased from the canteenluxuries he hadnt experienced since hed been locked up in belmarsh nick is teaching me to read and write he told her and big al is showing me how to survive in prison he waited to see how beth would react how lucky you were to end up in that cell danny hadnt thought about that before and suddenly realized he ought to thank mr jenkins so whats happening back in bacon road he asked touching beths thigh some of the locals are collecting signatures for a petition to have you released and danny cartwright is innocent has been sprayed on the wall outside bow road tube station no ones tried to remove it not even the council danny listened to all of beths news while he munched his way through three mars bars and drank two more diet cokes aware that he wouldnt be allowed to take anything back to his cell once the visit was over he wanted to hold christy but shed fallen asleep in beths arms the sight of his child only made him more determined to learn to read and write he wanted to be able to answer all of mr redmaynes questions so that he would be ready for his appeal and to surprise beth by replying to her letters all visitors must now leave announced a voice over the loudspeaker danny wondered where the shortest hour in his life had gone as he looked up to check the clock on the wall he rose slowly from his seat and took beth in his arms kissing her gently he couldnt help remembering that this was the most common way for visitors to pass drugs to their partners and that the security staff would be watching them closely some prisoners even swallowed the drugs so they wouldnt be discovered when they were searched before returning to their cells goodbye my darling said beth when he eventually released her goodbye said danny sounding desperate oh i nearly forgot he added pulling a piece of paper out of a pocket in his jeans no sooner had he passed the message to her than an officer appeared by his side and grabbed it you cant exchange anything while youre on a visit cartwright but its only began danny no buts its time for you to leave miss danny stood watching as beth walked away carrying his daughter his eyes never left them until they had disappeared out of sight i must get out of here he said out loud the officer unfolded the note and read the first words danny cartwright had ever written to beth it wont be long before were together again the officer looked worried short back and sides asked louis as the next customer took his place in the barbers chair no whispered danny i want you to make my hair look more like your last customers itll cost you said louis how much same as nick ten fags a month danny removed a packet of unopened marlboros from his jeans today and a month in advance said danny if you do the job properly the barber smiled as danny placed the cigarettes back in his pocket louis walked slowly around the chair occasionally stopping to take a closer look before he offered an opinion first thing youll have to do is let your hair grow and wash it two or three times a week he said nick never has a hair out of place and his cut is slightly at the nape of the neck he added as he came to a halt behind him youll also need to shave every day and cut your sideboards a lot higher if you want to look like a gent after another perambulation he added nick parts his hair on the left not the right so thats the first change ill have to make and his hairs a shade lighter than yours but nothing a little lemon juice wont take care of how long will all this take asked danny six months no longer but ill need to see you at least once a month he added im not going anywhere said danny so book me in for the first monday of every month because the job has to be finished by the time my appeal comes up my lawyer seems to think that it matters what you look like when youre in the dock and i want to look like an officer not a criminal shrewd fellow your lawyer said louis throwing a green sheet around danny before picking up his clippers twenty minutes later an almost imperceptible change had begun to take place dont forget said louis as he held up the mirror for his valued customer before brushing a few hairs from his shoulders youll need to shave every morning and shampoo your hair at least twice a week if you hope to pass muster to use one of nicks expressions back to your cells shouted mr hagen the officer looked surprised when he saw an unopened packet of twenty cigarettes pass between the two prisoners found another customer for the alternative service you offer have you louis he asked with a grin danny and louis remained silent funny that cartwright said hagen id never have put you down for a queer chapter twentythree minutes turned into hours hours became days days ended up being weeks in the longest year of dannys life though as beth regularly reminded him it hadnt been entirely wasted in a couple of months time danny would takesit nicks wordsix gcses and his mentor seemed confident that he would pass them all with flying colors beth had asked him which a levels he had signed up for ill have been released long before then he promised her but i still want you to take them she insisted beth and christy had visited danny on the first sunday of every month and lately she could talk of little else but his upcoming appeal even though a date hadnt yet been posted in the court calendar mr redmayne was still searching for fresh evidence because without it he admitted they didnt stand much of a chance danny had recently read a home office report which said that percent of lifers appeals were rejected and the remaining percent ended up with no more than a minor reduction in their sentence he tried not to think about the consequences of failing to win his appeal what would happen to beth and christy if he had to serve another twentyone years beth never raised the subject but danny had already accepted that he couldnt expect all three of them to serve a life sentence in dannys experience lifers fell into two categories those who completely cut themselves off from the outside worldno letters no calls no visitsand those who like a bedridden invalid remain a burden to their families for the rest of their lives he had already decided which course he would take if his appeal was turned down dr beresford killed in car accident read the headline on the front page of the mail on sunday the article went on to tell its readers that lawrence davenports star was on the wane and the producers of the prescription had decided to write him out of the script davenport was to be killed off in a tragic car accident involving a drunkdriver he would be rushed to his own hospital where nurse petal whom he had recently ditched when he discovered she was pregnant would try to save his life but would be unable the phone rang in spencer craigs study he wasnt surprised to find it was gerald payne on the other end of the line have you seen the papers payne asked yes said craig frankly im not surprised the shows ratings have been going west for the past year so theyre obviously looking for some gimmick to give them a boost but if they ditch larry said payne hes not going to find it that easy to get another part we certainly dont want him going back on the bottle i dont think we should be discussing this over the phone gerald lets meet up soon craig opened his diary to find several days were blank he didnt seem to be getting quite as many briefs as he had in the past the arresting officer placed the prisoners few possessions on the counter while the desk sergeant made a note of them in his log book one needle one small packet containing a white substance one match box one spoon one tie and one fivepound note do we have a name or any id asked the desk sergeant no replied the young constable glancing at the helpless figure slumped on the bench in front of him poor bastard he said whats the point of sending him to prison the laws the law my lad our job is to carry it out not to question our masters poor bastard the constable repeated during the long sleepless nights running up to the appeal mr redmaynes advice during the original trial was never far from dannys thoughts if you plead guilty to manslaughter youll only have to serve two years if danny had taken his advice he would be free in twelve months time he tried to concentrate on the essay he was writing on the count of monte cristohis gcse set text perhaps like edmond dantès he would escape but you cant build a tunnel when your cell is on the second floor and he couldnt throw himself into the sea because belmarsh wasnt on an island so unlike dantès unless he won his appeal he had little hope of gaining revenge on his four enemies after nick had read his last essay he had given danny a mark of percent with the comment unlike edmond dantès you wont need to escape because theyll have to release you how well the two of them had come to know each other during the past year in truth they had spent more hours together than he and bernie had ever done some of the new prisoners even assumed they were brothers until danny opened his mouth that was going to take a little longer youre every bit as bright as i am nick kept telling him and when it comes to maths youve become the teacher danny looked up from his essay when he heard the key turning in the lock mr pascoe pulled the door open to allow big al to stroll in regular as clockworkyou must stop using clichés even in your thoughts nick had told himand slumped down on the bed without a word danny continued writing got some news fur ye danny boy said big al once the door had been slammed shut danny put down his pen it was a rare event for big al to initiate a conversation unless it was to ask for a match ever come across a fucker called mortimer dannys heart began to race yes he eventually managed he was in the bar the night bernie was murdered but he never showed up in court well hes shown up here said big al what do you mean exactly whit i said danny boy he reported tae the hospital this efternoon needed some medication danny had learned not to interrupt big al when he was in full flow otherwise he might not speak again for a week checked his file possession of a classa drug two years so ive got a feeling hes gonnae be a regular visitor tae the hospital danny still didnt interrupt his heartbeat was if anything even faster now im no as clever as you or nick but its jist possible he might be able tae supply that new evidence you and yur lawyer have been looking fur youre a diamond danny said a rougher stone perhaps said big al but wake me up when yer mate gets back cause i have a feeling it may be me has got something tae teach you two fur a change spencer craig sat alone nursing a glass of whiskey as he watched lawrence davenports final episode of the prescription nine million viewers joined him as dr beresford with nurse petal clutching on to his hand gasped out his final line you deserve better the episode won the shows largest audience share for over a decade it ended with dr beresfords coffin being lowered into the ground as nurse petal sobbed at the graveside the producers had left no chance of a miraculous recovery whatever the demands of davenport s adoring fans it had been a bad week for craig toby being sent to the same prison as cartwright larry out of work and that morning the date for cartwrights appeal had been posted on the court calendar it was still several months away but what would larrys state of mind be by then especially if toby cracked and in return for a fix was willing to tell anyone who would listen what had really happened that night craig rose from his desk walked across to a filing cabinet he rarely opened and thumbed through an archive of his past cases he extracted the files of seven former clients who had ended up at belmarsh he studied their case histories for over an hour but for the job he had in mind there was only one obvious candidate hes beginning tae blab said big al has he mentioned that night in the dunlop arms asked danny no yet but its early days he wull given time what makes you so confident asked nick because i have something he needs and fair exchange is nae robbery what have you got that he needs that badly asked danny never ask a question that you dont need to know the answer to said nick jumping in canny man yer friend nick said big al so what can i do for you mr craig i believe youll find its what i can do for you i dont think so mr craig ive been banged up in this shithole for the past eight years and during that time i havent heard a dicky bird out of you so dont fuck me about you know i couldnt afford even an hour of your time why dont you just come to the point and tell me what youre doin here craig had carefully checked the interview room for any bugs before kevin leach had been allowed to join him for a legal visit client confidentiality is sacred in english law and if it were ever breached any evidence would automatically be ruled inadmissible in court despite that fact craig still knew he was taking a riskbut the prospect of a long spell in prison locked up with the likes of leach was an even less attractive proposition got everything you need have you asked craig who had rehearsed each line he intended to deliver as if he was in court crossexamining a key witness i get by said leach dont need a lot on twelve pounds a week as a stacker on the chain gang as i said i get by but no one is sending you in any little extras said craig and you havent had a visit for over four years i see you are as well informed as ever mr craig in fact you havent even made a phone call during the past two yearsnot since your aunt maisie died i see you are as wheres all this leading mr craig theres just a possibility that aunt maisie might have left you something in her will now why would she bother to do that because shes got a friend who youre in a position to help what kind of help her friend has a problema craving not to put too fine a point on it and not for chocolate let me guess heroin crack or cocaine right first time said craig and hes in need of a regular supply how regular daily and how much has aunt maisie left me to cover this considerable outlay not to mention the risk of being caught five thousand pounds said craig but just before she died she added a codicil to her will let me guess that it wasnt to be paid all at once just in case you decided to spend it all at once im still listenin she hoped that fifty pounds a week would be enough to make sure her friend wouldnt need to look elsewhere tell her if she makes it a hundred i might just think about it i think i can say on her behalf that she accepts your terms so whats the name of aunt maisies friend toby mortimer always from the outside in said nick its a simple rule to follow danny picked up the plastic spoon and began to scoop up the water that nick had poured into his breakfast bowl no said nick you always tilt a soup bowl away from you and push the spoon in the same direction he demonstrated the movement and never slurp i dont want to hear a sound while youre drinking your soup beth always complained about that said danny me tae said big al not stirring from his bunk and beth is right said nick in some countries its considered a compliment to slurp but not in england he removed the bowl and replaced it with a plastic plate on which he had put a thick slice of bread and a helping of baked beans now i want you to think of the bread as a lamb chop and the baked beans as peas whit are ye using fur gravy asked big al not stirring from his bunk cold bovril said nick danny picked up his plastic knife and fork holding them firmly with the blade and the prongs pointing toward the ceiling try to remember said nick that your knife and fork are not rockets on a launch pad waiting to blast off and unlike rockets they are going to need to refuel whenever they return to earth nick picked up the knife and fork on his side of the table and demonstrated how danny should hold them its not natural was dannys immediate response youll soon get used to it said nick and dont forget that your forefinger should rest along the top dont let the handle stick out between your thumb and forefingeryoure holding a knife not a pen danny adjusted the grip on his knife and fork in imitation of nick but still found the whole experience awkward now i want you to eat the piece of bread as if it were a lamb chop how wid ye like it sir grunted big al medium or rare you will only be asked that question said nick if you order a steak never for a lamb chop danny dug into his slice of bread no said nick cut your meat dont tear it apart and only a small piece at a time danny once again carried out his instructions but then started to cut a second piece of bread while still chewing the first no said nick firmly while youre eating place your knife and fork on the plate and dont pick them up again until youve finished the mouthful once danny had swallowed the piece of bread he scooped up some beans on the end of his fork no no no said nick a fork isnt a shovel just pierce a few peas at a time but it will take forever if i carry on this way said danny and dont speak with your mouth full replied nick big al grunted again but danny ignored him and cut himself another piece of bread put it in his mouth then placed his knife and fork back on the plate good but chew your meat for longer before you swallow it said nick try to remember youre a human being not an animala comment that elicited a loud burp from big al once danny had finished another piece of bread he tried to pierce a couple of beans but they kept escaping he gave up dont lick your knife was all nick had to say but if yed like tae danny boy said big al you cin lick ma arse it was some time before danny was able to finish his meager meal and finally put his knife and fork down on an empty plate once youve finished your meal said nick place your knife and fork together why asked danny because when youre eating in a restaurant the waiter will need to know that youve finished your meal i dont eat in restaurants that often admitted danny then i shall have to be the first person to invite you and beth out for a meal as soon as youve been released and what about me asked big al dont i get invited nick ignored him now its time to move on to dessert pudding asked danny no not pudding dessert repeated nick if you are in a restaurant you only ever order the starter and the main course and not until you have finished them do you ask to see the dessert menu two menus in one restaurant said danny nick smiled as he placed a thinner slice of bread on dannys plate that is an apricot tart he said an im in bed wi cameron diaz said big al this time danny and nick did laugh for dessert said nick you use the small fork however if you order a crème brûlée or ice cream you pick up the small spoon big al suddenly sat bolt upright on his bunk whits the fucking point of aw this he demanded this isnae a restaurant its a prison the only thing danny boys gonnae be eating for the next twenty years is cold turkey and tomorrow said nick ignoring him ill show you how to taste wine after the waiter has poured a small amount into your glass an the day efter that said big al accompanied by a long fart i shall allow you to sip a sample of ma piss a rare vintage that wull remind ye yur in prison and no in the fuckin ritz chapter twentyfour the heavy door of his single cell swung open youve got a parcel leach follow me and look sharp about it leach climbed slowly off his bed strolled out onto the landing and joined the waiting officer thanks for fixin the single cell he grunted as they walked down the corridor you scratch my back and ill scratch yours said hagen he didnt speak again until they reached the stores when he banged loudly on the double doors the stores manager pulled them open and said name brad pitt dont try it on with me leach or i might have to put you on report leach youve got a parcel the stores manager turned around took a box from the shelf behind him and placed it on the counter i see youve already opened it mr webster you know the regulations leach yes i do said leach you are required to open any parcel in my presence so that i can be sure nothing has been removed or planted inside get on with it said webster leach removed the lid from the box to reveal the latest adidas tracksuit smart piece of gear that said webster must have set someone back a few quid leach didnt comment as webster began to unzip the pockets one by one to check for any drugs contraband or cash he found nothing not even the usual fivepound note you can take it away leach he said reluctantly leach picked up the tracksuit and began to walk off hed only managed a couple of paces before the word leach was bellowed after him he turned around and the box muppet webster added leach returned to the counter placed the tracksuit back in the box and tucked it under his arm that will be quite an improvement on your present gear remarked hagen as he accompanied leach back to his cell perhaps i ought to take a closer look since youve never been seen in the gym but on the other hand perhaps i could turn a blind eye leach smiled ill leave your cut in the usual place mr hagen he said as the cell door closed behind him i cant go on living a lie said davenport theatrically dont you understand that weve been responsible for sending an innocent man to jail for the rest of his life once davenport had been written out of his soap opera craig had assumed that it wouldnt be too long before he felt the need for some dramatic gesture after all he had little else to think about while he was resting so what do you intend to do about it asked payne as he lit a cigarette trying to appear unconcerned tell the truth said davenport sounding a little overrehearsed i intend to give evidence at cartwrights appeal and tell them what really happened that night they may not believe me but at least my conscience will be clear if you do that said craig all three of us could end up in prison he paused for the rest of our lives are you sure thats what you want no but its the lesser of two evils and it doesnt concern you that you might end up in a shower being buggered by a couple of eighteenstone lorry drivers said craig davenport didnt respond not to mention the disgrace it will bring on your family added payne you may be out of work now but let me assure you larry if you decide to make an appearance in court it will be your final performance ive had a lot of time to consider the consequences davenport replied haughtily and ive made up my mind have you thought about sarah and the effect this would have on her career asked craig yes i have and when i next see her i intend to tell her exactly what happened that night and i feel confident she will approve of my decision could you do me one small favor larry asked craig for old times sake whats that asked davenport suspiciously just give it a week before you tell your sister davenport hesitated all right a week but not a day longer leach waited until lights out at ten oclock before he climbed off his bunk he picked up a plastic fork from the table and walked across to the lavatory in the corner of the cellthe one place the screws cant see you through the spyhole when they make their hourly rounds to check if you are safely tucked up in bed he pulled off his new tracksuit bottoms and sat on the lavatory lid he gripped the plastic fork firmly in his right hand and began to pick away at the stitching on the middle one of the three white stripes that ran down the length of the leg a laborious process that took forty minutes finally he was able to extract a long waferthin cellophane packet inside was enough fine white powder to satisfy an addict for about a month he smileda rare occurrenceat the thought that there were still another five stripes to unpick they would guarantee his profit as well as hagen s cut mortimer has to be getting the gear from somewhere said big al what makes you say that asked danny he used tae turn up at the hospital every morning without fail doc even got him started on a detox program then one day hes nowhere to be seen which can only mean hes found another source concurred nick not one of the regular suppliers i can tell that said big al ive asked around and come up with nothing danny slumped back down on his bunk succumbing to lifers syndrome dinnae give up on me danny boy hell be back they always come back visits hollered the familiar voice and a moment later the door swung open to allow danny to join those prisoners who had been looking forward to a visit all morning he had hoped to tell beth that hed come up with the fresh evidence mr redmayne so desperately needed to win the appeal now all he had to hope for was big als belief that mortimer would be back in the prison hospital before too long in prison a lifer clings on to hope as a drowning sailor clings on to a drifting log danny clenched his fist as he made his way toward the visits area determined that beth would not suspect even for a moment that anything might be wrong whenever he was with her he never let his guard down despite all he was going through he always needed beth to believe that there was still hope he was surprised when he heard the key turning in the lock because he never had a visitor three officers charged into the cell two of them grabbed him by the shoulders and pulled him off the bed as he fell he grabbed at one of the officers ties it came off in his hand hed forgotten that screws wear clipon ties so they cant be strangled one of them thrust his arms behind his back while another kicked him sharply behind the knee which allowed the third to cuff him as he collapsed on to the stone floor the first screw grabbed him by the hair and yanked his head back in less than thirty seconds he was bound and trussed before being dragged out of his cell and on to the landing what are you fuckin bastards up to he demanded once hed caught his breath youre on your way to segregation leach said the first officer you wont be seeing daylight for another thirty days he added as they dragged him down the spiral staircase his knees banging on every step whats the charge supplying said the second officer as they marched him almost at a jog along a purple corridor no prisoner ever wants to see ive never touched drugs guv and you know it protested leach thats not what supplying means said the third officer once they reached the basement and you know it the four of them came to a halt outside a cell that had no number one of the officers selected a rarely used key while the other two held firmly on to leachs arms once the door was open he was hurled head first into a cell that made his upstairs accommodation seem like a motel a thin horsehair mattress lay in the middle of the stone floor there was a steel washbasin bolted to the wall a steel lavatory without a flush one sheet one blanket no pillow and no mirror by the time you get out leach youll find your monthly income has dried up no one on the top floor believes youve got an aunt maisie the door slammed shut congratulations was beths first word when danny took her in his arms he looked puzzled your six gcses silly she added you passed them all with flying colors just as nick predicted danny smiled that all seemed such a long time ago although it couldnt have been more than a monthan eternity in prisonand in any case hed already kept his promise to beth and signed up for three a levels which subjects did you settle on she asked as if she could read his mind english maths and business studies danny replied but ive come up against a problem beth looked anxious im already better at maths than nick so theyve had to bring in an outside teacher but she can only see me once a week she said beth suspiciously danny laughed miss lovett is over sixty and retired but she knows her stuff she says if i stick at it shell recommend me for a place with the open university mind you if i win my appeal i just wont have time when you win your appeal said beth you must continue with your a levels otherwise miss lovett and nick will have wasted their time but ill be running the garage all day and ive already come up with some ideas for making it more profitable beth went silent whats the matter beth hesitated her father had told her not to raise the subject the garage isnt doing that well at the moment she finally admitted in fact its barely breaking even why asked danny without you and bernie weve started losing business to monty hughes across the road dont worry love said danny all that will change once im out of here in fact i even have plans to take over monty hughess placehe must be over sixtyfive if hes a day beth smiled at dannys optimism does that mean youve come up with the fresh evidence mr redmayne is looking for possibly although i cant say too much at the moment said danny glancing up at the cctv cameras above their heads but one of craigs friends who was in the bar that night has turned up in here he looked up at the officers on the balcony who big al had warned him could lipread i wont mention his name whats he in for asked beth i cant say youll just have to trust me have you told mr redmayne i wrote to him last week i was guarded because the screws open your letters and read every word officers he said correcting himself officers said beth nick says i mustnt get into the habit of using prison slang if im going to start a new life once im out of here so nick obviously believes youre innocent said beth yes he does so does big al and even some of the officers were not alone anymore beth he said taking her hand whens nick due to be released asked beth in five or six months time will you keep in touch with him ill try to but hes off to scotland to teach id like to meet him said beth placing her other hand on dannys cheek hes turned out to be a real mate friend danny said and hes already invited us out to dinner christy tumbled to the ground after trying to take a step toward her father she began crying and danny swept her up in his arms weve been ignoring you havent we little one he said but she didnt stop crying pass her over beth said we seem to have found something nick hasnt been able to teach you no whit id call a coincidence said big al who was glad to have a private word with the captain while danny was taking a shower nick stopped writing not a coincidence leach ends up in segregation and the next morning mortimers back desperate tae see the doctor you think leach was his supplier like i said no whit id call a coincidence nick put down his pen he has the shakes continued big al but that always happens when ye start a detox doc seems tae think this time he really wants tae come aff the stuff anyway well soon find oot if leach is involved how asked nick he gets oot of solitary in a couple of weeks if mortimer stops turning up tae the hospital fur treatment the moment leach is back on the block well know who the supplier is so weve only got another fortnight to gather the evidence we need said nick unless it is a coincidence thats not a risk we can take said nick borrow dannys tape recorder and set up an interview as soon as possible yes sir said big al standing to attention by the side of his bed dae i tell danny aboot this or keep ma mooth shut you tell him everything so he can pass on the information to his barrister in any case three brains are better than two jist how clever is he asked big al as he sat back down on his bunk hes brighter than me admitted nick but dont tell him i said so because with a bit of luck ill be out of this place before he works it out for himself perhaps its time we told him the truth about us not yet said nick firmly letters said the officer two for cartwright and one for you moncrieff he passed the single letter to danny who checked the name on the envelope no im cartwright said danny hes moncrieff the officer frowned and handed the single letter to nick and the other two to danny an im big al said big al fuck off said the officer slamming the door behind him danny began to laugh but then he looked at nick and saw that he had turned ashen he was holding the envelope in his hand and was shaking danny couldnt remember when nick had last received a letter do you want me to read it first he asked nick shook his head unfolded the letter and began to read big al sat up but didnt speak the unusual doesnt happen that often in prison as nick read his eyes began to water he brushed a shirtsleeve across his face then passed the letter across to danny dear sir nicholas i am sorry to have to inform you that your father has passed away he died from heart failure yesterday morning but the doctor assures me that he suffered little or no pain i will with your permission make an application for compassionate leave in order that you can attend the funeral yours sincerely fraser munro solicitor danny looked up to see big al holding nick in his arms his dads died hasnt he was all big al said chapter twentyfive can you take care of this while im away asked nick unfastening the silver chain from around his neck and handing it to danny sure said danny as he studied what looked like a key attached to the chain but why not take it with you lets just say i trust you more than most of the people im going to meet up with later today im flattered said danny putting the chain around his neck no need to be said nick with a smile he looked at his reflection in the small steel mirror that was screwed into the wall above the washbasin his personal possessions had been returned to him at five oclock that morning in a large plastic bag that hadnt been unsealed for four years he would have to leave by six if he was to be in scotland in time for the funeral i cant wait said danny staring at him for what asked nick as he straightened his tie just to be allowed to wear my own clothes again youll be allowed to do that at your appeal and once they overturn the verdict youll never have to put on prison clothes again in fact youll be able to walk straight out of the courtroom a free man especially after they hear ma tape chipped in big al with a grin i think todays the day he was about to explain what he meant when they heard a key turning in the lock it was the first time they had ever seen pascoe and jenkins dressed in civilian clothes follow me moncrieff said pascoe the governor wants a word with you before we set off for edinburgh do give him my best wishes said danny and ask him if hed like to pop in for afternoon tea some time nick laughed at dannys imitation of his accent if you think you can pass yourself off as me why dont you try taking my class this morning are ye talking to me asked big al davenport s phone was ringing but it was some time before he emerged from under the sheets to answer it who the hell is this he mumbled gibson announced the familiar voice of his agent davenport was suddenly awake gibson graham only rang when it meant work davenport prayed it would be a film another television role or perhaps an advertisementthey paid so well even for a voiceover surely his fans would still recognize the dulcet tones of dr beresford ive had an availability inquiry said gibson trying to make it sound as if it was a regular occurrence davenport sat up and held his breath its a revival of the importance of being earnest and they want you to play jack eve bests signed up to play gwendolen four weeks on the road before it opens in the west end the pays not great but it will remind all those producers out there that youre still alive delicately put thought davenport although he didnt warm to the idea he remembered only too well what it was like to spend weeks on the road followed by night after night in the west end not forgetting the halfempty matinees although he had to admit that it was his first serious offer for nearly four months ill think about it he said dont take too long said gibson i know theyve already put a call in to nigel haverss agent to check his availability ill think about it davenport repeated and put the phone down he checked his bedside clock it was ten past ten he groaned and slid back under the sheets pascoe rapped gently on the door before he and jenkins escorted nick into the office good morning moncrieff said the governor looking up from behind his desk good morning mr barton nick replied you realize said barton that although you have been granted compassionate leave in order to attend your fathers funeral you remain a categorya prisoner which means that two officers must accompany you until you return tonight the regulations also state that you should be handcuffed at all times however given the circumstances and in view of the fact that for the past two years you have been an enhanced prisoner and that its only a few months before you are due to be released im going to exercise my prerogative and allow you to be uncuffed once you cross the border that is unless either mr pascoe or mr jenkins has reason to believe you might attempt to escape or commit an offense im sure i dont have to remind you moncrieff that if you were foolish enough to try to take advantage of my decision i would have no choice but to recommend to the parole board that you should not be considered for early release onhe checked nicks filejuly seventeenth but that you should serve your full sentence another four years is that fully understood moncrieff yes thank you governor said nick then there is nothing more for me to say other than to offer my condolences for the loss of your father and to wish you a peaceful day michael barton rose from behind his desk and added may i say that i am only sorry this sad event did not take place after you had been released thank you governor barton nodded and pascoe and jenkins led their charge out the governor frowned when he saw the name of the next prisoner who was due to come in front of him he wasnt looking forward to the encounter during the morning break danny took over nicks duties as the prison librarian reshelving recently returned books and datestamping those that prisoners wished to take out after completing these tasks he picked up a copy of the times from the newspaper shelf and sat down to read it papers were delivered to the prison every morning but could only be read in the library six copies of the sun four of the mirror two of the daily mail and a single copy of the timeswhich danny felt was a fair reflection of the prisoners preferences danny had read the times every day for the past year and was now familiar with its layout unlike nick he still couldnt complete the crossword although he spent as much time reading the business section as he did the sports pages but today would be different he leafed through the paper until he came to a section that he had not troubled himself with in the past the obituary of sir angus moncrieff bt mc obe warranted half a page even if it was the bottom half danny read the details of sir anguss life from his days at loretto school followed by sandhurst from where he graduated and took up a commission as a second lieutenant with the cameron highlanders after winning the mc in korea sir angus had gone on to become colonel of the regiment in when he was awarded the obe the final paragraph reported that his wife had died in and that the title now passed to their only son nicholas alexander moncrieff danny picked up the concise oxford dictionary that was never far from his side and turned to the back to look up the meaning of the letters bt mc and obe he smiled at the thought of telling big al that they were now sharing a cell with an hereditary knight sir nicholas moncrieff bt big al already knew see you later nick said a voice but the prisoner had already left the library before danny could correct his mistake danny played with the key on the end of the silver chain wishing like malvolio that he could be someone he wasnt it reminded him that his essay on twelfth night had to be handed in by the end of the week he thought about the mistake his fellow prisoner had made and wondered if he could get away with it when he came face to face with nicks class he folded the times and placed it back on the shelf then crossed the corridor to the education department nicks group were already sitting behind their desks waiting for him and clearly none of them had been told that their usual teacher was on his way to scotland to attend his fathers funeral danny marched boldly into the room and smiled at the dozen expectant faces he unbuttoned his blue and white striped shirt to ensure that the silver chain was even more prominent open your books to page nine danny said hoping he sounded like nick youll see a set of animal pictures on one side of the page and a list of names on the other all i want you to do is to match up the pictures with the names you have two minutes i cant find page nine said one of the prisoners danny walked across to help him just as an officer strolled into the room a puzzled expression appeared on his face moncrieff danny looked up i thought you were on compassionate leave he said checking his clipboard youre quite right mr roberts said danny nicks at his fathers funeral in scotland and he asked me to take over his reading class this morning roberts looked even more puzzled are you taking the piss cartwright no mr roberts then get yourself back to the library before i put you on report danny quickly left the room and returned to his desk in the library he tried not to laugh but it was some time before he could concentrate enough to continue his essay on his favorite shakespeare comedy nicks train pulled into waverley station a few minutes after twelve a police car was waiting to drive them the fifty miles from edinburgh to dunbroath as they pulled away from the curb pascoe checked his watch we should have plenty of time the service doesnt start until two nick looked out of the car window as the city gave way to open country he felt a freedom he hadnt experienced in years he had forgotten how beautiful scotland was with its harsh greens and browns and almost purple sky nearly four years in belmarsh with only a view of high brick walls topped with razor wire tends to dim the memory he tried to compose his thoughts before they reached the parish church in which hed been christened and his father would be buried pascoe had agreed that after the service was over he could spend an hour with fraser munro the family solicitor who had made the application for his compassionate leave and who nick suspected had also put in a plea for minimum security and certainly no handcuffs once they had crossed the border the police car drew up outside the church fifteen minutes before the service was due to begin an elderly gentleman whom nick remembered from his youth stepped forward as the policeman opened the back door he wore a black tailcoat wing collar and a black silk tie he looked more like an undertaker than a solicitor he raised his hat and gave a slight bow nick shook hands with him and smiled good afternoon mr munro he said its nice to see you again good afternoon sir nicholas he replied welcome home leach although you have been provisionally released from segregation let me remind you that it is only provisional said the governor should you cause even the slightest disruption now that youre back on the wing i dont want you to be in any doubt that you will be returned to closed conditions without recourse to me recourse to you sneered leach as he stood in front of the governors desk with an officer on either side of him are you questioning my authority asked the governor because if you are no i am not sir said leach sarcastically just your knowledge of the prison act i was thrown into segregation before being placed on report a governor is allowed to carry out such an action without resorting to report if he has reason to believe that there is a prima facie case of i want to put in an immediate request to see my lawyer said leach coolly ill note your request responded barton trying to remain composed and who is your lawyer mr spencer craig leach replied barton wrote the name down on the pad in front of him i will be requesting that he makes a formal complaint against you and three members of your staff are you threatening me leach no sir just making sure its on the record that i have made a formal complaint barton could no longer hide his exasperation and nodded curtly his sign that the officers should remove the prisoner from his sight immediately danny wanted to tell nick the good news but he knew that he wouldnt return from scotland until after midnight alex redmayne had written to confirm that the date of his appeal had been set for may st only two weeks away mr redmayne also wanted to know if danny wished to attend the hearing remembering that he had not given evidence in his original trial hed written back immediately confirming that he wanted to be present he had also written to beth he would have liked her to be the first to learn that mortimer had made a full confession and big al had recorded every word of it on dannys tape recorder the tape was now secreted inside his mattress and he would hand it over to mr redmayne during his next legal visit danny wanted to let beth know they now had the evidence they needed but he couldnt risk putting anything in writing big al didnt try to hide the fact that he was pleased with himself and even offered to appear as a witness it looked as if nick had been right danny was going to be released before he was chapter twentysix the church warden was waiting for sir nicholas in the vestry he gave a slight bow before accompanying the new head of the family down the aisle to the front pew on the righthand side pascoe and jenkins took their places in the row behind nick turned to his left where the rest of the family were seated in the first three rows on the other side of the aisle not one of them even glanced in his direction they were all clearly under his uncle hugos instructions to ignore him that didnt stop mr munro joining nick in the front row the organ struck up and the local parish priest accompanied by the regimental chaplain led the choir down the aisle to the words of the lord is my shepherd the trebles filed into the front row of the choir stalls followed by the tenors and basses a few moments later a coffin was borne in on the shoulders of six squaddies from the cameron highlanders then placed gently on a bier in front of the altar all the colonels favorite hymns were sung lustily during the service ending with the day thou gavest lord is ended nick bowed his head in prayer for a man who did believe in god queen and country when the vicar delivered his eulogy nick recalled one of his fathers expressions which he invariably repeated whenever they had attended a regimental funeral in the pastthe padre did him proud once the chaplain had offered closing prayers and the priest had administered the final blessing the congregation of family friends representatives of the regiment and locals gathered in the churchyard to witness the burial for the first time nick noticed the massive figure of a man who must have weighed more than twentyfive stone and who didnt look at home in scotland he smiled nick returned his smile and tried to recall when they had last met then he remembered washington dc the opening of an exhibition at the smithsonian to celebrate his grandfathers eightieth birthday when his fabled stamp collection had been put on display to the public but nick still couldnt recall the mans name after the coffin had been lowered into the grave and the final rites administered the moncrieff clan departed without a single member offering their condolences to the deceaseds son and heir one or two of the locals whose livelihoods did not depend on his uncle hugo walked across and shook hands with nick while the senior officer representing the regiment stood to attention and saluted nick raised his hat in acknowledgment as he turned to leave the graveside nick saw fraser munro talking to jenkins and pascoe munro came across to him theyve agreed that you can spend an hour with me to discuss family matters but theyll not allow you to accompany me back to the office in my car i understand nick thanked the chaplain and then climbed into the back of the police car a moment later pascoe and jenkins took their places on either side of him as the car moved off nick looked out of the window to see the large man lighting a cigar hunsacker said nick out loud gene hunsacker why did you want to see me demanded craig ive run out of gear said leach but i supplied you with enough to last six months not after a bent screws taken his cut then youd better visit the library why would i go to the library mr craig take out the latest copy of the law review the leatherbound edition and youll find everything you need taped to the inside of the spine craig closed his briefcase stood up and headed toward the door it wont be a moment too soon said leach not moving from his seat what do you mean asked craig as he touched the door handle aunt maisies friend has signed up for a detox program then youll have to wean him off it wont you that may not solve your problem said leach calmly craig walked slowly back to the table but didnt sit down what are you getting at a little bird tells me that aunt maisies friend has started singing like a canary then shut him up spat out craig it may be too late for that stop playing games leach and tell me what youre getting at im told theres a tape craig collapsed into the chair and stared across the table and whats on this tape he asked quietly a full confession with names dates and places leach paused aware that he now had craigs undivided attention it was when i was told the names that i felt i ought to consult my lawyer craig didnt speak for some time do you think you can get your hands on the tape he eventually asked at a cost how much ten grand thats a bit steep bent screws dont come cheap said leach in any case i bet aunt maisie doesnt have a plan b so she hasnt got much choice craig nodded all right but theres a time limit if its not in my possession before may thirtyfirst you wont get paid no prizes for guessing whose appeal will be coming up that day said leach with a smirk your father made a will which this firm executed said munro tapping his fingers on the desk it was witnessed by a justice of the peace and i have to advise you that however you feel about its contents you would be unwise to dispute it it would not have crossed my mind to oppose my fathers wishes said nick i think that is a sensible decision sir nicholas if i may say so however you are entitled to know the details of the will as time is against us allow me to paraphrase he coughed the bulk of your fathers estate has been left to his brother mr hugo moncrieff with smaller gifts and annuities to be distributed among other members of the family the regiment and some local charities he has left nothing to you except the title which of course was not his to dispose of be assured mr munro this does not come as a surprise im relieved to hear that sir nicholas however your grandfather a shrewd and practical man who incidentally my father had the privilege of representing made certain provisions in his will of which you are now the sole beneficiary your father made an application to have that will rescinded but the courts rejected his claim munro smiled as he rummaged around among the papers on his desk until he found what he wanted he held it up in triumph and declared your grandfathers will i will only acquaint you with the relevant clause he turned over several pages ah heres what im looking for he placed a pair of halfmoon spectacles on the end of his nose and read slowly i leave my estate in scotland known as dunbroathy hall as well as my london residence in the boltons to my grandson nicholas alexander moncrieff presently serving with his regiment in kosovo however my son angus will be allowed full and free use of both of these properties until his demise when they will come into the possession of the aforementioned grandson munro placed the will back on his desk in normal circumstances he said this would have guaranteed you a vast inheritance but unfortunately i have to inform you that your father took advantage of the words full and free use and borrowed heavily against both properties up until a few months before his death in the case of the dunbroathy estate he secured a sum of once again munro put on his halfmoon spectacles in order that he could check the figureone million pounds and for the boltons a little over a million in accordance with your fathers will once probate has been agreed that money will pass directly to your uncle hugo so despite my grandfathers best intentions said nick ive still ended up with nothing not necessarily said munro because i believe you have a legitimate case against your uncle to retrieve the money he procured by this little subterfuge nevertheless if those were my fathers wishes i will not go against them said nick i think you should reconsider your position sir nicholas said munro once again tapping his fingers on the desk after all a large sum of money is at stake and im confident you may well be right mr munro but i will not call my fathers judgment into question munro removed his glasses and reluctantly said so be it i also have to report he continued that i have been in correspondence with your uncle hugo moncrieff who is well aware of your present circumstances and has offered to take both properties off your hands and with them the responsibility for both mortgages he has also agreed to cover any expenses including legal costs associated with the transactions do you represent my uncle hugo nick asked no i do not said munro firmly i advised your father against taking out a mortgage on either of the two properties in fact i told him that i considered it to be against the spirit of the law if not the letter to conduct such transactions without your prior knowledge or approval munro coughed he did not heed my advice and indeed decided to take his custom elsewhere in that case mr munro may i inquire if you would be willing to represent me i am flattered that you should ask sir nicholas and let me assure you that this firm would be proud to continue its long association with the moncrieff family remembering all my circumstances mr munro how would you advise me to proceed munro gave a slight bow anticipating the possibility that you might seek my counsel i have on your behalf set in motion a train of inquiries nick smiled as the glasses returned to the nose of the aging advocate i am advised that the price of a house in the boltons is currently around three million pounds and my brother who is a local councillor tells me that your uncle hugo has recently made inquiries at the town hall as to whether planning permission might be granted for a development on the dunbroathy estate despite the fact that i believe your grandfather hoped you would eventually hand over the estate to the national trust for scotland yes he said as much to me said nick i made a note of the conversation in my diary at the time that will not prevent your uncle from going ahead with his plans and with that in mind i inquired of a cousin who is a partner in a local estate agent what the councils attitude might be to such a planning application he informs me that under the latest planning provisions in the local government act any part of the estate that currently has buildings on it including the house any barns outbuildings or stables would be likely to receive provisional planning permission he tells me that this could amount to as much as twelve acres he also informed me that the council are looking for land on which to build affordable flats or a retirement home and they might even consider an application for an hotel munro removed his glasses you could have discovered all this information by reading the minutes of the councils planning committee which are lodged in the local library on the last day of every month was your cousin able to put a value on the estate asked nick not officially but he said that similar pockets of land are currently trading at around two hundred and fifty thousand pounds per acre making the estate worth around three million suggested nick i suspect nearer four and a half if you include the twelve thousand acres of rural land but and there is always a but when your uncle hugo is involved you must not forget that the estate and the london property are now encumbered with large mortgages which have to be serviced every quarter day nick anticipated the opening of another file and he wasnt disappointed the house in the boltons has outgoings including rates service charge and mortgage of around three thousand four hundred pounds a month and there are another two thousand nine hundred pounds a month on the dunbroathy estate making in all an outlay of approximately seventyfive thousand pounds a year it is my duty to warn you sir nicholas that should either of these payments fall in arrears by more than three months the mortgage companies concerned are entitled to place the properties on the market for immediate disposal were that to happen i am sure they would find a willing buyer in your uncle and i must tell you munro that my current income as a prison librarian is twelve pounds a week is that so said munro making a note such a sum would not make a very large dent in seventyfive thousand pounds he suggested revealing a rare flash of humor perhaps in the circumstances we might resort to another of your cousins suggested nick unable to mask a smile sadly not replied munro however my sister is married to the manager of the local branch of the royal bank of scotland and he has assured me that he can see no problem in servicing the payments if you were willing to lodge a second charge on both properties with the bank you have been most solicitous on my behalf said nick and i am indeed grateful i must confess said munro and you will understand that what i am about to say is off the record that although i had great admiration indeed affection for your grandfather and was happy to represent your father i have never felt quite the same confidence when it came to your uncle hugo who is there was a knock on the door come in said munro pascoe put his head around the door i apologize for interrupting you mr munro but we have to leave in a few minutes if were to catch the train back to london thank you said munro i shall be as expeditious as possible he did not speak again until pascoe had closed the door behind him i fear that despite our brief acquaintance sir nicholas you are going to have to trust me said munro placing several documents on the table in front of him i will have to ask you to sign these agreements although you do not have the time to consider them in detail however if i am to proceed while you complete he coughed my sentence said nick quite so sir nicholas said the solicitor as he removed a fountain pen from his pocket and passed it to his client i also have a document of my own that i wish you to witness said nick he took out several pieces of lined prison paper from an inside pocket and passed them across to his solicitor chapter twentyseven lawr ence davenport took three curtain calls on the night the importance of being earnest opened at the theatre royal in brighton he didnt seem to notice that the rest of the cast were on stage with him during rehearsals he had phoned his sister and invited her to join him for dinner after the show hows it going sarah had asked just fine he replied but thats not the real reason i want you to come down i need to discuss an important decision ive come to that will affect you indeed the whole family by the time he put the phone down he was even more determined he was going to stand up to spencer craig for the first time in his life whatever the consequences he knew he wouldnt be able to go through with it without sarahs support especially remembering her past relationship with craig rehearsals had been tiresome in a play theres no second or third take should you forget a line or walk on stage at the wrong time davenport even began to wonder how he could hope to shine playing alongside actors who regularly appeared in the west end but the moment the curtain rose on the first night it was clear that the theater was full of dr beresfords fans who hung on lawrences every word laughed at his least amusing lines and applauded every bit of business in which he was involved when sarah dropped into his dressing room to wish him luck before the curtain went up he reminded her that he had something of great importance to discuss over dinner she thought he looked pale and a little tired but put it down to firstnight nerves see you after the show she said break a leg when the curtain finally fell davenport knew he couldnt go through with it he felt that he was back where he belonged he tried to convince himself that he had a duty to take other people into consideration not least his sister after all why should her career be harmed because of spencer craig davenport returned to his dressing room to find it full of friends and admirers toasting his good healthalways the first sign of a hit he basked in the praise heaped upon him and tried to forget all about danny cartwright who was after all nothing more than an east end thug who was probably best locked up in any case sarah sat in the corner of the room delighted by her brothers success but wondering what he needed to discuss with her that was of such great importance nick was surprised to find danny still awake when the cell door was opened by pascoe just after midnight although he was exhausted after the days events and his long journey back to london he was pleased to have someone to share his news with danny listened attentively to all that had taken place in scotland big al lay facing the wall and didnt speak you would have been so much better at handling munro than i was said nick to begin with i doubt if you would have allowed my uncle to get away with stealing all that money he was about to go into more detail about the meeting with his solicitor when he suddenly stopped and asked what are you looking so pleased about danny climbed off the bunk slipped a hand under his pillow and extracted a small cassette tape he put it in his cassette player and pressed play whits yer name inquired a man with a thick glaswegian accent toby toby mortimer responded a voice that had clearly been raised in a different environment so how did ye end up in here possession class a the worst heroin i used to need the stuff twice a day then ye must be pleased we got ye on a detox program its not proving that easy said toby and whit aboot that load of shite ye told me yisterday wis i expected tae believe aw that its all true every word i just needed you to understand why i dropped out of the program i saw my friend stab a man and i should have told the police why didnt ye because spencer told me to keep my mouth shut spencer my friend spencer craig hes a barrister an you expect me tae believe that a barrister knifed someone hed never met before it wasnt as simple as that i bet the polis thought it wis as simple as that yes they did all they had to do was choose between a lad from the east end and a barrister who had three witnesses to say he wasnt even there the tape was silent for several seconds before the same voice said but i was there so whit really happened it was geralds thirtieth birthday and wed all had a bit too much to drink thats when the three of them walked in three of them two men and a girl it was the girl who was the problem wis it the girl who started the fight no no craig fancied the girl the moment he set eyes on her but she wasnt interested which really pissed him off so hur boyfriend started the fight no the girl made it obvious that she wanted to leave so they slipped out the back door intae an alley how did you know that asked a surprisedsounding voice ye told me yisterday said big al recovering from his mistake oh yes another long silence spencer and gerald ran round to the back of the pub the moment they left so larry and i went along for the ride but then it got out of control who wis tae blame fur that spencer and gerald they wanted to pick a fight with the two yobs and assumed wed back them up but i was too spaced out to be of any use and larry doesnt go in for that sort of thing larry larry davenport the soap star said big al trying to sound surprised yes but he and i just stood around and watched when the fight broke out so it wis yer friend spencer who wis looking fur a fight yes hes always fancied himself as a boxer got a blue at cambridge but those two lads were in a different class that was until spencer pulled out the knife spencer had a knife yes he picked it up from the bar before he went into the alley i remember him saying just in case an hed nae seen the two men or the girl before no but he still fancied his chances with the girl until cartwright got the better of him thats when spencer lost his temper and stabbed him in the leg but he didnae kill him no just stabbed him in the leg and while cartwright was nursing his wound spencer stabbed the other guy in the chest it was some time before the voice said and killed him did ye call the polis no spencer must have done that later after he told us all to go home he said that if anyone asked any questions we were to say wed never left the bar and didnt see anything and did anyone ask any questions the police came round to my place the next morning i hadnt slept but i didnt let on i think i was more frightened of craig than the police but it didnt matter anyway because the detective in charge of the investigation was convinced hed arrested the right man the tape ran for several more seconds before mortimers voice added that was over two years ago and not a day goes by when i dont think about that lad ive already warned spencer that as soon as im fit enough to give evidence the tape went dead well done exclaimed nick but big al only grunted he had stuck to the script danny had written for him which covered all the points mr redmayne needed for the appeal i still have to get the tape to mr redmayne somehow said danny as he removed it from the cassette player and tucked it under his pillow that shouldnt prove too difficult said nick send it in a sealed envelope marked legal no officer would dare to open it unless they were convinced the lawyer was dealing in money or drugs directly with an inmate and no barrister would be stupid enough to take that sort of risk unless that inmate hud a screw working on the inside said big al who jist happened tae find oot aboot the tape but thats not possible said danny not while were the only three who know about it dont forget mortimer said big al finally deciding it was time to sit up an hes no capable of keeping his mooth shut especially when he needs a hit so what should i do with the tape said danny because i have no chance of winning my appeal without it dinnae risk sending it by post said big al make an appointment tae see redmayne and then hand it over in person cause who dae ye think jist happened to huv a meeting wi his lawyer yisterday nick and danny didnt speak as they waited for big al to answer his own question that bastard leach he eventually said that could just be a coincidence said nick no when that lawyer is spencer craig how can you be so sure it was spencer craig asked danny gripping the railing on the side of his bunk screws drop in and oot of the hospital to huv a chat wi sister and im the wan who his tae brew their cuppa if a bent screw were to find out about that tape said nick there would be no prizes for guessing whose desk it would end up on so what am i meant to do about that said danny sounding desperate make sure it does end up on his desk said nick are you booked in for a consultation not exactly so are you here to seek legal advice not exactly then what are you here for exactly asked spencer craig i require aid but not of the legal variety what kind of aid do you have in mind asked craig ive spotted a rare opportunity to get my hands on a large shipment of wine but theres a problem a problem repeated craig they require a down payment how much ten thousand pounds ill need a few days to think about it im sure you will mr craig but dont take too long because i have another interested party whos hoping ill be able to answer a few questions this time around the barman of the dunlop arms paused before adding i promised to let him know before may thirtyfirst they all heard the key turning in the lock which took them by surprise as it was still another hour before association when the cell door was pulled open hagen was standing in the doorway cell search he said you three in the corridor nick danny and big al made their way out onto the landing and were even more surprised when hagen marched into their cell and pulled the door closed behind him the surprise was not that a screw was carrying out a pad search they were common enoughofficers were always on the lookout for drugs drink knives and even guns but whenever a cell search had taken place in the past there were always three officers present and the cell door was left wide open so that prisoners couldnt claim something had been planted a few moments later the door swung open and hagen reappeared unable to hide the grin on his face ok lads he said youre clean danny was surprised to see leach in the library because hed never taken out a book before perhaps he wanted to read a paper he was roaming up and down the shelves looking lost can i help ventured danny i want the latest copy of the law review youre in luck said danny we only had an outofdate one until a few days ago when someone donated several books to the library including the latest edition of the law review so hand it over leach demanded danny walked across to the legal section removed a thick leatherbound book from the shelf and brought it back to the counter name and number i dont have to tell you nothin youll have to tell me your name if you want to take out a book because otherwise i cant make out a library card leach he snarled danny made out a new library card he hoped leach hadnt noticed his hand was trembling sign on the bottom line leach put a cross on the place where danny was pointing youll have to return the book within three days danny explained who do you think you are a fuckin screw ill bring it back when i feel like it danny watched as leach grabbed the book and walked out of the library without saying another word he was puzzled if leach couldnt sign his name chapter twentyeight craig left his black porsche in the visitors car park an hour before they were due to see toby he had already warned gerald that it was almost as difficult to get into belmarsh prison as it was to get out an endless ratrun of barred gates doublechecking of credentials and thorough body searches and that was before you even reached the reception area once they had given their names in at the desk craig and payne were handed a numbered key and told to place any valuables including watches rings necklaces and any notes or loose change in a locker if they wished to buy any items from the canteen on behalf of a prisoner they had to hand over the correct amount of money in exchange for small plastic tokens marked p p p so that cash could not be passed to an inmate each visitors name was called separately and before being allowed to enter the secure area they were subjected to a further search on this occasion by an officer assisted by a sniffer dog numbers one and two said a voice over the loudspeaker craig and payne sat in a corner of the waiting room with only copies of prison news and lock and key to help while away the time as they waited for their numbers to be called numbers seventeen and eighteen said the voice some forty minutes later craig and payne rose from their places and made their way through another set of barred gates to face an even more rigorous security search before they were allowed to enter the visits area where they were told to take their seats in row g numbers and craig sat down on a green chair that was bolted to the floor while payne went off to the canteen to buy three cups of tea and a couple of mars bars in exchange for his prison tokens when he rejoined craig he placed the tray on a table that was also bolted to the floor and sat down on another immovable seat how much longer will we have to wait he asked some time yet i suspect replied craig the prisoners are only let in one by one and i expect theyre being searched even more thoroughly than we were dont look round whispered beth but craig and payne are sitting three or four rows behind you they must be visiting someone danny began to shiver but resisted looking around it has to be mortimer he said but theyre too late too late for what asked beth danny took her hand i cant say too much at the moment but alex will be able to brief you when you next see him its alex now is it said beth smiling so are you two on firstname terms danny laughed only behind his back youre such a coward said beth mr redmayne always refers to you as danny and he even told me how pleased he was that youd started shaving regularly and grown your hair longer he thinks it just might make a difference when it comes to the appeal hows the garage coming along asked danny changing the subject dads slowing down a bit said beth i wish i could convince him to give up smoking he never stops coughing but he wont listen to anything mum or i have to say on the subject so who has he made manager trevor sutton trevor sutton he couldnt run a whelk stall no one else seemed to want the job said beth then youd better keep a close eye on the books said danny why you dont think trevor is on the fiddle no but only because he cant add up but what can i do about it said beth dad never confides in me and frankly im pretty overworked myself at the moment mr thomas driving you hard is he asked danny with a grin beth laughed mr thomas is a terrific boss and you know it dont forget how kind he was during the trial and hes just given me another pay rise i dont doubt hes a good chap said danny but a good chap laughed beth blame nick said danny unconsciously running a hand through his hair if you go on like this said beth you wont be able to mix with your old mates when youre released but you do realize said danny ignoring her comment that mr thomas fancies you you must be joking said beth he always behaves like the perfect gentleman that doesnt stop him fancying you how does anyone ever manage to get drugs into a place as well protected as this asked payne looking up at the cctv cameras and the prison officers on the balcony peering down at them through binoculars the carriers are getting more and more sophisticated said craig childrens nappies wigssome even put the gear in condoms and then stuff them up their backside knowing not many officers enjoy searching around in there while others even swallow the stuff theyre so desperate and if the packet breaks open inside them they can die a horrible death i once had a client who could swallow a small packet of heroin hold it in his throat and then cough it up when he got back to his cell you might consider that one hell of a risk but imagine being on twelve pounds a week when you can sell a packet like that for five hundred poundsthey obviously think its worth it the only reason why we were put through such a rigorous search is because of what tobys in for if toby takes much longer our time will be up before he even makes an appearance said payne looking down at a cup of tea that had gone cold sorry to disturb you sir an officer was standing by craigs side im afraid mortimer has been taken ill and wont be able to join you this afternoon bloody inconsiderate said craig as he rose from his place the least he could have done was to let us know typical bang up everyone back in your cells immediately and i mean immediately bellowed a voice whistles were blowing klaxons were blaring and officers appeared from every corridor and began herding any stray prisoners back into their cells but i have to report to education protested danny as the cell door was slammed in his face no today danny boy said big al lighting a cigarette what was that all about asked nick it could be wan ay many things said big al inhaling deeply like what asked danny a fight couldae broken oot on another wing which the screws think might spread someone could even huv attacked a screwgod help the bastard or a dealer might have been caught handin over some gear or a prisoner couldae torched his cell ma bet he offered but not before hed exhaled a large cloud of smoke is that someones gone and topped himself he flicked the ash from the end of his cigarette onto the floor ye cin take your choice because only wan things fur certainwe willnae be opened up again for at least another twentyfour hours until its been sorted big al turned out to be right it was twentyseven hours before they heard a key turning in the lock what was that all about nick asked the officer who opened their cell door no idea came back the regulation response someones topped himself said a voice from the next cell poor bastard must have discovered it was the only way out of this place anyone we know asked another a druggie said another voice only been with us for a few weeks gerald payne asked the man at the porters lodge in inner temple to direct him to mr spencer craigs chambers far corner of the square sir number six came back the reply youll find his office on the top floor payne hurried across the square keeping to the path obeying the notices that firmly announced keep off the grass he had left his office in mayfair as soon as craig had phoned to say if you come to my chambers around four you wont be suffering any more sleepless nights when payne reached the other side of the square he climbed the stone steps and pushed open a door he stepped into a cold musty corridor with stark white walls adorned with old prints of even older judges at the far end of the corridor was a wooden staircase and attached to the wall was a shiny black board on which was painted boldly in white a list of names indicating the members of chambers as the porter had told him mr spencer craigs chambers were on the top floor the long climb up the creaking wooden staircase reminded payne how badly out of shape hed becomehe was breathing heavily long before he reached the third floor mr payne inquired a young woman who was waiting on the top step im mr craigs secretary hes just phoned to say that hes left the old bailey and should be with you in a few minutes perhaps youd care to wait in his office she led him down the corridor opened a door and ushered him in thank you said payne as he stepped into a large room sparsely furnished with a partners desk and two highbacked leather chairs one on either side would you care for a cup of tea mr payne or perhaps a coffee no thank you said payne as he looked out of a window overlooking the square she closed the door behind her and payne sat down facing craigs desk it was almost bare as if no one worked thereno photos no flowers no mementoes just a large blotting pad a tape recorder and a bulky unopened envelope addressed to mr s craig and marked private a few minutes later craig came bursting into the room closely followed by his secretary payne rose and shook hands with him as if he was a client rather than an old friend have a seat old boy said craig miss russell can you make sure were not disturbed of course mr craig she replied and left closing the door behind her is that what i think it is asked payne pointing at the envelope on craigs desk were about to find out said craig it arrived in the morning post while i was in court he ripped the envelope open and tipped its contents onto the blotting pada small cassette tape how did you get hold of it asked payne better not to ask said craig lets just say ive got friends in low places he smiled picked up the tape and slotted it in the cassette player we are about to find out what toby was so keen to share with the rest of the world he pressed the play button craig leaned back in his chair while payne remained on the edge of his seat his elbows on the desk it was several seconds before they heard someone speak i cant be sure which one of you will be listening to this tape craig didnt recognize the voice immediately it could be lawrence davenportbut that seems unlikely gerald payne is a possibility payne felt a chill shiver dart through his body but i suspect its most likely to be spencer craig craig showed no emotion whichever one of you it is i want to leave you in no doubt that if it takes me the rest of my life im going to make sure that all three of you end up in jail for the murder of bernie wilson not to mention my own unlawful incarceration if you still hope to get your hands on the tape you were really looking for let me assure you that its somewhere youll never find it until youre locked up in here chapter twentynine danny looked at himself in a fulllength mirror for the first time in months and was surprised by his reaction nicks influence must have gone further than even he had realized because he suddenly felt uncomfortably aware that a pair of designer jeans and a west ham shirt might not be the most appropriate apparel for an appearance at the royal courts he was already regretting having turned down nicks offer of a sober suit shirt and tie which would have been more in keeping with the gravity of the occasion nicks words as the disparity in their size was negligible two words danny no longer had to look up danny took his place in the dock and waited for the three judges to appear he had been driven out of belmarsh at am in a large white prison van along with twelve other prisoners who were all due to appear at the appeal court that morning how many of them would be returning that night on arrival hed been locked up in a cell and told to wait it gave him time to think not that he would be allowed to say anything in court mr redmayne had gone through the appeal procedure with him in great detail and had explained that it was very different from a trial three judges would have trawled through all the original evidence as well as the transcript of the trial and would have to be persuaded that there was fresh evidence that the judge and jury had not been privy to before they would consider overturning the original verdict once he had heard the tape alex redmayne was confident that doubt would be planted in their lordships minds although he didnt intend to dwell for too long on why toby mortimer was unable to appear as a witness it was some time before the door of dannys cell was unlocked and alex joined him after their last consultation he had insisted that danny call him by his christian name he still refused as it just didnt feel right despite the fact that his counsel had always treated him as an equal alex began to go over all the new evidence in great detail despite mortimer taking his own life they were still in possession of the tape which alex described as their trump card one should always try to avoid clichés mr redmayne danny said with a grin alex smiled another year and youll be conducting your own defense lets hope that wont be necessary danny looked up to where beth and her mother were seated in the front row of a gallery that was packed with the good citizens of bow who were in no doubt that he would be released later that day he was only sorry that beths father was not among them what danny didnt realize was how many more people were standing on the pavement outside the royal courts chanting and holding up placards demanding his release he glanced down at the press benches where a young man from the bethnal green and bow gazette sat with his notepad open and his pen poised would he have an exclusive for tomorrows paper the tape might not prove to be enough in itself alex had warned danny but once it had been played in court its contents could be reported in any newspaper in the land and after that danny was no longer alone alex nick big al and of course beth were the generals in what was fast becoming a small army alex had admitted that he was still hopeful a second witness might come forward to confirm mortimers story if toby mortimer had been willing to confess wasnt it possible that either gerald payne or lawrence davenport might after more than two years of having had to live with their consciences want to set the record straight why dont you go and see them danny had asked they might just listen to you alex had explained why that wasnt possible and went on to point out that even if he bumped into one of them socially he could be forced to withdraw from the case or face a charge of unprofessional conduct couldnt you send someone else in your place and have them get hold of the evidence we need the way big al did no said alex firmly if such an action were traced back to me youd be looking for a new barrister and id be looking for another job what about the barman danny asked alex told him that theyd already carried out a background check on reg jackson the barman of the dunlop arms to find out if he had any previous convictions and nothing said alex hes been arrested twice in the past five years for handling stolen goods but the police didnt have enough evidence to be sure of a conviction so the charges were dropped what about beth danny asked will they give her a second chance to testify no replied alex the judges will have read her written testimony as well as the transcript of the trial and theyre not interested in repeat performances he also warned danny that he couldnt find anything in the judges summingup which suggested sufficient prejudice to seek a retrial the truth is everything rests on the tape what about big al alex told him that he had considered calling albert crann as a witness but had decided that it might do more harm than good but hes a loyal friend said danny with a criminal record as ten oclock struck the three judges trooped into the courtroom the court officials rose bowed to their lordships and then waited for them to take their places on the bench to danny the two men and one woman who held the rest of his life in their hands appeared somewhat shadowy figures their heads covered in short wigs and their everyday clothes masked by fulllength black gowns alex redmayne placed a file on a small lectern in front of him he had explained to danny that he would be alone on the front bench as prosecuting counsel didnt have to be present at appeals danny felt he wouldnt miss mr arnold pearson qc once the court had settled the senior judge lord justice browne invited mr redmayne to begin his summation alex opened by reminding the court of the background to the case trying once again to sow doubt in their lordships minds but from the looks on their faces he clearly wasnt making much of an impression in fact lord justice browne interrupted him on more than one occasion to inquire if there was going to be any new evidence presented in this case as he stressed that all three judges had studied the court transcripts of the original trial after an hour alex finally gave in be assured mlord that i do indeed intend to present important new evidence for your consideration be assured mr redmayne that we are looking forward to hearing it was lord justice brownes response alex steadied himself and turned another page of his file my lords i am in possession of a tape recording that i should like you to consider it is a conversation with a mr toby mortimer a fellow musketeer who was present at the dunlop arms on the night in question but was unable to give evidence at the original trial as he was indisposed danny held his breath as alex picked up the tape and placed it in a cassette player on the table in front of him he was just about to press the play button when lord justice browne leaned forward and said one moment please mr redmayne danny felt a shiver go through his body as the three judges whispered among themselves it was some time before lord justice browne asked a question to which alex had no doubt he already knew the answer will mr mortimer be appearing as a witness he asked no mlord but the tape will show why will he not be appearing before us mr redmayne is he still indisposed unfortunately mlord he died quite recently may i inquire what was the cause of death alex cursed he knew that lord justice browne was well aware of the reason mortimer couldnt be in court but was making sure that every detail was on the record he committed suicide mlord after taking an overdose of heroin was he a registered heroin addict continued lord justice browne relentlessly yes mlord but fortunately this recording was made during a period of remission no doubt a doctor will appear before us to confirm this unfortunately not mlord am i to understand that a doctor was not present when the tape recording was made yes mlord i see and where was the tape recording made in belmarsh prison mlord were you present at the time no mlord perhaps an officer of the prison was on hand to witness the circumstances in which this tape recording was made no mlord then i am curious to know mr redmayne exactly who was present on the occasion a mr albert crann and if he is not a doctor or a member of the prison staff what was his position at the time he is a prisoner is he indeed i am bound to ask mr redmayne if you have any proof that this recording was made without mr mortimer being coerced or threatened alex hesitated no mlord but im confident that you will be able to make such a judgment concerning mr mortimers state of mind once you have listened to the tape but how can we be sure that mr crann wasnt holding a knife to his throat mr redmayne indeed perhaps his very presence would have been enough to put the fear of god into mr mortimer as i have suggested mlord you might feel better able to form an opinion once you have heard the tape allow me a moment to consult with my colleagues mr redmayne once again the three judges whispered among themselves after a short time lord justice browne turned his attention back to defense counsel mr redmayne we are all of the opinion that we cannot allow you to play the tape as it is clearly inadmissible but my lord may i refer you to a recent european commission directive european directives do not yet constitute law in my court said lord justice browne but quickly corrected himself in this country let me warn you that if the contents of this tape were ever to become public i would be obliged to refer the matter to the cps the one journalist on the press benches put down his pen for a moment he had thought he had an exclusive as mr redmayne would surely pass over the tape at the conclusion of the hearing so that he could decide if his readers might be interested even if their lordships were not but that would no longer be possible if the paper published one word of the tape following the judges directive it would be in contempt of courtsomething even the most robust editors draw the line at alex shuffled some papers around but he knew that he wouldnt be troubling lord justice browne again please carry on with your submission mr redmayne the judge offered helpfully alex continued defiantly with the little new evidence he had left at his disposal but he could no longer call on anything that caused lord justice browne even to raise an eyebrow when alex finally resumed his place he cursed himself under his breath he should have released the tape to the press the day before the appeal was due to be heard and then the judge would have had no choice but to consider the conversation to be admissible as fresh evidence but lord justice browne proved too wily a customer to allow alex even to press the play button his father had later pointed out that if their lordships had heard so much as one sentence they would have had no choice but to listen to the whole tape they hadnt heard one word let alone a sentence the three judges retired at twelve thirtyseven and it was only a short time before they returned with a unanimous verdict alex lowered his head when lord justice browne uttered the words appeal dismissed he looked across at danny who had just been condemned to spend the next twenty years of his life in jail for a crime alex was now certain he did not commit chapter thirty several of the guests were on their third or fourth glass of champagne by the time lawrence davenport appeared on the staircase of the crowded ballroom he didnt move from the top step until he was satisfied that most of them had turned to gaze in his direction a smattering of applause broke out he smiled and waved a hand in acknowledgment a glass of champagne was thrust into his other hand with the words you were magnificent darling when the curtain fell the firstnighters had given the cast a standing ovation but that would not have come as a surprise to any regular theatergoers because they always do after all the first eight rows are usually filled with the casts family friends and agents and the next six with comps and hangerson only a seasoned critic would fail to rise the moment the curtain fell unless it was to leave quickly so that they could file their piece in time to catch the first edition the following morning davenport slowly looked around the room his eyes settled on his sister sarah who was chatting to gibson graham how do you think the critics will react sarah asked larrys agent theyll be sniffy said gibson puffing away on his cigar they always are when a soap star appears in the west end but as weve got an advance of nearly three hundred thousand pounds and its only a fourteenweek run were criticproof its bums on seats that matter sarah not the critics has larry got anything else lined up not at the moment gibson admitted but im confident that after tonight there will be no shortage of inquiries larry well done said sarah as her brother walked over to join them what a triumph added gibson raising his glass do you really think so asked davenport oh yes said sarah who understood her brothers insecurities better than anyone in any case gibson tells me that youre almost booked out for the entire run true but i still worry about the critics said davenport theyve never been kind to me in the past dont give them a thought said gibson it doesnt matter what they saythe shows going to be a sellout davenport scanned the room to see who he wanted to talk to next his eyes rested on spencer craig and gerald payne who were standing in the far corner deep in conversation it looks as if our little investment will pay off said craig doubly doubly said payne not only did larry clam up the moment he was offered the chance to appear in the west end but with an advance of three hundred thousand were certain to get our money back and possibly even show a small profit and now that cartwright has lost his appeal we wont have to worry about him for at least another twenty years craig added with a chuckle im still worried about the tape said payne id be far more relaxed if i knew it no longer existed its no longer relevant said craig but what if the papers got hold of it said payne the papers wont dare to go anywhere near it but that wouldnt stop it being published on the internet which could be every bit as damaging for both of us you keep worrying yourself unnecessarily said craig not a night goes by when i dont worry about it said payne i wake up every morning wondering if my face will be plastered across the front pages i dont think it would be your face that ended up on the front pages said craig as davenport appeared by his side congratulations larry you were quite brilliant my agent tells me that you both invested in the show said davenport you bet we did said craig we know a winner when we see one in fact were going to spend part of the profits on the musketeers annual bash two young men came up to davenport happy to confirm his own opinion of himself which gave craig the opportunity to slip away as he circulated around the room he caught a glimpse of sarah davenport talking to a short balding overweight man who was smoking a cigar she was even more beautiful than he remembered he wondered if the man puffing away on the cigar was her partner when she turned in his direction craig smiled at her but she didnt respond perhaps she hadnt seen him in his opinion she had always been better looking than larry and after their one night together he walked across to join her he would know in a moment if larry had confided in her hello spencer she said craig bent down to kiss her on both cheeks gibson said sarah this is spencer craig an old friend of larrys from university days spencer this is gibson graham larrys agent you invested in the show didnt you said gibson a modest amount admitted craig i never thought of you as an angel said sarah ive always backed larry said craig but then i never doubted he was going to be a star youve become something of a star yourself said sarah with a smile then im bound to ask said craig if you feel that way why you never brief me i dont deal with criminals i hope that wont stop you having dinner with me sometime because id like the first editions of the papers have arrived interrupted gibson excuse me while i find out if weve got a hit or just a winner gibson graham made his way quickly across the ballroom barging anyone aside who was foolish enough to stand in his path he grabbed a copy of the daily telegraph and turned to the review section he smiled when he saw the headline oscar wilde is still at home in the west end but the smile turned to a frown by the time he reached the second paragraph lawrence davenport gave us his usual stock performance this time as jack but it didnt seem to matter as the audience was littered with dr beresford fans in contrast eve best playing gwendolen fairfax sparkled from her first entrance gibson looked across at davenport pleased to see that he was deep in conversation with a young actor who had been resting for some time chapter thirtyone by the time they reached his cell the damage had been done the table had been smashed to pieces the mattresses torn apart the sheets ripped to shreds and the little steel mirror wrenched from the wall as mr hagen heaved open the door he found danny trying to pull the washbasin from its stand three officers came charging toward him and he took a swing at hagen if the punch had landed it would have felled a middleweight champion but hagen ducked just in time the second officer grabbed dannys arm while the third kicked him sharply in the back of the knee which gave hagen enough time to recover and cuff his arms and legs while his colleagues held him down they dragged him out of his cell and bounced him down the iron staircase keeping him on the move until they reached the purple corridor that led to the segregation unit they came to a numberless cell hagen opened the door and the other two threw him in danny lay still on the cold stone floor for some considerable time had there been a mirror in the cell he would have been able to admire his black eye and the patchwork quilt of bruises that was woven across his body he didnt care you dont when youve lost hope and have another twenty years to think about it my name is malcolm hurst said the representative from the parole board please have a seat mr moncrieff hurst had given some thought to how he should address the prisoner you have applied for parole mr moncrieff he began and it is my responsibility to write a report for the boards consideration of course i have read your case history which gives a full account of how you have conducted yourself while youve been in prison and your wing officer mr pascoe has described your behavior as exemplary nick remained silent i have also noted that you are an enhanced prisoner who works in the library as well as assisting the prison teaching staff in both english and history you seem to have had remarkable success with some of your fellow prisoners who have gone on to be awarded gcses and one in particular who is currently preparing to take three a levels nick nodded sadly pascoe had tipped him off that danny had lost his appeal and was on his way back from the old bailey he had wanted to be waiting in the cell when danny arrived but unfortunately the parole board had scheduled the interview some weeks ago nick had already resolved to be in touch with alex redmayne as soon as he was released and to offer to assist in any way possible he couldnt understand why the judge hadnt allowed the tape to be played no doubt danny would tell him the reason once he returned to his cell he tried to concentrate on what the representative from the parole board was saying i see that during your time in prison mr moncrieff you have taken an open university degree in english gaining a twotwo nick nodded while your record in prison is highly commendable im sure youll understand that i still have to ask you some questions before i can complete my report nick had already taken advice from pascoe on what those questions might be of course he replied you were convicted by an army board of being reckless and negligent during the course of duty to which you pleaded guilty the board stripped you of your commission and sentenced you to eight years in prison is that a fair assessment yes it is mr hurst hurst placed a tick in the first box your platoon was guarding a group of serbian prisoners when a band of albanian militia drove up to the compound firing their kalashnikovs in the air thats correct your staff sergeant retaliated warning shots said nick after i had given the insurgents a clear order to stop firing but two united nations observers who witnessed the whole incident gave evidence at your trial suggesting that the albanians were only firing their guns in the air at the time nick made no attempt to defend himself and although you did not fire a shot yourself you were the watch commander on that occasion i was and you accept that your sentence was just yes hurst made a further note before asking and were the board to recommend that you should be released having served only half of your sentence what plans do you have for the immediate future i intend to return to scotland where i would take up a teaching post in any school that will employ me hurst put another tick in another box before moving on to his next question do you have any financial problems that might prevent you taking up a teaching post no said nick on the contrary my grandfather has left me sufficiently well off to ensure that i need not work again hurst ticked another box are you married mr moncrieff no said nick do you have any children or other dependants no are you currently on any medication no if you were to be released do you have a home to go to yes i have a house in london and another in scotland do you have any family to assist you were you to be released no said nick hurst looked up this was the first box not to be ticked both my parents are dead and i have no brothers or sisters aunts or uncles one uncle and aunt who live in scotland whom i have never been close to and another aunt on my mothers side who lives in canada and whom i have corresponded with but never met i understand said hurst one final question mr moncrieff it may seem a little strange given your circumstances but nevertheless i have to ask it can you think of any reason why you might consider committing the same crime again as i am unable to resume my career in the army and indeed have no desire to do so the answer to your question has to be no i fully understand said hurst placing a tick in the last box finally do you have any questions for me only to ask when ill be informed of the boards decision it will take me a few days to write my report before i submit it to the board said hurst but once theyve received it it should be no more than a couple of weeks before theyre in touch with you thank you mr hurst thank you sir nicholas we didnt have any choice sir said pascoe im sure thats right ray said the governor but i do think a little common sense is called for with this particular prisoner what do you have in mind sir asked pascoe after all he did trash his cell im aware of that ray but we all know how lifers can react if their appeal is turned down they either become silent loners or tear the place apart a few days in the slammer will bring cartwright to his senses said pascoe lets hope so said barton because id like to get him back on an even keel as quickly as possible hes a bright lad id hoped hed be moncrieffs natural successor the obvious choice although hell automatically lose his enhanced status and have to return to basic that need only be for a month said the governor in the meantime said pascoe what do i do about his work category do i take him off education and put him back on the chain gang heaven forbid said barton that would be more of a punishment for us than it would be for him what about his canteen rights no pay and no canteen for four weeks right sir said pascoe and have a word with moncrieff hes cartwrights closest friend see if he can knock some sense into him as well as supporting him over the next few weeks will do sir whos next leach sir whats the charge this time failure to return a library book cant you deal with something as minor as that without involving me asked the governor in normal circumstances yes sir but in this case it was a valuable leatherbound copy of the law review which leach failed to return despite several verbal and written warnings i still dont see why he needs to come in front of me said barton because when we eventually found the book in a rubbish skip at the back of the block it had been torn apart why would he do that i have my suspicions sir but no proof another way of getting drugs in as i said sir i have no proof but leach is back in segregation for another month just in case he takes it upon himself to tear the whole library apart pascoe hesitated we have another problem namely one of my informers tells me he overheard leach saying he was going to get even with cartwright if it was the last thing he did because hes the librarian no something to do with a tape replied pascoe but i cant get to the bottom of it thats all i need said the governor youd better keep a twentyfourhour watch on both of them were pretty shortstaffed at the moment said pascoe then do the best you can i dont want a repeat of what happened to the poor bastard at garsideand all he did was give leach a v sign chapter thirtytwo danny lay on the top bunk composing a letter which hed given a great deal of thought to nick had tried to talk him out of it but he had made his decision and there was nothing that would change his mind nick was taking a shower and big al was over at the hospital helping sister with the evening surgery so danny had the cell to himself he climbed down from his bunk and took a seat at the small formica table he stared at a blank sheet of paper it was some time before he managed to write the first sentence dear beth this will be the last time i write to you i have given a great deal of thought to this letter and have come to the conclusion that i cannot condemn you to the same life sentence that has been imposed on me he glanced at the photograph of beth that was sellotaped to the wall in front of him as you know i am not due to be released until im fifty and with that in mind i want you to start a new life without me if you write to me again i will not open your letters if you try to visit i will remain in my cell i will not contact you and will not respond to any attemptyou make to contact me on this i am adamant and nothing will change my mind do not imagine even for a moment that i dont love you and christy because i do and i will for the rest of my life but i am in no doubt that this course of action will be best for both of us in the long run goodbye my love danny he folded the letter and placed it in an envelope which he addressed to beth wilson bacon road bow london e danny was still staring at the photograph of beth when the cell door swung open letters said an officer standing in the doorway one for moncrieff and one for he spotted the watch on dannys wrist and the silver chain around his neck and hesitated nicks taking a shower danny explained right said the officer theres one for you and one for moncrieff danny immediately recognized beths neat handwriting he didnt open the envelope just tore it up dropped the pieces into the lavatory and pulled the flush he placed the other envelope on nicks pillow printed in bold letters in the top lefthand corner were the words parole board how many times have i written to him asked alex redmayne this will be the fourth letter youve sent in the past month replied his secretary alex looked out of the window several gowned figures were rushing to and fro across the square lifers syndrome he said lifers syndrome you either cut yourself off from the outside world or carry on as if nothing has happened hes obviously decided to cut himself off so is there any point in writing to him again oh yes replied alex i want him to be left in no doubt that i havent forgotten him when nick came back from the shower room danny was still at the table going over some financial forecasts that were part of his a level in business studies while big al remained slumped on his bed nick strolled into the cell with a thin wet towel around his waist his flipflops making water marks on the stone floor danny stopped writing and handed him back his watch ring and silver chain thanks said nick he then spotted the thin brown envelope on his pillow for a moment he just stared at it danny and big al said nothing as they waited to see nicks reaction finally he grabbed a plastic knife and slit open an envelope that the prison authorities were not allowed to tamper with dear mr moncrieff i am directed by the parole board to inform you that your request for early release has been granted your sentence will therefore be terminated on july th the full details of your release and your parole conditions will be sent to you at a later date along with the name of your probation officer and the office you will be expected to report to yours sincerely t l williams nick looked up at his two cellmates but he didnt need to tell them that he would soon be a free man visits hollered a voice that could be heard from one side of the block to the other a few moments later the cell door swung open and an officer checked his clipboard youve got a visitor cartwright same young lady as last week danny turned another page of bleak house and just shook his head suit yourself said the officer and slammed the cell door closed nick and big al didnt comment they had both given up trying to make him change his mind chapter thirtythree he had chosen the day carefully even the hour but what he couldnt have planned was that the minute would fall so neatly into place the governor had decided the day and the senior officer had backed his judgment on this occasion an exception would be made the prisoners would be allowed out of their cells to watch the world cup match between england and argentina at five minutes to twelve the doors were unlocked and the prisoners flooded out of their cells all heading in one direction big al as a patriotic scot gruffly declined the opportunity to watch the old enemy in action and remained supine on his bunk danny was among those seated at the front staring attentively at an ancient square box waiting for the referee to blow his whistle and start the game all the prisoners were clapping and shouting long before the kickoff with one exception who was standing silently at the back of the group he wasnt looking at the television but up at an open cell door on the first floor he didnt move officers dont notice prisoners who dont move he was beginning to wonder if the man had broken his usual routine because of the match but he wasnt watching the match his mate was sitting on a bench at the front so he must still be in his cell after thirty minutes with the score nilnil there was still no sign of him then just before the referee blew his whistle for halftime an english player was brought down in the argentine penalty area the crowd surrounding the tv seemed to make almost as much noise as the thirtyfive thousand spectators in the stadium and even some of the officers joined in background noise was all part of his plan his eyes remained fixed on the open door when suddenly without warning the rabbit came out of his hutch he was wearing boxer shorts and flipflops with a towel draped over his shoulder he didnt look down he clearly had no interest in football he walked backward for a few paces until he had detached himself from the group but nobody noticed he turned and walked slowly to the far end of the block then climbed stealthily up the spiral staircase to the second floor no one looked around as the referee pointed to the penalty spot when he reached the top step he checked to see if anyone had noticed him leave no one even glanced in his direction the argentine players were surrounding the referee and protesting while the england captain picked up the ball and walked calmly into the penalty box he came to a halt outside the shower room and peered inside to discover it was steamed up all part of his plan he stepped inside relieved to find that only one person was taking a shower he padded silently over to the wooden bench on the far side of the room where a single towel lay neatly folded in the corner he picked it up and carefully twisted it into a noose the prisoner standing under the shower rubbed some shampoo into his hair everyone on the ground floor had gone silent there was not a murmur as david beckham placed the ball on the penalty spot some even held their breath as he took a few paces back the man in the shower room took a few paces forward as beckhams right foot connected with the ball the roar that followed sounded like a prison riot with all the officers joining in the prisoner who was rinsing his hair under the shower opened his eyes when he heard the roar and immediately had to place a hand across his forehead to stop more lather running into his eyes he was just about to step out of the shower and grab his towel from the bench when a knee landed in his groin with such force that beckham would have been impressed followed by a clenched fist into the middle of his ribs which propelled him against the tiled wall he tried to retaliate but a forearm was rammed into his throat and another hand grabbed his hair and jerked his head back one swift movement and although no one heard the bone snap when he was released his body sank to the ground like a puppet whose strings had been cut his attacker bent down and carefully placed the noose around his neck then with all the strength he possessed lifted the dead man up and held him against the wall while he tied the other end of the towel to the shower rail he slowly lowered the body into place and stood back for a moment to admire his handiwork he returned to the entrance of the shower room and poked his head around the doorway to check what was going on down below the celebrations were now out of control and any officers were fully occupied making sure that the prisoners didnt start breaking up the furniture he moved like a ferret making his way swiftly and silently back down the spiral staircase ignoring the dripping water that would have dried long before the match came to an end he was back in his cell in less than a minute laid out on his bed were a towel a clean tshirt and a pair of jeans a fresh pair of socks and his adidas trainers he quickly stripped off his wet gear dried himself and put on the clean clothes he then checked his hair in the little steel mirror on the wall before slipping back out of the cell the prisoners were now impatiently waiting for the second half to begin he joined his fellow inmates unnoticed and slowly a pace here a sideways move there made his way to the center of the melee for most of the second half the crowd were urging the referee to whistle for full time so that england could leave the pitch as onenil winners when the final whistle eventually blew there was another eruption of noise several officers shouted back to your cells but the response was not immediate he turned and walked purposefully toward one particular officer knocking against his elbow as he passed by look where youre going leach said pascoe sorry guv said leach and continued on his way danny made his way back upstairs he knew that big al would have already reported to surgery but he was surprised that nick wasnt in the cell he sat down at the table and stared at the photo of beth still sellotaped to the wall it brought back memories of bernie they would have been at their local watching the match together if danny tried to concentrate on the essay that had to be handed in by tomorrow but he just went on looking at the photo trying to convince himself that he didnt miss her suddenly the shriek of a klaxon echoed around the block accompanied by the sound of officers screaming back to your cells moments later the cell door was pulled open and an officer stuck his head in moncrieff wheres big al danny didnt bother to correct himafter all he was still wearing nicks watch ring and silver chain which had been given to him for safekeepingand simply said hell be at work in the hospital when the door slammed shut danny wondered why he hadnt asked where he was it was impossible to concentrate on his essay with so much noise going on all around him he assumed some overexuberant prisoner was being carted off to segregation in the aftermath of the english victory a few minutes later the door was pulled opened again by the same officer and big al ambled in hello nick he said in a loud voice before the door was slammed shut whats your game asked danny big al placed a finger on his lips walked across to the lavatory and sat down on it they cannae see me while im sitting here so look like yer working and dont turn roon but why and dont open yer mooth just listen danny picked up his pen and pretended to be concentrating on his essay nicks topped himself danny thought he was going to be sick but why he repeated i said dont speak they found him hangin in the showers danny began to pound the table with his fist it cant be true shut up ya stupid fucker and listen i wis in surgery when two screws came rushing inone of them said sister come quickly cartwrights topped himself i knew that wis balls cause id seen ye at the football a few minutes before it hud tae be nick he always uses the shower when hes least likely tae be disturbed but why dont worry about why danny boy big al said firmly the screws and the sister ran off so i was left on ma own fur a few minutes then another screw turns up and marches mi back here danny was now listening intently he told me it wis you whod committed suicide but theyll find out it wasnt me as soon as no they wont said big al because i hud enough time tae switch the names on yer two files you did what said danny in disbelief you heard me but i thought you told me the files are always locked up they are but no during surgery in case sister needs tae check on someones medication and she left in a hurry big al stopped talking when he heard someone in the corridor outside keep writing he said and stood up returned to his bed and lay down an eye peered through the spyhole then moved on to the next cell but why did you do that danny asked wance they check his fingerprints and his blood group theyre gonnae go on thinkin its you who topped himself because ye couldnae face another twenty years in this shitehole but nick had no reason to hang himself i know said big al but as long as they think it wis you on the end ay that rope theres no gonnae be an inquiry but that doesnt explain why you switched began danny he went silent for some time before adding so i can walk out of here a free man in six weeks time ye catch on fast danny boy the blood drained from dannys face as the consequences of big als impetuous action began to sink in he stared at the photo of beth he still wouldnt be able to see her even if he did manage to escape hed have to spend the rest of his life pretending to be nick moncrieff you didnt think of asking me first he said if i hud it would ve been too late dont forget there are only aboot half a dozen people in this place who cin tell ye apart and wance theyve checked the files even theyre gonnae be programmed tae thinking yur died but what if were caught yell carry on serving a life sentence an ill lose ma job in the hospital and go back tae being a wing cleaner big deal danny was silent again for some time eventually he said im not sure i can pull it off but if and i mean if nae time for ifs danny boy yeve probably got twentyfour hours before that cell door opens again by which time yell huv tae decide if yer danny cartwright serving another twenty years for a crime ye didnae commit or sir nicholas moncrieff due for release in six weeks time and lets face it yell huv a far better chance of clearing yer name wance youre on the ootsidenot tae mention getting those bastards who murdered yer mate i need time to think said danny as he began to climb up onto the top bunk no fur too long said big al remember nick always slept on the bottom bunk chapter thirtyfour nick was five months older than me said danny and half an inch shorter how dae ye know that asked big al nervously its all in his diaries replied danny ive just reached the point where i turn up in this cell and you two have to decide what story youre going to tell me big al frowned ive been blind for the past two years when all the time it was staring me in the face big al still didnt speak you were the staff sergeant who shot those two kosovan albanians when nicks platoon was ordered to guard a group of serbian prisoners wurse said big al it wis ifter captain moncrieff hud given a clear order no tae fire till hed issued a warnin in both english and serbocroat and you chose to ignore that order theres nae point issuing warnings tae someone whos already firing at ye but two un observers told the court martial that the albanians were only firing their weapons into the air an observation made fae the safety of their hotel suite on the other side of the square and nick ended up carrying the can aye said big al despite the fact that i told the provost marshal exactly whit happened they chose tae take nicks word over mine which resulted in you being charged with manslaughter an only being sentenced tae ten years rather than twentytwo for murder with nae hope of remission nick writes a lot about your courage and how you saved half the platoon including himself while you were serving in iraq he exaggerated not his style said danny although it does explain why he was willing to shoulder the blame even though you had disobeyed his orders i told the court martial the truth repeated big al but they still stripped nick of his commission and sentenced him tae eight years fur being reckless and negligent in the course of his duty do you imagine a day goes by when i dont think aboot the sacrifice he made fur me but im certain of wan thinghe wouldae wanted ye tae take his place how can you be so sure read on danny boy read on something doesnt ring quite true about this whole episode said ray pascoe what are you getting at asked the governor you know as well as i do that its not uncommon for a lifer to commit suicide within days of his appeal being turned down but not cartwright he had too much to live for we cant begin to know what was going on in his mind said the governor dont forget that he tore his cell apart and ended up in segregation he also refused to see his fiancée or his child whenever they turned up for a visitwouldnt even open her letters true but is it just a coincidence that this happens within days of leach threatening to get even with him you wrote in your latest report that theres been no contact between the two of them since the librarybook incident thats what worries me said pascoe if you intended to kill someone the last thing youd do is be seen anywhere near them the doctor has confirmed that cartwright died of a broken neck leach is quite capable of breaking someones neck because he didnt return a library book and ended up in segregation for a month said pascoe what about that tape youve been banging on about pascoe shook his head im none the wiser on that subject he admitted its still just a gut feeling youd better have a little more to go on than a gut feeling ray if you expect me to open a full inquiry a few minutes before the body was found leach bumped into me quite purposely so what said the governor he was wearing a brand new pair of trainers is this leading somewhere i noticed that he was wearing his blue prison gym shoes when the match started so how come he was wearing brandnew adidas trainers when it ended it doesnt add up much as i admire your powers of observation ray thats hardly enough proof to convince me that we need to open an inquiry his hair was wet ray said the governor weve got two choices either we accept the doctors report and confirm to our masters at the home office that it was suicide or we call in the police and ask them to mount a full investigation if its the latter ill need a little more to go on than wet hair and a new pair of trainers but if leach the first question wed be asked is why if we knew about leachs threat to cartwright we didnt recommend that he was transferred to another prison the same day there was a gentle tap on the door come in said the governor sorry to disturb you said his secretary but i thought youd want to see this immediately she handed him a sheet of lined prison paper he read the short note twice before passing it across to ray pascoe now thats what i call proof said the governor payne was showing a client around a penthouse apartment in mayfair when his mobile phone began to ring he would normally have switched it off whenever he was with a potential buyer but when the name spencer appeared on the screen he excused himself for a moment and went into the next room to take the call good news said craig cartwrights dead dead he committed suicidehe was found hanging in the showers how do you know its on page seventeen of the evening standard he even left a suicide note so thats the end of our problems not while that tape still exists payne reminded him no one is going to be interested in a tape of one dead man talking about another the cell door swung open and pascoe walked in he stared at danny for some time but didnt speak danny looked up from the diary hed reached the date of nicks interview with hurst from the parole board the same day his appeal had been turned down the day he trashed the cell and ended up in segregation ok lads grab a meal and then get back to work and moncrieff said pascoe im sorry about your friend cartwright i for one never thought he was guilty danny tried to think of a suitable reply but pascoe was already unlocking the next door cell he knows said big al quietly then were done for said danny i dont think so said big al fur some reason hes gon along wi the suicide an ma bet is that hes no the only wan whos got his doubts by the way nick whit made ye change yer mind danny picked up the diary flicked back a few pages and read out the words if i could change places with danny i would he has far more right to his freedom than i do chapter thirtyfive danny stood as inconspicuously as possible at the back of the churchyard as michael raised his right hand and gave the sign of the cross the governor had granted nicks request to attend danny cartwrights funeral at st marys in bow he turned down a similar application from big al on the grounds that he still had at least fourteen months to serve and had not yet been granted parole as the unmarked car had swung into mile end road danny looked out of the window checking for familiar sights they passed his favorite chippie his local the crown and garter and the odeon where he and beth used to sit in the back row every friday night when they stopped at the lights outside clement attlee comprehensive he clenched his fist as he thought of the wasted years he had spent there he tried not to look when they passed wilson s garage but he couldnt stop himself there were few signs of life in the little yard it would take more than a fresh coat of paint to make anyone think about buying a secondhand car from wilson s he turned his attention to monty hughess place on the other side of the road row upon row of gleaming new mercedes with smartly dressed salesmen displaying cheerful smiles the governor had reminded moncrieff that although he had only five weeks left to serve he would still have to be accompanied by two officers who would never leave his side and if he were to disobey any of the strictures placed upon him the governor would not hesitate to recommend to the parole board that they rescind their decision for an early release which would result in him having to serve another four years but you already know all this michael barton had gone on to say because the same strictures were placed on you when you attended your fathers funeral just a couple of months ago danny didnt comment the governors strictures as he called them rather suited danny as he was not allowed to mix with the cartwright family their friends or any members of the public in fact he was not permitted to speak to anyone other than the accompanying officers until he was back inside the prison walls the possibility of another four years in belmarsh was quite enough to concentrate the mind pascoe and jenkins stood on either side of him some way back from the mourners who surrounded the grave danny was relieved to find that nicks clothes might have been tailormade for himwell perhaps the trousers could have been an inch longer and although he had never worn a hat before it had the advantage of shielding his face from any curious onlookers father michael opened the service with a prayer while danny watched a gathering that was far larger than he had anticipated his mother looked pale and drawn as if she had been weeping for days and beth was so thin that a dress he well remembered now hung loosely on her no longer emphasizing her graceful figure only his twoyearold daughter christy was oblivious to the occasion as she played quietly by her mothers side but then she had only ever come into contact with her dad briefly followed by monthlong intervals so shed probably long forgotten him danny hoped that the only memory of her father wouldnt be of visiting him in prison danny was touched to see beths father standing by her side head bowed and just behind the family a tall elegant young man in a black suit lips pursed a look of smoldering anger in his eyes danny suddenly felt guilty that he hadnt replied to any of alex redmaynes letters since the appeal when father michael had finished intoning the prayers he bowed his head before delivering his eulogy the death of danny cartwright is a modern tragedy he told his parishioners as he looked down at the coffin a young man who had lost his way and so troubled was he in this world that he took his own life those of us who knew danny well still find it hard to believe that such a gentle considerate man could have committed any crime let alone the slaying of his closest friend indeed many of us in this parish he glanced at an innocent constable standing by the entrance to the church have still to be convinced that the police arrested the right person a smattering of applause broke out among some of the mourners encircling the grave danny was pleased to see that beths father was among them father michael raised his head but for now let us remember the son the young father the gifted leader and sportsman for many of us believe that had danny cartwright lived his name would have echoed far beyond the streets of bow applause broke out a second time but that was not the lords will and in his divine mystery he chose to take our son away to spend the rest of his days with our savior the priest sprinkled holy water around the grave and as the coffin was lowered into the ground he began to intone may eternal rest be granted unto danny o lord as the young choir softly chanted the nunc dimittis father michael beth and the rest of the cartwright family knelt by the graveside alex redmayne along with several other mourners waited behind to pay their last respects alex bowed his head as if in prayer and spoke a few words that neither danny nor anyone else present could hear i will clear your name so that you may finally rest in peace danny wasnt allowed to move until the last mourners had departed including beth and christy who never once looked in his direction when pascoe finally turned to tell moncrieff that they should leave he found him in tears danny wanted to explain that his tears were shed not only for his dear friend nick but for the privilege of being one of those rare individuals who discover how much they are loved by those closest to them chapter thirtysix danny spent every spare moment reading and rereading nicks diaries until he felt there was nothing left to know about the man big al who had served with nick for five years before they were both courtmartialed and sent to belmarsh was able to fill in several gaps including how danny should react if he ever bumped into an officer of the cameron highlanders and he also taught him how to spot the regimental tie at thirty paces they endlessly discussed the first thing nick would have done the moment he was released hed go straight up tae scotland said big al but all ill have is fortyfive pounds and a rail voucher mr munro will be able tae sort all that oot fur ye dont forget that nick said yed huv handled him far better than he did if id been him ye ur him said big al thanks to louis and nick who between them huv done a brilliant job so munro shouldnae be too difficult just be sure that when he sees ye fur the first time the second time but he only saw nick fur an hour and hell be expecting tae see sir nicholas moncrieff not someone hes never met before the bigger problem will be whit tae dae efter that ill come straight back to london said danny then make sure ye keep away fae the east end there are millions of londoners who have never been to the east end said danny with some feeling and although i dont know where the boltons is im pretty sure its west of bow so whit will ye dae wance yur back in london after attending my own funeral and having to watch beth suffer im more determined than ever to ensure that she isnt the only person who knows i didnt kill her brother bit like that frenchman ye told me abootwhits his name edmond dantès said danny and like him i will not be satisfied until i have had revenge on the men whose deceit has ruined my life yur gonnae kill them aw no that would be too easy they must suffer to quote dumas a fate worse than death ive had more than enough time to think how id go about it perhaps ye should add leach tae that list said big al leach why should i bother with him because i think it wis leach who killed nick i keep asking maself why would he top hisself six weeks before he wis gonnae be released but why would leach kill nick if he had a quarrel with anyone it was me it wasnae nick he wis efter said big al dont forget ye were wearing nicks silver chain watch and ring while he wis in the shower but that means leach killed the wrong man but he cant have wanted to kill me just because i asked him to return a library book an ended up back in segregation you think that would be enough to make him murder someone perhaps not said big al but you cin be sure that craig wouldnae uve paid up fur the wrong tape and i doubt if yeer on mr hagens christmas card list danny tried not to think about the fact that he might have been unwittingly responsible for nicks death but dont worry yersel nick once youre oot ay here a fate worse than death isnae whit i huv planned for leach spencer craig didnt need to look at the menu because it was his favorite restaurant the maître d was used to seeing him accompanied by different womensometimes two or three times in the same week sorry im late said sarah as she sat down opposite him i was held up by a client you work too hard said craig but then you always did this particular client always makes an appointment for an hour and then expects me to clear my diary for the rest of the afternoon i didnt even have time to go home and change i would never have guessed said craig in any case i find white blouses black skirts and black stockings quite irresistible i see youve lost none of your charm said sarah as she began to study the menu the food here is excellent said craig i can recommend i only ever have one course in the evenings said sarah one of my golden rules i remember your golden rules from cambridge said craig theyre the reason you ended up with a first while i only got a twoone but you also managed a boxing blue if i recall said sarah what a good memory you have said little red riding hood by the way hows larry i havent seen him since opening night nor me said craig but then hes no longer able to come out and play in the evenings i hope he wasnt too hurt by those vicious reviews cant imagine why he should have been said craig actors are like barristersits only the jurys opinion that matters i never give a damn what the judge thinks a waiter reappeared by their side ill have the john dory said sarah but please no sauce even on the side steak for me so rare that the blood is almost running said craig he handed the menu to the waiter and turned his attention back to sarah its good to see you after all this time he said especially as we didnt part on the best of terms mea culpa were both a little older now sarah replied in fact arent you being tipped to be among the youngest qcs of our generation the cell door swung open which surprised danny and big al because lockup had been called over an hour before you put in a written request to see the governor moncrieff yes mr pascoe said danny if thats possible hell give you five minutes at eight oclock tomorrow morning the door slammed without further explanation ye sound mer like nick every day said big al carry on like this and ill soon be saluting and calling ye sir carry on sergeant said danny big al laughed but then asked how come ye want tae see the governor yer no changing yer mind no said danny thinking on his feet there are two young lads in education who would benefit from sharing a cell as theyre both studying the same subject but cell allocation is mr jenkinss responsibility why not huv a word wi him i would but theres an added problem said danny trying to think of one and whits that asked big al theyve both applied to be the librarian i was going to suggest to the governor that he appoints two librarians in future otherwise one of them could end up back on the wing as a cleaner good try nick but ye dinnae expect me tae believe that load of bullshit dae ye yes said danny well if yur gonnae try and bluff an auld soldier like me make sure youre no taken by surprisealways have yer story well prepared so if youd been asked why you wanted to see the governor said danny how would you have replied mind yer own business can i give you a lift home asked craig as the waiter handed him back his credit card only if its not out of your way said sarah i was hoping it would be on my way he replied delivering a wellhoned line sarah rose from the table but didnt respond craig accompanied her to the door and helped her on with her coat he then took her by the arm and led her across the road to where his porsche was parked he opened the passenger door and admired her legs as she climbed in cheyne walk he asked how did you know that asked sarah as she fastened her seatbelt larry told me but you said craig turned on the ignition revved up for several seconds then suddenly shot off he swung sharply around the first bend causing sarah to lurch toward him his left hand ended up on her thigh she gently removed it sorry about that said craig not a problem said sarah but she was surprised when he tried the same move as he rounded the next corner and this time she removed the hand more firmly craig didnt try again during the rest of the journey satisfying himself with small talk until he drew up outside her flat in cheyne walk sarah unclipped her seatbelt expecting craig to get out and open the door for her but he leaned across and attempted to kiss her she turned her head away so that his lips only brushed against her cheek craig then wrapped an arm firmly around her waist and pulled her toward him her breasts were pressed against his chest and he placed his other hand on her thigh she tried to push him away but she had forgotten how strong he was he smiled at her and attempted to kiss her again she pretended to give in leaned forward and bit his tongue he fell back and shouted you bitch this allowed sarah enough time to open the door although she quickly discovered just how difficult it was to get out of a porsche she turned back to confront him and to think i was living under the illusion that you might have changed she said angrily she slammed the door and didnt hear him say i dont know why i bothered you werent that good a lay the first time pascoe marched him into the governors office why did you want to see me moncrieff asked barton its a delicate matter danny replied im listening said the governor it concerns big al who if i remember correctly was a staff sergeant in your platoon thats right sir which is why i feel somewhat responsible for him naturally said pascoe after your four years in this place moncrieff we know youre not a nark and will have cranns best interests at heart so out with it i overheard a heated row between big al and leach said danny of course its possible that im overreacting and im confident i can keep the lid on it while im still around but if anything were to happen to big al after i left i would feel responsible thank you for the warning said the governor mr pascoe and i have already discussed what we should do about crann once youve been released while youre here moncrieff continued the governor do you have a view on who should be the next librarian there are two lads sedgwick and potter who are both well capable of doing the job id split the role between them youd have made a good governor moncrieff i think youll find that i lack the necessary qualifications it was the first time danny had heard either man laugh the governor nodded and pascoe opened the door so that he could accompany moncrieff to work mr pascoe perhaps you could remain behind for a moment im sure moncrieff can find his way to the library without your help right governor how much longer has moncrieff got to serve asked barton after danny had closed the door behind him ten more days sir said pascoe then well have to move quickly if were going to ship leach out there is an alternative sir said pascoe hugo moncrieff tapped his boiled egg with a spoon while he considered the problem his wife margaret was sitting at the other end of the table reading the scotsman they rarely spoke at breakfast a routine that had been established over many years hugo had already sifted through the morning post there was a letter from the local golf club and another from the caledonian society along with several circulars which he put on one side until he finally came across the one he was looking for he picked up the butter knife slit the envelope open extracted the letter and then did what he always did checked the signature at the bottom of the last page desmond galbraith he left his egg untouched as he began to consider his lawyers advice at first he smiled but by the time he had reached the last paragraph he was frowning desmond galbraith was able to confirm that following hugos brothers funeral his nephew sir nicholas had attended a meeting with his solicitor fraser munro had called galbraith the following morning and did not raise the subject of the two mortgages this led galbraith to believe that sir nicholas would not be disputing hugos right to the two million pounds that had been raised using his grandfathers two homes as security hugo smiled removed the top from his egg and took a spoonful it had taken a lot of persuading to get his brother angus to agree to take out mortgages on both the estate and his london home without consulting nick especially after fraser munro had advised so firmly against it and hugo had had to move quickly once anguss doctor confirmed that his brother had only a few weeks to live since angus had left the regiment single malt had become his constant companion hugo regularly visited dunbroathy hall to partake of a wee dram with his brother and he rarely left before theyd finished the bottle toward the end angus was willing to sign almost any document placed in front of him first a mortgage on the london property he rarely visited followed by another on the estate which hugo was able to convince him was in dire need of urgent repair finally hugo persuaded him to end his professional association with fraser munro who in hugos opinion had far too great a sway over his brother to take over the familys affairs hugo appointed desmond galbraith a lawyer who believed in abiding by the letter of the law but took no more than a passing interest in its spirit hugos final triumph had been anguss last will and testament which was signed only a few nights before his brother passed away hugo had it witnessed by a magistrate who just happened to be the secretary of the local golf club and the local parish prices when hugo came across an earlier will in which angus had bequeathed the bulk of the estate to his only son nicholas he shredded it and hugo tried not to show the relief he felt when his brother died just a few months before nick was due to be released a reunion and reconciliation between father and son hadnt formed any part of his plans however galbraith had failed to prize out of mr munro the original copy of sir alexanders earlier will as the old solicitor had correctly pointed out that he now represented the main beneficiary sir nicholas moncrieff once he had finished off his first egg hugo reread the paragraph of galbraiths letter that had made him frown he cursed which caused his wife to look up from her paper surprised by this break in their wellordered routine nick is claiming that he knows nothing about the key his grandfather left him how can that be when weve all seen him wearing the damn thing around his neck he didnt wear it at the funeral said margaret i looked most carefully when he knelt down to pray do you think he knows what that key unlocks said hugo he may well do margaret replied but that doesnt mean he knows where to look for it father should have told us where he had hidden his collection in the first place you and your father were hardly on speaking terms towards the end margaret reminded him and he considered angus to be weak and far too fond of the bottle true but that doesnt solve the problem of the key perhaps the time has come for us to resort to more robust tactics what do you have in mind old gal i think the vulgar expression is putting a tail on him once nick is released we can have him followed if he does know where the collection is hell lead us straight to it but i wouldnt know how to said hugo dont even think about it said margaret leave it all to me whatever you say old gal said hugo as he attacked his second egg chapter thirtyseven danny lay awake on the lower bunk and thought about everything that had taken place since nicks death he couldnt sleep despite the fact that big al wasnt snoring he knew his last night at belmarsh would be as long as the firstanother night he would never forget during the past twentyfour hours several officers and inmates had dropped in to say goodbye and to wish him luck confirming just how popular and respected nick had been the reason big al wasnt snoring was that hed been shipped out of belmarsh the previous morning and transferred to wayland prison in norfolk while danny had been revising for his a levels in nicks name danny still had the maths papers to look forward to but was disappointed to have to forgo the english exams as nick was not taking them by the time danny returned to his cell that afternoon there was no sign of big al it was almost as if he had never existed danny hadnt even been given the chance to say goodbye by now big al would have worked out why danny had been to see the governor and hed be fuming but danny knew that hed calm down once he settled into his c cat with a television in every cell food that was almost edible an opportunity to visit a gym that wasnt overcrowded and most important of all being allowed out of his cell fourteen hours a day leach had also disappeared but no one knew where and few cared enough to ask a second time during the past few weeks danny had begun to form a plan in his mind but in his mind it had remained because he couldnt risk committing anything to paper if he was discovered it would condemn him to another twenty years in hell he slept he woke his first thought was of bernie who had been robbed of his life by craig and the misnamed musketeers his second was of nick who had made it possible for him to be given another chance his final thoughts were of beth when he was reminded once again that the decision had made it impossible for him ever to see her again he began to think about tomorrow once hed had his meeting with fraser munro and tried to sort out nicks immediate problems in scotland he would return to london and put into motion the plans hed been working on for the past six weeks hed become realistic about the chances of clearing his name but that wouldnt stop him seeking justice of a different kindwhat the bible called retribution and what edmond dantès described less subtly as revenge whatever he slept he woke he would stalk his prey like an animal observing them at a distance while they relaxed in their natural habitat spencer craig in the courtroom gerald payne in his mayfair offices and lawrence davenport on stage toby mortimer the last of the four musketeers had suffered a death even more dreadful than any he could have devised but first danny must travel to scotland meet up with fraser munro and find out if he could pass his initiation test if he fell at the first hurdle he would be back in belmarsh by the end of the week he slept he woke the early morning sun was producing a feeble square of light on his cell floor but it could not disguise the fact that he was in prison for the bars were clearly reflected on the cold gray stones a lark attempted a cheerful tune to greet the dawn but quickly flew away danny pulled aside the green nylon sheet and placed his bare feet on the ground he walked across to the tiny steel washbasin filled it with lukewarm water and shaved carefully then with the assistance of a sliver of soap he washed wondering how long the smell of prison would remain in the pores of his skin he studied himself in the small steel mirror above the basin the bits he could see appeared to be clean he put on his prison clothes for the last time a pair of boxer shorts a blue and white striped shirt jeans gray socks and nicks trainers he sat on the end of the bed and waited for pascoe to appear jangling keys and with his usual morning greeting lets be having you lad its time to go to work not today he waited when the key eventually turned in the lock and the door opened pascoe had a broad grin on his face morning moncrieff he said look lively and follow me its time for you to pick up your personal belongings from the stores be on your way and leave us all in peace as they walked down the corridor at a prison pace pascoe ventured the weathers on the turn you should have a nice day for it as if danny was off on a day trip to the seaside how do i get from here to kings cross danny asked something nick wouldnt have known take the train from plumstead station to cannon street then the tube to kings cross said pascoe as they reached the storeroom he banged on the double doors and a moment later they were pulled open by the stores manager morning moncrieff said webster you must have been looking forward to today for the past four years danny didnt comment ive got everything ready for you continued webster taking two full plastic bags from the shelf behind him and placing them on the counter he then disappeared into the back returning a moment later with a large leather suitcase that was covered in dust and bore the initials nam in black nice piece of kit that he said what does the a stand for danny couldnt remember if it was angus after nicks father or alexander after his grandfather get on with it moncrieff said pascoe i dont have all day to stand around chatting danny tried manfully to pick up both the plastic bags in one hand and the large leather suitcase with the other but found that he had to stop and change hands every few paces id like to help you moncrieff whispered pascoe but if i did id never hear the end of it eventually they ended up back outside dannys cell pascoe unlocked the door ill return in about an hour to fetch you i have to get some of the lads off to the old bailey before we can think about releasing you the cell door slammed in dannys face for the last time danny took his time he opened the suitcase and placed it on big als bed he wondered who would sleep in his bunk tonight someone who would be appearing at the old bailey later that morning hoping the jury would find him not guilty he emptied the contents of the plastic bags onto the bed feeling like a robber surveying his swag two suits three shirts what the diary described as a pair of cavalry twills along with a couple of pairs of brogues one black one brown danny selected the dark suit hed worn at his own funeral a cream shirt a striped tie and a pair of smart black shoes that even after four years didnt require a polish danny cartwright stood in front of the mirror and stared at sir nicholas moncrieff officer and gentleman he felt like a fraud he folded up his prison gear and placed it on the end of nicks bed he still thought of it as nicks bed then he packed the rest of the clothes neatly in the suitcase before retrieving nicks diary from under the bed along with a file of correspondence marked fraser munrotwentyeight letters that danny knew almost off by heart once hed finished packing all that remained were a few of nicks personal belongings which danny had put on the table and the photo of beth taped to the wall he carefully peeled off the sellotape before putting the photo in a side pocket of the suitcase which he then snapped closed and placed by the cell door danny sat back down at the table and looked at his friends personal belongings he strapped on nicks slim longines watch with stamped on the backa gift from his grandfather on his twentyfirst birthdaythen he slipped on a gold ring which bore the moncrieff family crest he stared at a black leather wallet and felt even more like a thief inside it he found seventy pounds in cash and a coutts checkbook with an address in the strand printed on the cover he put the wallet in an inside pocket turned the plastic chair around to face the cell door sat down and waited for pascoe to reappear he was ready to escape as he sat there he recalled one of nicks favorite misquotes in prison time and tide wait for every man he reached inside his shirt and touched the small key that was hanging from the chain around his neck he was no nearer to discovering what it unlockedit unlocked the prison gate he had searched through the diaries for the slightest clue over a thousand pages but had come up with nothing if nick had known he had taken the secret to his grave now a very different key was turning in the lock of his cell door it opened to reveal pascoe standing alone danny quite expected him to say good try cartwright but you didnt really expect to get away with it did you but all he said was its time to go moncrieff look sharp about it danny rose picked up nicks suitcase and walked out onto the landing he didnt look back at the room that had been his home for the past two years he followed pascoe along the landing and down the spiral staircase as he left the block he was greeted with cheers and jeers from those who were soon to be released and those who would never see the light of day again they continued down the blue corridor hed forgotten how many sets of doublebarred gates there were between b block and reception where jenkins was seated behind his desk waiting for him good morning moncrieff he announced cheerfully he had one voice for those coming in quite another for those who were leaving he checked the open ledger in front of him i see that over the past four years you have saved two hundred and eleven pounds and as you are also entitled to fortyfive pounds discharge allowance that makes in all two hundred and fiftysix pounds he counted out the money slowly and carefully before passing it over to danny sign here he said danny wrote nicks signature for the second time that morning before putting the money in his wallet you are also entitled to a rail warrant to any part of the country you decide on its one way of course as we dont want to see you back here again prison humor jenkins handed him a rail warrant to dunbroath in scotland but not before danny had falsely signed another document it wasnt surprising that his handwriting resembled nicksafter all it was nick who had taught him to write mr pascoe will accompany you to the gate said jenkins once hed checked the signature ill say goodbye as i have a feeling well never meet again which sadly im not able to say all that often danny shook his hand picked up the suitcase and followed pascoe out of reception down the steps and into the yard together they walked slowly across a bleak concrete square which acted as a car park for the prison vans and private vehicles that made their legal entrance and exit every day in the gatehouse sat an officer danny had never seen before name he demanded without looking up from the list of discharges on his clipboard moncrieff danny replied number ck said danny without thinking the officer ran a finger slowly down his list a puzzled look appeared on his face ck whispered pascoe ck repeated danny shaking ah yes said the officer his finger coming to rest on moncrieff sign here dannys hand was shaking as he scribbled nicks signature in the little rectangular box the officer checked the name against the prison number and the photograph before looking up at danny he hesitated for a moment dont hang around moncrieff said pascoe firmly some of us have got a days work to do havent we mr tomkins yes mr pascoe replied the gate officer and quickly pressed the red button beneath his desk the first of the massive electric gates slowly began to open danny stepped out of the gatehouse still not sure in which direction he would be heading pascoe said nothing once the first gate had slipped into the gap in the wall pascoe finally offered good luck lad youll need it danny shook him warmly by the hand thank you mr pascoe he said for everything danny picked up nicks suitcase and stepped into the void between the two different worlds the first gate slid back into place behind him and a moment later the second one began to open danny cartwright walked out of prison a free man the first inmate ever to escape from belmarsh book three freedom chapter thirtyeight as nick moncrieff crossed the road one or two passersby glanced at him in mild surprise it wasnt that they were unaccustomed to seeing prisoners coming out of that gate but not someone carrying a leather suitcase and dressed like a country gentleman danny never once looked back as he walked to the nearest station after hed bought a tickethis first handling of cash for over two yearshe boarded the train he stared out of the window feeling strangely insecure no walls no razor wire no barred gates and no screwsprison officers look like nick talk like nick think like danny at cannon street danny switched to the tube the commuters were moving at a different pace from the one he had become accustomed to in prison several of them were dressed in smart suits speaking in smart accents and dealing in smart money but nick had shown him that they were no smarter than he was they had just started life in a different cot at kings cross nick disembarked lugging his heavy suitcase he passed a policeman who didnt even glance at him he checked the departures board the next train to edinburgh was scheduled to leave at eleven arriving at waverley station at that afternoon he still had time for breakfast he grabbed a copy of the times from a stand outside wh smith hed walked a few paces before he realized he hadnt paid for the paper sweating profusely danny ran back and quickly joined the queue at the till he remembered being told about a prisoner who had just been released and while he was on his way home to bristol had taken a mars bar from a display cabinet on reading station he was arrested for shoplifting and was back in belmarsh seven hours later hed ended up serving another three years danny paid for the paper and walked into the nearest café where he joined another queue when he reached the hotplate he passed his tray across to the girl behind the counter what would you like she asked ignoring the proffered tray danny wasnt sure how to respond for over two years he had just taken whatever ended up on his plate eggs bacon mushrooms and you may as well have the full english breakfast while youre at it she suggested fine the full english breakfast said danny and and tea or coffee yes coffee would be great he said aware that it was going to take him a little time to become used to being given whatever he asked for he found a seat at a table in the corner he picked up the bottle of hp sauce and shook an amount onto the side of the plate that nick would have approved of he then opened his paper and turned to the business pages look like nick talk like nick think like danny internet companies were still falling by the wayside as their owners discovered that the meek rarely inherit the earth by the time danny had reached the front pages hed finished his meal and was enjoying a second cup of coffee someone had not only walked over to his table and refilled his cup but also smiled when he said thank you danny began to read the lead article on the front page the leader of the conservative party iain duncan smith was under attack again if the prime minister called an election danny would have voted for tony blair he suspected that nick would have supported iain duncan smith after all he was another old soldier perhaps he would abstain no he must stay in character if he hoped to fool the voters let alone remain in office danny finished his coffee but didnt move for some time he needed mr pascoe to tell him he could return to his cell he smiled to himself rose from his seat and strolled out of the café he knew the time had come to face his first test when he spotted a row of phone booths he took a deep breath he took out his walletnicks walletextracted a card and dialed the number embossed in the bottom righthand corner munro munro and carmichael announced a voice mr munro please said nick which mr munro danny checked the card mr fraser munro who shall i say is calling nicholas moncrieff ill put you straight through sir thank you good morning sir nicholas said the next lilting voice danny heard how nice to hear from you good morning mr munro danny spoke slowly im thinking of traveling up to scotland later today and i wondered if you might be free to see me sometime tomorrow of course sir nicholas would ten oclock suit you admirably said danny recalling one of nicks favorite words then ill look forward to seeing you here in my office at ten oclock tomorrow morning goodbye mr munro said danny just stopping himself from asking where his office was danny put the phone down he was covered in sweat big al had been right munro was expecting a call from nick why would he have thought for a moment that he might be speaking to someone else danny was among the first to board the train while he waited for it to depart he turned his attention to the sports pages the football season was still a month away but he had high hopes for west ham who had finished seventh in the premier league the previous season he felt a tinge of sadness at the thought that he would never be able to risk visiting upton park again for fear of being recognized no more im forever blowing bubbles try to remember danny cartwright is deadand buried the train pulled slowly out of the station and danny watched london pass by giving way to the countryside he was surprised how quickly they reached full speed he had never been to scotland beforethe farthest north he had ever been was vicarage road watford danny felt exhausted and hed only been out of prison for a few hours the pace of everything was so much quicker and hardest of all you had to make decisions he checked nicks watchhis watcha quarter past eleven he tried to go on reading the paper but his head fell back tickets please danny woke with a start rubbed his eyes and handed his rail warrant to the ticket collector im sorry sir but this ticket isnt valid for the express train youll have to pay a supplement but i was began danny i do apologize how much will that be asked nick eightyfour pounds danny couldnt believe hed made such a stupid mistake he took out his wallet and handed over the cash the ticket collector printed out a receipt thank you sir he said after hed issued danny with his ticket danny noticed that he called him sir without thinking about it not mate as an east end bus driver would have addressed him will you be having lunch today sir once again simply because of his dress and accent yes said danny the dining car is a couple of carriages forward theyll begin serving in about half an hour im grateful another of nicks expressions danny looked out of the window and watched the countryside flying by after they passed through grantham he returned to the financial pages but was interrupted by a voice over the loudspeaker announcing that the dining car was now open he made his way forward and took a seat at a small table hoping that no one would join him he studied the menu carefully wondering which dishes nick would have chosen a waiter appeared by his side the pâté danny said he knew how to pronounce it although he had no idea what it would taste like in the past his golden rule had been never to order anything that had a foreign name followed by the steak and kidney pie and for pudding nick had taught him that you should never order all three courses at once ill think about it said danny of course sir by the time danny had finished his meal he had read everything the times had to offer including the theater reviews which only made him think about lawrence davenport but for now davenport would have to wait danny had other things on his mind he had enjoyed the meal until the waiter gave him a bill for twentyseven pounds he handed over three tenpound notes aware that his wallet was becoming lighter by the minute according to nicks diary mr munro believed that if the estate in scotland and the london house were placed on the market they would fetch handsome sums although he had cautioned that it could be several months before a sale was completed danny knew that he couldnt survive for several months on less than two hundred pounds he returned to his seat and began to give some thought to his meeting with munro the following morning when the train stopped at newcastle upon tyne danny unbuckled the leather straps around the suitcase opened it and found mr munros file he extracted the letters although they contained all of munros replies to nicks questions danny had no way of knowing what nick had written in his original letters he had to try to secondguess what questions nick must have asked after reading munros answers with only the dates and the diary entries as reference points after reading the correspondence again he wasnt in any doubt that uncle hugo had taken advantage of the fact that nick had been locked up for the past four years danny had come across customers like hugo when he worked at the garageloan sharks property dealers and barrow boys who thought they could get the better of him but they never did and none of them ever discovered that he couldnt read a contract he found his mind drifting to the a levels hed taken only days before being released he wondered if nick had passed with flying colorsanother nick expression he had promised his cellmate that if he won his appeal the first thing he would do was study for a degree he intended to keep that promise and take the degree in nicks name think like nick forget danny he reminded himself you are nick you are nick he went over the letters once again as if he was revising for an exam an exam he couldnt afford to fail the train arrived at waverley station at threethirty ten minutes late danny joined the crowd as they walked along the platform he checked the departure board for the time of the next train to dunbroath another twenty minutes he bought a copy of the edinburgh evening news and satisfied himself with a bacon baguette from upper crust would mr munro realize that he wasnt upper crust he went in search of his platform then sat down on a bench the paper was full of names and places he had never heard of problems with the planning committee in duddlingston the cost of the unfinished scottish parliament building and a supplement giving details of something called the edinburgh festival which was taking place the following month hearts and hibss prospects in the forthcoming season dominated the back pages rudely replacing arsenal and west ham ten minutes later danny climbed on board the crosscountry train to dunbroath a journey that took forty minutes stopping at several stations whose names he couldnt even pronounce at fourforty the little train trundled into dunbroath station danny lugged his case along the platform and out onto the pavement relieved to see a single taxi waiting on the stand nick climbed into the front seat while the driver put his case in the boot where to asked the driver once he was back behind the wheel perhaps you can recommend a hotel there is only one said the taxi driver well that solves the problem said danny as the car moved off three pounds fifty later plus a tip and danny was dropped outside the moncrieff arms he walked up the steps through the swing doors and dumped his suitcase by the reception desk i need a room for the night he told the woman behind the counter just a single yes thank you would you please sign the booking form sir danny could now sign nicks name almost without thinking and can i take an imprint of your credit card but i dont began danny ill be paying cash said nick of course sir she swiveled the form around checked the name and tried to hide her surprise she then disappeared into a back room without another word a few moments later a middleaged man wearing a plaid sweater and brown corduroys emerged from the office welcome home sir nicholas im robert kilbride the hotel manager and i do apologize but we werent expecting you ill transfer you to the walter scott suite transfer is a word every prisoner dreads but began danny recalling how little cash was left in his wallet at no extra cost added the manager thank you said nick will you be joining us for dinner yes said nick no said danny remembering his diminishing reserves ive already eaten of course sir nicholas ill have a porter take your case up to the room a young man accompanied danny to the walter scott suite my names andrew he said as he unlocked the door if you need anything just pick up the phone and let me know i need a suit pressed and a shirt washed in time for a ten oclock meeting tomorrow morning said danny of course sir youll have them back well in time for your meeting thank you said danny another tip danny sat on the end of the bed and turned on the television he watched the local news delivered in an accent that reminded him of big al it wasnt until he switched channels to bbc that he was able to follow every word but within a few minutes he had fallen asleep chapter thirtynine danny woke to find he was fully dressed and the credits were running at the end of a black and white film starring someone called jack hawkins he switched it off undressed and decided to take a shower before going to bed he stepped into a shower which sent down a steady stream of warm water that didnt turn itself off every few seconds he washed himself with a bar of soap the size of a bread roll and dried himself with a large fluffy towel he felt clean for the first time in years he climbed into a bed with a thick comfortable mattress clean sheets and more than one blanket before resting his head on a feather pillow he fell into a deep sleep he woke the bed was too comfortable it even changed shape when he moved he peeled off one of the blankets and dumped it on the floor he turned over and fell asleep again he woke the pillow was too soft so it joined the blanket on the floor he fell asleep again and when the sun rose accompanied by a cacophony of unrecognizable bird tunes he woke again he looked around expecting to see mr pascoe standing in the doorway but this door was different it was wooden not steel and it had a handle on the inside that he could open whenever he pleased danny climbed out of bed and walked across the soft carpet to the bathrooma separate roomto take another shower this time he washed his hair and shaved with the aid of a circular glass mirror that magnified his image there was a polite tap on the door which remained closed instead of being heaved open danny put on a hotel dressing gown and opened the door to find the porter standing there holding a neat package your clothes sir thank you said danny breakfast will be served until ten oclock in the dining room danny put on a clean shirt and a striped tie before trying on his freshly pressed suit he looked at himself in the mirror surely no one would doubt that he was sir nicholas moncrieff never again would he have to wear the same shirt for six days in a row the same jeans for a month the same shoes for a yearthat was assuming mr munro was about to solve all his financial problems that was also assuming mr munro danny checked the wallet that had felt so thick only yesterday he cursed he wouldnt have much left once he had settled the hotel bill he opened the door and once hed closed it he immediately realized that hed left the key inside he would have to ask pascoe to open the door for him would he end up on report he cursed again damn a nick curse he went off in search of the dining room a large table in the center of the room was brimming over with a choice of cereals and juices and the hotplate offered porridge eggs bacon black pudding and even kippers to order danny was shown to a table by the window and offered a morning paper the scotsman he turned to the financial pages to find that the royal bank of scotland was expanding its property portfolio while he was in prison danny had watched with admiration the rbss takeover of the natwest bank a minnow swallowing a whale and not even burping he looked around suddenly fearful that the staff might be commenting on the fact that he didnt have a scottish accent but big al had once told him that officers never do nick certainly didnt a pair of kippers was placed in front of him his father would have considered them a right treat first thoughts of his father since he had been released would you care for anything else sir no thank you said danny but would you be kind enough to have my bill ready of course sir came back the immediate reply he was just about to leave the dining room when he remembered he had no idea where mr munros office was according to his business card it was argyll street but he couldnt ask the receptionist for directions because everyone thought hed been brought up in dunbroath danny picked up another key from reception and returned to his room it was ninethirty he still had thirty minutes to find out where argyll street was there was a knock on the door it was still going to be a little time before he didnt leap up and stand at the end of the bed and wait for the door to be opened can i take your luggage sir asked the porter and will you need a taxi no im only going to argyll street danny risked then ill put your case in reception and you can pick it up later is there still a chemist shop on the way to argyll street danny asked no it closed a couple of years ago what do you need just some razor blades and shaving cream youll be able to get those at leith s a few doors down from where johnsons used to be many thanks said danny parting with another pound although he had no idea where johnsons used to be danny checked nicks watch am he walked quickly downstairs and headed for reception where he tried a different ploy do you have a copy of the times no sir nicholas but we could pick one up for you dont trouble yourself i could do with the exercise theyll have one at menzies said the receptionist turn left as you go out of the hotel about a hundred yards she paused but of course you know where menzies is danny slipped out of the hotel and turned left and soon spotted the menzies sign he strolled inside no one recognized him he bought a copy of the times and the girl behind the counter much to his relief addressed him as neither sir nor sir nicholas am i far from argyll street he asked her a couple of hundred yards turn right out of the shop go past the moncrieff arms danny walked quickly back past the hotel checking every intersection until he finally saw the name argyll street carved in large letters on a stone slab above him he checked his watch as he turned into the street he still had a few minutes to spare but he couldnt afford to be late nick was always on time he recalled one of big als favorite lines battles are lost by armies who turn up late ask napoleon as he passed numbers his pace became slower and slower number and then he came to a halt outside a brass plate on the wall that looked as if it had been polished that morning and on ten thousand mornings before displayed the faded imprint of munro munro and carmichael danny took a deep breath opened the door and marched in the girl behind the reception desk looked up he hoped she couldnt hear his heart pounding he was about to give his name when she said good morning sir nicholas mr munro is expecting you she rose from her seat and said please follow me danny had passed the first test but he hadnt opened his mouth yet following the death of your partner said a woman officer standing behind the counter im authorized to pass over all of mr cartwrights personal belongings to you but first i need to see some form of identification beth opened her bag and pulled out her driving license thank you said the officer who checked the details carefully before passing it back if i read out the description of each item miss wilson perhaps youd be kind enough to identify them the officer opened a large cardboard box and removed a pair of designer jeans one pair of jeans light blue she said when beth saw the jagged tear where the knife had entered dannys leg she burst into tears the officer waited until she had composed herself before she continued one west ham shirt one belt brown leather one ring gold one pair of socks gray one pair of boxer shorts red one pair of shoes black one wallet containing thirtyfive pounds and a membership card for the bow street boxing club if youd be kind enough to sign here miss wilson she said finally placing a finger on a dotted line once beth had signed her name she put all dannys possessions neatly back in the box thank you she said as she turned to leave she came face to face with another prison officer good afternoon miss wilson he said my name is ray pascoe beth smiled danny liked you she said and i admired him said pascoe but thats not why im here allow me to carry that for you he said taking the box from her as they started to walk down the corridor i wanted to find out if you still intend to try to have the appeal verdict overturned whats the point said beth now that dannys dead would that be your attitude if he was still alive asked pascoe no of course it wouldnt said beth sharply id go on fighting to prove his innocence for the rest of my life when they reached the front gate pascoe handed the box back to her and said i have a feeling danny would like to see his name cleared chapter forty good morning mr munro said danny thrusting out his hand how nice to see you again and you sir nicholas munro replied i trust you had a pleasant journey nick had described fraser munro so well that danny almost felt he knew him yes thank you the train journey allowed me to go over our correspondence once again and reconsider your recommendations said danny as munro ushered him into a comfortable chair by the side of his desk i fear my latest letter may not have reached you in time said munro i would have telephoned but of course that wasnt possible said danny only interested in what the latest letter contained i fear its not good news said munro tapping his fingers on the deska habit nick hadnt mentioned a writ has been issued against youdanny gripped the arms of his chair were the police waiting for him outsideby your uncle hugo danny breathed an audible sigh of relief i should have seen it coming said munro and therefore i blame myself get on with it danny wanted to say nick said nothing the writ claims that your father left the estate in scotland and the house in london to your uncle and that you have no legal claim over either of them but thats nonsense said danny i entirely agree with you and with your permission i will reply that we intend to defend the action vigorously danny accepted munros judgment although he realized that nick would have been more cautious to add insult to injury munro continued your uncles lawyers have come up with what they describe as a compromise danny nodded still unwilling to offer an opinion if you were to accept your uncles original offer namely that he retains possession of both properties along with responsibility for the mortgage payments he will give instructions to withdraw the writ hes bluffing said danny if i recall correctly mr munro your original advice was to take my uncle to court and make a claim for the money my father borrowed against both houses a matter of two million one hundred thousand pounds that was indeed my advice continued munro but if i recall your response at the time sir nicholashe placed his halfmoon spectacles back on the end of his nose and opened a fileyes here it is your exact words were if those were my fathers wishes i will not go against them that was how i felt at the time munro said danny but circumstances have changed since then i do not believe my father would have approved of uncle hugo issuing a writ against his nephew i agree with you said munro unable to hide his surprise at his clients change of heart so can i suggest sir nicholas that we call his bluff and how would we go about that we could issue a counterwrit replied munro asking the court to make a judgment on whether your father had the right to borrow money against the two properties without consulting you in the first place although i am by nature a cautious man sir nicholas i would go as far as to suggest that the law is on our side however im sure that you read bleak house in your youth quite recently admitted danny then you will be acquainted with the risks of becoming embroiled in such an action but unlike jarndyce and jarndyce said danny i suspect uncle hugo will agree to settle out of court what makes you think that he wont want to see his picture on the front page of the scotsman and the edinburgh evening news both of which would be only too happy to remind their readers where his nephew had been residing for the past four years a point i had not taken into consideration said munro but on reflection i have to agree with you he coughed when we last met you did not seem to be of the opinion that when we last met mr munro i was preoccupied with other matters and was therefore unable to fully grasp the significance of what you were telling me since then i have had time to consider your advice and danny had rehearsed these sentences again and again in his cell with big al playing the role of mr munro quite so said munro removing his spectacles and looking more carefully at his client then with your permission i will take up the cudgels on your behalf however i must warn you that the matter may not be resolved quickly how long asked danny it could be a year even a little longer before the case comes to court that might be a problem said danny im not sure theres enough money in my account at coutts to cover no doubt you will advise me once you have been in touch with your bankers certainly said danny munro coughed again there are one or two other matters i feel we ought to discuss sir nicholas danny simply nodded as munro put his halfmoon spectacles back on and rummaged among the papers on his desk once again you recently executed a will while you were in prison said munro extracting a document from the bottom of the pile remind me of the details said danny recognizing nicks familiar hand on the lined prison paper you have left the bulk of your estate to one daniel cartwright oh my god said danny from that am i to assume that you wish to reconsider your position sir nicholas no said danny recovering quickly its just that danny cartwright died recently then you will need to make a new will at some time in the future but frankly there are far more pressing matters for us to consider at this moment in time like what asked danny there is a key that your uncle seems most anxious to get his hands on a key yes said munro it seems that he is willing to offer you one thousand pounds for a silver chain and key that he believes are in your possession he realizes that they have little intrinsic value but he would like them to remain in the family and so they will responded danny i wonder if i might ask you in confidence mr munro if you have any idea what the key opens no i do not admitted munro on that particular subject your grandfather did not confide in me though i might make so bold as to suggest that if your uncle is so keen to lay his hands on it i think we can assume that the contents of whatever the key opens will be worth far more than a thousand pounds quite so said danny mimicking munro how do wish me to respond to this offer munro asked tell him that you are not aware of the existence of such a key as you wish sir nicholas but i have no doubt that hell not be that easily dissuaded and will come back with a higher offer my reply will be the same whatever he offers said danny firmly so be it said munro may i inquire if it is your intention to settle in scotland no mr munro i shall be returning to london shortly to sort out my financial affairs but be assured i will stay in touch then you will require the keys to your london residence said munro which have been in my safekeeping since your fathers death he rose from his chair and walked across to a large safe in the corner of the room he entered a code and pulled open the heavy door to reveal several shelves stacked with documents he took two envelopes from the top shelf i am in possession of the keys to both the house in the boltons and your estate here in scotland sir nicholas would you care to take charge of them no thank you said danny for the time being i only require the keys for my home in london i would be obliged if you retained the keys to the estate after all i cant be in two places at once quite so said munro handing over one of the bulky envelopes thank you said danny you have served our family loyally over many years munro smiled my grandfather ah said munro with a sigh danny wondered if hed gone too far i apologize for interrupting you but the mention of your grandfather reminds me that there is a further matter that i should bring to your attention he returned to the safe and after rummaging around for a few moments extracted a small envelope ah here it is he declared a look of triumph on his face your grandfather instructed me to hand this to you in person but not until after your father had died i should have carried out his wishes at our previous meeting but with all the er constraints you were under at that time i confess it quite slipped my mind he passed the envelope to danny who looked inside but found nothing does this mean anything to you danny asked no it doesnt confessed munro but recalling your grandfathers lifelong hobby perhaps the stamp might be of some significance danny placed the envelope in an inside pocket without further comment munro rose from his chair i hope sir nicholas that it will not be too long before we see you in scotland again in the meantime should you require my assistance do not hesitate to call i dont know how to repay your kindness said danny im sure that after we have dealt with the problem of your uncle hugo i shall be more than adequately compensated he smiled drily then accompanied sir nicholas to the door shook him warmly by the hand and bade him farewell as munro watched his client stride back in the direction of the hotel he couldnt help thinking how like his grandfather sir nicholas had turned out to be although he wondered if it had been wise of him to wear the regimental tiegiven the circumstances hes done what said hugo shouting down the phone hes issued a counterwrit against you making a claim for the two million one hundred thousand you raised on the two properties fraser munro must be behind this said hugo nick wouldnt have the nerve to oppose his fathers wishes what do we do now accept service of the writ and tell them well see them in court but we cant afford to do that said hugo youve always said that if this case were to end up in court wed loseand the press would have a field day true but it will never come to court how can you be so sure because ill make certain that the case drags on for at least a couple of years and your nephew will have run out of money long before then dont forget we know how much is in his bank account youll just need to be patient while i bleed him dry what about the key munro is claiming that he doesnt know anything about a key offer him more money said hugo if nick ever discovers what that key opens hell be able to watch me bleed to death chapter fortyone on the train back to london danny took a closer look at the envelope nicks grandfather must have wanted him to have without his father knowing but why danny turned his attention to the stamp it was french value five francs and showed the five circles of the olympic emblem the envelope was postmarked paris and dated danny knew from nicks diaries that his grandfather sir alexander moncrieff had been a keen collector so the stamp might possibly be rare and valuable but he had no idea who to turn to for advice he found it hard to believe that the name and address could be of any significance baron de coubertin rue de la croixrouge genève la suisse the baron must have been dead for years from kings cross danny took the tube to south kensingtonnot a part of london in which he felt at home with the aid of an a to z bought from a station kiosk he walked down old brompton road in the direction of the boltons although nicks suitcase was becoming heavier by the minute he didnt feel he could waste any more of his rapidly dwindling reserves on a taxi when he finally reached the boltons danny came to a halt outside number he couldnt believe that only one family had lived there the double garage alone was larger than his home in bow he opened a squeaky iron gate and walked up a long path covered in weeds to the front door he pressed the bell he couldnt think why except that he didnt want to put the key in the lock until he was certain the house was unoccupied no one answered danny made several attempts at turning the key in the lock before the door reluctantly opened he switched on the hall light inside the house was exactly as nick had described it in his diary a thick green carpet faded redpatterned wallpaper faded and long antique lace curtains that hung from ceiling to floor and had been allowed to attract moths over the years there were no pictures on the walls just less faded squares and rectangles to show where they had once hung danny wasnt in much doubt who had removed them and in whose home they were now hanging he walked slowly around the rooms trying to get his bearings it felt like a museum rather than someones home once hed explored the ground floor he climbed the stairs to the landing and walked down another corridor before entering a large double bedroom in a wardrobe hung a row of dark suits that could have been hired out for a period drama along with shirts with wing collars and on a rail at the bottom were several pairs of heavy black brogues danny assumed that this must have been nicks grandfathers room and clearly his father had preferred to stay in scotland once sir alexander had died uncle hugo must have removed the pictures and anything else of value that wasnt nailed down before committing nicks father to a millionpound mortgage on the house while nick was safely locked up in prison danny was beginning to think that he might have to settle with hugo before he could turn his attention to the musketeers having checked all the bedroomsseven in alldanny selected one of the smaller rooms in which to spend his first night after hed looked through the wardrobe and the chest of drawers he concluded that it had to be nicks old room because there was a rack of suits a drawer full of shirts and a row of shoes that fitted him perfectly but looked as if they had been worn by a soldier who spent most of his time in uniform and had little interest in fashion once danny had unpacked he decided to venture higher and find out what was on the top floor he came across a childrens room that looked as if it had never been slept in next door to a nursery full of toys that no child had ever played with his thoughts turned to beth and christy he looked out of the nursery window onto a large garden even in the fading light of dusk he could see that the lawn was overgrown from years of neglect danny returned to nicks room undressed and ran himself a bath he sat in it deep in thought and didnt move until the water had turned cold once hed dried himself he decided against wearing nicks silk pajamas and climbed straight into bed within minutes he was fast asleep the mattress was more like the one he had become accustomed to in prison danny leaped out of bed the following morning pulled on a pair of pants grabbed a silk dressing gown that was hanging on the back of the door and went in search of the kitchen he descended a small uncarpeted staircase to a dark basement where he discovered a large kitchen with an aga and shelves full of glass bottles containing he knew not what he was amused by a line of little bells attached to the wall marked drawing room master bedroom study nursery and front door he began to search for some food but couldnt find anything that hadnt passed its sellby date years before he now realized what the smell was that pervaded the whole house if there was any money in nicks bank account the first thing he needed to do was employ a cleaner he pulled open one of the large windows to allow a gust of fresh air to enter the room into which it hadnt been invited for some time having failed to find anything to eat danny returned to the bedroom to get dressed he chose the least conservative garments he could find from nicks wardrobe but still ended up looking like a guards captain on furlough as eight oclock struck on the church clock in the square danny picked up the wallet from the bedside table and put it in his jacket pocket he looked at the envelope nicks grandfather had left him and decided the stamp had to be the secret he sat down at the desk by the window and wrote out a check to nicholas moncrieff for five hundred pounds was there five hundred pounds in nicks account there was only one way he was going to find out when he left the house a few minutes later he pulled the door closed but this time he remembered to take the keys with him he strolled to the top of the road turned right and walked in the direction of south kensington tube station only stopping to drop into a newsagent and pick up a copy of the times as he was leaving the shop he spotted a noticeboard offering various services massage sylvia will come to your home lawnmower for sale only used twice ono he would have bought it if he had been confident there was in nicks bank account cleaner five pounds an hour references supplied call mrs murphy on danny wondered if mrs murphy had a thousand hours to spare he made a note of her mobile number which reminded him of something else he needed to put on his shopping list but that would also have to wait until he had discovered how much money there was in nicks account by the time he got off the tube at charing cross danny had settled on two plans of action depending on whether the manager of coutts knew sir nicholas well or had never come across him before he walked along the strand looking for the bank on its gray cover nicks checkbook simply stated coutts amp co the strand london clearly it was too grand an establishment to admit it had a number he had not gone far before he spotted a large glassfronted bronze building on the other side of the road discreetly displaying two crowns above the name coutts he crossed the road nipping in and out of the traffic he was about to find out the extent of his wealth he entered the bank through the revolving doors and quickly tried to get his bearings ahead of him an escalator led up to the banking hall he made his way up to a large glassroofed room with a long counter running the length of one wall several tellers dressed in black frock coats were serving customers danny selected a young man who looked as if he had only just started shaving he walked up to his window i would like to make a withdrawal how much do you require sir the teller asked five hundred pounds said danny handing over the check he had written out earlier that morning the teller checked the name and number on his computer and hesitated would you be kind enough to wait for one moment sir nicholas he asked dannys mind started racing was nicks account overdrawn had the account been closed were they unwilling to deal with an excon a few moments later an older man appeared and gave him a warm smile had nick known him sir nicholas he ventured yes said danny one of his questions answered my name is mr watson im the manager its a pleasure to meet you after all this time danny shook him warmly by the hand before the manager said perhaps we could have a word in my office certainly mr watson said danny trying to appear confident he followed the manager across the banking floor and through a door that led into a small woodpaneled office there was a single oil painting of a gentleman in a long black frock coat hanging on the wall behind his desk under the portrait was the legend john campbell founder mr watson began speaking even before danny had sat down i see that you havent made a withdrawal for the past four years sir nicholas he said looking at his computer screen thats correct said danny perhaps you have been abroad no but in future i will be a more regular customer that is if you have been handling my account with care while ive been away i hope you will think so sir nicholas responded the manager we have been paying interest at three percent per annum into your current account year on year danny wasnt impressed but only asked and how much is in my current account the manager glanced at the screen seven thousand two hundred and twelve pounds danny breathed a sigh of relief then asked are there any other accounts documents or valuables in my name which you are holding at the present time the manager looked a little surprised its just that my father died recently the manager nodded ill just check sir he said before pressing some keys on his computer he shook his head it seems that your fathers account was closed two months ago and all his assets were transferred to the clydesdale bank in edinburgh ah yes said danny my uncle hugo hugo moncrieff was indeed the recipient confirmed the manager just as i thought said danny is there anything else i can do for you sir nicholas yes ill need a credit card of course said watson if you fill in this form he added pushing a questionnaire across the table well send one to your home address in the next few days danny tried to remember nicks date and place of birth and his middle name he wasnt sure what to put under occupation or annual earnings theres one other thing said danny once hed completed the form would you have any idea where i can get this valued he took out the little envelope from an inside pocket and slid it across the desk the manager looked at the envelope carefully stanley gibbons he replied without hesitation they are leaders in the field and they have an international reputation where would i find them they have a branch just up the road i would recommend that you have a word with mr prendergast im lucky that youre so well informed said danny suspiciously well they have banked with us for almost a hundred and fifty years danny walked out of the bank with an extra in his wallet and set off in search of stanley gibbons on the way he passed a mobile phone shop which allowed him to tick another item off his shopping list after hed selected the latest model he asked the young assistant if he knew where stanley gibbons was another fifty yards on your left he replied danny continued down the road until he saw the sign over the door inside a tall thin man was leaning on the counter turning the pages of a catalog he stood up straight the moment danny came in mr prendergast asked danny yes he said how may i help you danny took out the envelope and put it on the counter mr watson at coutts suggested that you might be able to value this for me ill do my best said mr prendergast picking up a magnifying glass from under the counter he studied the envelope for some time before he ventured an opinion the stamp is a firstedition fivefranc imperial issued to mark the founding of the modern olympic games the stamp itself is of little value no more than a few hundred pounds but there are two other factors that could possibly add to its importance and what are they asked danny the postmark is dated april sixth and why is that of any significance asked danny trying not to sound impatient that was the date of the opening ceremony of the first modern olympic games and the second factor asked danny not waiting this time the person the envelope is addressed to said prendergast sounding rather pleased with himself baron de coubertin said danny not needing to be reminded correct said the dealer it was the baron who founded the modern olympics and that is what makes your envelope a collectors item are you able to place a value on it asked danny thats not easy sir as the item is unique but i would be willing to offer you two thousand pounds for it thank you but id like a little time to think about it replied danny and turned to leave two thousand two hundred said the dealer as danny closed the door quietly behind him chapter fortytwo danny spent the next few days settling into the boltons not that he thought hed ever really feel at home in kensington that was until he met molly molly murphy hailed from county cork and it was some time before danny could understand a word she was saying she must have been about a foot shorter than danny and was so thin that he wondered if she had the strength to manage more than a couple of hours work a day he had no idea of her age although she looked younger than his mother and older than beth her first words to him were i charge five pounds an hour cash i wont be paying any tax to those english bastards she had added firmly after learning that sir nicholas hailed from north of the border and if you dont think im up to it ill leave at the end of the week danny kept an eye on molly for the first couple of days but it soon became clear that she had been forged in the same furnace as his mother by the end of the week he was able to sit down anywhere in the house without a cloud of dust rising climb into a bath that didnt have a water mark and open the fridge to grab something without fearing hed be poisoned by the end of the second week molly had started making his supper as well as washing and ironing his clothes by the third week he wondered how he had ever survived without her mollys enterprise allowed danny to concentrate on other things mr munro had written to let him know that he had served a writ on his uncle hugos solicitor had allowed the full twentyone days to pass before acknowledging service mr munro warned sir nicholas that galbraith had a reputation for taking his time but assured him that he would keep snapping at his ankles whenever the opportunity arose danny wondered how much this snapping would cost he found out when he turned the page attached to munros letter was a bill for four thousand pounds which covered all the work he had done since the funeral including the serving of the writ danny checked his bank statement which had arrived along with a credit card in the morning post four thousand pounds would make a very large dent on the bottom line and danny wondered how long he could survive before he would have to throw in the towel it might have been a cliché but the expression did remind him of happier times in bow during the past week danny had bought a laptop and a printer a silver photo frame several files assorted pens pencils and erasers as well as reams of paper he had already begun to build a database on the three men who had been responsible for bernies death and he spent most of the first month entering everything he knew about spencer craig gerald payne and lawrence davenport that didnt amount to a great deal but nick had taught him that its easier to pass exams if youve put in the research he had just been about to begin that research when he received munros invoice which reminded him how quickly his funds were drying up then he remembered the envelope the time had come to seek a second opinion he picked up the timesbrought in by molly every morningand turned to an article hed spotted on the arts pages an american collector had bought a klimt for fiftyone million pounds in an auction at somewhere called sothebys danny opened his laptop and googled klimt to discover that he was an austrian symbolist painter he next turned his attention to sothebys which turned out to be an auction house that specialized in fine art antiques books jewelry and other collectible items after a few clicks of the mouse he discovered that collectible items included stamps those wishing to seek advice could do so by calling sothebys or by visiting their offices in new bond street danny thought hed take them by surprise but not today because he was going to the theater and not to see the play the play was not the thing danny had never been to a west end theater before unless he counted a trip on beths twentyfirst to see les misérables at the palace theatre he hadnt enjoyed it that much and didnt think hed bother with another musical he had phoned the garrick the previous day and booked a seat for a matinee performance of the importance of being earnest they had told him to pick up his ticket from the box office fifteen minutes before the curtain rose danny arrived a little early to find that the theater was almost deserted he collected his ticket bought a program and with the assistance of an usher made his way to the stalls where he found his seat at the end of row h just a handful of people were dotted around he opened his program and read for the first time about how oscar wildes play had been an instant hit in when it was first performed at the st jamess theatre in london he had to keep standing up to allow other people to take their seats in row h as a steady stream of ticket holders made their way into the theater by the time the lights went down the garrick was almost full and the majority of seats seemed to be occupied by young girls when the curtain rose lawrence davenport was nowhere to be seen but danny didnt have to wait long because he made his entrance a few moments later a face he would never forget one or two of the audience immediately began clapping davenport paused before delivering his first line as though he expected nothing less danny was tempted to charge up onto the stage and tell the assembled gathering what sort of a man davenport really was and what had taken place at the dunlop arms the night their hero had stood and watched spencer craig stab his best friend to death how differently he had acted in the alley from the swaggering confident man he now portrayed on that occasion he had given a far more convincing performance as a coward like the young girls in the audience dannys eyes never left davenport as the performance continued it became clear that if there was a mirror to gaze in davenport would find it by the time the curtain fell for the interval danny felt he had seen quite enough of lawrence davenport to know just how much hed appreciate a few matinees in jail danny would have returned to the boltons and brought his file up to date if he hadnt found to his surprise how much he was enjoying the play he followed the jostling crowd into a packed bar and waited in a long queue while one barman tried manfully to serve all his wouldbe customers finally danny gave up and decided to use the time to read his program and learn more about oscar wilde who he wished had been featured on the alevel syllabus he became distracted by a highpitched conversation that was taking place between two girls standing at the corner of the bar what did you think of larry asked the first hes wonderful came back the reply pity hes gay but are you enjoying the play oh yes im coming again on closing night how did you manage to get tickets one of the stagehands lives in our street does that mean youll be going to the party afterwards only if i agree to be his date for the night do you think youll get to meet larry its the only reason i said id go out with him a bell sounded three times and several customers quickly downed their drinks before drifting back into the auditorium to take their seats danny followed in their wake when the curtain rose again danny became so engrossed in the play that he almost forgot his real purpose for being there while the girls attention remained firmly focused on dr beresford danny sat back waiting to find out which one of two men would turn out to be earnest when the curtain fell and the cast took their bows the audience rose to their feet shouting and screaming just as beth had done that night but a different kind of scream it only made danny more determined that they should find out the truth about their flawed idol after the final curtain call the chattering crowd spilled out of the theater onto the pavement some headed straight for the stage door but danny made his way back to the box office the box office manager smiled enjoy the show yes thank you do you by any chance have a ticket for the closing night afraid not sir sold out just a single said danny hopefully i dont mind where i sit the box office manager checked his screen and studied the seating plan for the last performance i do have a single seat in row w ill take it said danny passing over his credit card does that allow me to attend the party afterwards no im afraid not said the manager with a smile thats by invitation only he swiped dannys card sir nicholas moncrieff he said looking at him more closely yes thats right said danny the manager printed out a single ticket took an envelope from below the counter and slipped the ticket inside danny continued to read the program on the tube journey back to south kensington and after hed devoured every word on oscar wilde and read about the other plays hed written he opened the envelope to check his ticket c they must have made a mistake he looked inside the envelope and pulled out a card which read the garrick theatre invites you to the closingnight party of the importance of being earnest at the dorchester saturday th september admittance by ticket only pm till heaven knows when danny suddenly realized the importance of being sir nicholas chapter fortythree how interesting how very interesting said mr blundell as he placed his magnifying glass back on the table and smiled at his potential customer how much is it worth asked danny i have no idea blundell admitted but i was told you were one of the leading experts in the field and i like to think i am replied blundell but in thirty years in the business ive never come across anything quite like this he picked up his magnifying glass again bent down and studied the envelope more closely the stamp itself is not all that uncommon but one franked on the day of the opening ceremony is far more rare and for the envelope to be addressed to baron de coubertin the founder of the modern olympics said danny must be even rarer if not unique suggested blundell he ran the magnifying glass over the envelope once again its extremely difficult to put a value on it could you give me a rough estimate perhaps asked danny hopefully if the envelope was purchased by a dealer two thousand two hundred to two thousand five hundred would be my guess by a keen collector perhaps as much as three thousand but should two collectors want it badly enough who can say allow me to give you an example sir nicholas last year an oil painting entitled a vision of fiammetta by dante gabriel rossetti came under the hammer here at sothebys we put an estimate on it of two and a half to three million pounds which was certainly at the high end of the market and indeed all the wellknown dealers had fallen out some time before it reached the high estimate however because andrew lloyd webber and elizabeth rothschild both wanted to add the picture to their collections the hammer came down for the final time at nine million pounds more than double the previous record for a rossetti are you suggesting that my envelope might sell for more than double its valuation no sir nicholas i am simply saying that i have no idea how much it might sell for but can you make sure that andrew lloyd webber and elizabeth rothschild turn up for the sale asked danny blundell lowered his head fearing sir nicholas might see that he was amused by such a suggestion no he said i have no reason to believe that either lord lloyd webber or elizabeth rothschild has any interest in stamps however if you decide to put your envelope into our next sale it would be featured in the catalog and sent to all the leading collectors in the world and when will your next stamp sale be asked danny september the sixteenth replied blundell just over six weeks time that long said danny who had assumed that they would be able to sell his envelope within a few days we are still preparing the catalog and will be mailing it to all our clients at least two weeks prior to the sale danny thought back to his meeting with mr prendergast at stanley gibbons who had offered him for the envelope and probably would have gone as high as if he accepted his offer he wouldnt have to wait for another six weeks nicks latest bank statement showed that he only had so he might well be overdrawn by september th with still no prospect of any income blundell did not hurry sir nicholas who was clearly giving the matter his serious consideration and if he was the grandson of this could be the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship danny knew which of the two options nick would have settled for he would have accepted the original offer of from mr prendergast walked back to coutts and banked the money immediately that helped danny come to a decision he picked up the envelope handed it to mr blundell and said ill leave you to find the two people who want my envelope ill do my best said blundell nearer the time sir nicholas ill see that you are sent a catalog along with an invitation to the sale and may i add how much i always enjoyed assisting your grandfather in the building of his magnificent collection his magnificent collection repeated danny should you wish to add to that collection or indeed to sell any part of it i would be only too happy to offer my services thank you said danny i may well be in touch he left sothebys without another wordhe couldnt risk asking mr blundell questions to which he himself would be expected to know the answers but how else was he going to find out about sir alexanders magnificent collection no sooner was danny back out on bond street than he wished he had accepted prendergasts original offer because even if the envelope raised as much as six thousand it still wouldnt be nearly enough to cover the costs of a prolonged legal battle with hugo moncrieff and if he were to settle the writ before the expenses ran out of control hed still have enough money to survive on for a few more weeks while he looked for a job but unfortunately sir nicholas moncrieff was not qualified to work as an east end garage mechanic in fact danny was beginning to wonder what he was qualified to do danny strolled on up bond street and into piccadilly he thought about the significance if any of blundells words your grandfathers magnificent collection he didnt notice that someone was following him but then the man was a professional hugo picked up the phone hes just left sothebys and hes standing at a bus stop in piccadilly so he must be running out of funds said hugo why did he go to sothebys he left an envelope with a mr blundell the head of the philatelic department it will come up for auction in six weeks time what was on the envelope asked hugo a stamp issued to mark the first modern olympics which blundell estimated to be worth between two and two and a half thousand whens the sale september sixteenth then ill have to be there said hugo putting down the phone how unlike your father to allow one of his stamps to be put up for sale unless said margaret as she folded her napkin im not following you old gal unless what said hugo your father devotes his life to putting together one of the worlds finest stamp collections which not only disappears on the day he dies but isnt even mentioned in his will but what is mentioned are a key and an envelope which he leaves to nick im still not sure what youre getting at old gal the key and the envelope are clearly connected in some way said margaret what makes you think that because i dont believe the stamp is of any importance but two thousand pounds would be a great deal of money to nick at the present time but not to your father i suspect that the name and address on the envelope are far more important because they will lead us to the collection but we still wont have the key said hugo the key will be of little importance if you can prove that you are the rightful heir to the moncrieff fortune danny jumped on a bus for notting hill gate hoping hed be in time for the monthly meeting with his probation officer another ten minutes and he would have had to take a cab ms bennett had written to say that something of importance had come up those words made him nervous though danny knew that if they had found out who he really was he wouldnt have been informed by a letter from his probation officer but would have woken in the middle of the night to find the house surrounded by police although he was becoming more and more confident with his new persona not a day passed when he wasnt reminded that he was an escaped prisoner anything could give him away a second glance a misunderstood remark a casual question to which he didnt know the answer who was your housemaster at loretto which college were you in at sandhurst which rugby team do you support two men stepped off the bus when it came to a halt in notting hill gate one of them began to jog toward the local probation office the other followed close behind but didnt enter the building although danny checked in at reception with a couple of minutes to spare he still had to wait for another twenty minutes before ms bennett was free to see him danny entered a small sparse office that contained only one table and two chairs no curtains and a threadbare carpet that would have been left orphaned at a carboot sale it wasnt much of an improvement on his cell at belmarsh how are you moncrieff asked ms bennett as he sat down in the plastic chair opposite her no sir nicholas no sir just moncrieff behave like nick think like danny im well thank you ms bennett and you she didnt reply simply opened a file in front of her that revealed a list of questions that had to be answered by all former prisoners once a month while they are on probation i just want to bring myself up to date she began have you had any success finding a job as a teacher danny had forgotten that nick intended to return to scotland and teach once he was released from prison no danny replied sorting out my family problems is taking a little longer than i had originally anticipated family problems repeated ms bennett sharply that wasnt the reply she had expected family problems spelled trouble do you wish to discuss these problems no thank you ms bennett said danny im just trying to sort out my grandfathers will theres nothing for you to worry about i will be the judge of that responded ms bennett does this mean you are facing financial difficulties no ms bennett have you found any employment yet she asked returning to her list of questions no but i expect to be looking for a job in the near future presumably as a teacher lets hope so said danny well if that proves difficult perhaps you should consider other employment like what well i see that you were a librarian in prison id certainly be willing to consider that said danny confident that would achieve another tick in another box do you have somewhere to live at the present time or are you staying in a prison hostel i have somewhere to live with your family no i have no family one tick one cross and one question mark she continued are you in rented accommodation or staying with a friend i live in my own house ms bennett looked perplexed no one had ever given that reply to the question before she decided on a tick i have just one more question for you have you during the past month been tempted to commit the same crime as the one you were sent to prison for yes ive been tempted to kill lawrence davenport danny wanted to tell her but nick replied no ms bennett i have not that will be all for now moncrieff ill see you again in a months time dont hesitate to get in touch if you feel i can be of any assistance in the meantime thank you said danny but you mentioned in your letter that there was something of importance did i said ms bennett as she closed the file on her desk to reveal an envelope ah yes youre quite right she handed him a letter addressed to na moncrieff education department hmp belmarsh danny began to read a letter to nick from the uk matriculation board to discover what ms bennett considered important the results of your a level exams are listed below business studies a maths a danny leaped up and punched his fist in the air as if he was at upton park and west ham had scored the winning goal against arsenal ms bennett wasnt sure if she should congratulate moncrieff or press the button under her desk to summon security when his feet touched the ground she asked if its still your intention to take a degree moncrieff ill be happy to assist you with your application for a grant hugo moncrieff studied the sothebys catalog for some considerable time he had to agree with margaret it could only be lot a rare envelope displaying a firstedition stamp celebrating the opening of the modern olympics addressed to the founder of the games baron pierre de coubertin estimate perhaps i should attend one of the viewing days and take a closer look he suggested you will do nothing of the sort said margaret firmly that would only alert nick and he might even work out that its not the stamp were interested in but if i went down to london the day before the sale and found out the address on the envelope wed know where the collection is without having to waste any money buying it but then we wouldnt have a calling card im not sure im following you old gal we may not be in possession of the key but if your fathers only surviving son turns up with the envelope as well as the new will we must have a chance of convincing whoever is holding the collection on his behalf that you are the rightful heir but nick might be at the sale if he hasnt worked out by then that its the address that matters not the stamp it will be too late for him to do anything about it just be thankful of one thing hugo and whats that old gal nick doesnt think like his grandfather danny opened the catalog once again he turned to lot and studied the entry more carefully he was pleased to find such a full description of his envelope if not a little disappointed that unlike several of the other items there was no photograph accompanying it he started to read the conditions of sale and was horrified to discover that sothebys deduct percent of the hammer price from the seller as well as loading a further percent premium on the buyer if he ended up with only he would have been better off selling the envelope to stanley gibbonswhich was exactly what nick would have done danny closed the catalog and turned his attention to the only other letter he had received that morning a booklet and an application form from london university to apply for one of its degree courses he spent some time considering the various options he finally turned to the section marked grant applications aware that if he did honor his promise to nick and beth it was going to mean a considerable change in lifestyle nicks current account was down to with not a single addition to the entry column since he had been released from prison he feared his first sacrifice would have to be molly in which case the house would soon return to the state hed found it in when he had first opened the front door danny had avoided calling mr munro for a progress report on his battle with uncle hugo for fear it would only prompt another bill he sat back and thought about the reason he had been willing to take nicks place big al had convinced him that if he were able to escape anything was possible he was in fact quickly discovering that a penniless man working on his own was in no position to take on three highly successful professionals even if they did think he was dead and long forgotten he thought of the plans he had begun to put in place starting with tonights visit to the final performance of the importance of being earnest its real purpose would come after the curtain had fallen when he attended the closingnight party and came face to face with lawrence davenport for the first time chapter fortyfour danny rose from his place and joined the standing ovation not least because if he hadnt he would have been one of the few people in the theater who was still sitting he had enjoyed the play even more a second time but that was possibly because hed now had a chance to read the script sitting in the third row among the family and friends of the cast had only added to his enjoyment the set designer sat on one side of him and the wife of the producer on the other they invited him to join them for a drink in the extended interval he listened to theater talk rarely feeling confident enough to offer an opinion it didnt seem to matter as they all had unshakable views on everything from davenport s performance to why the west end was full of musicals danny appeared to have only one thing in common with theater folk none of them seemed to know what their next job would be after davenport had taken countless curtain calls the audience slowly made their way out of the theater as it was a clear night danny decided he would walk to the dorchester the exercise would do him good and in any case he couldnt afford the expense of a cab he began to stroll toward piccadilly circus when a voice behind him said sir nicholas he looked around to see the box office manager hailing him with one hand while holding a taxi door open with the other if youre going to the party why dont you join us thank you said danny and climbed in to find two young women sitting on the back seat this is sir nicholas moncrieff said the box office manager as he unfolded one of the seats and sat down to face them nick insisted danny as he sat on the other folding seat nick this is my girlfriend charlotte she works in props and this is katie whos an understudy im paul which part do you understudy nick asked i stand in for eve best whos been playing gwendolen but not tonight said danny no admitted katie as she crossed her legs in fact ive only done one performance during the entire run a matinee when eve had to fulfill a commitment for the bbc isnt that a little frustrating asked danny it sure is but it beats being out of work every understudy lives in hope that theyll be discovered while the lead is indisposed said paul albert finney took over from larry olivier when he was playing coriolanus at stratford and became a star overnight well it didnt happen the one afternoon i was on stage said katie with feeling what about you nick what do you do danny didnt reply immediately partly because no one except his probation officer had ever asked him that question i used to be a soldier he said my brothers a soldier said charlotte im worried that he might be sent to iraq have you ever served there danny tried to recall the relevant entries in nicks diary twice he replied but not recently he added katie smiled at danny as the cab drew up outside the dorchester he remembered so well the last young woman who had looked at him that way danny was the last to climb out of the taxi he heard himself saying let me get this one quite expecting pauls reply to be certainly not thanks nick said paul as he and charlotte strolled into the hotel danny took out his wallet and parted with another ten pounds he could ill affordone thing was certain he would be walking home tonight katie hung back and waited for nick to join her paul tells me this is the second time youve seen the show she said as they made their way into the hotel i came on the offchance youd be playing gwendolen said danny with a grin she smiled and kissed his cheek something else danny hadnt experienced for a long time youre sweet nick she said as she took his hand and led him into the ballroom so what are you hoping to do next asked danny almost having to shout above the noise of the crowd three months of rep with the english touring company understudying again no they cant afford understudies on tour if anyone falls out the program seller takes your place so this is going to be my chance to be on stage and your chance to come and see me where will you be performing asked danny take your choice newcastle sheffield birmingham cambridge or bromley i think it will have to be bromley said danny as a waiter offered them champagne he looked around the overcrowded room everyone seemed to be talking at once those that werent were drinking champagne while others continually moved from person to person hoping to impress directors producers and casting agents in an endless quest to land their next job danny let go of katies hand recalling that not unlike the outofwork actors he had a purpose for being there he slowly scanned the room in search of lawrence davenport but there was no sign of him danny assumed that he would make an entrance later bored with me already asked katie grabbing another glass of champagne from a passing waiter no said danny unconvincingly as a young man joined them hi katie he said kissing her on the cheek have you got another job lined up or are you resting danny took a sausage from a passing tray remembering that he wouldnt be having anything else to eat that night once again he looked around the room in search of davenport his eyes rested on another man he should have realized might be there that evening he was standing in the center of the room chatting to a couple of girls who were hanging on his every word he wasnt as tall as danny remembered from their last encounter but then it had been in an unlit alley and his only interest had been in saving bernies life danny decided to take a closer look he took a pace toward him and then another until he was just a few feet away spencer craig looked straight at him danny froze then realized craig was looking over his shoulder probably at another girl danny stared at the man who had killed his best friend and thought hed got away with it not while im still alive said danny almost loud enough for craig to hear he took another pace forward emboldened by craigs lack of interest another pace and a man in craigs group who had his back to danny instinctively turned around to see who was invading his territory danny came face to face with gerald payne hed put on so much weight since the trial that it was a few seconds before danny recognized him payne turned back uninterested even when he had appeared in the witness box he hadnt given danny a second lookno doubt part of the tactics craig had advised him to adopt danny helped himself to a smoked salmon blini while listening to craigs conversation with the two girls he was delivering an obviously wellrehearsed line about the courtroom being rather like the theater except that you never know when the curtain will fall both girls dutifully laughed very true said danny in a loud voice craig and payne both looked at him but without a flicker of recognition despite the fact that they had seen him in the dock only two years before but at that time his hair had been a lot shorter he had been unshaven and wearing prison clothes in any case why should they give danny cartwright a thought after all he was dead and buried how are you getting on nick danny turned to find paul standing by his side very well thank you said danny better than i expected he added without explanation danny took a pace closer to craig and payne so that they could hear his voice but nothing seemed to distract them from their conversation with the two girls a burst of applause erupted around the room and all heads turned to watch lawrence davenport as he made his entrance he smiled and waved as if he were visiting royalty he made his way slowly across the floor receiving plaudits and praise with every step he took danny remembered f scott fitzgeralds haunting line while the actor danced he could find no mirrors so he leant back to admire his image in the chandeliers would you like to meet him asked paul who had noticed that danny couldnt take his eyes off davenport yes i would said danny curious to discover if the actor would treat him with the same indifference as his fellow musketeers then follow me they began to make slow progress across the crowded ballroom but before they reached davenport danny came to a sudden halt he stared at the woman the actor was addressing with whom it was clear that he was on intimate terms so goodlooking said danny yes he is isnt he agreed paul but before danny could correct him he said larry i want you to meet a friend of mine nick moncrieff davenport didnt bother to shake hands with danny he was just another face in the crowd hoping for an audience danny smiled at davenport s girlfriend hello she said im sarah nick nick moncrieff he replied you must be an actress no far less glamorous im a solicitor you dont look like a solicitor said danny sarah didnt respond she had clearly heard that dull response before and are you an actor she asked ill be whatever you want me to be danny replied and this time she did smile hi sarah said another young man putting an arm around her waist you are without question the most gorgeous woman in the room he said before kissing her on both cheeks sarah laughed id be flattered charlie if i didnt know that its my brother you really fancy not me are you lawrence davenports sister said danny in disbelief someone has to be said sarah but ive learned to live with it what about your friend said charlie smiling at danny i dont think so said sarah nick this is charlie duncan the plays producer pity said charlie and turned his attention to the young men who were surrounding davenport i think he fancies you said sarah but im not id just about worked that out said sarah with a grin danny continued to flirt with sarah aware that he no longer needed to bother with davenport when his sister could undoubtedly tell him everything he needed to know perhaps we might began danny when another voice said hi sarah i was wondering if hello spencer she said coldly do you know nick moncrieff no he replied and after a cursory handshake he continued his conversation with sarah i was just coming across to tell larry how brilliant he was when i spotted you well nows your chance said sarah but i was also hoping to have a word with you i was just about to leave said sarah checking her watch but the partys only just begun cant you hang around a little longer im afraid not spencer i need to go over some papers before briefing counsel its just that i was hoping just as you were on the last occasion we met i think we got off on the wrong foot i seem to remember it being the wrong hand said sarah turning her back on him sorry about that nick said sarah some men dont know when to take no for an answer while others she gave him a gentle smile i hope well meet again how do i began danny but sarah was already halfway across the ballroom the kind of woman who assumes that if you want to find her you will danny turned back to see craig looking more closely at him spencer good of you to come said davenport was i all right tonight never better said craig danny thought it was time to leave he no longer needed to talk to davenport and like sarah he also had a meeting he had to prepare for he intended to be wide awake when the auctioneer called for an opening bid for lot hi stranger where did you disappear to ran into an old enemy said danny and you the usual bunch so boring said katie ive had enough of this party how about you i was just leaving good idea said katie taking him by the hand why dont we jump ship together they walked across the ballroom and headed toward the swing doors once katie had stepped out onto the pavement she hailed a taxi where to miss asked the driver where are we going katie asked nick twelve the boltons right you are guv said the cabbie which brought back unhappy memories for danny danny hadnt even sat down before he felt a hand on his thigh katies other arm draped around his neck and she pulled him toward her im sick of being the understudy she said im going to take the lead for a change she leaned across and kissed him by the time the taxi drew up outside nicks home there were very few buttons left to undo katie jumped out of the cab and ran up the drive as danny paid for a second taxi that night i wish i was your age remarked the cabbie danny laughed and joined katie at the front door it took him some time to get the key in the lock and as they stumbled into the hall she pulled off his jacket they left a trail of clothes all the way from the front door to the bedroom she dragged him onto the bed and pulled him on top of her something else danny hadnt experienced for a long time chapter fortyfive danny jumped off the bus and began walking up bond street he could see a blue flag fluttering in the breeze boldly displaying in gold the legend sothebys danny had never attended an auction before and was beginning to wish hed sat in on one or two other sales before he lost his virginity the uniformed officer on the door saluted him as he walked in as if he were a regular who thought nothing of spending a few million on a minor impressionist where is the stamp sale being held danny asked the woman behind the reception desk up the stairs she said pointing to her right on the first floor you cant miss it do you want a paddle she asked danny wasnt sure what she meant will you be bidding no said danny collecting i hope danny climbed the stairs and walked into a large brightly lit room to find half a dozen people milling around he wasnt certain if he was in the right place until he spotted mr blundell talking to a man in smart green overalls the room was filled with rows and rows of chairs although only a few were occupied at the front where blundell was standing was a highly polished circular podium from which danny assumed the auction would be conducted on the wall behind it was a large screen giving the conversion rates of several different currencies so that any bidders from abroad would know how much they were expected to pay while on the righthand side of the room a row of white telephones were evenly spaced on a long table danny hung around at the back of the room as more people began to stroll in and take their places he decided to sit at the far end of the back row so that he could keep his eye on all those who were bidding as well as the auctioneer he felt like an observer rather than a participant danny leafed through the pages of the catalog although he had already read it several times his only real interest was lot but he noticed that lot an cape of good hope fourpenny red had a low estimate of and a high of making it the most expensive item in the sale he looked up to see mr prendergast from stanley gibbons enter the room and join a small group of dealers who were whispering among themselves at the back of the room danny began to relax as more and more people carrying paddles strolled in and took their seats he checked his watchthe one nicks grandfather had given him for his twentyfirst birthdayit was ten to ten he couldnt help noticing when a man who must have weighed over twentyfive stone waddled into the room carrying a large unlit cigar in his right hand he made his way slowly down the aisle before taking a seat on the end of the fifth row that appeared to have been reserved for him when blundell spotted the mannot that he could have missed himhe left the group he was with and walked across to greet him to dannys surprise they both turned and looked in his direction blundell raised his catalog in acknowledgment and danny nodded the man with the cigar smiled as if he recognized danny and then continued his conversation with the auctioneer the seats were quickly beginning to fill as seasoned customers appeared only moments before blundell returned to the front of the sale room he mounted the halfdozen steps of the podium smiled down at his potential customers and then filled a glass with water before checking the clock on the wall he tapped his microphone and said good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our biannual auction of rare stamps lot number one an enlarged image of the stamp displayed in the catalog appeared on the screen by his side we begin today with a penny black dated in near mint condition do i see an opening bid of one thousand pounds a dealer standing in prendergasts small group at the back raised his paddle one thousand two hundred this was met by an immediate response from a bidder in the third row who six bids later ended up purchasing the stamp for danny was delighted that the penny black had sold for a far higher price than its estimate but as each new lot came under the hammer the prices achieved were inconsistent there seemed no reason to danny why some of them exceeded the high estimate while others failed to reach the low after which the auctioneer said quietly no sale danny didnt want to think about the consequences of no sale when it came to lot danny occasionally glanced at the man with the cigar but there was no sign that he was bidding for any of the early lots he hoped his interest was in the de coubertin envelope otherwise why would blundell have pointed him out by the time the auctioneer had reached lot an assortment of commonwealth stamps which was disposed of in less than thirty seconds for danny was becoming increasingly nervous lot no caused an outbreak of chatter which made danny check his catalog once again the cape of good hope fourpenny red one of only six known in the world blundell opened the bidding at and after some dealers and a few minor collectors had dropped out the only two bidders left appeared to be the man with the cigar and an anonymous telephone bidder danny watched the man with the cigar very closely he didnt seem to give any sign that he was bidding but when mr blundell finally received a shake of the head from the woman on the phone he turned back to him and said sold to mr hunsacker for seventyfive thousand pounds the man smiled and removed the cigar from his mouth danny had become so engrossed in the bidding war that had just taken place that he was taken by surprise when mr blundell announced lot number thirtyseven a unique envelope showing an eighteen ninetysix first edition of a stamp issued by the french government to celebrate the opening ceremony of the modern olympic games the envelope is addressed to the founder of the games baron pierre de coubertin do i have an opening bid of a thousand pounds danny was disappointed that blundell had started the bidding at such a low figure until he saw several paddles being raised around the room fifteen hundred almost as many two thousand not quite as many two thousand five hundred mr hunsacker kept the unlit cigar in his mouth three thousand danny craned his neck and peered around the room but couldnt see where the bidding was coming from three thousand five hundred the cigar remained in the mouth four thousand four thousand five hundred five thousand five thousand five hundred six thousand hunsacker removed his cigar and frowned sold to the gentleman in the front row for six thousand pounds said the auctioneer as he brought the hammer down lot thirtyeight a rare example of danny tried to see who was seated in the front row but he couldnt work out which one of them had bought his envelope he wanted to thank them for bidding three times the high estimate he felt a tap on his shoulder and looked around to see the man with the cigar towering over him my name is gene hunsacker he said in a voice almost as loud as the auctioneers if youd care to join me for a coffee sir nicholas its possible that we may have something of mutual interest to discuss im a texan he said shaking danny by the hand which may not come as a big surprise as we met in washington i had the honor of knowing your granddaddy he added as they left the room and walked down the stairs together danny didnt say a word never offer hostages he had learned since he had begun playing the role of nick when they reached the ground floor hunsacker led him into the restaurant and headed for another seat that appeared to be his by right two black coffees he said to a passing waiter without giving danny any choice now sir nicholas im puzzled puzzled said danny speaking for the first time i cant work out why you let the de coubertin come up for auction and then allowed your uncle to outbid me for it unless you and he were working together and hoped you could force me to go even higher my uncle and i are not on speaking terms said danny selecting his words carefully thats something you have in common with your late granddaddy said hunsacker you were a friend of my grandfathers asked danny friend would be presumptuous said the texan pupil and follower would be nearer the mark he once outfoxed me for a rare twopenny blue way back in when i was still a rookie collector but i learned quickly from him and to be fair he was a generous teacher i keep reading in the press that i have the finest stamp collection on earth but it just aint true that honor goes to your late granddaddy hunsacker sipped his coffee before adding many years ago he tipped me off that hed be leaving the collection to his grandson and not to either of his sons my father is dead danny said hunsacker looked surprised i knowi was at his funeral i thought you saw me i did said danny recalling nicks description of the vast american in his diary but they would only allow me to speak to my solicitor he added quickly yes i know said hunsacker but i managed to have a word with your uncle and let him know that i was in the market should you ever want to dispose of the collection he promised to keep in touch thats when i realized that he hadnt inherited it and that your granddaddy must have kept his word and left the collection to you so when mr blundell phoned to tell me that youd put the de coubertin up for sale i flew back across the pond in the hope that we might meet i dont even know where the collection is admitted danny maybe that explains why hugo was willing to pay so much for your envelope said the texan because he has absolutely no interest in stamps there he is now hunsacker pointed his cigar at a man standing at the reception desk so thats uncle hugo danny thought taking a closer look at him he could only wonder why he wanted the envelope so badly that hed been willing to pay three times its estimated value danny watched as hugo passed a check to mr blundell who in return handed over the envelope youre an idiot muttered danny rising from his place what did you say asked hunsacker the cigar falling out of his mouth me not you said danny quickly its been staring me in the face for the past two months its the address hes after not the envelope because thats where sir alexanders collection has to be gene looked even more puzzled why would nick describe his grandfather as sir alexander i have to go mr hunsacker i apologize i should never have sold the envelope in the first place i wish i knew what in hells name you were talking about said hunsacker taking a wallet from an inside pocket he passed a card across to danny if you ever decide to sell the collection at least give me first option id offer you a fair price with no ten percent deduction and no twenty percent premium either said danny with a grin a chip off the older block said gene your granddaddy was a brilliant and resourceful gentleman unlike your uncle hugo as im sure you realize goodbye mr hunsacker said danny as he tucked the card into nicks wallet his eyes never left hugo moncrieff who had just put the envelope into a briefcase he walked across the lobby to join a woman danny hadnt noticed until that moment she linked her arm in his and the two of them left the building quickly danny waited for a few seconds before following them once he was back on bond street he looked left and then right and when he spotted them he was surprised by how much ground theyd already covered it was clear they were in a hurry they turned right as they passed the statue of churchill and roosevelt sitting on a bench and then left when they reached albemarle street where they crossed the road and walked for a few more yards before disappearing into browns hotel danny hung around outside the hotel for a few moments while he considered his options he knew that if they spotted him they would think it was nick he entered the building cautiously but there was no sign of either of them in the lobby danny took a seat that was half concealed by a pillar but still allowed him a clear view of the lifts as well as reception he didnt pay any attention to a man who had just sat down on the other side of the lobby danny waited for another thirty minutes and began to wonder if hed missed them he was about to get up and check with reception when the lift doors opened and out stepped hugo and the woman pulling two suitcases they walked across to the reception desk where the woman settled the bill before they quickly left the hotel by a different door danny rushed out onto the pavement to see them climbing into the back of a black cab he hailed the next one on the rank and even before he had closed the door shouted follow that cab ive waited all my life to hear someone say that the cabbie responded as he pulled away from the curb the taxi in front turned right at the end of the road and made its way toward hyde park corner through the underpass along brompton road and on to the westway looks like theyre heading for the airport said the cabbie twenty minutes later he was proved right when the two cabs emerged from the heathrow underpass dannys driver said terminal two so they must be flying to somewhere in europe they both came to a halt outside the entrance the meter read and danny handed over forty pounds but remained in the cab until hugo and the woman had disappeared inside the terminal he followed them in and watched as they joined a queue of businessclass passengers the screen above the checkin desk read ba geneva idiot danny muttered again recalling the address on the envelope but where exactly in geneva had it been he looked at his watch he still had enough time to buy a ticket and catch the plane he ran across to the british airways sales counter and had to wait some time before he reached the front of the queue can you get me on the to geneva he asked trying not to sound desperate do you have any luggage sir asked the assistant behind the sales counter none said danny she checked her computer they havent closed the gate yet so you should still be able to make it business or economy economy said danny wanting to avoid the section where hugo and the woman would be seated window or aisle window that will be sir thank you said danny as he passed over his credit card may i see your passport please danny had never had a passport in his life my passport yes sir your passport oh no i must have left it at home then im afraid you wont be in time to catch the plane sir idiot idiot said danny i beg your pardon im so sorry said danny me not you he repeated she smiled danny turned around and walked slowly back across the concourse feeling helpless he didnt notice hugo and the woman leave through the gate marked departures passengers only but someone else did who had been watching both them and danny closely hugo pressed the green button on his mobile just as the loudspeaker announced final call for all passengers traveling to geneva on flight ba please make your way to gate nineteen he followed you from sothebys to the hotel and then from the hotel to heathrow is he on the same flight as us asked hugo no he didnt have his passport with him typical nick where is he now on his way back to london so you should have at least a twentyfourhour start on him lets hope thats enough but dont let him out of your sight for a moment hugo turned off his phone as he and margaret left their seats to board the aircraft have you come across another heirloom sir nicholas asked mr blundell hopefully no but i do need to know if you have a copy of the envelope from this mornings sale said danny yes of course replied blundell we retain a photograph of every item sold at auction in case a dispute should arise at some later date would it be possible to see it asked danny is there a problem asked blundell no danny replied i just need to check the address on the envelope of course repeated blundell he tapped some keys on his computer and a moment later an image of the letter appeared on the screen he swiveled the screen around so that danny could see it baron de coubertin rue de la croixrouge genéve la suisse danny copied down the name and address do you by any chance know if baron de coubertin was a serious stamp collector asked danny not to my knowledge said blundell but of course his son was the founder of one of the most successful banks in europe idiot said danny idiot he repeated as he turned to leave i do hope sir nicholas that you are not dissatisfied with the result of this mornings sale danny turned back no of course not mr blundell i do apologize yes thank you another of those moments when he should have behaved like nick and only thought like danny the first thing danny did when he arrived back at the boltons was to search for nicks passport molly knew exactly where it was and by the way she added a mr fraser munro called and asked you to phone him danny retreated to the study called munro and told him everything that had happened that morning the old solicitor listened to all his client had to say but didnt comment im glad you phoned back he eventually said because i have some news for you although it might be unwise to discuss it over the phone i was wondering when you next expected to be in scotland i could catch the sleeper train tonight said danny good and perhaps it might be wise for you to bring your passport with you this time for scotland said danny no sir nicholas for geneva chapter fortysix mr and mrs moncrieff were ushered into the boardroom by the chairmans secretary the chairman will be with you in a moment she said would you care for coffee or tea while youre waiting no thank you said margaret as her husband began pacing around the room she took a seat in one of the sixteen charles rennie mackintosh chairs placed around the long oak table and that should have made her feel at home the walls were painted in a pale wedgwood blue with fulllength oil portraits of past chairmen hanging on every available space giving an impression of stability and wealth margaret said nothing until the secretary had left the room and closed the door behind her calm down hugo the last thing we need is for the chairman to think were unsure about your claim now come and sit down its all very well old gal said hugo continuing his perambulations but dont forget that our whole future rests on the outcome of this meeting all the more reason for you to behave in a calm and rational manner you must appear as if youve come to claim what is rightfully yours she said as the door at the far end of the room opened an elderly gentleman entered the room although he stooped and carried a silver cane such was his air of authority that no one would have doubted he was the banks chairman good morning mr and mrs moncrieff he said and shook hands with both of them my name is pierre de coubertin and its a pleasure to meet you he added his english revealed no trace of an accent he took a seat at the head of the table below a portrait of an elderly gentleman who but for a large gray mustache was a reflection of himself how may i assist you rather simple really responded hugo i have come to claim the inheritance left to me by my father not a flicker of recognition passed across the chairmans face may i ask what your fathers name was he said sir alexander moncrieff and what makes you think that your father conducted any business with this bank it was no secret within the family said hugo he told both my brother angus and myself on several occasions about his longstanding relationship with this bank which among other things was the guardian of his unique stamp collection do you have any evidence to support such a claim no i do not said hugo my father considered it unwise to commit such matters to paper given our countrys tax laws but he assured me that you were well aware of his wishes i see said de coubertin perhaps he furnished you with an account number no he did not said hugo beginning to show a little impatience but i have been briefed on my legal position by the familys solicitor and he assures me that as i am my fathers sole heir following my brothers death you have no choice but to release what is rightfully mine that may well be the case confirmed de coubertin but i must inquire if you are in possession of any documents that would substantiate your claim yes said hugo placing his briefcase on the table he flicked it open and produced the envelope he had bought from sothebys the previous day he pushed it across to the other side of the table this was left to me by my father de coubertin spent some time studying the envelope addressed to his grandfather fascinating he said but it does not prove that your father held an account with this bank it may be wise at this juncture for me to ascertain if that was indeed the case perhaps youd be kind enough to excuse me for a moment the old man rose slowly from his place bowed low and left the room without another word he knows perfectly well that your father did business with this bank said margaret but for some reason hes playing for time good morning sir nicholas said fraser munro as he rose from behind his desk i trust you had a comfortable journey it might have been more comfortable if i hadnt been painfully aware that my uncle is at this moment in geneva trying to relieve me of my inheritance rest assured responded munro that in my experience swiss bankers do not make hasty decisions no we will come to geneva in good time but for the moment we must deal with more pressing matters that have arisen on our own doorstep is this the problem you felt unable to discuss over the phone asked danny precisely said munro and i fear that i am not the bearer of glad tidings your uncle is now claiming that your grandfather made a second will only weeks before his death in which he disinherited you and left his entire estate to your father do you have a copy of this will asked danny i do replied munro but as i was not satisfied with a facsimile i traveled to edinburgh to attend mr desmond galbraith in his chambers in order that i could inspect the original and what conclusion did you come to asked danny the first thing i did was to compare your grandfathers signature with the one on the original will and said danny trying not to sound anxious i was not convinced but if it is a fake its a damned good one replied munro on a brief inspection i could also find no fault with the paper or the ribbon which appeared to be of the same vintage as those of the original will he executed on your behalf can it get any worse im afraid so said munro mr galbraith also mentioned a letter purportedly sent to your father by your grandfather a short time before he died did they allow you to see it yes it was typewritten which surprised me because your grandfather always wrote his letters by hand he distrusted machinery he described the typewriter as a newfangled invention that would be the death of fine writing what did the letter say asked danny that your grandfather had decided to disinherit you and that he had accordingly written a new will leaving everything to your father particularly clever clever yes if the estate had been divided between both of his sons it would have looked suspicious because too many people were aware that he and your uncle hadnt been on speaking terms for years but this way said danny uncle hugo still ends up with everything because my father left his entire estate to him but you used the word clever does that mean that you have your doubts about whether my grandfather actually wrote the letter i most certainly do said munro and not simply because it was typed it was on two sheets of your grandfathers personal stationery which i recognized immediately but for some inexplicable reason the first page was typed while the second was handwritten and bore only the words these are my personal wishes and i rely on you both to see they are carried out to the letter your loving father alexander moncrieff the first page the typewritten one detailed those personal wishes while the second was not only handwritten but was identical in every word to the one that was attached to the original will quite a coincidence but surely that alone must be enough proof i fear not said munro although we may have every reason to believe that the letter is a fake the facts are that it was written on your grandfathers personal stationery the typewriter used is of the correct vintage and the writing on the second page is unquestionably in your grandfathers hand i doubt if theres a court in the land that would uphold our claim and if that werent enough continued munro your uncle served a trespass order on us yesterday a trespass order said danny not satisfied that the new will claims he is now the rightful heir to both the estate in scotland and the house in the boltons he is also demanding that you vacate the latter within thirty days or he will serve you with a court order demanding rent that is commensurate with that of similar properties in the area backdated to the day you took over occupation so ive lost everything said danny not quite said munro although i admit that matters do look a little bleak on the home front but when it comes to geneva you still have the key i suspect that the bank will be loath to hand over anything that belonged to your grandfather to someone who is unable to produce that key he paused for a moment before he delivered the next sentence and of one thing i am certain if your grandfather had been placed in this position he would not have taken it lying down and neither would i said danny if i had the finances to take hugo on but despite yesterdays sale of the envelope it will only be a matter of weeks before my uncle can add a writ for bankruptcy to the long list of actions we are already defending mr munro smiled for the first time that morning i had anticipated this problem sir nicholas and yesterday afternoon my partners and i discussed what we should do about your current dilemma he coughed they were of the unanimous opinion that we should break with one of our longheld customs and not present any further bills until this action has reached a satisfactory conclusion but should the case fail when it comes to courtand let me assure you mr munro that i have some experience in these mattersi would end up being perpetually in your debt should we fail replied munro no bills will be presented because this firm remains perpetually in your grandfathers debt the chairman returned after a few minutes and resumed the place opposite his wouldbe customers he smiled mr moncrieff he began i have been able to confirm that sir alexander did indeed conduct some business with this bank we must now attempt to establish your claim to be the sole heir to his estate i can supply you with any documentation you require said hugo with confidence first i must ask you if you are in possession of a passport mr moncrieff yes i am replied hugo who opened his briefcase extracted his passport and handed it across the table de coubertin turned to the back page and studied the photograph for a moment before returning the passport to hugo do you have your fathers death certificate he asked yes replied hugo taking a second document from his briefcase and pushing it across the table this time the chairman studied the document a little more carefully before nodding and handing it back and do you also have your brothers death certificate he asked hugo passed over a third document once again de coubertin took his time before handing it back i will also need to see your brothers will to confirm that he left the bulk of the estate to you hugo handed over the will and put another tick against the long list galbraith had prepared for him de coubertin did not speak for some time while he studied angus moncrieffs will that all seems to be in order he said eventually but most important of all are you in possession of your fathers will not only am i able to supply you with his last will and testament said hugo signed and dated six weeks before his death but i am also in possession of a letter he wrote to my brother angus and myself that was attached to that will hugo slid both documents across the table but de coubertin made no attempt to study either of them and finally mr moncrieff i must ask if there was a key among your fathers bequests hugo hesitated there most certainly was said margaret speaking for the first time but unfortunately it has been mislaid although i have seen it many times over the years its quite small silver and if i remember correctly it has a number stamped on it and do you recall that number by any chance mrs moncrieff asked the chairman unfortunately i do not margaret finally admitted in that case im sure you will appreciate the banks dilemma said de coubertin as you can imagine without the key we are placed in an invidious position however he added before margaret could interrupt i will ask one of our experts to study the will which as im sure you are aware is common practice in such circumstances should they consider it to be authentic we will hand over any possessions we are holding in sir alexanders name but how long will that take asked hugo aware that it would not take nick long to work out where they were and what they were up to a day a day and a half at the most said the chairman when should we return asked margaret to be on the safe side let us say three oclock tomorrow afternoon thank you said margaret we look forward to seeing you then de coubertin accompanied mr and mrs moncrieff to the banks front door without discussing anything more significant than the weather ive booked you on a ba businessclass flight to barcelona said beth you fly from heathrow on sunday evening and youll be staying at the arts hotel she handed her boss a folder which contained all the documents he would need for the trip including the names of several recommended restaurants and a guide to the city the conference opens at nine oclock with a speech from the international president dick sherwood youll be sitting on the platform along with the other seven vps the organizers have asked you to be in your place by eight fortyfive how far away from the conference center is the hotel asked mr thomas its just across the road said beth is there anything else you need to know just one thing thomas replied how would you like to join me for the trip beth was taken by surprise something thomas didnt manage that often and admitted ive always wanted to visit barcelona well nows your chance said thomas giving her a warm smile but would there be enough for me to do while i was there asked beth for a start you could make sure im sitting in my place on time next monday morning beth didnt respond i was rather hoping you might relax for a change added thomas we could go to the opera take in the thyssen collection study picassos early work see mirós birthplace and they tell me that the food you do realize that mr thomas fancies you dannys words came flooding back and caused beth to smile its very kind of you mr thomas but i think it might be wiser if i were to stay behind and make sure that everything runs smoothly while youre away beth said thomas sitting back and folding his arms youre a bright beautiful young woman dont you think danny would have wanted you to enjoy yourself occasionally god knows youve earned it its very thoughtful of you mr thomas but im not quite ready to consider i understand said thomas of course i do in any case im quite content to wait until youre ready whatever it was that danny possessed i havent yet calculated the premium thats required to insure against it beth laughed hes like the opera the art galleries and the finest wine all wrapped up in one she replied and even then you wont have captured danny cartwright well i dont intend to give up said thomas maybe ill be able to tempt you next year when the annual conference is in rome and it will be my turn to be president caravaggio sighed beth caravaggio repeated thomas looking puzzled danny and i had planned to spend our honeymoon in saint tropezthat was until he was introduced to caravaggio by his cellmate nick moncrieff in fact one of the last things danny promised me before he diedbeth could never get herself to utter the words committed suicidewas that he would take me to rome so i could also meet signor caravaggio i dont have a chance do i said thomas beth didnt reply danny and mr munro touched down at geneva airport later that evening once they had cleared customs danny went in search of a taxi the short journey into the city ended when the driver pulled up outside the hôtel les armeurs situated in the old town near the cathedralhis personal recommendation munro had called de coubertin before leaving his office the chairman of the bank had agreed to see them at ten oclock the following morning danny was beginning to think that the old man was rather enjoying himself over dinner mr munrodanny didnt consider even for a moment calling him frasertook sir nicholas through the list of documents he anticipated would be required for their meeting in the morning are we missing anything asked danny certainly not said munro that is assuming youve remembered to bring the key hugo picked up the phone on his bedside table yes he took the overnight train to edinburgh and then traveled on to dunbroath said a voice in order to see munro no doubt in his office at ten oclock this morning did he then return to london no he and munro left the office together drove to the airport and caught a ba flight they should have landed an hour ago were you on the same flight no said the voice why not asked hugo sharply i didnt have my passport with me hugo put the phone down and looked across at his wife who was fast asleep he decided not to wake her chapter fortyseven danny lay awake considering the precarious position he was in far from vanquishing his foes he seemed only to have created new ones who were bent on bringing him to his knees he rose early showered and dressed and went down to the breakfast room to find munro seated at a corner table a pile of documents by his side they spent the next forty minutes going over any questions munro thought de coubertin might ask danny stopped listening to his lawyer when a fellow guest entered the room and went straight to a table by the window that overlooked the cathedral another seat that he evidently assumed would be reserved for him should de coubertin ask you that question sir nicholas how will you respond asked munro i think the worlds leading stamp collector has decided to join us for breakfast whispered danny from that i assume your friend mr gene hunsacker is among us no less i cant believe its a coincidence that hes in geneva at the same time as we are certainly not said munro and hell also be aware that your uncle is in geneva what can i do about it asked danny not a lot for the moment said munro hunsacker will circle like a vulture until he discovers which of you has been anointed as the legitimate heir to the collection and only then will he swoop hes a little overweight for a vulture suggested danny but i take your point what do i tell him if he starts asking me questions you say nothing until after weve had our meeting with de coubertin but hunsacker was so helpful and friendly the last time we met and it was obvious that he doesnt care for hugo and would prefer to deal with me dont deceive yourself hunsacker will be happy to do business with whoever de coubertin decides is the rightful heir to your grandfathers collection hes probably already made your uncle an offer munro rose from the table and left the dining room without even glancing in hunsackers direction danny followed him into the lobby how long will it take for us to get to the banque de coubertin by taxi munro asked the concierge three possibly four minutes depending on the traffic came back the reply and if we walk three minutes a waiter tapped softly on the door room service he announced before entering he set up a breakfast table in the center of the room and placed a copy of the telegraph on a side plate the only newspaper margaret moncrieff would consider reading if the scotsman wasnt available hugo signed for the breakfast as margaret took her place and poured them both coffee do you think well get away with it old gal without the key asked hugo if theyre convinced the will is genuine said margaret theyll have no choice unless theyre prepared to involve themselves in a lengthy court battle and as anonymity is a swiss bankers mantra theyll avoid that at all costs theyre not going to find anything wrong with the will said hugo then my bet is that well be in possession of your fathers collection by this evening in which case all youll have to do is agree a price with hunsacker as he offered you forty million dollars when he came up to scotland for your fathers funeral i feel sure hed be willing to go to fifty said margaret in fact i have already instructed galbraith to draw up a contract to that effect with whichever one of us secures the collection said hugo because by now nick will have worked out why were here but he cant do anything about it said margaret not while hes stranded in england theres nothing to stop him jumping on the next plane i wouldnt be surprised if hes here already added hugo not wanting to admit that he knew nick was in geneva youve obviously forgotten hugo that hes not allowed to travel abroad while hes on probation if it was me id be willing to take that risk said hugo for fifty million dollars you might said margaret but nick would never disobey an order and even if he did it would only take one phone call to help de coubertin decide which branch of the moncrieff family he wants to do business withthe one threatening to take him to court or the one who will be spending another four years in jail although danny and fraser munro arrived at the bank a few minutes early the chairmans secretary was waiting in reception to accompany them to the boardroom once they were seated she offered them both a cup of english tea i wont be having any of your english tea thank you said munro giving her a warm smile danny could only wonder if she had understood a word the scotsman had said let alone comprehended his particular brand of humor two coffees please said danny she smiled and left the room danny was admiring a portrait of the founder of the modern olympic games when the door opened and the present holder of the title entered the room good morning sir nicholas he said walking up to munro offering his hand no no my name is fraser munro i am sir nicholass legal representative i apologize said the old man trying to hide his embarrassment he smiled shyly as he shook hands with danny i apologize he repeated not at all baron said danny an understandable mistake de coubertin gave him a slight bow like me you are the grandson of a great man he invited sir nicholas and mr munro to join him at the boardroom table what can i do for you he asked i had the great honor of representing the late sir alexander moncrieff began munro and i now have the privilege of advising sir nicholas de coubertin nodded we have come to claim my clients rightful inheritance said munro opening his briefcase and placing on the table one passport one death certificate and sir alexanders will thank you said de coubertin not giving any of the documents even a cursory glance sir nicholas may i ask if you are in possession of the key that your grandfather left you yes i am danny replied he undid the chain that hung around his neck and handed the key across to de coubertin who studied it for a moment before returning it to danny he then rose from his place and said please follow me gentlemen dont say a word whispered munro as they followed the chairman out of the room its clear that hes carrying out your grandfathers instructions they walked down a long corridor passing even more oil paintings of partners of the bank until they came to a small elevator when the doors slid open de coubertin stood to one side to allow his guests to step in then joined them and pressed a button marked he didnt speak until the doors opened again when he stepped out and repeated please follow me gentlemen the soft wedgwood blue of the boardroom walls had been replaced by a dull ocher as they walked on down a brick corridor that displayed no pictures of the banks past officeholders at the end of the corridor was a large steel barred gate which brought back unhappy memories for danny a guard unlocked the gate the moment he spotted the chairman he accompanied the three of them until they came to a halt outside massive steel door with two locks de coubertin took a key from his pocket placed it in the top lock and turned it slowly he nodded to danny who put his key in the lock below and also turned it the guard pulled open the heavy steel door a twoinchwide yellow strip had been painted on the ground just inside the doorway danny crossed it and walked into a small square room whose walls were covered from floor to ceiling with shelves crammed with thick leatherbound books on each shelf were printed cards indicating the years to please join me said danny as he removed one of the thick leather books from the top shelf and began to leaf through the pages munro walked in but de coubertin did not follow i apologize he said but i am not allowed to cross the yellow lineone of the banks many regulations perhaps you would be kind enough to inform the guard when you wish to leave and then do come and join me back in the boardroom danny and munro spent the next half hour turning the pages of album after album and began to understand why gene hunsacker had flown all the way from texas to geneva im none the wiser said munro as he looked at an unperforated sheet of fortyeight penny blacks you will be after youve had a look at this one said danny passing him the only leatherbound book in the entire collection that was not dated munro turned the pages slowly to be reacquainted with the neat calligraphic hand he remembered so well column after column listing when where and from whom sir alexander had acquired each new acquisition and the price hed paid he handed the meticulous record of the collectors life back to danny and suggested youre going to have to study each entry most carefully before you next bump into mr hunsacker mr and mrs moncrieff were shown into the boardroom at pm baron de coubertin was seated at the far end of the table with three colleagues on each side of him all seven men rose from their chairs as the moncrieffs entered the room and didnt resume their places until mrs moncrieff had sat down thank you for allowing us to inspect your late fathers will said de coubertin as well as the attached letter hugo smiled however i must inform you that in the considered opinion of one of our experts the will is invalid are you suggesting that its a fake said hugo angrily rising from his place we are not suggesting for a moment mr moncrieff that you were aware of this however we have decided that these documents do not stand up to the scrutiny required by this bank he passed the will and the letter across the table but began hugo are you able to tell us what in particular prompted you to reject my husbands claim asked margaret quietly no madam we are not then you can expect to hear from our lawyers later today said margaret as she gathered up the documents placed them back in her husbands briefcase and rose to leave all seven members of the board stood as mr and mrs moncrieff were escorted from the room by the chairmans secretary chapter fortyeight when fraser munro joined danny in his room the following morning he found his client sitting crosslegged on the floor in his dressing gown surrounded by sheets of paper a laptop and a calculator i apologize for disturbing you sir nicholas shall i come back later no no said danny as he leaped up come in i trust you slept well said munro as he looked down at the mass of paperwork littering the floor i havent been to bed admitted danny i was up all night checking over the figures again and again and are you any the wiser asked munro i hope so said danny because i have a feeling that gene hunsacker didnt lose any sleep wondering what this lot is worth do you have any idea well said danny the collection consists of twentythree thousand one hundred and eleven stamps purchased over a period of more than seventy years my grandfather bought his first stamp in at the age of thirteen and he continued collecting until only a few months before he died in total he spent no wonder hunsacker thinks its the finest collection on earth said munro danny nodded some of the stamps are incredibly rare there is for example a us onecent inverted center a hawaiian twocent blue from and a newfoundland twopenny scarlet which he paid for in but the pride of the collection has to be an british guiana onecent black on magenta which he bought at auction in april for thats the good news said danny the not so good news is that it would take a year possibly even longer to have every stamp valued hunsacker knows that of course but in our favor is that he wont want to hang around waiting for a year because among other things ive picked up from the odd article my grandfather kept is that hunsacker has a rival a mr tomoji watanabe a commodities dealer from tokyo it appears danny said as he bent down to pick up an old cutting from time magazine to be a matter of opinion which one of their collections was second only to my grandfathers that argument would be settled the moment one of them gets his hands on this said danny holding up the inventory that piece of knowledge may i suggest said munro places you in a very strong position possibly said danny but when you get into amounts of this sizeand on a quick calculation the collection must be worth around fifty million dollarsthere are very few people on earth and i suspect in this case only two who could even consider joining in the bidding so i cant afford to overplay my hand im lost said munro lets hope im not once the game of poker begins because i suspect that if the next person to knock on that door isnt the waiter wanting to set up breakfast it will be mr gene hunsacker hoping to buy a stamp collection hes been after for the past fifteen years so id better take a shower and get dressed i wouldnt want him to think ive been up all night trying to work out how much i ought to be asking for mr galbraith please who shall i say is calling hugo moncrieff ill put you straight through sir how did you get on in geneva were galbraiths first words we left emptyhanded what how can that be possible you had every document you needed to validate your claim including your fathers will de coubertin said the will was a fake and virtually threw us out of his office but i dont understand said galbraith sounding genuinely surprised i had it examined by the leading authority in the field and it passed every known test well de coubertin clearly doesnt agree with your leading authority so im phoning to ask what our next move should be ill call de coubertin immediately and advise him to expect service of a writ both in london and geneva that will make him think twice about doing business with anyone else until the authenticity of the will has been resolved in the courts perhaps the time has come for us to set in motion the other matter we discussed before i flew to geneva all ill need if im to do that said galbraith is your nephews flight number you were right said munro when danny emerged from the bathroom twenty minutes later about what asked danny the next person to knock on that door was the waiter munro added as danny took his place at the breakfast table a bright young man who was happy to give me a great deal of information then he cant have been swiss said danny as he unfolded his napkin it appears continued munro that mr hunsacker booked into the hotel two days ago the management sent a limousine to the airport to pick him up from his private jet the young man was also able to tell me in return for ten swiss francs that his hotel booking is openended a sound investment said danny even more interesting is the fact that the same limousine drove hunsacker to the banque de coubertin yesterday morning where he had a fortyminute meeting with the chairman to view the collection no doubt suggested danny no said munro de coubertin would never allow anyone near that room without your authority that would break every tenet of the banks policy in any case it wouldnt have been necessary why not asked danny surely you remember that when your grandfather put his entire collection on display at the smithsonian institution in washington to celebrate his eightieth birthday one of the first people to walk through the doors on the opening morning was mr hunsacker what else did the waiter tell you asked danny without missing a beat mr hunsacker is at this moment having breakfast in his room on the floor above us presumably waiting for you to knock on his door then hes going to have a long wait said danny because i dont intend to be the first to blink pity said munro id been looking forward to the encounter i once had the privilege of attending a negotiation in which your grandfather was involved by the end of the meeting i left feeling battered and bruisedand i was on his side danny laughed there was a knock on the door sooner than i thought said danny it might be your uncle hugo brandishing another writ suggested munro or just the waiter coming to take away the breakfast things either way ill need a moment to clear up these papers cant have hunsacker thinking i dont know what the collection is worth danny knelt down on the floor and munro joined him as they began gathering up reams of scattered papers there was another knock on the door this time a little louder danny disappeared into the bathroom with all the papers while munro went across to open the door good morning mr hunsacker how nice to see you again we met in washington he added offering his hand but the texan barged past him clearly looking for danny the bathroom door opened a moment later and danny reappeared wearing a hotel dressing gown he yawned and stretched his arms what a surprise mr hunsacker he said to what do we owe this unexpected pleasure surprise be damned said hunsacker you saw me at breakfast yesterday im pretty hard to miss and you can cut out the yawning act i know youve already had breakfast he said glancing at a halfeaten piece of toast at a cost of ten swiss francs no doubt said danny with a grin but do tell me what brings you to geneva he added as he sank back in the only comfortable chair in the room you know damn well why im in geneva said hunsacker lighting his cigar this is a nonsmoking floor danny reminded him crap said hunsacker flicking ash onto the carpet so how much do you want for what mr hunsacker dont play games with me nick how much do you want i confess i was discussing that very subject with my legal adviser only moments before you knocked on the door and he wisely recommended that i should wait a little longer before i commit myself why wait you dont have any interest in stamps true said danny but perhaps there are others who do like who mr watanabe for example suggested danny youre bluffing thats what he said about you youve already been in touch with watanabe not yet admitted danny but im expecting him to call any minute name your price sixtyfive million dollars said danny youre crazy thats double what its worth and you do realize that im the only person on earth who can afford to buy the collection it would only take you one phone call to discover that watanabes not in my league then i shall have to split the collection up said danny after all mr blundell assured me that sothebys could guarantee me a large income for the rest of my life without ever having to flood the market that would give both you and mr watanabe the chance to cherrypick any particular items you are keen to add to your collection while at the same time you paid a ten percent sellers premium on everything in the collection hunsacker said jabbing his cigar at him and dont lets forget your twenty percent buyers premium danny countered and lets face it gene im thirty years younger than you so im not the one whos in a hurry id be willing to pay fifty million said hunsacker danny was taken by surprise as he had expected hunsacker to open the bidding at around forty million but he didnt blink id be willing to drop to sixty youd be willing to drop to fiftyfive said hunsacker not for a man who flew halfway round the world in his private jet simply to find out who would end up owning the moncrieff collection fiftyfive hunsacker repeated sixty insisted danny no fiftyfive is my limit and ill wire the full amount to any bank in the world which means it would be in your account within the next couple of hours why dont we toss for the last five million because that way you cant lose fiftyfive is what i said you can take it or leave it i think ill leave it said danny rising from his chair have a good flight back to texas gene and do give me a call if there is a particular stamp youd like to make an offer for before i phone mr watanabe ok ok ill toss you for the last five million danny turned back to his lawyer would you be kind enough to act as referee mr munro umpire said hunsacker yes of course munro replied danny handed him a pound coin and was surprised to see that munros hand was shaking as he balanced it on the end of his thumb he tossed it high in the air heads called hunsacker the coin landed in the thick rug by the fireplace it was standing upright on its edge lets settle on said danny its a deal said hunsacker who bent down picked up the coin and put it in his pocket i think youll find thats mine said danny holding out his hand hunsacker handed over the coin and grinned now give me the key nick so i can inspect the goods theres no need for that said danny after all you saw the whole collection when it was on display in washington however i will allow you to have my grandfathers ledger he said picking up the thick leather book from a side table and handing it to him as for the key he added with a smile mr munro will deliver it to you the moment the money is lodged in my account i think you said it would take a couple of hours hunsacker started walking toward the door and gene hunsacker turned back try to make it before the sun sets in tokyo desmond galbraith picked up the private line on his desk im reliably informed by one of the hotel staff said hugo moncrieff that they are both booked on ba flight which leaves here at pm and touches down at heathrow at pm thats all i need to know said galbraith well be flying back to edinburgh first thing in the morning which should give de coubertin more than enough time to reflect on which branch of the moncrieff family hed prefer to do business with would you care for a glass of champagne asked the stewardess no thank you said munro just a scotch and soda and for you sir ill have a glass of champagne thank you said danny after the stewardess had gone he turned to ask munro why do you think the bank didnt take my uncles claim seriously after all he must have shown de coubertin the new will they must have spotted something i missed said munro why dont you call de coubertin and ask him what it was that man wouldnt admit hed ever met your uncle let alone seen your grandfathers will still now that you have almost sixty million dollars in the bank i presume youll want me to defend all the writs i wonder what nick would have done mumbled danny as he fell into a deep sleep munro raised an eyebrow but didnt press his client further when he remembered that sir nicholas hadnt been to bed the previous night danny woke with a start when the wheels touched down at heathrow he and munro were among the first to disembark from the aircraft as they walked down the steps they were surprised to see three policemen standing on the tarmac munro noticed that they were not carrying machine guns so they couldnt be security as dannys foot touched the bottom step two of the policemen grabbed him while the third pinned his arms behind his back and handcuffed him youre under arrest moncrieff said one of them as they marched him off on what charge demanded munro but he didnt get a response because the police car siren blaring was already speeding away danny had spent most days since his release wondering when theyd finally catch up with him the only surprise was that theyd called him moncrieff beth could no longer bear to look at her father whom she hadnt spoken to for days despite being forewarned by the doctor she couldnt believe how emaciated hed become in such a short time father michael had visited his parishioner every day since he had been bedridden and that morning he had asked beths mother to gather the family and close friends around the bedside that evening as he could no longer delay conducting the last rites beth beth was taken by surprise when her father spoke yes dad she said taking his hand whos running the garage he asked in a piping voice that was almost inaudible trevor sutton she replied softly hes not up to it youll have to appoint someone else and soon i will dad beth replied dutifully she didnt tell him that no one else wanted the job are we alone he asked after a long pause yes dad mums in the front room talking to mrs mrs cartwright yes admitted beth thank god for her common sense her father paused to take another breath before adding which youve inherited beth smiled even the effort of talking was now almost beyond him tell harry he suddenly said his voice even weaker id like to see them both before i die beth had stopped saying youre not going to die some time ago and simply whispered in his ear of course i will dad another long pause another struggle for breath before he whispered promise me one thing anything he gripped his daughters hand youll fight on to clear his name the grip suddenly weakened and his hand went limp i will said beth although she knew he couldnt hear her chapter fortynine mr munros office had left several messages on his mobile asking him to call urgently he had other things on his mind sir nicholas had been whisked off in a police car to spend the night in a cell at paddington green police station when mr munro left him he made his way by taxi to the caledonian club in belgravia he blamed himself for not remembering that sir nicholas was still on probation and was not allowed to leave the country perhaps it was simply that he could never think of him as a criminal when munro arrived at his club just after eleventhirty he found miss davenport waiting for him in the guest lounge the first thing he needed to ascertain and very quickly was whether she was up to the job that took him about five minutes he had rarely come across anyone who grasped the salient points of a case so quickly she asked all the right questions and he could only hope that sir nicholas had all the right answers by the time they parted just after midnight munro was in no doubt that his client was in good hands sarah davenport hadnt needed to remind munro of the courts attitude to prisoners who broke their parole conditions and how rarely exceptions were made especially when it came to traveling abroad without seeking approval from their probation officer both she and munro were fully aware that a judge would probably send nick back to prison to complete the remaining four years of his sentence miss davenport would of course plead mitigating circumstances but she wasnt at all optimistic about the outcome munro had never cared for lawyers who were optimistic she promised to call him in dunbroath the moment the judge had delivered his verdict as munro was about to make his way upstairs to his room the porter told him there was another message to call his son as soon as possible so whats so urgent was munros first question as he sat on the end of the bed galbraith has withdrawn all his pending writs whispered hamish munro not wanting to wake his wife as well as the trespass order demanding that sir nicholas vacate his home in the boltons within thirty days is this total capitulation dad or am i missing something he asked after hed quietly closed the bathroom door the latter i fear my boy galbraiths done no more than sacrifice the irrelevant in order to capture the only prize thats really worth having getting the court to legitimize sir alexanders second will youve got it in one said munro if he is able to prove that sir alexanders new will leaving everything to his brother angus supersedes any previous wills then it will be hugo moncrieff and not sir nicholas who inherits the estate including a bank account in switzerland that is now showing a balance of at least galbraith must be confident that the second will is genuine he may well be but i know someone else who isnt quite so confident by the way dad galbraith called again just as i was leaving the office he wanted to know when youd be returning to scotland did he indeed said munro which begs the question how did he know i wasnt in scotland when i told you that i hoped wed meet again said sarah an interview room at paddington green police station wasnt exactly what i had in mind danny smiled ruefully as he looked across the small wooden table at his new solicitor munro had explained that he could not represent him in an english court of law however he could recommendno danny had responded i know exactly who i want to represent me im flattered sarah continued that when you found yourself in need of legal advice i was your first choice you were my only choice admitted danny i dont know any other solicitors he regretted his words the moment hed said them and to think ive been up half the night im sorry said danny thats not what i meant its just that mr munro told me i know what mr munro told you said sarah with a smile now we dont have any time to waste youll be up in front of the judge at ten oclock and although mr munro has fully briefed me on what youve been up to for the past couple of days i still have a few questions of my own that need answering as i dont want to be taken by surprise once were in the court so please be frankand by that i mean honest have you at any time in the past twelve months traveled abroad other than on this one occasion when you visited geneva no danny replied have you failed to attend any meetings with your probation officer since you left prison no never did you at any time make an attempt to contact good morning mr galbraith said munro i apologize for not contacting you earlier but i have a feeling that you are only too aware of what caused me to be detained indeed i am responded galbraith which is precisely the reason i needed to speak to you so urgently you will know that my client has withdrawn all pending actions against sir nicholas so id rather hoped given these circumstances that your client will wish to respond in the same magnanimous manner and withdraw his writ disputing the validity of his grandfathers most recent will you can assume nothing of the sort retorted munro sharply that would only result in your client ending up with everything including the kitchen sink your response comes as no surprise to me munro indeed i have already forewarned my client that would be your attitude and we would be left with no choice but to contest your vexatious writ however galbraith added before munro could respond may i suggest that as there is now only one dispute outstanding between the two parties namely whether sir alexanders most recent will is valid or invalid it might be in the best interest of both parties to expedite matters by making sure this action comes before the court at the first possible opportunity may i respectfully remind you mr galbraith that it has not been this firm that has been responsible for holding up proceedings nevertheless i welcome your change of heart even at this late juncture i am delighted that that is your attitude mr munro and im sure you will be pleased to learn that mr justice sandersons clerk rang this morning to say that his lordship has a clear day in his diary on the first thursday of next month and would be happy to sit in judgment on this case if that were convenient to both sides but that gives me less than ten days to prepare my case said munro realizing he had been ambushed frankly mr munro you either have proof that the will is invalid or you do not said galbraith if you do mr justice sanderson will rule in your favor which to quote you would result in your client ending up with everything including the kitchen sink danny looked down at sarah from the dock he had answered all her questions truthfully and was relieved to find that she only seemed interested in his reasons for traveling abroad but then how could she possibly know anything about the late danny cartwright she had warned him that he would probably be back at belmarsh in time for lunch and should anticipate having to spend the next four years in prison she had advised him to plead guilty as they had no defense to the charge of breaking his probation order and therefore she could do no more than plead mitigating circumstances hed agreed my lord began sarah as she rose to face mr justice callaghan my client does not deny his breach of license but he did so only in order to establish his rights in a major financial case which he anticipates will shortly be coming before the high court in scotland i should also point out my lord that my client was accompanied at all times by the distinguished scottish solicitor mr fraser munro who is representing him in that case the judge made a note of the name on the pad in front of him you may also consider it to be relevant my lord that my client was out of the country for less than fortyeight hours and returned to london of his own volition the charge that he failed to inform his probation officer is not entirely accurate because he rang ms bennett and when he received ceived no reply left a message on her answerphone that message was recorded and can be supplied to the court if your lordship pleases my lord this uncharacteristic lapse has been the only occasion on which my client has failed to abide strictly by his license conditions and he has never missed or ever been late for a meeting with his probation officer i would add continued sarah that since being released from prison my clients behavior with the exception of this one blemish has been exemplary not only has he at all times abided by his license but he has continued his efforts to further his educational qualifications he has recently been granted a place at london university which he hopes will lead to an honors degree in business studies my client unreservedly apologizes for any inconvenience he has caused the court or the probation service and he has assured me that this will never happen again in conclusion my lord i would hope that after you have taken all these matters into consideration you will agree that no purpose will be served by sending this man back to prison sarah closed her file bowed and resumed her place the judge went on writing for some time before he put down his pen thank you miss davenport he eventually said i would like a little time to consider your submission before i pass judgment perhaps we could take a short break and convene again at noon the court rose sarah was puzzled why would a judge of mr justice callaghans experience need time to come to a decision on such a mundane matter and then she worked it out could i speak to the chairman please who shall i say is calling fraser munro ill see if hes free to take your call mr munro munro tapped his fingers on the desk while he waited mr munro how nice to hear from you again said de coubertin how can i assist you on this occasion i thought i would let you know that the matter which concerns us both will be resolved on thursday of next week yes i am fully aware of the latest developments replied de coubertin as i have also had a call from mr desmond galbraith he assured me that his client has agreed to accept whatever judgment the court reaches i must therefore ask if your client is willing to do the same yes he is replied munro i shall be writing to you later today confirming that is our position i am most grateful said de coubertin and will inform our legal department accordingly as soon as we learn which of the two parties has won the action i will give instructions to deposit the into the relevant account thank you for that assurance said munro he coughed i wondered if i might have a word with you off the record not an expression we swiss have come to terms with replied de coubertin then perhaps in my capacity as a trustee of the late sir alexander moncrieffs estate i could seek your guidance i will do my best replied de coubertin but i will not under any circumstances breach client confidentiality and that applies whether the client is dead or alive i fully understand your position said munro i have reason to believe that you had a visit from mr hugo moncrieff before you saw sir nicholas and that therefore you must have considered the documents that constitute the evidence in this case de coubertin did not offer an opinion can i assume from your silence said munro that is not in dispute de coubertin still did not respond among those documents would have been copies of both of sir alexanders wills the legitimacy of which will decide the outcome of this case again de coubertin didnt offer an opinion making munro wonder if the line had gone dead are you still there chairman he asked yes i am de coubertin replied as you were willing to see sir nicholas after your meeting with mr hugo moncrieff i can only assume that the reason you rejected his uncles claim was because the bank like myself is not convinced that the second will is valid so that there is no misunderstanding between us added munro your bank concluded that it is a fake mr munro could now hear the chairman breathing then in the name of justice man i must ask you what it was that convinced you that the second will was invalid but which i have failed to identify im afraid i am unable to assist you mr munro as it would be a breach of client confidentiality is there anyone else that i can turn to for advice on this matter pressed munro there was a long silence before de coubertin eventually said in keeping with the banks policy we sought a second opinion from an outside source and can you divulge the name of your source no i cannot replied de coubertin much as i might like to that would also be contrary to the banks policy on such matters but began munro however continued de coubertin ignoring the interruption the gentleman who advised us is unquestionably the leading authority in his field and hasnt yet left geneva all rise said the usher as twelve oclock struck and mr justice callaghan walked back into the courtroom sarah turned to smile encouragingly at danny who was standing in the dock with a look of resignation on his face once the judge had settled in his chair he peered down at defense counsel i have given a great deal of thought to your submission miss davenport however you must understand that it is my responsibility to ensure that prisoners are fully aware that while they are on license they are still serving part of their sentence and that if they fail to keep to the conditions set down in their parole order they are breaking the law i have of course he continued taken into consideration your clients overall record since his release including his efforts to obtain further academic qualifications this is all very commendable but does not alter the fact that he abused his position of trust he must therefore be punished accordingly danny bowed his head moncrieff said the judge i intend to sign an order today which will ensure that you will be locked up for a further four years should you break any of your license conditions in the future for the period of your license you may not under any circumstances travel abroad and you will continue to report to your probation officer once a month he removed his spectacles moncrieff you have been most fortunate on this occasion and what tipped the balance in your favor was the fact that you were accompanied on your injudicious foreign excursion by a senior member of the scottish legal profession whose reputation on both sides of the border is beyond reproach sarah smiled mr justice callaghan had needed to make one or two phone calls so that he could confirm something sarah already knew you are free to leave the court were mr justice callaghans final words the judge rose from his place bowed low and shuffled out of the courtroom danny remained in the dock despite the fact that the two policemen whod been guarding him had already disappeared downstairs sarah walked across as the usher opened the little gate to allow him to step out of the dock and into the well of the court can you join me for lunch he asked no said sarah switching off her mobile mr munro has just texted to say he wants you on the next flight to edinburgh and please call him on the way to the airport chapter fifty in chambers was a term danny had not come across before mr munro explained in great detail why he and mr desmond galbraith had agreed on this approach for settling the dispute between the two parties both sides had agreed that it would not be wise to air any family grievances in public galbraith went as far as to admit that his client had a loathing of the press and munro had already warned sir nicholas that if their grievances were to be picked over in open court his period in prison would end up covering far more column inches than any disagreement over his grandfathers will both sides also accepted that the case should be tried in front of a high court judge and that his decision would be final once judgment had been made neither side would be given leave to appeal sir nicholas and mr hugo moncrieff both signed a binding legal agreement to this effect before the judge would agree to consider proceeding danny sat at a table next to mr munro on one side of the room while hugo and margaret moncrieff sat alongside mr desmond galbraith on the other mr justice sanderson was seated at his desk facing them none of the participants was dressed in court garb which allowed a far more relaxed atmosphere to prevail the judge opened proceedings by reminding both parties that despite the case being heard privately in chambers the outcome still carried the full weight of the law he seemed pleased to see both counsel nodding mr justice sanderson had not only proved acceptable to both sides but was in the words of munro a wise old bird gentlemen he began having acquainted myself with the background to this case i am aware just how much is at stake for both parties before i begin i am bound to ask if every attempt to reach a compromise has been made mr desmond galbraith rose from his place and stated that sir alexander had written an uncompromising letter making it clear that he wished to disinherit his grandson after he had been courtmartialed and his client mr hugo moncrieff simply wished to carry out his late fathers wishes mr munro rose to state that his client had not issued the original writ and had never sought this quarrel in the first place but that like mr hugo moncrieff he felt that it was imperative that his grandfathers wishes were carried out he paused to the letter the judge shrugged his shoulders and resigned himself to not being able to achieve any form of compromise between the two parties then lets get on with it he said i have read all the papers put before me and i have also considered any further submissions entered by both parties as evidence with that in mind i intend to state from the outset what i consider to be relevant in this case and what i consider to be irrelevant neither side disputes that sir alexander moncrieff executed a will on january seventeenth in which he left the bulk of his estate to his grandson nicholas then a serving officer in kosovo he looked up to seek confirmation and both galbraith and munro nodded however what is being claimed by mr galbraith on behalf of his client mr hugo moncrieff is that this document was not his last will and testament and that at a later date the judge looked down at his notesnovember first sir alexander executed a second will leaving the entire estate to his son angus sir angus died on the twentieth of may and in his last will and testament he in turn left everything to his younger brother hugo also offered in evidence by mr galbraith on behalf of his client is a letter signed by sir alexander stating his reasons for this change of heart mr munro does not dispute the authenticity of the signature on the second page of this letter but suggests that the first page was in fact drawn up at a later date he states that although he will not be putting forward any evidence to support this claim its truth will become selfevident when the second will is proved to be invalid mr munro has also made it known to the court that he will not be suggesting that sir alexander was to use the legal term not of sound mind at the relevant time on the contrary they spent an evening together only a week before sir alexander died and after dinner his host soundly beat him at a game of chess so i am bound to say to both parties that in my opinion the only question to be settled in this dispute is the validity of the second will which mr galbraith claims on behalf of his client was sir alexander moncrieffs last will and testament while mr munro states without putting too fine a point on it that its a fake i hope that both sides consider this to be a fair assessment of the present position if so i will ask mr galbraith to present his case on behalf of mr hugo moncrieff desmond galbraith rose from his place my lord my client and i for our part accept that the only disagreement between the two parties concerns the second will which as you have stated we are in no doubt was sir alexanders last will and testament we offer the will and the attached letter as proof of our claim and we would also like to present a witness who we believe will put this matter to rest once and for all by all means said mr justice sanderson please call your witness i call professor nigel fleming said galbraith looking toward the door danny leaned across and asked mr munro if he knew the professor only by reputation munro replied as a tall elegant man with a full head of gray hair walked into the room as he took the oath danny thought that the professor reminded him of the sort of visiting dignitary who used to come to clement attlee comprehensive once a year to present the prizesthough never to him please have a seat professor fleming said mr justice sanderson galbraith remained standing professor i feel it is important for the court to be made aware of the expertise and authority you bring to this case so i hope you will forgive me if i ask you a few questions concerning your background the professor gave a slight bow what is your present position i am the professor of inorganic chemistry at edinburgh university and have you written a book on the relevance of that field to crime which has become the standard work on the subject and is taught as part of the legal syllabus in most universities i cannot speak for most universities mr galbraith but that is certainly the case at edinburgh have you in the past professor represented several governments to advise them on disputes of this nature i would not wish to overstate my authority mr galbraith i have on three occasions been called in by governments to advise them on the validity of documents when a disagreement has arisen between two or more nations quite so then let me ask you professor if you have ever given evidence in court when the validity of a will has been called into question yes sir on seventeen separate occasions and will you tell the court professor how many of those cases ended with a judgment that supported your findings i would not for a moment suggest the verdicts given in those cases were solely determined by my evidence nicely put said the judge with a wry smile however professor the question is how many of the seventeen verdicts backed up your opinion sixteen sir replied the professor please continue mr galbraith said the judge professor have you had the opportunity to study the late sir alexander moncrieffs will which is at the center of this case i have studied both wills can i ask you some questions about the second will the professor nodded is the paper on which the will is written of a type that would have been available at that time what time is that precisely mr galbraith asked the judge november my lord yes it is replied the professor it is my belief based on scientific evidence that the paper is the same vintage as that used for the first will which was executed in the judge raised an eyebrow but didnt interrupt was the red ribbon attached to that second will also of the same vintage asked galbraith yes i carried out tests on both ribbons and it turned out that they were produced at the same time and were you professor able to come to any conclusion about sir alexanders signature as it appears on both wills before i answer that question mr galbraith you must understand that i am not a calligraphic expert but i can tell you that the black ink used by the signatory was manufactured some time before are you telling the court asked the judge that you are able to date a bottle of ink to within a year of its production sometimes within a month said the professor in fact i would submit that the ink used for the signature on both wills came from a bottle manufactured by watermans in and now i should like to turn to the typewriter used for the second will said mr galbraith what make was it and when did it first come on to the market it is a remington envoy ii which came on to the market in so just to confirm added galbraith the paper the ink the ribbon and the typewriter were all in existence before november without question in my judgment said the professor thank you professor if you would be kind enough to wait there i have a feeling that mr munro will have some questions for you munro rose slowly from his place i have no questions for this witness my lord the judge did not react however the same could not be said of galbraith who stared at his opposite number in disbelief hugo moncrieff asked his wife to explain the significance of munros words while danny looked straight ahead showing no emotion just as munro had instructed him to do will you be presenting any other witnesses mr galbraith asked the judge no my lord i can only assume that my learned friends refusal to crossexamine professor fleming means that he accepts his findings he paused without question munro didnt rise in any sense of the expression mr munro said the judge do you wish to make an opening statement briefly if it so pleases your lordship said munro professor fleming has confirmed that sir alexanders first will and testament made in favor of my client is indisputably authentic we accept his judgment in this matter as you stated at the beginning of this hearing my lord the only question which concerns this court is the validity or otherwise of the second will which my lord said galbraith jumping up from his place is mr munro suggesting to the court that the expertise the professor applied to the first will can conveniently be discounted when it comes to his opinion of the second no my lord said munro had my learned friend shown a little more patience he would have discovered that that is not what i am suggesting the professor told the court that he was not an expert on the authenticity of signatures but he also testified my lord said galbraith leaping up again that the ink used to sign both of the wills came from the same bottle but not from the same hand i would suggest said munro will you be calling a calligraphy expert asked the judge no my lord i will not do you have any evidence to suggest that the signature is a forgery no my lord i do not repeated munro this time the judge did raise an eyebrow will you be calling any witnesses mr munro in support of your case yes my lord like my esteemed colleague i will be calling only one witness munro paused for a moment aware that with the exception of danny who didnt even blink everyone in the room was curious to know who this witness could possibly be i call mr gene hunsacker the door opened and the vast frame of the texan ambled slowly into the room danny felt that something wasnt right then realized that it was the first time hed seen hunsacker without his trademark cigar hunsacker took the oath his voice booming around the small room please have a seat mr hunsacker said the judge as we are such a small gathering perhaps we might address each other in more conversational tones im sorry your honor said hunsacker no need to apologize said the judge please proceed mr munro munro rose from his place and smiled at hunsacker for the record would you be kind enough to state your name and occupation my name is gene hunsacker the third and im retired and what did you do before you retired mr hunsacker asked the judge not a lot sir my pa like my granddaddy before him was a cattle rancher but i myself never took to it especially after oil was discovered on my land so youre an oilman said the judge not exactly sir because at the age of twentyseven i sold out to a british company bp and since then ive spent the rest of my life pursuing my hobby how interesting what may i ask began the judge well come to your hobby in a moment mr hunsacker said munro firmly the judge sank back in his chair an apologetic look on his face mr hunsacker you have stated that having made a considerable fortune following the sale of your land to bp you are not in the oil business thats correct sir i would also like to establish for the courts benefit what else you are not an expert on for example are you an expert on wills no sir i am not are you an expert on paper and ink technology no sir are you an expert on ribbons i tried to remove a few from girls hair when i was a younger man but i wasnt even very good at that said gene munro waited for the laughter to die down before he continued then perhaps you are an expert on typewriters no sir or even signatures no sir however said munro would i be right in suggesting that you are considered the worlds leading authority on postage stamps i think i can safely say its either me or tomoji watanabe hunsacker replied depending on who you talk to the judge couldnt control himself any longer can you explain what you mean by that mr hunsacker both of us have been collectors for over forty years your honor i have the larger collection but to be fair to tomoji thats possibly because im a darn sight richer than he is and keep outbidding the poor bastard even margaret moncrieff couldnt stifle a laugh i sit on the board of sothebys and tomoji advises philips my collection has been put on display at the smithsonian institution in washington dc his at the imperial museum in tokyo so i cant tell you whos the worlds leading authority but whichever one of us is number one the other guy is certainly number two thank you mr hunsacker said the judge i am satisfied that your witness is an expert in his chosen field mr munro thank you my lord said munro mr hunsacker have you studied both of the wills involved in this case i have sir and what is your opinion your professional opinion of the second will the one that leaves sir alexanders fortune to his son angus its a fake desmond galbraith was immediately on his feet yes yes mr galbraith said the judge waving him back in his place i do hope mr hunsacker that you are going to supply the court with some concrete evidence for the assertion by concrete evidence i do not mean another dose of your homespun philosophy hunsackers jovial smile disappeared he waited for some time before saying i shall prove your honor in what i believe you describe in this country as beyond reasonable doubt that sir alexanders second will is a fake in order to do so i will require you to be in possession of the original document mr justice sanderson turned to galbraith who shrugged his shoulders rose from his place and handed the second will across to the judge now sir said hunsacker if you would be kind enough to turn to the second page of the document you will see sir alexanders signature written across a stamp are you suggesting that the stamp is a fake said the judge no sir i am not but as you have already stated mr hunsacker you are not an expert on signatures what exactly are you suggesting that is clear for all to see sir said hunsacker as long as you know what youre looking for please enlighten me said the judge sounding a little exasperated her majesty the queen ascended the british throne on february second said hunsacker and was crowned at westminster abbey on june second the royal mail produced a stamp to mark that occasionindeed i am the proud owner of a mint sheet of first editions that stamp shows the queen as a young woman but because of the remarkable length of her majestys reign the royal mail has had to issue a new edition every few years to reflect the fact that the monarch has grown a little older the edition that is affixed to this will was issued in march hunsacker swung around in his chair to look at hugo moncrieff wondering if the significance of his words had sunk in he couldnt be sure although the same could not be said of margaret moncrieff whose lips were pursed while the blood was quickly draining from her face your honor said hunsacker sir alexander moncrieff died on december seventeenth three months before the stamp was issued so one thing is for certain that sure cant be his signature scrawled across her majesty book four revenge chapter fiftyone revenge is a dish best served cold danny placed les liaisons dangereuses in his briefcase as the plane began its descent through a bank of murky clouds that hung over london he had every intention of exacting cold revenge on all three men who had been responsible for the death of his closest friend for preventing him from marrying beth for depriving him of being able to bring up his daughter christy and for causing him to be imprisoned for a crime he did not commit he now had the financial resources to pick them off slowly one by one and it was his intention that by the time hed completed the task all three of them would consider death a preferable option would you please fasten your seatbelt sir well be landing at heathrow in a few minutes danny smiled up at the stewardess who had interrupted his thoughts mr justice sanderson hadnt been given the opportunity to pass judgment in the case of moncrieff v moncrieff as one of the parties had withdrawn its claim soon after mr gene hunsacker had left the judges chambers mr munro had explained to nick over dinner at the new club in edinburgh that if the judge had reason to believe a crime had been committed he would have no choice but to send all the relevant papers to the procurator fiscal elsewhere in the city mr desmond galbraith was informing his client that if that were to happen hugos nephew might not be the only moncrieff to experience the slamming of the iron door munro had advised sir nicholas not to press charges despite the fact that danny was in no doubt who had been responsible for the three policemen waiting for him on the last occasion he had landed at heathrow munro had added in one of those rare moments when his guard came down but if your uncle hugo causes any trouble in the future then all bets are off danny had tried inadequately to thank munro for all he had done over the yearsthink like nickand was surprised by his response im not sure whom i enjoyed defeating more your uncle hugo or that prig desmond galbraith the guard remained down danny had always thought how lucky he was to have mr munro in his corner but he had only recently become aware what it would be like to have him as an opponent when coffee was served danny had asked fraser munro to become a trustee of the family estate as well as its legal adviser he had bowed low and said if that is your wish sir nicholas danny had also made it clear that he wanted dunbroathy hall and the surrounding land to be handed over to the national trust for scotland and that he intended to allocate whatever funds were necessary for its upkeep precisely as your grandfather envisaged said munro although i have no doubt your uncle hugo with the help of mr galbraith would have found some ingenious way of wriggling out of that commitment danny was beginning to wonder if munro had had a wee dram too many he couldnt imagine how the old solicitor would react were he to find out what danny had in mind for another member of his profession the plane touched down at heathrow just after eleven danny was meant to have caught the flight but had overslept for the first time in weeks he put spencer craig out of his mind when the aircraft came to a halt at its docking gate he unbuckled his seatbelt and joined the other passengers standing in the aisle waiting for the door to swing open this time there would be no policemen waiting outside for him after the case had come to its premature end hunsacker had slapped the judge on the back and offered him a cigar mr justice sanderson was briefly lost for words but he did manage a smile before politely refusing danny pointed out to hunsacker that if he had stayed in geneva he would still have ended up with sir alexanders collection because hugo would have been happy to sell it to him and probably for a lower price but i wouldnt have kept my pact with your granddaddy hunsacker replied now ive done something to repay his kindness and shrewd advice over so many years an hour later gene took off for texas in his private jet accompanied by leatherbound albums which danny knew would keep him engrossed for the entire journey and probably the rest of his life as danny climbed aboard the heathrow express his thoughts turned to beth he desperately wanted to see her again maupassant summed up his feelings so well whats the point of triumph if youve no one to share it with but he could hear beth asking whats the point of revenge now you have so much to live for he would have reminded her first of bernie and then of nick who had also had so much to live for she would realize that the money meant nothing to him he would have happily exchanged every penny for if only he could turn the clock back if only they had gone up to the west end the following night if only they hadnt gone to that particular pub if only they had left by the front door if only the heathrow express pulled into paddington station seventeen minutes later danny checked his watch he still had a couple of hours before his meeting with ms bennett this time hed go by taxi and would be waiting in reception long before his appointment the judges words were still ringing in his ears i intend to sign an order today which will ensure that you will be returned to prison for a further four years should you break any of your license conditions in the future although settling scores with the three musketeers remained dannys first priority he would have to put aside enough time to work on his degree and honor his promise to nick he was even beginning to wonder if spencer craig might have played some role in nicks death had leach as big al suggested murdered the wrong man the taxi drew up outside his house in the boltons for the first time danny really felt as if it was his home he paid the fare and opened the gate to find a tramp lounging on his doorstep this is going to be your lucky day danny said as he took out his wallet the dozing figure was dressed in an openneck blue and white striped shirt a pair of wellworn jeans and a pair of black shoes that must have been polished that morning he stirred and raised his head hi nick danny threw his arms around him just as molly opened the door she put her hands on her hips he said he was a friend of yours she said but i still told him to wait outside he is my friend said danny molly meet big al molly had already prepared an irish stew for nick and as her portions were always too large there was more than enough for both of them so tell me everything danny said once they were seated at the kitchen table no a lot tae tell nick said big al between mouthfuls like you they released me after id served half my sentence thank god they shipped me oot otherwise i might ve been there fur the rest of ma life he reluctantly put down his spoon and added with a smile an we know who wis responsible fur that so what have you got planned asked danny nothing at the moment but ye did say tae come and see you wance i got oot he paused i hoped yed let me stay fur a night stay as long as you like said danny my housekeeper will prepare the guest bedroom he added with a grin im not your housekeeper said molly sharply im your cleaner what occasionally cooks not any longer molly youre now the housekeeper as well as cook on ten pounds an hour molly was speechless danny took advantage of this unusual state of affairs to add and whats more youll need to hire a cleaner to help you now that big als joining us no no said big al ill be out of here just as soon as i find a job you were a driver in the army werent you asked danny i wis your driver fur five years whispered big al nodding his head in the direction of molly then youve got your old job back said danny but you havent got a car molly reminded him then i shall have to get one said danny and who better to advise me he added winking at big al ive always wanted a bmw he said having worked in a garage i know the exact model big al put a finger up to his lips danny knew big al was right yesterdays triumph must have gone to his head and hed slipped back to behaving like dannya mistake he couldnt afford to make too often think like danny act like nick he snapped back into his unreal world but first youd better go and buy some clothes he said to big al before you even think about a car and some soap said molly filling big als plate for a third time then molly can scrub your back i will do no such thing said molly but id better go and make up one of the guest bedrooms if mr big al is going to be with usfor a few days danny and big al laughed as she took off her apron and left the kitchen once the door was closed big al leaned across the table are ye still planning tae get they bastards that yes i am said danny quietly and you couldnt have turned up at a better time so when dae we start you start by having a bath and then go and buy yourself some clothes danny said taking out his wallet for a second time meanwhile ive got an appointment with my probation officer and how have you spent the past month nicholas was ms bennetts first question danny tried to keep a straight face ive been busy sorting out those family problems i mentioned at our last meeting he replied and has everything worked out as planned yes thank you ms bennett have you found a job yet no ms bennett im currently concentrating on my business studies degree at london university ah yes i remember but surely the grant isnt sufficient to live on i can just about get by said danny ms bennett returned to her list of questions are you still living in the same house yes i see i think perhaps i should come and inspect the property at some time just to make sure it meets with the minimum home office standards you would be most welcome to visit any time that suits you said danny she read out the next question have you been associating with any former prisoners you were in jail with yes said danny aware that concealing anything from his probation officer would be regarded as a breach of his parole conditions my former driver has just been released on bail and is currently staying with me is there enough room in the house for both of you more than enough thank you ms bennett and does he have a job yes hes going to be my driver i think youre in enough trouble as it is nicholas without being facetious its no more than the truth ms bennett my grandfather has left me with sufficient funds to allow me to employ a driver ms bennett looked down at the questions that the home office expected her to ask at monthly meetings there didnt appear to be anything there about employing your own driver she tried again have you been tempted to commit a crime since our last meeting no ms bennett have you been taking any drugs no ms bennett are you at present drawing unemployment benefit no ms bennett do you require any other assistance from the probation service no thank you ms bennett ms bennett had come to the end of her list of questions but had only spent half the time she was allocated for each client why dont you tell me what youve been up to for the past month she asked desperately im going to have to let you go said beth resorting to the euphemism mr thomas always fell back on whenever he sacked a member of staff but why asked trevor sutton if i go you wont have a manager unless youve already got someone else lined up to replace me i have no plans to replace you said beth but since my fathers death the garage has been steadily losing money i cant afford this state of affairs to continue any longer she added reading from the script mr thomas had prepared for her but you havent given me enough time to prove myself protested sutton beth wished that it was danny who was sitting in her placebut if danny had been around the problem would never have arisen in the first place if we have another three months like the last three beth said well be out of business what am i expected to do demanded sutton leaning forward and putting his elbows on the table because i know one thing the boss would never have treated me this way beth felt angry that he had mentioned her father but mr thomas had advised her to try to put herself in trevors shoes and to imagine how he must be feeling especially since hed never worked anywhere else since the day he left clement attlee comprehensive ive had a word with monty hughes said beth trying to remain calm and he assured me that hed be able to find you a place on his staff what she didnt add was that mr hughes only had a junior mechanics job available which would mean a considerable drop in pay for trevor thats all very well he said angrily but what about compensation i know my rights im willing to pay you three months wages said beth and also to give you a reference saying that youve been among the hardest workers and among your most stupid monty hughes had added when beth had consulted him while she waited for trevors response she recalled dannys words but only because he cant add up beth pulled open the drawer of her fathers desk and extracted a bulky package and a single sheet of paper she ripped open the package and emptied its contents onto the desk sutton stared down at the pile of fiftypound notes and licked his lips as he tried to calculate just how much money was on the table beth slid a contract across the desk that mr thomas had prepared for her the previous afternoon if you sign here she said placing her finger on a dotted line the seven thousand pounds will be yours trevor hesitated while beth tried not to show just how desperate she was for him to sign the contract she waited for trevor to spend the money although it seemed an age before he eventually picked up the proffered pen and wrote the only two words he could spell with confidence he suddenly gathered up the cash and without uttering another word turned his back on beth and marched out of the room once trevor had kicked the door closed behind him beth breathed a sigh of relief that wouldnt have left him in any doubt that he could have demanded far more than seven thousand though in truth withdrawing that amount of cash from the bank had just about emptied the garages account all that was left for beth to do now was to sell off the property as quickly as possible the young estate agent who had looked over the property had assured her that the garage was worth at least two hundred thousand after all it was a freehold site situated in an excellent location with easy access to the city two hundred thousand pounds would solve all of beths financial problems and mean there was enough left over to ensure that christy could have the education she and danny had always planned for her chapter fiftytwo danny was reading milton friedmans tax limitation inflation and the role of government and taking notes on the chapter about the property cycle and the effects of negative equity when the phone rang after two hours of studying he was beginning to feel that anything would be an improvement on professor friedman he picked up the phone to hear a womans voice hi nick its a voice from your past hi voice from my past said danny desperately trying to put a name to it you said you were going to come and see me while i was on tour well i keep looking out into the audience but youre never there so where are you performing at the moment asked danny still racking his brains but no name came to his rescue cambridge the arts theatre great which play a woman of no importance oscar wilde again said danny aware that he didnt have much longer nick you dont even remember my name do you dont be silly katie he said just in time how could i ever forget my favorite understudy well ive got the lead now and i was hoping youd come and see me sounds good said danny flicking through the pages of his diary although he knew that almost every evening was free how about friday couldnt be better we can spend the weekend together i have to be back in london for a meeting on saturday morning said danny looking at a blank page in his diary so it will have to be another onenight stand said katie i can live with that danny didnt respond curtains up at seventhirty ill leave a ticket for you at the box office come alone because i dont intend to share you with anybody danny put the phone down and stared at the photograph of beth that was in a silver frame on the corner of his desk there are three men coming up the path said molly as she looked out of the kitchen window they look foreign theyre quite harmless danny assured her just show them into the living room and tell them ill join them in a moment danny ran up the stairs to his study and grabbed the three files that he had been working on in preparation for the meeting then quickly made his way back downstairs the three men who were waiting for him looked identical in every way except for their age they wore welltailored dark blue suits white shirts and anonymous ties and each carried a black leather briefcase you would have passed them in the street without giving them a second lookwhich would have pleased them how nice to see you again baron said danny de coubertin bowed low we are touched that you invited us to your beautiful home sir nicholas may i introduce monsieur bresson the banks chief executive and monsieur segat who handles our major accounts danny shook hands with all three men as molly reappeared carrying a tray laden with tea and biscuits gentlemen said danny as he sat down perhaps i could begin by asking you to bring me up to date on the current state of my account certainly said monsieur bresson opening an unmarked brown file your numberone account is showing a balance of just over fiftyseven million dollars which is currently accumulating interest at the rate of percent per annum your numbertwo account he continued has a balance of just over one million dollars this was known at the bank as your grandfathers stamp account which he used whenever he wanted to add to his collection at short notice you can combine the two accounts said danny as i wont be buying any stamps bresson nodded and i have to say monsieur bresson that i find a percent return on my capital unacceptable and that i shall in future be putting my money to better use can you tell us what you have in mind asked segat yes said danny i shall be investing in three areasproperty stocks and shares and possibly bonds which incidentally are showing a current return of percent across the board i will also set aside a small amount never more than ten percent of my total worth for speculative ventures then may i suggest in the circumstances said segat that we move your money into three separate accounts that cannot be traced back to you while appointing nominee directors as your representatives in the circumstances repeated danny since the americans and the british are taking far more interest in anyone who moves large sums of money around it would not be wise for your name to keep popping up on their radar good thinking said danny assuming that you agree to our setting up these accounts added bresson may i ask whether you will wish to make additional use of the banks expertise in managing your investments i mention this because our property department for example employs over forty specialists in the fieldseven of them in london who currently manage a portfolio of just under one hundred billion dollars and our investment department is considerably larger i shall take advantage of everything you have to offer said danny and do not hesitate to let me know if you think i am making a wrong decision however over the past couple of years i have spent a considerable amount of time following the fortunes of twentyeight particular companies and i have decided to invest some of my capital in eleven of them what will be your policy when it comes to purchasing shares in those companies asked segat i would want you to buy in small tranches whenever they come on the marketnever aggressively as i do not wish to be responsible for influencing the market either way also i never want to hold more than two percent of any one company danny handed bresson a list of the companies whose progress he had been monitoring long before he had escaped from prison bresson ran his finger down the names and smiled we have been keeping an eye on several of these companies ourselves but i am fascinated to see that you have identified one or two that we have not yet considered then please doublecheck them and if you have any doubts tell me danny picked up one of his files when it comes to property i intend to act aggressively he said and i will expect you to move quickly if immediate payment will secure a more realistic price bresson handed over a card it had no name on it no address just a phone number embossed in black that is my private line we can wire any amount of money you require to any country on earth at the touch of a button and when you call you need never give your name as the line is voiceactivated thank you said danny placing the card in an inside pocket i also require your advice on a more pressing matter namely my daytoday living expenses i have no desire for the taxman to be prying into my affairs and as i live in this house and employ a housekeeper and driver while apparently subsisting on nothing more than a student grant it may be the inland revenues radar that i keep popping up on if i might make a suggestion said de coubertin we used to transfer one hundred thousand pounds a month to an account in london for your grandfather it came from a trust we set up on his behalf he paid tax on this income in full and even carried out some of his smaller transactions through a company registered in london i should like you to continue that arrangement said danny how do i go about it de coubertin extracted a slim file from his briefcase removed a single sheet of paper and said pointing to a dotted line if you sign here sir nicholas i can assure you that everything will be set up and administered to your satisfaction all i will need to know is to which bank we should make the monthly transfer coutts and co in the strand said danny just like your grandfather said the chairman how long will it take to get to cambridge danny asked big al moments after the three swiss bankers had disappeared into thin air aboot an hour and a half so we ought tae be leaving fairly soon boss fine said danny ill go and change and pack an overnight bag mollys already done that said big al i put it in the boot of the car the friday evening traffic was heavy and it wasnt until they joined the m that big al managed to push the speedometer above thirty miles an hour he drove into kings parade only minutes before the curtain was due to rise danny had been so preoccupied during the past few weeks with getting the better of nicks grandfathers will that this was going to be his first visit to the theater since seeing lawrence davenport in the importance of being earnest lawrence davenport although danny had begun to form plans for all three of his antagonists every time he thought about davenport sarah came into his mind he was aware that he might well have been back in belmarsh had it not been for her and also that he would need to see her again as she could open doors to which he didnt have a key big al brought the car to a halt outside the theater what time will ye be gon back tae london boss i havent decided yet said danny but not before midnight he picked up his ticket from the box office handed over three pounds in exchange for a program and followed a group of fellow latecomers into the stalls once hed found his seat he began to turn the pages of the program hed meant to read the play before this evening but it had remained on his desk unopened while he tried to keep up with milton friedman danny stopped at a page that displayed a large glamorous headshot of katie benson unlike so many actresses it was not a photograph that had been taken years before he read the brief résumé of her credits a woman of no importance was clearly the most significant role she had played in her short career when the curtain rose danny became lost in another world and resolved that in future he would go to the theater on a regular basis how he wished that beth was sitting next to him and sharing in his enjoyment katie was standing on stage arranging some flowers in a vase but all he could think about was beth but as the play unfolded he had to admit that katie was giving a polished performance and he soon became engrossed in the story of a woman who suspected her husband of being unfaithful during the interval danny made a decision and by the time the curtain came down mr wilde had even shown him how to go about it he waited for the theater to empty before he made his way to the stage door the doorman gave him a suspicious look when he asked if he could see miss benson whats your name he demanded checking his clipboard nicholas moncrieff ah yes shes expecting you dressing room seven first floor danny walked slowly up the stairs and when he reached the door marked he waited for a moment before knocking come in said a voice he remembered he opened the door to find katie sitting in front of a mirror wearing only a black bra and panties she was removing her stage makeup shall i wait outside he asked dont be silly darling ive got nothing new to show you and in any case i was hoping to arouse a few memories she added turning to face him she stood up and stepped into a black dress which strangely made her look even more desirable you were wonderful he said lamely are you sure darling she asked looking at him more closely you dont sound altogether convinced oh yes danny said i really enjoyed the play katie stared at him somethings wrong i have to get back to london i have some urgent business on a friday night oh come on nick you can do better than that its just that its another woman isnt it yes admitted danny then why did you bother to come in the first place she said angrily turning her back on him im sorry im very sorry dont bother to apologize nick you couldnt have made it more obvious that im a woman of no importance chapter fiftythree sorry boss but i thought ye said no before midnight said big al quickly finishing his hamburger i changed my mind i thought that was a ladys prerogative so did she said danny by the time they reached the m fifteen minutes later danny was already fast asleep he didnt wake until the car came to a halt at a traffic light on mile end road if danny had woken a few moments earlier he would have asked big al to take a different route the light changed and they sped through green light after green light as if someone else knew that danny shouldnt be there he leaned back and closed his eyes though he knew there were some familiar landmarks he wouldnt be able to pass without at least a fleeting glance clement attlee comprehensive st marys church and of course wilsons garage he opened his eyes and wished hed kept them closed it cant be possible he said pull over al big al brought the car to a halt and looked around to make sure the boss was all right danny was staring across the road in disbelief big al tried to work out what he was looking at but couldnt see anything unusual wait here said danny opening the back door ill only be a couple of minutes danny walked across the road stood on the pavement and stared up at a sign that was attached to the wall he took a pen and a piece of paper out of an inside pocket and wrote down the number below the words for sale when he saw some locals spilling out of a nearby pub he ran quickly back across the road and joined big al in the front of the car lets get out of here he said without explanation danny thought of asking big al to drive him back to the east end on saturday morning so he could have a second look but he knew he couldnt take the risk of someone even thinking they recognized him a plan began to form in his mind and by sunday evening it was nearly in place every detail would have to be followed to the letter one mistake and all three of them would work out exactly what he was up to but the bitpart players the understudies had to be in their positions long before the three lead actors could be allowed to walk onto the stage when danny woke on monday morning and went down to breakfast he left the times unopened on the kitchen table he played over in his mind what needed to be done because he couldnt afford to commit anything to paper if arnold pearson qc had asked him as he left the kitchen what molly had given him for breakfast that morning he wouldnt have been able to tell him he retreated to his study locked the door and sat at his desk he picked up the phone and dialed the number on the card i will need to move a small amount of money sometime today and very quickly he said understood i will also require someone to advise me on a property transaction they will be in touch with you later today danny replaced the phone and checked his watch no one would be at their desks before nine he paced around the room using the time to rehearse his questions questions that mustnt sound prepared at one minute past nine he took the piece of paper out of his pocket and dialed the number douglas allen spiro said a morning voice you have a forsale sign outside a property on mile end road said danny ill put you through to mr parker he deals with properties in that area danny heard a click roger parker you have a property for sale on mile end road repeated danny we have several properties in that area sir can you be more specific wilson s garage oh yes firstclass property freehold its been in the same family for over a hundred years how long has it been on the market not long and weve already had a lot of interest how long repeated danny five perhaps six months admitted parker danny cursed to himself as he thought about the anxiety beths family must have been going through and hed done nothing to help he wanted to ask so many questions that he knew mr parker couldnt answer whats the asking price two hundred thousand said parker or near offer which of course includes the fixtures and fittings can i take your name sir danny replaced the receiver he stood up and walked across to a shelf that had three files on it marked craig davenport and payne he took down gerald paynes file and checked the phone number of the youngest partner in baker tremlett and smythes history as mr arnold pearson qc had been so keen to inform the jury but danny had no plans to speak to payne today payne had to come to him desperate to be part of the deal today was saved for the messenger he dialed the number baker tremlett and smythe im thinking of buying a property on mile end road ill put you through to the department that handles east london there was a click on the end of the line would whoever picked up the phone ever discover they had been randomly selected to be the messenger and shouldnt later be blamed when the earthquake erupted gary hall how can i help you mr hall my name is sir nicholas moncrieff and i wonderslowly very slowlyif ive got the right man tell me what it is you need sir and ill see if i can help theres a property for sale in mile end road that id like to buy but i dont want to deal directly with the vendors estate agent i understand sir you can be assured of my discretion i hope not thought danny what number in mile end road is it one four three danny replied its a garage wilson s garage who are the vendors agents douglas allen spiro ill have a word with my opposite number there and find out all the details said hall then give you a bell back ill be in your area later today said danny perhaps you could join me for a coffee of course sir nicholas where would you like to meet danny could only think of one place hed ever been to that was anywhere near baker tremlett and smythes offices the dorchester he said shall we say twelve oclock ill see you there at twelve sir nicholas danny remained seated at his desk he put three ticks on a long list in front of him but he still needed several other players to be in place before midday if he was going to be ready for mr hall the phone on his desk began to ring danny picked it up good morning sir nicholas said a voice i manage the banks property desk in london big al drove danny to park lane and drew up outside the terrace entrance of the dorchester just after eleven thirty a doorman walked down the steps and opened the back door of the car danny stepped out my name is sir nicholas moncrieff he said as he walked up the steps im expecting a guest to join me around twelvea mr hall could you tell him ill be in the lounge he took out his wallet and handed the doorman a tenpound note i certainly will sir said the doorman raising his top hat and your name is asked danny george thank you george said danny and walked through the revolving doors and into the hotel he paused in the lobby and introduced himself to the head concierge after a short conversation with walter he parted with another tenpound note on walters advice danny made his way to the lounge and waited for the maître d to return to his post this time danny took a tenpound note out of his wallet before hed made his request why dont i put you in one of our more private alcoves sir nicholas ill see that mr hall is brought across to you the moment he arrives would you care for anything while youre waiting a copy of the times and a hot chocolate said danny of course sir nicholas and your name is asked danny mario sir george walter and mario had unwittingly become members of his team at a cost of thirty pounds danny turned to the business section of the times to check on his investments while he waited for the innocent mr hall to appear at two minutes to twelve mario was standing by his side sir nicholas your guest has arrived thank you mario danny said as if he were a regular customer its a pleasure to meet you sir nicholas said hall as he took the seat opposite danny what would you like to drink mr hall said danny just a coffee thank you a coffee and my usual please mario of course sir nicholas the young man who had joined danny was dressed in a beige suit green shirt and a yellow tie gary hall would never have been offered for a position at the banque de coubertin he opened his briefcase and took out a file i think i have all the information you require sir nicholas said hall flicking open the cover number one hundred and fortythree mile end road used to be a garage owned by a mr george wilson who died recently the blood drained from dannys face as he realized just how far the ramifications of bernies death had extended a single incident that had changed so many lives are you feeling all right sir nicholas asked hall looking genuinely concerned yes im fine just fine said danny quickly recovering you were saying he added as a waiter placed a hot chocolate in front of him after mr wilson retired the business was carried on for a couple of years under a man called hall referred to his file though danny could have told him trevor sutton but during that time the company ran up considerable debts so the owner decided to cut her losses and put it up for sale her losses yes the site is now ownedhe once again checked his fileby a miss elizabeth wilson the daughter of the previous owner whats the asking price said danny the site is approximately five thousand square feet but if you are considering making an offer i could do a survey and confirm the exact measurements square feet danny could have told him theres a pawnshop on one side and a turkish carpet warehouse on the other whats the asking price repeated danny oh yes sorry two hundred thousand including fixtures and fittings but im fairly confident you could pick it up for a hundred and fifty there hasnt been much interest shown in the property and theres a far more successful garage trading on the other side of the road i cant afford to waste any time haggling said danny so listen carefully im prepared to pay the asking price and i also want you to approach the owners of the pawnshop and the carpet warehouse as i intend to make an offer for their properties yes of course sir nicholas said hall writing down his every word he hesitated for a moment ill need a deposit of twenty thousand pounds before we can proceed by the time you get back to your office mr hall two hundred thousand pounds will have been deposited in your client account hall didnt look convinced but managed a thin smile as soon as you know about the other two properties call me yes sir nicholas and i must make one thing clear said danny the owner must never find out who she is dealing with you can rely on my discretion sir nicholas i hope so said danny because i found i couldnt rely on the discretion of the last company i dealt with and thats how they lost my business i understand said hall how do i get in touch with you danny took out his wallet and handed him a freshly minted embossed card and finally may i ask sir nicholas which solicitors will be representing you in this transaction this was the first question danny hadnt anticipated he smiled munro munro and carmichael you should only deal with mr fraser munro the senior partner who handles all my personal affairs of course sir nicholas said hall rising from his place once he had written the name down id better get straight back to the office and talk to the vendors agents danny watched hall as he scuttled away his coffee untouched he was confident that within the hour the whole office would have heard about the eccentric sir nicholas moncrieff who clearly had more money than sense they would undoubtedly tease young hall about his wasted morning until they discovered the in the client account danny flicked open his mobile phone and dialed the number yes said a voice i want two hundred thousand pounds to be transferred to the client account of baker tremlett and smythe in london understood danny closed the phone and thought about gary hall how quickly would he discover that mrs isaacs had wanted her husband to sell the pawnshop for years and that the carpet warehouse only just about broke even and mr and mrs kamal hoped to retire to ankara so that they could spend more time with their daughter and grandchildren mario placed the bill discreetly on the table by his side danny left a large tip he needed to be remembered as he passed through reception he paused to thank the head concierge my pleasure sir nicholas do let me know if i can be of any service in the future thank you walter i may well be in touch danny pushed his way through the swing doors and walked out onto the terrace george rushed across to the waiting car and opened the back door danny extracted another tenpound note thank you george george walter and mario were now all paidup members of his cast although the curtain had only fallen on the first act chapter fiftyfour danny took the file marked davenport off the shelf and placed it on his desk he turned to the first page davenport lawrence actorpages davenport sarah sister solicitorpages duncan charlie producerpages he turned to page another bitpart player was about to become involved in lawrence davenports next production danny dialed his number charles duncan productions mr duncan please who shall i say is calling nick moncrieff ill put you through mr moncrieff im trying to remember where we met said the next voice on the line at the dorchester for the importance of being earnest closingnight party oh yes now i remember so what can i do for you asked a suspicioussounding voice im thinking of investing in your next production said danny a friend of mine put a few thousand in earnest and he tells me he made a handsome profit so i thought this might be the right time for me to you couldnt have called at a better time said duncan ive got the very thing for you old boy why dont you join me at the ivy for a spot of lunch sometime so we can discuss it could anyone really fall for that line thought danny if they could this was going to be easier than he had imagined no let me take you to lunch old boy said danny you must be extremely busy so perhaps youd be kind enough to give me a call when youre next available well funnily enough said duncan ive just had a cancellation for tomorrow so if you happened to be free yes i am said danny before baiting the trap why dont you join me at my local pub your local pub said duncan not sounding quite so enthusiastic yes the palm court room at the dorchester shall we say one oclock ah yes of course ill see you there one oclock said duncan its sir nicholas isnt it nicks just fine said danny before putting the phone down and making an entry in his diary professor amirkhan mori smiled benevolently as he peered into the packed auditorium his lectures were always well attended and not just he also imparted so much wisdom and knowledge but because he managed to do it with humor it had taken danny some time to realize that the professor enjoyed provoking discussion and argument by offering up outrageous statements to see what reaction he would arouse from his students it would have been better for the economic stability of our nation if john maynard keynes had never been born i cannot think of one worthwhile thing that he achieved in his lifetime twenty hands shot into the air moncrieff he said what example do you have to offer of a legacy that keynes could be proud of he founded the cambridge arts theatre said danny hoping to play the professor at his own game he also played orsino in twelfth night when he was a student at kings college said mori but that was before he went on to prove to the world that it made economic sense for wealthy countries to invest in and encourage developing nations the clock on the wall behind him struck one ive had enough of you lot said the professor and marched off the platform and disappeared out of the swing doors to laughter and applause danny knew he wouldnt have time even to grab a quick lunch in the canteen if he wasnt going to be late for the meeting with his probation officer but as he dashed out of the lecture theater he found professor mori waiting in the corridor i wonder if we might have a word moncrieff said mori and without waiting for a reply charged off down the corridor danny followed him into his office prepared to defend his views of milton friedman as he knew his latest essay was not in line with the professors oftexpressed opinions on the subject have a seat dear boy mori said id offer you a drink but frankly i dont have anything worth drinking but to more important matters i wanted to know if you had considered entering your name for the jennie lee memorial prize essay competition i hadnt given it a thought admitted danny then you should said professor mori youre by far the brightest student of your intake which isnt saying a lot but i still think you could win the prise if you have the time you ought to give it your serious consideration what sort of commitment would it require asked danny whose studies were still only the second priority in his life the professor picked up a booklet that was lying on his desk turned to the first page and began reading out loud the essay should be no less than ten thousand words and no more than twenty on a subject of the entrants choice and it must be handed in by the end of michaelmas term im flattered that you think im up to it said danny im only surprised that your masters at loretto didnt advise you to go to edinburgh or oxford rather than join the army danny would like to have told the professor that no one from clement attlee comprehensive had ever been to oxford including the head teacher perhaps youd like to think it over said the professor let me know when youve come to a decision i certainly will said danny as he rose to leave thank you professor once he was back in the corridor danny began running toward the entrance as he charged through the front doors he was relieved to see big al waiting by the car danny mulled over professor moris words as big al drove along the strand and through the mall on his way to notting hill gate he continually broke the speed limit as he didnt want the boss to be late for his appointment danny made it clear that hed rather pay a speeding fine than spend another four years in belmarsh it was unfortunate that big al drew up outside the probation office just as ms bennett stepped off her bus she stared through the car window as danny tried to conceal himself behind big als hulking frame she probably thinks ye huv robbed a bank said big al and im the getaway driver i did rob a bank danny reminded him danny was made to wait in reception for longer than usual before ms bennett reappeared and beckoned him into her office once he was seated on his plastic chair on the opposite side of the formica table she said before i begin nicholas perhaps you can explain whose car you arrived in this afternoon its mine replied danny and who was the driver asked ms bennett hes my chauffeur how can you afford to own a bmw and have a chauffeur when your only declared source of income is a student grant she asked my grandfather set up a trust fund for me which pays out a monthly income of a hundred thousand pounds and nicholas said ms bennett sharply these meetings are meant to be an opportunity for you to be open and frank about any problems you are facing so that i can offer you advice and assistance i am going to allow you one more chance to answer my questions honestly if you continue to act in this frivolous manner i will have no choice but to mention it in my next report to the home office and we both know what the consequences of that will be do i make myself clear yes ms bennett said danny recalling what big al had told him when he had faced the same problem with his probation officer tell them what they want tae hear boss it makes life so much easier let me ask you once again who owns the car you arrived in this afternoon the man who was driving it said danny and is he a friend or do you work for him i knew him when i was in the army and because i was running late he offered me a lift and can you tell me if you have any source of income other than your student grant no ms bennett thats more like it said ms bennett you see how much more smoothly everything goes when you cooperate now is there anything else you want to discuss with me danny was tempted to tell her about his meeting with the three swiss bankers take her through the property deal he was trying to put together or let her know what he had in mind for charlie duncan he settled on my professor wants me to enter for the jennie lee memorial prize essay competition and i wondered what your advice would be ms bennett smiled do you think it will enhance your chances of becoming a teacher yes i suppose it might said danny then i would advise you to enter the competition i am most grateful ms bennett not at all she replied after all thats what im here for dannys unplanned latenight visit to mile end road had rekindled those glowing embers that lifers call their demons returning to the old bailey in broad daylight would mean that he had to face an even greater challenge as big al swung the car into st paul s yard danny looked up at the statue perched on top of the central criminal court a woman was attempting to balance a pair of scales when danny had flicked through his diary to see if he was free to have lunch with charlie duncan he had been reminded how he had planned to spend that morning big al drove past the public entrance swung right at the end of the road and made his way around to the back of the building where he parked outside a door marked visitors entrance once danny had been cleared through security he began the long climb up the steep stone steps that led to the galleries that overlook the different courts when he reached the top floor a court official wearing a long black schoolmasters gown asked him if he knew which court he wished to attend number four he told the officer who pointed down the corridor to the second door on the right danny followed his instructions and made his way into the public gallery a handful of onlookersfamily and friends of the accused and a few of the simply curiouswere seated on a bench in the front row peering down into the court he didnt join them danny had no interest in the accused man he had come to watch his adversary performing on his home ground he slipped into a place in the corner of the back row like a skilled assassin he had a perfect sighting of his quarry as he went about his business while spencer craig would have had to turn around and stare up into the gallery if he were to have any chance of seeing him and even then danny would appear as an irrelevant speck on his landscape danny watched every move craig made much as a boxer does when sparring with an opponent looking for flaws searching for weaknesses craig displayed very few to the untrained eye as the morning progressed it became clear that he was skillful cunning and ruthless all necessary weapons in the armory of his chosen profession but he also appeared willing to stretch the elastic of the law to breaking point if it would advance his cause as danny had already learned to his cost he knew that when the time came to face craig head on he would have to be at his sharpest because this opponent wasnt going to lie down until the last breath had been knocked out of him danny felt that he now knew almost everything there was to know about spencer craig which only made him more cautious while danny had the advantage of preparation and the element of surprise he also had the disadvantage of having dared to enter an arena that craig considered to be nothing less than his birthright whereas danny had only inhabited the same terrain for a few months with every day that he played his role it became more of a reality so that now no one he came across ever doubted that he was sir nicholas moncrieff but danny remembered that nick had written in his diary that whenever you face a skillful enemy you must lure him off his own ground so that he does not feel at ease because that is when you have the best chance of taking him by surprise danny had been testing his new skills every day but getting himself invited to a closingnight party giving the impression that he was a regular customer at the dorchester fooling a young estate agent who was desperate to close a deal and convincing a theatrical producer that he might invest in his latest production were simply the opening rounds of a long competition in which craig was undoubtedly the numberone seed if danny were to lower his guard even for a moment the man strutting his hour upon the courtroom floor below would not hesitate to strike again and this time he would make sure that danny was sent back to belmarsh for the rest of his life he had to lure this man into a swamp from which he could not hope to escape charlie duncan might be able to help him strip lawrence davenport of his adoring fans gary hall could even cause gerald payne to be humiliated in the eyes of his colleagues and friends but it would take far more to ensure that spencer craig would end his legal career not sitting in judgment on the bench wearing a wig and red gown while being addressed as mlord but standing in the dock being convicted by a jury of his fellow citizens on a charge of murder chapter fiftyfive good morning george said danny as the doorman opened the back door of the car for him good morning sir nicholas danny strolled into the hotel and waved at walter as he passed through the reception area marios face lit up the moment he spotted his favorite customer a hot chocolate and the times sir nicholas he asked once danny had settled into his alcove seat thank you mario id also like a table for lunch tomorrow at one oclock somewhere i cant be overheard that wont be a problem sir nicholas danny leaned back and thought about the meeting that was about to take place his advisers from de coubertins property department had called three times during the past week no names no small talk just facts and considered advice not only had they come up with a realistic price for the pawnshop and the carpet warehouse but they had also drawn his attention to a barren plot of land that ran behind the three properties and was owned by the local council danny didnt tell them he knew every inch of that land because when he was a kid hed played striker while bernie was in goal in their private cup final they had also been able to inform him that for some years the councils planning committee had wanted to build affordable housing on that particular site but that with a garage so close to the site the health and safety committee had vetoed the idea the minutes of the relevant committee meetings had arrived in a brown envelope the following morning danny had plans to solve their problems good morning sir nicholas danny looked up from his newspaper good morning mr hall he said as the young man took the seat opposite him hall opened his briefcase and took out a thick file marked moncrieff then removed a document and handed it to danny these are the deeds for wilson s garage he explained contracts were exchanged when i met up with miss wilson this morning danny thought his heart would stop beating a charming young woman who seemed relieved to have the problem off her hands danny smiled beth would deposit the with her local branch of the hsbc content to see it earning percent per annum although he knew exactly who would benefit most from the windfall and the two buildings on either side asked danny have you made any progress with them to my surprise said hall i think we can close a deal on both sites this came as no surprise to danny mr isaacs says hed let the pawnshop go for two hundred and fifty thousand while mr kamal is asking three hundred and twenty thousand for the carpet warehouse together they would just about double the size of your holding and our investment people estimate that the marriage value alone would almost double your original outlay pay mr isaacs his asking price offer mr kamal three hundred thousand and settle for three hundred and twenty but i still think i can get you a better deal said hall dont even think about it said danny i want you to close both deals on the same day because if mr kamal were to find out what were up to hed know hes got a ransom strip understood said hall as he continued to write down dannys instructions once youve closed both deals let me know immediately so i can open negotiations with the council about the strip of land behind the three sites we could even draw you up some outline plans before we approach them said hall it might be an ideal site for a small office block even a supermarket no it would not mr hall said danny firmly if you did that youd be wasting your time and my money hall looked embarrassed theres a branch of sainsburys only a hundred yards away and if you study the councils tenyear development plan for the area youll see that the only projects theyre giving planning permission for are affordable dwellings my experience tells me that if you make a council think something is their idea in the first place you have a far better chance of closing a deal dont get greedy mr hall remember that was another mistake my last agent made ill remember said hall dannys advisers had done their homework so well that he had no difficulty in running circles around hall meanwhile ill deposit five hundred and seventy thousand pounds in your client account today so that you can close both deals as soon as possiblebut dont forget on the same day and without either side finding out about the other sale and certainly without them becoming aware of my involvement i wont let you down said hall i hope not said danny because if you succeed in this little enterprise ive been working on something far more interesting but as there is an element of risk involved it will need the backing of one of your partners preferably someone young whos got balls and imagination i know exactly the right man said hall danny didnt bother to say and so do i how are you beth asked alex redmayne as he rose from behind his desk and ushered her toward a comfortable chair by the fire im well thank you mr redmayne alex smiled as he took a seat by her side i never could get danny to call me alex he said even though i like to think that towards the end we became friends perhaps ill be more successful with you the truth mr redmayne is that danny was even shyer than i am shy and stubborn you mustnt think that because he didnt call you by your first name he didnt consider you a friend i wish he was sitting there now telling me that said alex although i was delighted when you wrote asking to see me i wanted to seek your advice said beth but until recently i havent been in a position to do so alex leaned across and took her hand he smiled when he saw the engagement ring which she hadnt worn on the previous occasion how can i help its just that i thought i should let you know that something strange took place when i went to belmarsh to pick up dannys personal belongings that must have been a dreadful experience said alex in some ways it was worse than the funeral replied beth but as i left i bumped into mr pascoe bumped into said alex or had he been hanging around hoping to see you possibly he had but i couldnt be sure does it make any difference a world of difference said alex ray pascoe is a decent fairminded man who never doubted danny was innocent he once told me that he had met a thousand murderers in his time and danny wasnt one of them so what did he have to say thats the strange thing said beth he told me he had a feeling danny would like his name cleared not would have liked dont you find that odd a slip of the tongue perhaps said alex did you press him on the point no said beth by the time id thought about it he was gone alex didnt speak for some time while he considered the implications of pascoes words theres only one course of action open to you if you still hope to clear dannys name and thats to make an application to the queen for a royal pardon a royal pardon yes if the law lords can be convinced that an injustice has been done the lord chancellor can recommend to the queen that the appeal courts decision be overturned it was quite common in the days of capital punishment although its far rarer now and what would be the chances of dannys case even being considered asked beth its rare for an application for pardon to be granted although there are many people some in high places who consider danny suffered an injusticemyself included you seem to forget mr redmayne that i was in the pub when craig provoked the row i was in the alley when he attacked danny and i held bernie in my arms when he told me that it was craig who had stabbed him my story has never waverednot because as mr pearson suggested id prepared it every word before the trial but because i was telling the truth there are three other people who know that i was telling the truth and a fourthtoby mortimerwho confirmed my story only days before he took his own life but despite your efforts at the appeal hearing the judge wouldnt even listen to the tape why should it be any different this time alex didnt reply immediately as it took him a moment to recover from beths rebuke if you were able to rekindle a campaign among dannys friends he eventually managed like the one you mounted when he was alive there would be an outcry if the law lords didnt reopen the case but he continued if you do decide to go down that particular road beth it will be a long and arduous journey and although i would be happy to offer my services pro bono it still wouldnt come cheap money is no longer a problem said beth confidently i recently managed to sell the garage for far more than i would have thought possible ive put half the money aside for christys education because danny wanted her to have a better start in life than he did and id be happy to spend the other half trying to have the case reopened if you believe theres the slightest chance of clearing his name alex once again leaned across and took her hand beth can i ask you a personal question anything whenever danny spoke about you he always used to say hes a diamond you can tell him anything i consider that a great compliment beth it gives me the confidence to ask you something thats been preying on my mind for some time beth looked up the fire bringing a warm glow to her cheeks you are a young and beautiful woman beth with rare qualities that danny recognized but dont you think the time has come to move on its six months since dannys death seven months two weeks and five days said beth lowering her head surely he wouldnt want you to mourn him for the rest of your life no he wouldnt said beth he even tried to break off our relationship after his appeal had failed but he didnt mean it mr redmayne how can you be sure asked alex she opened her handbag took out the last letter danny had ever sent her and handed it over to alex its almost impossible to read he said and whys that you know the answer only too well beth your tears no mr redmayne not my tears although ive read that letter every day for the past eight months those tears were not shed by me but by the man who wrote them he knew how much i loved him we would have made a life together even if we could only spend one day a month with each other id have been happy to wait twenty years more in the hope that i would eventually be allowed to spend the rest of my life with the only man ill ever love i adored danny from the day i met him and no one will ever take his place i know i cant bring him back but if i could prove his innocence to the rest of the world that would be enough quite enough alex stood up walked over to his desk and picked up a file he didnt want beth to see the tears streaming down his cheeks he looked out of the window at a statue of a blindfolded woman perched on top of a building holding up a pair of scales for the world to see he said quietly ill write to the lord chancellor today thank you alex chapter fiftysix danny was seated at a corner table fifteen minutes before charlie duncan was due to appear mario had chosen the ideal spot to ensure that they could not be overheard there were so many questions that danny needed to ask all filed away in his memory danny studied the menu so that he would be familiar with it before his guest arrived he expected that duncan would be on time after all he was desperate for danny to invest in his latest show perhaps at some time in the future he might even work out the real reason hed been invited to lunch at two minutes to one charlie duncan entered the palm court restaurant wearing an opennecked shirt and smoking a cigarettea walking h m bateman cartoon the headwaiter had a discreet word with him before offering him an ashtray duncan stubbed out his cigarette while the maître d rummaged around in a drawer in his desk and produced three striped ties all of which clashed with duncan s salmonpink shirt danny suppressed a smile if it had been a tennis match he would have started the first set fivelove up the headwaiter accompanied duncan across the room to dannys table danny made a mental note to double his tip danny rose from his place to shake hands with duncan whose cheeks were now the same color as his shirt youre obviously a regular here said duncan taking his seat everyone seems to know you my father and grandfather always used to stay here whenever they came down from scotland said danny its a bit of a family tradition so what do you do nick asked duncan while he glanced at the menu i dont recall seeing you at the theater before i used to be in the army danny replied so ive been abroad a lot of the time but since my fathers death ive taken over responsibility for the family trust and youve never invested in the theater before asked duncan as the sommelier showed danny a bottle of wine danny studied the label for a moment then nodded and what will you have today sir nicholas asked mario ill have my usual said danny and keep it on the rare side he added remembering nick once delivering those words to the servers behind the hotplate at belmarsh it had caused so much laughter that nick had nearly ended up on report the sommelier poured a little wine into dannys glass he sniffed the bouquet before sipping it then nodded againsomething else nick had taught him using ribena water and a plastic mug to swill the liquid in ill have the same said duncan closing his menu and handing it back to the maître d but make mine medium the answer to your question said danny is no ive never invested in a play before so id be fascinated to learn how your world operates the first thing a producer has to do is identify a play said duncan either a new one preferably by an established playwright or a revival of a classic your next problem is to find a star like lawrence davenport said danny topping up duncan s glass no that was a oneoff larry davenports not a stage actor he can just about get away with light comedy as long as hes backed up by a strong cast but he can still fill a theater we were running a little thin towards the end of the run admitted duncan once his dr beresford fans had dried up frankly if he doesnt get back on television fairly soon he wont be able to fill a phone box so how does the finance work asked danny having already had three of his questions answered to put a play on in the west end nowadays costs four to five hundred thousand pounds so once a producer has settled on a piece signed up the star and booked the theaterand its not always possible to get all three at the same timehe relies on his angels to raise the capital how many angels do you have asked danny every producer has his own list which he guards like the crown jewels i have about seventy angels who regularly invest in my productions said duncan as a steak was placed in front of him and how much do they invest on average asked danny pouring duncan another glass of wine on a normal production units would start around ten thousand pounds so you need fifty angels per play youre sharp when it comes to figures arent you said duncan cutting into his steak danny cursed to himself he hadnt meant to drop his guard and quickly moved on so how does an angel a punter make a profit if the theater is sixty percent full for the entire run hell break even and get his money back above that figure he can make a handsome profit below it he can lose his shirt and how much are the stars paid asked danny badly by their usual standards is the answer sometimes as little as five hundred a week which is the reason so many of them prefer to do television the odd advertisement or even voiceovers rather than get themselves involved in real work we only paid larry davenport one thousand a thousand a week said danny im amazed he got out of bed for that so were we admitted duncan as the wine waiter drained the bottle danny nodded when he held it up inquiringly fine wine that said duncan danny smiled larrys problem is that he hasnt been offered much lately and at least earnest kept his name on the billboards for a few weeks soap stars like footballers soon get used to earning thousands of pounds a week not to mention the lifestyle that goes with it but once that tap is turned off even if theyve accumulated a few assets along the way they can quickly run out of cash its been a problem for so many actors especially the ones who believe their own publicity and dont put anything aside for a rainy day and then find themselves facing a large tax bill another question answered so what are you planning to do next asked danny not wanting to show too much interest in lawrence davenport in case duncan became suspicious im putting on a piece by a new playwright called anton kaszubowski he won several awards at the edinburgh festival last year its called bling bling and i have a feeling its just what the west end is looking for several big names are already showing interest and im expecting to make an announcement in the next few days once i know whos taking the lead ill drop you a line he toyed with his glass what sort of figure would you be thinking of investing he asked id begin with something small said danny say ten thousand if that works out i could well become a regular i survive on my regulars said duncan and drained his glass ill be in touch as soon as ive signed up a lead actor by the way i always throw a small drinks party for the investors when i launch a new show which inevitably attracts a few stars youll be able to see larry again or his sister depending on your preference anything else sir nicholas asked the headwaiter danny would have called for a third bottle but charlie duncan had already answered all his questions just the bill thank you mario after big al had returned him to the boltons danny went straight up to his study and took the davenport file off the shelf he spent the next hour making notes once he had written down everything of relevance that duncan had told him he replaced the file between craigs and paynes and returned to his desk he began to read through his attempt at a prize essay and after only a few paragraphs his suspicions that it wouldnt be good enough to impress professor mori let alone the panel of judges were confirmed the only good thing about the time he had spent on it was that it had occupied the endless hours of waiting before he could make his next move he had to avoid the temptation to speed things up which might well result in him making a fatal error it was several weeks before gary hall managed to close the two property deals in mile end road without either seller becoming aware what he was up to like a good fisherman danny cast his fly with a single purpose not to catch the minnows like hall that hang around the surface but to tempt the bigger fish like gerald payne to leap out of the water he also had to wait for charlie duncan to find a star for his new show before he could legitimately meet up with davenport again he also had to wait forthe phone rang danny picked it up that problem you mentioned said a voice i believe we may have come up with a solution we should meet the line went dead danny was beginning to discover why swiss bankers continue to hold on to the accounts of the rich who value discretion he picked up his pen returned to his essay and tried to think of a more arresting opening line john maynard keynes would surely have known the popular song aint we got fun with its damning line theres nothing surer the rich get rich and the poor get children he may well have speculated on its application to nations as well as individuals chapter fiftyseven japanese knotweed yes we believe that japanese knotweed is the answer said bresson although im bound to say that we were both puzzled by the question danny made no attempt to enlighten them as he was just beginning to learn how to play the swiss at their own game and why is it the answer he asked if japanese knotweed is discovered on a building site it can hold up planning permission for at least a year once its been identified experts have to be brought in to destroy the weed and building cannot commence until the local health and safety committee have deemed the site to have passed all the necessary tests so how do you get rid of japanese knotweed asked danny a specialist company moves in and sets fire to the entire site then you have to wait another three months to make sure that every last rhizome has been removed before you can reapply for planning permission that wouldnt come cheap no it certainly doesnt come cheap for the owner of the land we came across a classic example in liverpool added segat the city council discovered japanese knotweed on a thirtyacre site that had already been granted planning permission for a hundred council houses it took more than a year to remove it at a cost of just over three hundred thousand pounds by the time the houses had been built the developer was lucky to break even why is it so dangerous asked danny if you dont destroy it said bresson it will eat its way into the foundations of any building even reinforced concrete and ten years later without warning the whole edifice comes tumbling down leaving you with an insurance bill that would bankrupt most companies in osaka japanese knotweed destroyed an entire apartment block which is how it acquired its name so how do i get hold of some asked danny well you certainly wont find a packet on the shelves of your local garden center said bresson however i suspect that any company which specializes in destroying it could point you in the right direction bresson paused for a moment it would of course be illegal to plant it on someone elses land he said looking directly at danny but not on your own land danny replied which silenced both bankers have you come up with a solution for the other half of my problem it was segat who answered him once again your request was to say the least unusual and it certainly falls into the highrisk category however my team feel they may have identified a piece of land in east london that fulfills all your criterion danny recalled nick correcting him on the proper use of the word criteria but decided not to enlighten segat london as you will be well aware continued segat is bidding to host the olympics with most of the major events provisionally planned to take place at stratford in east london although the success or failure of the bid has not yet been decided this has already created a large speculative market for sites in the area among the sites the olympic committee are currently considering is the venue for a velodrome which would accommodate all the indoor cycling events my contacts inform me that six potential sites have been identified of which only two are likely to be on the shortlist you are in the happy position of being able to purchase both sites and although you would initially have to pay a heavy premium there is still potential for a handsome profit how heavy a premium asked danny we have valued the two sites said bresson at around a million pounds each but both of the current owners are asking for a million and a half but if they were both to make the shortlist they could end up being worth as much as six million and if one of them turned out to be the winner that figure could be doubled but if it doesnt said danny i stand to lose three million he paused ill have to consider your report very carefully before im willing to risk that amount youve only got a month to make up your mind said bresson because thats when the shortlist will be announced if both of the sites are on it you certainly wouldnt be able to pick them up at that price youll find all the material you need to help make your decision in here added segat handing danny two files thank you said danny ill let you know what ive decided by the end of the week segat nodded now id like an update on how your negotiations with tower hamlets council over the wilson garage site on mile end road are progressing our london lawyer had a meeting with the councils chief planning officer last week said segat to try to discover what his committee would regard as acceptable were you to apply for outline planning permission the council has always envisaged a block of affordable flats on that piece of land but they accept that the developer has to make a profit theyve come up with a proposal that if seventy flats were to be built on the site one third of them would have to be classified as affordable dwellings thats not mathematically possible said danny segat smiled for the first time we didnt consider it wise to point out that there would have to be either sixtynine or seventytwo flats allowing us some room for negotiation however if we were to agree in principle to their suggestion they would sell us the plot for four hundred thousand pounds and grant outline planning permission at the same time on that basis we would recommend that you accept their offer price but try to get the council to allow you to build ninety flats the chief planning officer felt that this would cause heated debate in the council chamber but if we were to raise our offer to say five hundred thousand he could see his way to recommending our proposal if this were to be approved by the council said bresson youd end up owning the whole site for just over a million pounds if we managed to achieve that what do you suggest should be my next move you have two choices said bresson you can either sell on to a developer or you can build and manage the project yourself i have no interest in spending the next three years on a building site said danny in that case once weve agreed terms and provisional planning permission has been granted just sell the site on to the highest bidder i agree that might be the wisest solution said segat and im confident that you will still double your investment in the short term youve done well said danny we could not have moved so swiftly said segat had it not been for your knowledge of the site and its past history danny didnt react to what was clearly a fishing expedition finally perhaps you could bring me up to date on my current financial position certainly said bresson extracting another file from his briefcase we have merged your two accounts as requested and formed three trading companies none of them in your name your personal account currently stands at slightly down on where it was three months ago however you have made several investments during that time which should eventually show a handsome return we have also purchased on your behalf some of the shares you identified when we last met making a further investment of just over two million poundsyoull find the details on page nine of your green file again following your instructions we have placed any surplus cash with triplea institutions on the overnight currency markets which is presently showing a yearonyear return of approximately eleven percent danny decided not to comment on the difference between the percent interest the bank had originally been paying and the percent he was now accruing thank you he said perhaps we could meet again in a months time segat and bresson nodded and began to gather up their files danny rose from his place and aware that neither banker had any interest in small talk accompanied them to the front door ill be back in touch he said the moment ive come to a decision on those two olympic sites after they had been driven away danny went upstairs to his study removed gerald paynes file from the shelf placed it on his desk and spent the rest of the morning transferring all the details that would assist in his plan to destroy him if he were to purchase the two sites he would then need to meet payne face to face had he ever heard of japanese knotweed are parents always more ambitious for their children than they are for themselves beth wondered as she entered the headmistresss study miss sutherland stepped forward from behind her desk and shook hands with beth the headmistress didnt smile as she ushered her into a chair and then reread the application form beth tried not to show just how nervous she was am i to understand miss wilson said the headmistress emphasizing the word miss you are hoping that your daughter will be able to join our preschool group at st veronicas next term yes i am replied beth i think christy would greatly benefit from the stimulus your school has to offer there is no doubt that your daughter is advanced for her years said miss sutherland glancing at her entrance papers however as im sure you will appreciate before she can be offered a place at st veronicas there are other concerns i will have to take into consideration naturally said beth fearing the worst for instance i can find no mention of the childs father on the application form no said beth he died last year im sorry to hear that said miss sutherland not sounding at all sorry may i inquire what was the cause of death beth hesitated as she always found it difficult to utter the words he committed suicide i see said the headmistress were you married to him at the time no admitted beth we were engaged im sorry to have to ask this question miss wilson but what were the circumstances of your fiancés death he was in prison at the time said beth softly i see said miss sutherland may i ask what offense he was convicted of murder said beth now certain that miss sutherland already knew the answer to every question she was asking in the eyes of the catholic church both suicide and murder are as im sure you are aware miss wilson mortal sins beth said nothing i also feel it is my duty to point out the headmistress continued that there are no illegitimate children currently registered at st veronicas however i will give your daughters application my most serious consideration and will let you know my decision in the next few days at that moment beth felt that slobodan miloševich had a better chance of winning the nobel peace prize than christy did of entering st veronicas the headmistress rose from behind her desk walked across the room and opened the study door goodbye miss wilson once the door had been closed behind her beth burst into tears why should the sins of the father chapter fiftyeight danny wonder ed how he would react to meeting gerald payne he couldnt afford to show any emotion and certainly if he were to lose his temper all the hours that hed spent planning paynes downfall would have been wasted big al drew up outside baker tremlett and smythe a few minutes early but when danny pushed through the swing doors and walked into the foyer he found gary hall standing by the reception desk waiting to greet him hes quite an exceptional man hall enthused as they walked across to a bank of lifts the youngest partner in the history of the company he added as he pressed a button that would whisk them up to the top floor and quite recently hes landed a safe parliamentary seat so i dont suppose hell be with us for much longer danny smiled his plan had only involved payne being sacked having to give up a parliamentary seat as well would be an added bonus when they stepped out of the lift hall led his most important client along the partners corridor until they reached a door with the name gerald payne printed in gold hall knocked softly opened it and stood aside to allow danny to enter payne leaped up from behind his desk and tried to do up his jacket as he walked toward them but it was clear that it had been some time since the middle button had reached the buttonhole he thrust out his hand and gave danny an exaggerated smile try as he might danny couldnt return it have we met before asked payne looking at danny more closely yes said danny at lawrence davenports closingnight party oh yes of course said payne before inviting danny to take a seat on the opposite side of the desk gary hall remained standing let me begin sir nicholas nick said danny gerald said payne danny nodded as i was saying let me begin by expressing my admiration for your little coup with tower hamlets council over the site in bowa deal which in my opinion will see you double your outlay in under a year mr hall did most of the spadework said danny im afraid ive been distracted by something far more demanding payne leaned forward and will you be involving our firm in your latest venture he inquired certainly in the final stages said danny although ive already completed most of the research but ill still need someone to represent me when it comes to putting in an offer for the site well be happy to assist in any way we can said payne the smile returning to his face do you feel able to take us into your confidence at this stage he added danny was pleased to find that payne was clearly only interested in what might be in it for him this time he returned the smile everyone knows that if london is awarded the olympics there will be a lot of money to be made during the runup said danny with a budget of ten billion available there should be enough washing around for all of us i would normally agree with you said payne looking a little disappointed but dont you think that market is already rather overcrowded yes i do said danny if your mind is only focused on the main stadium the swimming pool the gymnastics hall the athletes village or even the equestrian center but ive identified an opportunity that hasnt attracted press attention or any public interest payne leaned forward and placed his elbows on the table as danny sat back and relaxed for the first time almost no one has noticed danny continued that the olympic committee has been considering six sites for the building of a velodrome how many people can even tell you what takes place in a velodrome cycling said gary hall well done said danny and in a fortnights time well learn which two sites the olympic committee has provisionally shortlisted my bet is that even after the announcement is made it wont get much more than the odd paragraph in the local paper and then only on the sports pages neither payne nor hall interrupted him but i have some inside information said danny which i acquired at a cost of four pounds ninetynine four ninetynine repeated payne looking mystified the price of cycling monthly said danny removing a copy from his briefcase in this months issue they leave no doubt which two sites the olympic committee will be shortlisting and their editor clearly has the ear of the minister danny passed the magazine over to payne open at the relevant page and you say the press havent followed this up said payne once hed finished reading the magazines leader why should they said danny but once the site has been announced said payne dozens of developers will apply for the contract im not interested in building the velodrome said danny i intend to have made my money long before the first excavator moves onto the site and how do you expect to do that that i admit has cost me a little more than four ninetynine but if you look on the back of cycling monthly said danny turning the magazine over youll see the name of the publishers printed in the bottom righthand corner the next edition wont be on the stands for another ten days but for a little more than the cover price i managed to get my hands on an early proof theres an article on page seventeen by the president of the british cycling federation in which he says that the minister has assured him that only two sites are being taken seriously the minister will be making an announcement to that effect in the house of commons the day before the magazine goes on sale but he goes on to point out which of the two sites his committee will be backing brilliant said payne but surely the owners of that site must be aware that they may be sitting on a fortune only if they can get their hands on next months cycling monthly because at the moment they still think theyre on a shortlist of six so what are you planning to do about it asked payne the site that is favored by the cycling federation changed hands quite recently for three million pounds although i havent been able to identify the buyer however once the minister has made her announcement the site could be worth fifteen perhaps even twenty million while there are still six possible sites on the shortlist if someone were to offer the present owner say four or five million i suspect they might be tempted to take a quick turn rather than risk ending up with nothing our problem is that we have less than a fortnight before the shortlist of two is announced and once the views of the cycling federations president become public there will be nothing left in it for us can i make a suggestion said payne go ahead said danny if youre so certain there are only two sites in contention why not purchase both of them your profit may not be as large but it would be impossible for you to lose danny now realized why payne had become the youngest partner in the firms history good idea said danny but theres not much point in doing that until weve found out if the site were really interested in can be purchased thats where you come in youll find all the details you need in this file apart from who owns the site after all you have to do something to earn your money payne laughed ill get straight on to it nick and be back in touch with you as soon as ive tracked down the owner dont hang about said danny standing up the rewards will only be high if we can move quickly payne produced the same smile as he stood to shake hands with his new client as danny turned to leave he spotted a familiar invitation on the mantelpiece will you be at charlie duncans drinks party this evening he asked sounding surprised yes i will i occasionally invest in his shows then i may see you there said danny in which case youll be able to bring me up to date will do said payne can i just check on one thing before i get started yes of course said danny trying not to sound anxious when it comes to the investment will you be putting up the full amount yourself every penny said danny and you wouldnt consider allowing anyone else to have a piece of the action no said danny firmly forgive me father for i have sinned said beth its been two weeks since my last confession father michael smiled the moment he recognized beths gentle voice he was always moved by her confessions because what she considered to be a sin most of his parishioners would not have thought worthy of mention i am ready to hear your confession my child he said as if he had no idea who it was on the other side of the lattice window i have thought unworthily of another and wished them ill father michael stirred are you able to tell me what caused you to have such evil thoughts my child i wanted my daughter to have a better start in life than i did and i felt that the headmistress of the school i had chosen did not give me a fair hearing is it possible that you were unable to see things from her point of view said father michael after all you may have misjudged her motives when beth didnt respond he added you must always remember my child that it is not for us to judge the lords will as he might have other plans for your little girl then i must ask for the lords forgiveness said beth and wait to discover what is his will i think that would be the wise course to take my child meanwhile you should pray and seek the lords guidance and what penance should i perform father for my sins you must learn to be contrite and to forgive those who cannot hope to understand your problems said father michael you will say one our father and two hail marys thank you father father michael waited until he heard the little door close and was sure that beth had departed he sat alone for some time while he gave beths problem considerable thought only relieved that he was not interrupted by another parishioner he then stepped out of the confessional box and headed for the vestry he walked quickly past beth who was on her knees head bowed a rosary in her hand once hed reached the vestry father michael locked the door went over to his desk and dialed a number this was one of those rare occasions when he felt the lords will needed a little assistance big al dropped the boss outside the front door a few minutes after eight once danny had entered the building he didnt need to be told where charlie duncans office was the sound of laughter and exuberant chatter was coming from the first floor and one or two of the guests had spilled out onto the landing danny climbed the shabby badly lit staircase passing framed posters of previous shows duncan had produced not one of which danny remembered being a hit he made his way past an intertwined young couple who didnt give him as much as a glance he walked into what was clearly duncan s office and quickly discovered why people were spilling out onto the landing it was so crowded the guests could hardly move a young girl standing by the door offered him a drink and danny asked for a glass of waterafter all he needed to concentrate if his investment was to show a dividend danny glanced around the room looking for someone he knew and spotted katie she turned away the moment she saw him it only made him smile and think of beth shed always teased him about how shy he was especially when he entered a room full of strangers if beth had been there by now she would have been chatting to a group of people shed never met before how he missed her someone touched his arm interrupting his thoughts and he turned to find gerald payne standing by his side nick he said as if they were old friends good news ive tracked down the bank which represents the owner of one of the sites and do you have any contacts there unfortunately not admitted payne but as they are based in geneva the owner may well be a foreigner who has no idea of the sites potential value or he may be an englishman who knows only too well danny had already discovered that paynes bottles were always threequarters full either way said payne well find out tomorrow because the banker a monsieur segat has promised to call back in the morning and let me know if his client is willing to sell and the other site asked danny not much point in chasing after that if the owner of the first site is unwilling to sell youre probably right said danny not bothering to point out that was what he had recommended in the first place gerald said lawrence davenport leaning down to kiss payne on both cheeks danny was surprised to see that davenport was unshaven and wearing a shirt that had clearly already been worn more than once that week as the two men exchanged greetings he felt such loathing for both of them that he found himself unable to join in the conversation do you know nick moncrieff asked payne davenport showed neither recognition nor interest we met at your closingnight party said danny oh right said davenport showing a little more interest i saw the play twice how flattering said davenport giving him the smile reserved for his fans will you be starring in charlies next production asked danny no replied davenport much as i adored being in earnest i cant afford to devote my talents to the stage alone whys that asked danny innocently you have to turn down so many opportunities if you commit yourself to a long run you never know when someones going to ask you to star in a film or take the lead in a new miniseries thats a pity said danny i would have invested considerably more if youd been a member of the cast how nice of you to say so said davenport perhaps youll have another opportunity at some time in the future i do hope so said danny because youre a real star he was becoming aware that there was no such thing as overthetop with lawrence davenport as long as you were talking to lawrence davenport about lawrence davenport well said davenport if you really did want to make a shrewd investment i have larry said a voice davenport turned away and kissed another man far younger than himself the moment had gone but davenport had left the door wide open and danny intended to barge in unannounced at some later date sad said payne as davenport drifted off sad prompted danny he was the star of our generation at cambridge said payne we all assumed he would have a glittering career but it wasnt to be i notice that you call him larry said danny like laurence olivier thats about the only thing he has in common with olivier danny almost felt sorry for davenport when he recalled dumass words with friends like these well time is still on his side he added not with his problems it isnt said payne his problems said danny as he felt a slap on the back hi nick said charlie duncan another instant friend hi charlie replied danny hope youre enjoying the party said duncan as he filled dannys empty glass with champagne yes thank you are you still thinking of investing in bling bling old boy whispered duncan oh yes said danny you can put me down for ten thousand he didnt add despite it being an unfathomable script shrewd fellow said duncan and slapped him on the back again ill drop a contract in the post tomorrow is lawrence davenport doing a film at the moment danny asked what makes you ask that the unshaven look and the shabby clothes i thought they might involve some part hes playing no no said duncan laughing hes not playing a part hes only just got out of bed once again he lowered his voice id steer clear of him at the moment old boy and whys that asked danny hes on the scrounge dont lend him anything because youll never get it back god knows how much he owes just to the people in this room thanks for the warning said danny putting the full glass of champagne on a passing tray i must be off but thanks its been a great party so soon but you havent even met the stars youll be investing in yes i have said danny she picked up the phone on her desk and recognized the voice immediately good evening father she said how may i assist you no miss sutherland it is i who wish to assist you and what do you have in mind i was hoping to help you come to a decision concerning christy cartwright a young member of my congregation christy cartwright said the headmistress the name rings a bell as indeed it should miss sutherland any conscientious headmistress couldnt fail to notice that christy is potentially scholarship material in this dreadful age of academic rankings and any conscientious headmistress could also not have failed to notice that the childs parents were unmarried a state of affairs that the governors of st veronicas still frown upon as im sure you will recall from the days when you served on the board and rightly so miss sutherland responded father michael but let me put your mind at rest by assuring you that i read the marriage banns three times at st marys and posted the date of their wedding on the church noticeboard as well as the parish magazine but unfortunately the marriage never took place the headmistress reminded him due to unforeseen circumstances murmured father oconnor i am sure that i dont have to remind you father of pope john pauls encyclical evangelium vitae making it clear that suicide and indeed murder are still in the eyes of the church mortal sins this i fear leaves me with no choice but to wash my hands of the matter you wouldnt be the first person in history to do that miss sutherland that was unworthy of you father snapped the headmistress you are right to rebuke me miss sutherland and i apologize i fear that i am only human and am therefore prone to making mistakes perhaps one of them was when an exceptionally talented young woman made an application to be headmistress of st veronicas and i failed to inform the governors that she had recently had an abortion im sure i dont need to remind you miss sutherland that the holy father also considers that to be a mortal sin chapter fiftynine for several weeks danny had been avoiding professor mori he feared his effort for the essay competition would not have impressed the garrulous professor but after he left the morning lecture danny saw mori standing by the door of his office there was no escaping the beckoning finger like a schoolboy who knows hes about to be given a flogging danny meekly followed him into his study he waited for the stinging remarks the barbed witticisms the poisoned arrows aimed at a static target im disappointed began professor mori as danny lowered his head how was it possible that he could handle swiss bankers west end impresarios senior partners and seasoned solicitors but was a quivering wreck in the presence of this man so now you know continued the professor how it must feel to be an olympic finalist who fails to step onto the podium danny looked up puzzled congratulations said a beaming professor mori you came fourth in the prize essay competition as it counts towards your degree im expecting great things from you when you sit your final exams he rose still smiling congratulations he repeated shaking danny warmly by the hand thank you professor said danny trying to take in the news he could hear nick saying damn good show old chap and he only wished he could share the news with beth she would be so proud how much longer could he survive without seeing her he left the professor and ran along the corridor out of the door and down the steps to see big al standing by the back door of the car looking anxiously at his watch danny inhabited three different worlds and in the next one he couldnt afford to be late for his probation officer danny had decided not to tell ms bennett how he would be spending the rest of his afternoon as he had no doubt that she would dismiss the very idea as frivolous however she did appear pleased to learn how hed fared in the essay competition molly had already served monsieur segat with a second cup of tea by the time danny arrived back from his meeting with ms bennett the swiss banker rose from his place as danny entered the room he apologized for being a few minutes late without offering an explanation segat gave a slight nod before sitting back down you are now the owner of both sites which are in serious contention for the olympic velodrome he said although you can no longer expect to make quite such a large profit you should still have a more than satisfactory return on your original investment has payne called back was all danny wanted to know yes he phoned again this morning and made a bid of four million pounds for the site most likely to be selected i presume you want me to turn the offer down yes but tell him that you would accept six million on the understanding that the contract is signed before the minister announces her decision but that site will be worth at least twelve million if everything goes to plan be assured everything is going to plan said danny has payne shown any interest in the other site no why should he said segat when everyone seems to know which site is going to be selected having gained all the information he needed danny switched subjects who came up with the highest offer for our site on mile end road the highest bidder turned out to be fairfax homes a firstclass company which the council has worked with in the past ive studied their proposal said segat handing danny a glossy brochure and have no doubt that subject to a few modifications from the planning committee the scheme should get the green light within the next few weeks how much asked danny trying not to sound impatient ah yes said segat checking his figures remembering that your outlay was a little over a million pounds i think you can be well satisfied that fairfax homes came in at giving you a profit of over half a million pounds not a bad return on your capital remembering that the moneys been in play for less than a year how do you explain the figure of asked danny i would guess that mr fairfax expected that there would be several bids around the one point eight million mark and just stuck his date of birth on the end danny laughed as he began to study fairfax s plans for a magnificent new block of luxury flats on the site where he had once worked as a garage mechanic do i have your authority to call mr fairfax and let him know his was the successful bid yes do said danny and once youve spoken to him id like a word while segat made the call danny continued to study fairfax homes impressive plans for the new apartment block he only had one query ill just pass you over to sir nicholas mr fairfax said segat he would like to have a word with you ive just been studying your plans mr fairfax said danny and i see you have a penthouse on the top floor thats right said fairfax four beds four baths all ensuite just over three thousand square feet overlooking a garage on the other side of mile end road less than a mile from the city retorted fairfax both of them laughed and youre putting the penthouse on the market at six hundred and fifty thousand mr fairfax yes thats the asking price fairfax confirmed ill close the deal at a million three said danny if youll throw in the penthouse a million two and youve got yourself a deal said fairfax on one condition and whats that danny told mr fairfax the one change he wanted and the developer agreed without hesitation danny had chosen the hour carefully am big al drove around redcliffe square twice before stopping outside number danny walked up a path that hadnt seen a trowel recently when he reached the front door he rang the bell and waited for some time but there was no reply he banged the brass knocker twice and could hear the sound echoing inside but still no one answered the door he rang the bell one more time before finally giving up and deciding to try again in the afternoon he had almost reached the gate when the door suddenly swung open and a voice demanded who the hell are you nick moncrieff said danny turning around and walking back up the path you asked me to give you a call but youre exdirectory and as i just happened to be passing davenport was wearing a silk dressing gown and slippers he clearly hadnt shaved for several days and began blinking in the morning sunlight like an animal that had come out of hibernation on the first day of spring you told me you had an investment you thought i might be interested in danny reminded him oh yes i remember now said lawrence davenport sounding a little more receptive yes come in danny entered an unlit corridor that brought back memories of what the house in the boltons had been like before molly had taken charge do have a seat while i get changed said davenport ill only be a moment danny didnt sit he strolled around the room admiring the paintings and fine furniture even if they were covered in a layer of dust he peered through the back window to see a large but unkempt garden the anonymous voice had called from geneva that morning to say that houses in the square were currently changing hands at around three million pounds mr davenport had purchased number in when eight million viewers were tuning in to the prescription every saturday evening to find out which nurse dr beresford would be sleeping with that week he has a mortgage of one million pounds with norwich union said the voice and for the last three months hes fallen behind with his payments danny turned away from the window when davenport walked back into the room he was wearing an openneck shirt jeans and sneakers danny had seen betterdressed men in prison can i fix you a drink asked davenport its a little early for me said danny its never too early said davenport as he poured himself a large whiskey he took a gulp and smiled ill get straight to the point because i know youre a busy chap its just that im a little strapped for cash at the momentonly temporary you understandjust until someone signs me up for another series in fact my agent was on the phone this morning with one or two ideas you need a loan said danny yes thats the long and the short of it and what can you put up as collateral well my paintings for a start said davenport i paid over a million for them ill give you three hundred thousand for the entire collection said danny but i paid over spluttered davenport pouring himself another whiskey thats assuming you can provide evidence that the total you paid does amount to over a million davenport stared at him as he tried to recall where they had last met ill instruct my lawyer to draw up a contract and youll receive the money the day you sign it davenport took another gulp of whiskey ill think about it he said you do that said danny and if you repay the full amount within twelve months ill return the paintings at no extra charge so whats the catch asked davenport no catch but if you fail to pay the money back within twelve months the paintings will be mine i cant lose said davenport a broad grin spread across his face lets hope not said danny who stood up to join him as davenport began walking toward the door ill send a contract round along with a check for three hundred thousand pounds said danny as he followed him into the hall thats good of you said davenport lets hope your agent comes up with something that suits your particular talents said danny as davenport opened the front door you dont have to concern yourself about that said davenport my bet is that youll have your money back within a few weeks thats good to hear said danny oh and should you ever decide to sell this house my home said davenport no never out of the question dont even think about it he closed the front door as if hed been dealing with a tradesman chapter sixty danny read the report in the times as molly poured him a black coffee an exchange which had taken place on the floor of the house between the minister of sport and billy cormack the member for stratford south was tucked in at the end of the papers parliamentary report cormack lab stratford south can the minister confirm that she has shortlisted two sites for the proposed olympic velodrome minister yes i can and im sure my honorable friend will be delighted to learn that the site in his constituency is one of the two still under consideration cormack i thank the minister for her reply is she aware that the president of the british cycling federation has written to me pointing out that his committee voted unanimously in favor of the site in my constituency minister yes i am partly because my honorable friend kindly sent me a copy of that letter laughter let me assure him that i shall take the views of the british cycling federation very seriously before i make my final decision andrew crawford con stratford west does the minister realize that this news will not be welcomed in my constituency where the other shortlisted site is located as we have plans to build a new leisurecenter on that land and never wanted the velodrome in the first place minister i will take the honorable members views into consideration before i make my final decision molly placed two boiled eggs in front of danny just as his mobile phone rang he wasnt surprised to see paynes name flash up on the little screen although he hadnt expected him to call quite so early he flicked open the mobile and said good morning morning nick sorry to ring at this hour but i wondered if youd read the parliamentary report in the telegraph i dont take the telegraph said danny but i have read the ministerial exchange in the times whats your paper saying that the president of the british cycling federation has been invited to address the olympic sites committee next week four days before the minister makes her final decision apparently its no more than a formalityan inside source has told the telegraph that the minister is only waiting for the surveyors report before she confirms her decision the times has roughly the same story said danny but that isnt why i phoned said payne i wanted you to know that ive already had a call from the swiss this morning and theyve turned down your offer of four million hardly surprising given the circumstances said danny but said payne they made it clear that they would accept six mil as long as the full amount is paid before the minister announces her final decision in ten days time thats still a nobrainer said danny but ive got some news too and im afraid mine is not so good my banks not willing to advance me the full amount right now but why not said payne surely they can see what an opportunity this is yes they can but they still consider its a risk perhaps i should have warned you that im a little overstretched at the moment with one or two other projects that arent going quite as well as id hoped but i thought you made a killing on the mile end road site it didnt turn out quite as well as i anticipated said danny i ended up with a profit of just over three hundred thousand and as i told gary hall some time ago my last agent let me down rather badly and im now having to pay the price for his lack of judgment so how much can you put up asked payne a million said danny which means that well be five million short so i fear the deal is off a long silence followed during which danny sipped his coffee and removed the tops of his two eggs nick i dont suppose youd allow me to offer this deal to some of my other clients why not said danny remembering all the work youve put in im just livid that i cant put up all the capital for the best deal ive come across for years thats very magnanimous of you said payne i wont forget it i owe you one you sure do said danny as he snapped his mobile closed he was just about to attack his egg when the phone rang again he checked the screen to see if he could ask whoever was calling to ring back later but realized he couldnt when the word voice flashed up he opened the phone and listened weve already had several calls this morning with offers for your site including one of eight million what do you want me to do about mr payne youll be getting a call from him making an offer of six million you will accept his offer danny said before the voice could comment on two conditions two conditions repeated the voice he must deposit six hundred thousand with the bank before close of business today and he must also pay the full amount before the minister makes her announcement in ten days time ill call you back once hes been in touch said the voice danny looked down at a prison yolk molly could you boil me another couple of eggs chapter sixtyone spencer craig left chambers at five oclock as it was his turn to host the quarterly musketeers dinner they still got together four times a year despite the fact that toby mortimer was no longer with them the fourth dinner had become known as the memorial dinner craig always used outside caterers so that he didnt have to worry about preparing the meal or the clearing up afterward although he did like to select the wine himself and to sample the food before the first guest arrived gerald had rung him earlier in the day to say that he had some exciting news to share with the team that could change their whole lives craig would never forget the previous occasion when a meeting of the musketeers had changed their whole lives but since danny cartwright had hanged himself no one had ever referred to the subject again craig thought about his fellow musketeers as he drove home gerald payne had gone from strength to strength in his firm and now that he had been selected for a safe conservative seat in sussex he looked certain to be a member of parliament whenever the prime minister called the next election larry davenport appeared more relaxed recently and had even paid back the ten thousand pounds craig had lent him a couple of years ago which he hadnt expected to see again perhaps larry also had something to tell the team craig had his own piece of news to share with the musketeers this evening and although it was no more than he had expected it was nevertheless gratifying the briefs had picked up again as he continued to win cases and his appearance at the danny cartwright trial was becoming a hazy memory that most of his colleagues could hardly recallwith one exception his private life remained patchy to say the least the occasional onenight stand but other than larrys sister there was no one he wanted to see a second time however sarah davenport had made it all too clear that she wasnt interested but he hadnt given up hope when craig arrived back at his home in hambledon terrace he checked the wine racks to find he had nothing worthy of a musketeers dinner he strolled to his local on the corner of the kings road and selected three bottles of merlot three of a vintage australian sauvignon and a magnum of laurent perrier after all he had something to celebrate as he walked back to the house carrying two bags full of bottles he heard a siren in the distance which brought back memories of that night they didnt seem to fade with time like other memories he had called detective sergeant fuller then run home stripped off his clothes had a quick shower without allowing his hair to get wet dressed in an almost identical suit shirt and tie and been back sitting at the bar seventeen minutes later if redmayne had checked the distance between the dunlop arms and craigs home before the opening of the trial he might have been able to plant even more doubt in the jurors minds thank god it was only his second case as a leader because if hed been up against arnold pearson he would have checked every paving stone on the route back to his home with a stopwatch in his hand craig had not been surprised by how long it had taken ds fuller before he walked into the pub as he knew he would have far more important problems to deal with in the alley a dying man and an obvious suspect covered in blood he would also have no reason to suspect that a complete stranger could have been involved especially when three other witnesses corroborated his story the barman had kept his mouth shut but then hed been in trouble with the police before and would have made an unreliable witness whichever side he appeared for craig had continued to purchase all his wine from the dunlop arms and when the bills were sent at the end of each month and didnt always add up he made no comment once hed returned home craig left the wine on the kitchen table and put the champagne in the fridge he then went upstairs to shower and change into something more casual hed just returned to the kitchen and started uncorking a bottle when the doorbell rang he couldnt remember when hed last seen gerald looking so buoyant and assumed it must be because of the news hed called about that afternoon how are you enjoying the constituency work craig asked as he hung up paynes coat and led him into the drawing room great fun but i cant wait for the general election so i can take my place in the commons craig poured him a glass of champagne and asked if hed heard from larry lately i popped round to see him one evening last week but he wouldnt let me inside the house which i thought was a little strange the last time i visited him at home the place was in a dreadful state said craig it might have been no more than that or perhaps just another boyfriend he didnt want you to meet he must be working said payne he sent me a check last week for a loan id given up on long ago you too said craig as the doorbell rang a second time when davenport strolled in to join them all the swagger and selfconfidence seemed to have returned he kissed gerald on both cheeks as if he were a french general inspecting his troops craig offered him a glass of champagne and couldnt help thinking that larry looked ten years younger than when hed last seen him perhaps he was about to reveal something that would upstage them all lets begin the evening with a toast said craig to absent friends the three men raised their glasses and cried toby mortimer so who shall we drink to next asked davenport sir nicholas moncrieff said payne without hesitation who the hell is he asked craig the man whos about to change all our fortunes how asked davenport unwilling to reveal the fact that moncrieff was the reason hed been able to pay back the money hed borrowed from them both as well as several other debts ill tell you the details over dinner said payne but tonight i insist on going last because this time im confident that you wont be able to trump me i wouldnt be so sure of that gerald said davenport looking even more pleased with himself than usual a young woman appeared in the doorway were ready when you are mr craig the three men strolled through to the dining room recounting their days at cambridge the stories becoming more exaggerated by the year craig took his place at the head of the table as portions of smoked salmon were placed in front of his two guests once he had tasted the wine and nodded his approval he turned to davenport and said i cant wait any longer larry lets hear your news first youve clearly had a change of fortune davenport leaned back in his chair and waited until he was certain he had their undivided attention a couple of days ago i had a call from the bbc asking me to drop into broadcasting house for a chat that usually means they want to offer you a small part in a radio play with a fee that wouldnt cover the taxi fare from redcliffe square to portland place but this time i was taken out to lunch by a senior producer who told me that they were going to write a new character into holbycity and i was their first choice it seems that dr beresford has faded in peoples memory blessed memory said payne raising his glass theyve asked me to do a screen test next week bravo said craig also raising his glass my agent tells me theyre not considering anyone else for the part so he should be able to close a threeyear contract with residuals and a tough renewal clause not bad i must admit said payne but im confident i can still beat both of you so whats your news spencer craig filled his glass and took a sip before he spoke the lord chancellor has asked to see me next week he took another sip as he allowed the news to sink in is he going to offer you his job asked davenport all in good time said craig but the only reason he asks to see someone of my humble status is when hes going to invite them to take silk and become a qc and well deserved said davenport as he and payne rose from their places to salute their host it hasnt been announced yet said craig waving them back down so whatever you do dont breathe a word craig and davenport leaned back in their chairs and turned to payne your turn old chum said craig so what is it thats going to change our whole lives there was a knock on the door come in said danny big al stood in the doorway clutching a large parcel its jist been delivered boss where wull i put it just leave it on the table said danny continuing to read his book as if the package was of little importance as soon as he heard the door close he put down adam smith on the theory of freemarket economics and walked across to the table he looked at the package marked hazardous handle with care for some time before removing the brown paper wrapping to reveal a cardboard box he had to peel off several layers of sellotape before he was finally able to lift the lid he took out a pair of black rubber boots size and tried them ona perfect fit next he removed a pair of thin latex gloves and a large torch when he switched it on the beam lit up the whole room the next articles to be removed from the box were a black nylon jumpsuit and a mask to cover his nose and mouth he had been given a choice of black or white and had chosen black the only thing danny left in the box was a small plastic container covered in bubble wrap and marked hazardous he didnt unwrap the container because he already knew what was inside he placed the gloves torch boots jumpsuit and mask back in the box took a reel of thick tape from the top drawer of his desk and resealed the lid danny smiled a thousand pounds well invested and how much will you be contributing to this little enterprise asked craig about a million of my own money said payne of which ive already transferred six hundred thousand in order to secure the contract wont that stretch you asked craig to breaking point payne admitted but im unlikely to come across an opportunity like this again in my lifetime and the profit will allow me enough to live on after i become an mp and have to resign my partnership let me try to understand what youre proposing said davenport whatever sum we put up youll guarantee to double it in less than a month you can never guarantee anything said payne but this is a twohorse race and ours is the clear favorite in simple terms i have the opportunity to pick up a piece of land for six million which will be worth fifteen to twenty million once the minister announces which site shes selected for the velodrome thats assuming she chooses your site said craig ive shown you the entry in hansard reporting her exchange with those two mps yes you have said craig but im still puzzled if its such a good deal why doesnt this chap moncrieff buy the site himself i dont think he ever had enough to cover the six million in the first place said payne but hes still putting up a million of his own money something just doesnt feel right to me said craig youre such an old cynic spencer said payne let me remind you what happened last time i presented the musketeers with such a golden opportunitylarry toby and i all doubled our money on that farmland in gloucestershire in just under two years now im offering you an even safer bet except this time youll double your money in ten days ok im willing to risk two hundred thousand said craig but ill kill you if anything goes wrong the blood drained from paynes face and davenport was struck dumb come on chaps it was only a joke said craig so im good for two hundred thousand what about you larry if geralds willing to risk a million so am i said davenport quickly recovering im fairly confident i can raise that amount on my house without it changing my lifestyle your lifestyle is going to change in ten days time old chum said payne neither of us will ever need to work again all for one and one for all said davenport trying to stand up all for one and one for all cried craig and payne in unison they all raised their glasses how are you going to raise the rest of the money craig asked after all the three of us will be putting in less than half dont forget moncrieffs million and my chairman is stumping up half a million ive also approached a few chums who ive made money for over the years and even charlie duncan is considering investing so i should have covered the full amount by the end of the week and as im the host for the next gettogether of the musketeers he continued i thought id book a table at harrys bar or mcdonalds said craig should the minister select the other site chapter sixtytwo alex was looking across the thames at the london eye when she arrived he rose from the bench to greet her have you ever been on the eye he asked as she sat down beside him yes once said beth i took my father on it when it first opened you used to be able to see our garage from the top it wont be that long before youll be able to see wilson house said alex yes it was kind of the developer to name the building after my dad hed have enjoyed that said beth i have to be back in court by two oclock said alex but i needed to see you urgently as i have some news it was good of you to give up your lunch break i had a letter this morning from the lord chancellors office said alec and hes agreed to reopen the case beth threw her arms around him but only if we can supply some fresh evidence wouldnt the tape be considered as fresh evidence asked beth theres been mention of it in both local papers since we launched the campaign to have danny pardoned im sure theyll take it into consideration this time but if they believe the conversation was recorded under duress theyll have to discount it but how will anyone be able to prove that either way asked beth do you remember that danny and big al shared a cell with a man called nick moncrieff of course said beth they were good friends he taught danny to read and write and even attended his funeral although none of us were allowed to speak to him well some weeks before moncrieff was released he wrote to me offering to help in any way he could as he was convinced danny was innocent but there are countless people who believe danny is innocent said beth and if you felt big al would have made a bad witness why should nick be any different because danny once told me that moncrieff kept a diary while he was in prison so its possible that the tape incident has been recorded courts take diaries very seriously because theyre contemporaneous evidence then all you have to do is get in touch with moncrieff said beth unable to hide her excitement its not quite that simple said alex why not if he was so keen to help not long after his release he was arrested for breaking his parole so is he back inside asked beth no thats the strange thing the judge gave him one last chance he must have had a hell of a lawyer defending him then whats to stop you trying to get hold of his diaries asked beth its possible that after his latest brush with the law he might not welcome a letter from a lawyer hes never met asking him to become involved in yet another court case danny said you could always rely on nick come hell or high water then ill write to him today said alex danny picked up the phone payne transferred six hundred thousand pounds by wire this morning said the voice so if he pays the remaining five million four hundred thousand by the end of the week the velodrome site will be his i thought youd want to know that weve had another bid in this morning for ten million which of course we had to turn down i hope you know what youre doing the line went dead it was the first time the voice had offered an opinion on anything danny dialed the number of his bank manager at coutts he was about to convince payne that the deal couldnt fail good morning sir nicholas how can i help you good morning mr watson i want to transfer a million pounds from my current account to baker tremlett and smythes client account certainly sir there was a long pause before mr watson added you do realize that will leave your account overdrawn yes i do said danny but it will be covered on october first when you receive the monthly check from my grandfathers trust ill do the paperwork today and be back in touch said mr watson i dont care when you do the paperwork mr watson as long as the full amount is transferred before close of business this evening danny replaced the receiver damn he said not the way nick would have behaved in the circumstances he must quickly return to nick mode he swung round to see molly standing in the doorway she was shaking and seemed unable to speak whats the matter molly asked danny jumping up from his chair are you all right its him she whispered him said danny that actor what actor that dr beresford you know lawrence davenport is it indeed said danny youd better show him into the drawing room offer him some coffee and tell him ill be with him in a moment as molly ran downstairs danny made two new entries in the payne file before placing it back on the shelf he then took down the davenport file and quickly brought himself up to date he was just about to close it when his eye caught a note under the heading early life which caused him to smile he replaced the file on the shelf and went downstairs to join his uninvited guest davenport leaped up as danny entered the room and this time he did shake hands danny was momentarily taken aback by his appearance he was now cleanshaven and wearing a welltailored suit and a smart opennecked shirt was he about to return the sorry to barge in on you like this said davenport i wouldnt have done so if it wasnt a bit of an emergency please dont concern yourself said danny as he sat in the chair opposite him how can i help molly placed a tray on the side table and poured davenport a cup of coffee cream or milk mr davenport she asked neither thank you sugar mr davenport no thank you would you like a chocolate biscuit asked molly no thank you davenport said patting his stomach danny sat back and smiled he wondered if molly would be quite so awestruck if she realized that she had just served the son of a carpark attendant with the grimsby borough council well just let me know if you want anything else mr davenport said molly before backing out of the room having quite forgotten to offer danny his usual hot chocolate danny waited for the door to close sorry about that he said shes normally quite sane dont worry old chap said davenport one gets used to it not for much longer thought danny now how can i help he asked i want to invest a rather large sum of money in a business venture only temporary you understand not only will i repay you within a few weeks at the outside but he said looking up at the mctaggart above the fireplace ill also be able to reclaim my paintings at the same time danny would have been sad to lose his recent acquisitions as hed been surprised how quickly hed become attached to them im sorry how thoughtless of me he said suddenly aware that the room was full of davenport s old pictures be assured they will be returned the moment the loan is repaid that could turn out to be a lot sooner than i had originally anticipated said davenport especially if you were able to help me out with this little enterprise what sort of sum did you have in mind asked danny a million said davenport tentatively the problem is that ive only got a week to come up with the money and what would your collateral be this time asked danny my house in redcliffe square danny recalled davenport s words the last time they had met my home no never out of the question dont even think about it and you say that you will pay the full sum back within a month using your home as collateral within a month its guaranteeda racing certainty and if you fail to pay back the million in that time then just like my pictures the house is yours we have a deal said danny and as youve only got a few days to come up with the money id better get straight on to my lawyers and instruct them to draw up a contract when they left the drawing room and walked out into the hallway they found molly standing by the front door clutching davenport s overcoat thank you said davenport after she had helped him on with his coat and opened the door ill be in touch said danny not shaking hands with davenport as he stepped out onto the path molly almost curtsied danny turned around and headed back to his study molly i have some calls to make so i could be a few minutes late for lunch he said over his shoulder when he received no reply he turned back to see his housekeeper standing at the door chatting to a woman is he expecting you asked molly no he isnt replied ms bennett i came on the offchance chapter sixtythree the alarm went off at am but danny wasnt asleep he jumped out of bed and quickly put on the pants tshirt socks slacks and trainers that hed laid out on the chair by the window he didnt turn on the light he checked his watch six minutes past two he closed the bedroom door and walked slowly downstairs he opened the front door to see his car parked by the curb although he couldnt see him he knew big al would be seated behind the wheel danny looked aroundthere were one or two lights still on in the square but no one to be seen he climbed into the car but didnt speak big al switched on the ignition and drove for a hundred yards before he put on the side lights neither of them spoke as big al turned right and headed for the embankment he had done the run five times during the past week twice during the day three times at nightwhat he called night ops but the dry runs were over and tonight the full operation would be carried out big al was treating the whole thing like a military exercise and his nine years in the army were being put to good use during the day the journey averaged around fortythree minutes but at night he could cover the same distance in twentynine never once exceeding the speed limit as they progressed past the house of commons and along the north side of the thames danny concentrated on what needed to be done once they had reached the target area they drove through the city and into the east end dannys concentration was broken only for a moment when they passed a large construction site with a vast advertising hoarding displaying a magnificent mockup of what wilson house would look like once it was completed sixty luxury flats thirty affordable dwellings it promised nine already sold including the penthouse danny smiled big al continued on down mile end road before turning left at a signpost indicating stratford the home of the olympics eleven minutes later he turned off the road and onto a gravel track he switched the lights off as he knew each twist and turn almost every stone between there and the target area at the end of the track he drove past a sign that read privateland keep off he kept on going after all the land was owned by danny and would still be his for another eight days big al brought the car to a halt behind a small mound switched off the engine and pressed a button the side window purred down they sat still and listened but the only sounds were night noises during an afternoon recce theyd come across the occasional dog walker and a group of kids kicking a football around but now there was nothing not even a night owl to keep them company after a couple of minutes danny touched big als elbow they climbed out of the car and walked around to the boot big al opened the boot while danny slipped off his trainers big al lifted the box out of the back and placed it on the ground just as they had done the night before when danny had walked the course to see if he could locate the seventyone white pebbles they had put in cracks holes and crevices during the day he had managed to find fiftythree hed do better tonight another dry run that afternoon had given him a chance to check the ones hed missed in daylight he could cover the three acres in just over two hours last night had taken three hours seventeen minutes while tonight would take even longer because of the number of times he would have to drop to his knees it was a clear still night as promised by the weather forecasters who were predicting light showers in the morning like any good farmer planting his seeds danny had chosen the day even the hour carefully big al removed the black jumpsuit from the box and handed it to danny who unzipped the front and climbed in even this simple exercise had been practiced several times in the dark big al then passed him the rubber boots followed by the gloves the mask the torch and finally the small plastic container marked hazardous big al stationed himself by the back of the car as the boss set off when danny reached the corner of his land he walked another seven paces before he came across the first white pebble he picked it up and dropped it into a deep pocket he fell on his knees switched on the torch and placed a tiny fragment of stem into a crack in the ground he turned off the torch and stood up yesterday he had practised the exercise without the rhizome nine more paces and he came to the second pebble where he repeated the whole process and then only one pace before he reached the third pebble and knelt by a little crevice before carefully scattering the rhizome deep inside five more paces big al desperately wanted a smoke but he knew it was a risk he couldnt take once in bosnia a squaddie had lit up during a night op and three seconds later he got a bullet through his head big al knew the boss would be out there for at least three hours so he couldnt afford to let his concentration slip even for a moment pebble number twentythree was at the far corner of dannys land he shone his torch down a large hole before dropping in some more rhizome he placed another pebble in his pocket big al stretched and began to walk slowly around the car he knew they planned to leave long before first light which was at am he checked his watch they both looked up when a plane flew overhead the first to land at heathrow that morning danny put pebble number thirtysix in his righthand pocket taking care to distribute the weight evenly he repeated the process again and again a few paces kneel down turn on the torch drop some rhizome in the crack pick up the pebble and drop it in a pocket turn off the torch stand up walk onit felt much more tiring than it had the night before big al froze as a car drove onto the site and parked about fifty yards away he couldnt be sure if whoever was in the car had seen him he fell onto his stomach and began to crawl toward the enemy a cloud moved to reveal the moon just a sliver of lighteven the moon was on their side the cars headlights had been turned off but an inside light remained on danny thought he saw a cars lights and immediately fell flat on the ground they had arranged that big al would flash his torch three times to warn him if there was any danger danny waited for over a minute but there was no flashing beam so he stood up and headed toward the next pebble big al was now only a few yards from the parked car and although the windows were steamed up he could see that the inside light was still on he pushed himself up onto his knees and peered through the rear window it took all his discipline not to burst out laughing when he saw a woman stretched out on the back seat her legs wide apart moaning big al couldnt see the face of the man who was on top of her but felt a throbbing in his pants he fell back down on his stomach and began the long crawl back to base when danny reached pebble number sixtyseven he cursed hed covered the entire area and somehow missed four as he walked slowly back toward the car each pace became more cumbersome than the last one thing he hadnt anticipated was the sheer weight of the pebbles once big al was back at base he still kept a wary eye on the car he wondered if the boss had even been aware of its presence suddenly he heard the sound of an engine revving up and the headlights were turned full on before the car swung around back onto the gravel path and disappeared into the night when big al saw danny coming toward him he removed the empty box from the boot and put it on the ground in front of him danny began to take the pebbles out of his pockets and place them in the box a painstaking exercise when the slightest sound might attract attention once the task had been completed he took off the mask the gloves the boots and the jumpsuit he handed them to big al who put them in the box on top of the pebbles the last things to be deposited were the torch and an empty plastic container big al closed the boot and climbed into the front of the car as the boss fastened his seatbelt he turned on the ignition swung the car around and drove slowly back toward the gravel track neither of them spoke even when they reached the main road the job wasnt finished yet during the week big al had identified various skips and building sites where they could dispose of any evidence of their nocturnal enterprise big al stopped seven times during a journey that took just over an hour instead of the usual forty minutes by the time they drove into the boltons it was half past seven danny smiled when he saw a few drops of rain land on the windscreen and the automatic wipers switch themselves on danny stepped out of the car walked up the path and unlocked the front door he picked up a letter that was lying on the mat and tore it open as he climbed the staircase when he saw the signature on the bottom of the page he went straight to his study and locked the door once he had read the letter he wasnt quite sure how he should reply think like danny behave like nick chapter sixtyfour nick how lovely to see you said sarah she leaned across and whispered now tell me youve been a good boy depends what you mean by good said danny as he took the seat next to her you havent missed a meeting with your favorite lady danny thought about beth even though he knew sarah was referring to ms bennett not one he said in fact she recently visited me at home and passed my accommodation as suitable putting ticks in all the relevant boxes and you havent even thought about going abroad not unless you count traveling up to scotland to visit mr munro good so what else have you been up to thats safe to tell your other solicitor not a lot said danny hows lawrence he asked wondering if he had told her about the loan never better hes doing a screen test for holby city next thursdaya new part thats been written especially for him so whats it called witness to murder asked danny regretting his words the moment hed said them no no said sarah laughing youre thinking of the part he played in witness for the prosecution but that was years ago it certainly was said danny and it was a performance im unlikely to forget i didnt realize youd known larry that long only from a distance said danny he was relieved to be rescued by a familiar voice saying hello sarah charlie duncan bent down and kissed her on the cheek good to see you nick said duncan you two know each other of course of course said sarah duncan whispered be careful what you say youre sitting behind a critic enjoy the show he added in a loud voice danny had read the script of bling bling but hadnt been able to follow it so he was curious to see how the piece would work on stage and what he had spent ten thousand pounds on he opened the program to find that the play was billed as a hilarious look at britain during the blair era he turned the page and began reading about the playwright a dissident czech who had escaped from the lights went down and the curtain rose no one laughed for the first fifteen minutes of the performance which surprised danny as the play had been billed as a lighthearted comedy when the star finally made his entrance a few laughs followed in his wake but danny wasnt altogether sure that they were intended by the playwright by the time the curtain for the interval came down danny found himself stifling a yawn what do you think he asked sarah wondering if he had missed something sarah put a finger to her lips and pointed to the critic in front of them who was writing furiously lets go and have a drink she said sarah touched his arm as they walked slowly up the aisle nick its my turn to seek your advice on what said danny because i must warn you i know nothing about the theater she smiled no im talking about the real world gerald payne has recommended that i put some money in a property deal hes involved in he mentioned your name so i wondered if you thought it was a safe investment danny wasnt sure how to reply because however much he loathed her brother he had no quarrel with this charming woman who had prevented him being sent back to jail i never advise friends to put money in anything said danny its a nowin situationif they make a profit they forget that it was you who recommended it and if they make a loss they never stop reminding you my only advice would be not to gamble what you cant afford and never to risk an amount that might cause you to lose a nights sleep good advice said sarah im grateful danny followed her into the stalls bar as they entered the crowded room danny spotted gerald payne standing by a table pouring a glass of champagne for spencer craig he wondered if craig had been tempted to invest any money in his olympic site and hoped to find out later at the openingnight party lets avoid them said sarah spencer craig has never been my favorite man mine neither said danny as they made their way toward the bar hey sarah nick were over here shouted payne waving furiously at them come and have a glass of bubbly danny and sarah reluctantly walked across to join them you remember nick moncrieff said payne turning to craig of course said craig the man whos about to make us all a fortune lets hope so said dannyone of his questions answered well need all the help we can get after tonights performance said payne oh it could have been worse said sarah as danny passed her a glass of champagne its shit said craig so thats one of my investments down the drain you didnt put too much into it i hope said danny embarking on a fishing expedition nothing compared to what ive invested in your little enterprise said craig who couldnt take his eyes off sarah payne whispered conspiratorially to danny i transferred the full amount this morning well be exchanging contracts sometime in the next few days im delighted to hear it said danny genuinely although the swiss had already informed him of the transfer just before hed left for the theater by the way added payne because of my political connections ive managed to get a couple of tickets for parliamentary questions next thursday so if youd like to join me for the ministers statement youd be most welcome thats kind of you gerald but wouldnt you rather take lawrence or craig he still couldnt bring himself to call him spencer larrys got a screen test that afternoon and spencer has an appointment with the lord chancellor at the other end of the building we all know what thats about he said winking do we asked danny oh yes spencers about to be made a qc payne whispered congratulations said danny turning to his adversary its not official yet said craig not even glancing in his direction but it will be next thursday said payne so nick why dont you meet me outside the st stephens entrance of the house of commons at twelve thirty and we can listen to the ministers statement together before going off to celebrate our good fortune ill see you there said danny as three bells sounded he glanced across at sarah who had been trapped in the corner by craig he would like to have rescued her but was swept along by the crowd as it began a reverse stampede back into the theater sarah returned to her seat just as the curtain rose the second half turned out to be a slight improvement on the first but danny suspected not nearly enough to please the man seated in front of him when the curtain fell the critic was the first out of the stalls and danny felt like joining him although the cast managed three curtain calls danny didnt have to stand on this occasion as no one else bothered to when the lights finally came up danny turned to sarah and said if youre going to the party why dont i give you a lift im not going said sarah and i suspect not many of this lot will be either its my turn to seek your advice said danny why not the pros can always smell a flop so theyll avoid being seen at a party where people might think theyre involved in some way she paused i hope you didnt invest too much not enough to lose a nights sleep said danny i wont forget your advice she said linking her arm in his so how do you feel about taking a lonely girl out to dinner danny recalled the last time hed taken up such an offer and how that evening had ended he didnt want to have to explain to another girl and particularly not this one im sorry he said but youre married asked sarah i only wish said danny i only wish id met you before she did said sarah unlinking her arm that wouldnt have been possible said danny without explanation bring her along next time said sarah id like to meet her goodnight nick and thanks again for your advice she kissed him on the cheek and drifted off to join her brother danny only just stopped himself from warning her not to invest a penny in paynes olympic venture but he knew that with a girl that bright it might be one risk too many he joined the silent throng as they disgorged themselves from the theater as quickly as they could but he still couldnt avoid a downcast charlie duncan who had stationed himself by the exit he gave danny a weak smile well at least i wont have to spend any money on a closingnight party chapter sixtyfive danny met gerald payne outside the st stephens entrance of the palace of westminster it was his first visit to the house of commons and he was planning that it would be paynes last i have two tickets for the public gallery payne announced in a loud voice to the policeman stationed at the entrance it still took them a long time to pass through security once they had emptied their pockets and passed through the metal detector payne guided danny down a long marble corridor to the central lobby they dont have tickets payne explained as he marched past a row of visitors sitting on the green benches waiting patiently to be admitted to the public gallery they wont get in until late this evening if at all danny took in the atmosphere of the central lobby while payne reported to the policeman on the desk and presented his tickets members were chatting to visiting constituents tourists were staring up at the ornate mosaic ceiling while others for whom it had all become commonplace strode purposefully across the lobby as they went about their business payne seemed interested in only one thing making sure he secured a good seat before the minister rose to make her statement from the dispatch box danny also wanted him to have the best possible view of proceedings the policeman pointed to a corridor on his right payne marched off and danny had to hurry to catch him up payne strode down the greencarpeted corridor and up a flight of steps to the first floor as if he were already a member he and danny were met at the top of the stairs by an usher who checked their tickets before escorting them into the strangers gallery the first thing that struck danny was how small the gallery was and how few places there were for visitors which explained the number of people having to wait on the ground floor the usher found them two seats in the fourth row and handed them both an order paper danny leaned forward and looked down into the chamber surprised to see how few members were present despite it being the middle of the day it was clear that not many mps were that interested in where the olympic velodrome would be sited even though some peoples whole future rested on the ministers decision one of them was sitting next to danny mostly london members payne whispered as he turned to the relevant page on the order paper his hand was shaking as he drew dannys attention to the top of the page pm statement by the minister of sport danny tried to follow what was happening in the chamber below payne explained that it was a day allocated for questions to the minister of health but that these would end promptly at danny was delighted to see just how impatient payne was to swap his place in the gallery for a seat on the green benches below as the clock above the speakers chair edged ever nearer to payne began fidgeting with his order paper his right leg twitching danny remained calm but then he already knew what the minister was going to tell the house when the speaker rose at and bellowed statement by the minister of sport payne leaned forward to get a better view as the minister rose from the front bench and placed a red file on the dispatch box mr speaker with your permission i will make a statement concerning which site i have selected for the building of a prospective olympic velodrome members will recall that i informed the house earlier this month that i had shortlisted two locations for consideration but would not make my final decision until i had received detailed surveyors reports on both sites danny glanced around at payne a bead of sweat had appeared on his forehead danny tried to look concerned too those reports were handed into my office yesterday and copies were also sent to the olympic sites committee to the two honorable members in whose constituencies the sites are located and to the president of the british cycling federation members can obtain copies from the order office immediately following this statement having read the two reports all the parties concerned agreed that only one site could possibly be considered for this important project a flicker of a smile appeared on paynes lips the surveyors report revealed that one of the sites is unfortunately infested with a noxious and invasive plant known as japanese knotweed laughter i can sense that honorable members like myself have not come across this problem before so i will spend a moment explaining its consequences japanese knotweed is an extraordinarily aggressive and destructive plant which once it takes hold quickly spreads and renders the land on which it is growing unsuitable for any building project before making my final decision i sought advice as to whether there was a simple solution to this problem i was assured by experts in the field that japanese knotweed can in fact be eradicated by chemical treatment payne looked up a glimmer of hope in his eyes however past experience has shown that first attempts are not always successful the average time before land owned by councils in birmingham liverpool and dundee was cleared of the weed and passed fit to build on was just over a year honorable members will appreciate that it would be irresponsible for my department to risk waiting another twelve months or possibly even longer before work can commence on the infested site i am therefore left with no choice but to select the excellent alternative site for this project paynes skin turned chalk white when he heard the word alternative i have been able to announce that my department with the backing of the british olympic committee and the british cycling federation has selected the site in stratford south for the building of the new velodrome the minister resumed her place and waited for questions from the floor danny looked at payne whose head was resting in his hands an usher came running down the steps is your friend feeling all right he asked looking concerned im afraid not said danny looking unconcerned can we get him to a lavatory i have a feeling hes going to be sick danny took payne by the arm and helped him to his feet while the usher guided them both up the steps and out of the gallery he ran ahead and opened the door to allow payne to stagger into the washroom payne began to be sick long before hed reached a washbasin he pulled his tie loose and undid the top button of his shirt then began to retch again as he bowed his head and clung on to the side of the basin breathing heavily danny helped him off with his jacket he deftly removed paynes mobile from an inside pocket of his jacket and pressed a button that revealed a long list of names he scrolled through them until he reached lawrence as payne stuck his head in the washbasin for the third time danny checked his watch davenport would be preparing for his screen test one last look at the script before going off to makeup he began to tap out a text message as payne fell on his knees sobbing just as beth had done when she watched her brother die minister didnt select our site sorry thought youd want to know he smiled and touched the send button before returning to the list of contacts he scrolled on down stopping when the name spencer appeared spencer craig looked at himself in the fulllength mirror he had purchased a new shirt and silk tie especially for the occasion hed also booked a car to pick him up from chambers at am he couldnt risk being late for the lord chancellor everyone seemed to know about his appointment as he continually received smiles and murmurs of congratulationfrom the head of chambers down to the tea lady craig sat alone in his office pretending to read through a brief that had landed on his desk that morning there had been a lot of briefs lately he waited impatiently for the clock to reach eleventhirty so that he could leave for his appointment at twelve first hell offer you a glass of dry sherry a senior colleague had told him then hell chat for a few minutes about the dire state of english cricket which he blames on sledging and then suddenly without warning hell tell you in the strictest confidence that he will be making a recommendation to her majestyhe gets very pompous at this pointthat your name should be included in the next list of barristers to take silk and be appointed a qc he then rambles on for a few minutes about the onerous responsibility such an appointment places on any new appointee blah blah craig smiled it had been a good year and he intended to celebrate the appointment in style he pulled open a drawer took out his checkbook and wrote out a check for two hundred thousand pounds payable to baker tremlett and smythe it was the largest check he had ever written in his life and hed already asked his bank for a shortterm overdraft facility but then he had never known gerald to be so confident about anything before he leaned back in his chair and savored the moment as he thought about what he would spend the profits on a new porsche a few days in venice even sarah might fancy a trip on the orient express the phone on his desk rang your car has arrived mr craig tell him ill be right down he put the check in an envelope addressed it to gerald payne at baker tremlett and smythe left it on his blotting pad and strolled downstairs he would be a few minutes early but he had no intention of keeping the lord chancellor waiting he didnt speak to the driver during the short journey down the strand along whitehall and into parliament square the car stopped outside the entrance to the house of lords an officer on the gate checked his name on a clipboard and waved the car through the driver turned left under a gothic archway and came to a halt outside the lord chancellors office craig remained seated and waited for the driver to open the door for him savoring every moment he walked through the little archway to be greeted by a badge messenger carrying another clipboard his name was checked once again before the messenger accompanied him slowly up a redcarpeted staircase to the lord chancellors office the messenger tapped on the heavy oak door and a voice said come in he opened the door and stood aside to allow craig to enter a young woman was seated at a desk on the far side of the room she looked up and smiled mr craig yes he replied youre a little early but ill just check and see if the lord chancellor is free craig was about to tell her that he was happy to wait but she had already picked up the phone mr craig is here lord chancellor please send him in came back a stentorian voice the secretary rose from behind her desk crossed the room opened another heavy oak door and ushered mr craig into the lord chancellors office craig could feel the sweat on the palms of his hands as he walked into the magnificent oakpaneled room that overlooked the river thames portraits of former lord chancellors were liberally displayed on every wall and the ornate red and gold pugin wallpaper left him in no doubt that he was in the presence of the most senior law officer in the land please have a seat mr craig said the lord chancellor opening a thick red folder that lay on the center of his desk there was no suggestion of a glass of dry sherry as he browsed through some papers craig stared at the old man with his high forehead and bushy gray eyebrows which had proved many a cartoonists joy the lord chancellor slowly raised his head and stared across the large ornate desk at his visitor i thought given the circumstances mr craig i should have a word in private rather than your becoming aware of the details in the press no mention of the state of english cricket we have received an application he continued in a dry even tone for a royal pardon in the case of daniel arthur cartwright he paused to allow craig to take in the full implication of what he was about to say three law lords led by lord beloff have advised me that having reviewed all the evidence it is their unanimous recommendation that i should advise her majesty to allow a full judicial review of the case he paused again clearly not wishing to hurry his words as you were a prosecution witness in the original trial i felt i should warn you that their lordships are minded to call you to appear before them along withhe looked back down and checked his foldera mr gerald payne and mr lawrence davenport in order to question the three of you concerning your evidence at the original hearing before he could continue craig jumped in but i thought that before their lordships would even consider overturning an appeal it was necessary for new evidence to be presented for their consideration new evidence has been forthcoming the tape there is nothing in lord beloffs report that mentions a tape there is however a claim from cartwrights former cellmateonce again the lord chancellor peered down at the foldera mr albert crann who states that he was present when mr toby mortimer whom i believe was known to you stated that he had witnessed the murder of mr bernard wilson but this is nothing more than hearsay coming from the lips of a convicted criminal it wouldnt stand up in any court in the land in normal circumstances i would have to agree with that judgment mr craig and would have dismissed the application had not another fresh piece of evidence been presented to their lordships another fresh piece of evidence repeated craig suddenly feeling a knot in the pit of his stomach yes said the lord chancellor it appears that cartwright shared a cell not only with albert crann but also with another prisoner who kept a daily diary in which he meticulously recorded everything that he witnessed in prison including verbatim accounts of conversations in which he took part so the sole source of these accusations is a diary which a convicted criminal claims he wrote while he was in prison no one is accusing you of anything mr craig said the lord chancellor quietly however it is my intention to invite the witness to appear before their lordships of course you will be given every opportunity to present your side of the case who is this man demanded craig the lord chancellor turned a page of his folder and doublechecked the name before he looked up and said sir nicholas moncrieff chapter sixtysix danny sat in his usual alcove seat at the dorchester reading the times the cycling correspondent reported the minister of sports surprise choice for the velodrome site it managed a few column inches tucked in between canoeing and basketball danny had checked through the sports pages of most of the national newspapers earlier that morning and those which bothered to report the ministers statement agreed that she had been left with little choice none of them not even the independent had had enough space to inform its readers what japanese knotweed was danny checked his watch gary hall was running a few minutes late and danny could only imagine the recriminations which must be going on in the offices of baker tremlett and smythe he turned to the front page and was reading about the latest twist in the north korea nuclear threat when an outofbreath hall appeared by his side sorry to be late he gasped but the senior partner called me in just as i was about to leave the office quite a bit of flack flying around following the ministers statement everyone is blaming everyone else he took a seat opposite danny and tried to compose himself just relax and let me order you a coffee said danny as mario walked across and another hot chocolate for you sir nicholas danny nodded put down his paper and smiled at hall well at least no one can blame you gary he said oh no one thinks i was even involved said hall which is why ive been promoted promoted said danny congratulations thank you but it wouldnt have happened if gerald payne hadnt been sacked danny somehow managed to stifle a smile he was summoned to the senior partners office first thing this morning and told to clear his desk and be off the premises within an hour one or two of us found ourselves promoted in the fallout but didnt they realize that it was you and me who took the idea to payne in the first place no once it turned out that you couldnt raise the full amount it suddenly became paynes idea in fact youre regarded as someone whos lost his investment and may even have a claim against the company something danny hadnt even considereduntil then i wonder what payne will do now said danny probing hell never get another job in our business said hall or at least not if the senior partner has anything to do with it so what will the poor fellow do asked danny still fishing his secretary tells me hes gone down to sussex to stay with his mother for a few days shes chairman of the local constituency that hes still hoping to represent at the next election i cant see why that should be a problem said danny hoping to be contradicted unless of course he advised any of his constituents to invest in japanese knotweed hall laughed that mans a survivor he said my bet is that hell be a member of parliament in a couple of years time and by then no one will even remember what all the fuss was about danny frowned suddenly aware that he might have only wounded payne although he didnt expect davenport or craig to recover quite so easily i have another job for you he said opening his briefcase and extracting a bundle of papers i need you to dispose of a property in redcliffe square number twentyfive the previous owner hi nick said a voice danny looked up a tall heavily built man hed never seen before was towering over him he was wearing a kilt had a shock of brown wavy hair and a ruddy complexion and must have been around the same age as danny think like danny behave like nick be nick danny had realized that this situation was bound to arise at some time but lately he had become so relaxed in his new persona that he didnt think it was still possible for him to be taken by surprise he was wrong first he needed to find out if the man had been at school or in the army with nick because it certainly wasnt prison he stood up hello said danny giving the stranger a warm smile and shaking him by the hand can i introduce you to a business associate of mine gary hall the man bent down and shook hands with hall saying pleased to meet you gary im sandy sandy dawson he added in a strong scottish accent sandy and i go back a long way said danny hoping to find out just how long sure do said dawson but i havent seen nick since we left school we were at loretto together danny said smiling at hall so what have you been up to sandy he asked desperately searching for another clue like my father still in the meat business said dawson and ever thankful that highland beef remains the most popular meat in the kingdom what about you nick ive been taking it pretty easy since said danny attempting to discover if dawson knew that nick had been to prison yes of course said sandy terrible business most unfair but im delighted to see youve come through the whole experience unscathed a puzzled look appeared on halls face danny couldnt think of a suitable reply i hope youre still finding time to play the occasional game of cricket said dawson best fast bowler of our generation at school he said turning to hall i should knowi was the wicketkeeper and a damn good one said danny slapping him on the back sorry to interrupt you said dawson but i couldnt just walk by without saying hello quite right said danny it was good to see you sandy after all this time you too said dawson as he turned to leave danny sat back down and hoped that hall didnt hear the sigh of relief that followed dawson s departure he began taking some more papers out of his briefcase when dawson turned back i dont suppose anyone has told you nick that squiffy humphries died no im sorry to hear that said danny had a heart attack on the golf course while playing a round with the headmaster the fifteen has never been the same since squiffy retired yes poor old squiffy great coach ill leave you in peace said dawson i thought youd want to know the whole of musselburgh turned out for his funeral no more than he deserved said danny dawson nodded and walked away this time danny didnt take his eyes off the man until he saw him leave the room sorry about that he said always embarrassing to meet up with old school chums years later said hall half the time i cant even remember their names mind you it would be difficult to forget that one quite a character yes said danny quickly passing over the deeds of the house in redcliffe square hall studied the document for some time before he asked what sort of price are you expecting the property to fetch around three million said danny theres a mortgage of just over a million and ive put up another million so anything above two point two two point three should show me a profit the first thing ill have to do is arrange for a survey pity payne didnt carry out a survey on the stratford site he claims he did said hall my bet is the surveyor had never heard of japanese knotweed to be fair neither had anyone else in the office i certainly hadnt said danny well not until quite recently any problems with the present owner asked hall as he turned the last page of the deeds then he added before danny could reply is that who i think it is yes lawrence davenport the actor said danny did you know hes a friend of geralds yur on the front page of the evening standard boss said big al as he pulled out of the dorchester forecourt and joined the traffic heading toward hyde park corner what do you mean said danny fearing the worst big al passed the paper back to danny he stared at the banner headline royal pardon for cartwright he skimmed through the article before reading it more carefully a second time i dont know whit yur gonnae dae boss if they ask sir nicholas moncrieff tae appear in front of a tribunal an gie evidence in defense of danny cartwright if all goes to plan said danny looking at a photo of beth surrounded by hundreds of campaigners from bow it wont be me whos the defendant chapter sixtyseven craig had sent out for four pizzas and there would be no waitresses to serve chilled wine for this particular gathering of the musketeers since leaving the lord chancellors office he had spent every spare moment trying to find out everything he could about sir nicholas moncrieff he had been able to confirm that moncrieff had shared a cell with danny cartwright and albert crann while they were inmates at belmarsh he also discovered that moncrieff had been released from prison six weeks after cartwrights death what craig couldnt work out was why anyone would be willing to devote his entire existence as moncrieff had clearly done to tracking down and then attempting to destroy three men he had never met unless it was when he placed the two photographs of moncrieff and cartwright next to each other that he first began to consider the possibility it didnt take him too long to come up with a plan to discover if the possibility could in fact be a reality there was a knock on the front door craig opened it to be greeted by the forlorn figure of gerald payne clutching on to a cheap bottle of wine all the selfassurance of their previous meeting had evaporated is larry coming he asked not bothering to shake hands with craig im expecting him at any minute said craig as he led his old friend through to the drawing room so where have you been hiding yourself im staying in sussex with my mother until this all blows over payne replied sinking into a comfortable chair any trouble in the constituency craig asked as he poured him a glass of wine could be worse said payne the liberals are spreading rumors but fortunately they do it so often no one takes much notice when the editor of the local rag rang i told him id resigned as a partner of baker tremlett and smythe because i wanted to devote more time to my constituency work in the runup to the general election he even wrote a supportive leader the following day i have no doubt youll survive said craig frankly im far more worried about larry he not only failed to land the part in holby city but hes telling everyone that you texted him about the ministers statement just as he was about to take the screen test but that just isnt true said payne i was in such a state of shock i didnt get in touch with anyone not even you someone did said craig and i now realize if it wasnt you who sent us both a text it had to be someone who knew about larrys screen test as well as my meeting with the lord chancellor the same person who had access to my phone at that time the ubiquitous sir nicholas moncrieff the bastard ill kill him said payne without thinking what he was saying thats what we should have done when we had the chance said craig what do you mean youll find out all in good time said craig as the doorbell rang that must be larry while craig answered the door payne sat thinking about the text messages that moncrieff must have sent to larry and spencer while he was out of action in the commons washroom but he was still no nearer to understanding why when the two of them joined him payne couldnt believe the change in larry in such a short time he was wearing a pair of faded jeans and a crumpled shirt he clearly hadnt shaved since hed heard about the announcement he slumped down in the nearest chair why why why were his opening words youll find out soon enough said craig handing him a glass of wine it was obviously a wellorganized campaign said payne once craig had refilled his glass and theres no reason to believe that hes finished with us yet said craig but why repeated davenport why lend me a million pounds of his own money if he knew i was going to lose every penny of it because he had the security of your home to cover the loan said payne he couldnt lose and what do you think he did the next day said davenport he appointed your old firm to dispose of my house theyve already put a forsale sign in the front garden and started showing potential buyers around he did what said payne and this morning i received a solicitors letter telling me that if i didnt vacate the premises by the end of the month they would have no choice but to where will you live asked craig hoping davenport wouldnt ask to move in with him sarahs agreed to put me up until this mess gets sorted out youve not told her anything asked craig anxiously no not a thing said davenport although she obviously knows somethings wrong and she keeps asking me when i first met moncrieff you cant afford to tell her that said craig or well all end up in even more trouble how can we possibly be in any more trouble asked davenport we will be if moncrieff is allowed to continue waging his vendetta said craig payne and davenport made no attempt to contradict him we know that moncrieff has handed over his diaries to the lord chancellor and no doubt hell be called on to give evidence before the law lords when they consider cartwrights pardon oh god said davenport a look of sheer desperation on his face no need to panic said craig i think ive come up with a way of finishing off moncrieff once and for all davenport didnt look convinced and whats more theres a possibility that we can still all get our money back which would include your house larry as well as your paintings but how can that be possible asked davenport patience larry patience and all will be revealed i understand his tactics with larry said payne because he had nothing to lose but why put up a million of his own money when he knew it was a bum deal that was a stroke of sheer genius admitted craig no doubt youre going to enlighten us said davenport because by investing that million said craig ignoring his sarcasm you were both convinced as i was that we must be onto a winner but he was still bound to lose his million said payne if he knew that the first site was doomed not if he already owned the site in the first place said craig neither of his two guests spoke for some time as they tried to work out the significance of his words are you suggesting that we were paying him to buy his own property said payne eventually worse than that said craig because i think a piece of advice you gave him gerald meant that he couldnt lose either way so he ended up not only killing us but making a killing himself the doorbell rang whos that asked davenport nearly jumping out of his chair only our supper said craig why dont you two go through to the kitchen ill let you know over our pizzas exactly what i have planned for sir nicholas moncrieff because the time has come for us to fight back im not sure i want another confrontation with that man davenport admitted as he and payne walked through to the kitchen we may not have much choice said payne any idea whos joining us asked davenport when he saw that the table had been laid for four payne shook his head havent a clue but i think its unlikely to be moncrieff youre right although it could just be one of his old school chums said craig as he joined them in the kitchen he took the pizzas out of their boxes and placed them in the microwave are you going to explain what the hell youve been hinting at all evening asked payne not yet said craig checking his watch but youll only have to wait a few more minutes to find out at least tell me what you meant when you said that moncrieff may have made a killing because of some advice i gave him demanded payne wasnt it you who told him to buy the second site so that it would be impossible for him to lose out either way yes i did but if you remember he didnt have enough money to buy the first site or thats what he told you said craig according to the evening standard the other site is now expected to fetch twelve million but why put up a million of his own money for the first site asked davenport if he already knew he was going to make a killing on the second because he always intended to make a killing on both sites said craig except on the first one we were to be the victims while he didnt lose a penny if youd told us that it was moncrieff who was lending you the money in the first place he said to davenport we could have worked it out davenport looked sheepish but made no attempt to defend himself but what i still dont understand said payne is why he put us through all this it cant just be because he shared a cell with cartwright i agree there has to be more to it than that said davenport there is said craig and if its what i think it is moncrieff wont be bothering us for much longer payne and davenport didnt look convinced at least tell us said payne how you happened to come across one of moncrieffs old school friends ever heard of old school chums dot com so who have you been trying to get in touch with asked payne anyone who knew nicholas moncrieff when he was at school or in the army did anybody get in touch with you asked davenport as the doorbell rang again seven but only one had all the necessary qualifications said craig as he left the kitchen to answer the door davenport and payne looked at each other but didnt speak when craig reappeared moments later he was accompanied by a tall heavily built man who had to lower his head as he passed through the kitchen doorway gentlemen allow me to introduce sandy dawson said craig sandy was in the same house at loretto school as nicholas moncrieff for five years said dawson shaking hands with payne and davenport craig poured him a glass of wine before ushering him toward the vacant seat at the table but why do we need someone who knew moncrieff at school asked davenport why dont you tell them sandy said craig i contacted spencer under the impression that he was my old friend nick moncrieff who i havent seen since leaving school when sandy got in touch interrupted craig i told him my reservations about the man claiming to be moncrieff and he agreed to put him to the test it was gerald who let me know that moncrieff had an appointment with one of his colleagues gary hall at the dorchester that morning so sandy turned up there a few minutes later it wasnt difficult to find him said dawson everyone from the hall porter to the hotel manager seemed to know sir nicholas moncrieff he was sitting in an alcove exactly where the concierge said i would find him when i first spotted him i felt certain it was nick but as it was almost fifteen years since id last seen him i thought id better doublecheck but when i walked over to have a word with him he didnt show the slightest sign of recognition and its not as if im that easy to forget thats one of the reasons i selected you said craig but it still doesnt constitute proof not after all this time which is why i decided to interrupt his meeting said dawson to see whether it really was nick and asked payne very impressive same look same voice even the same mannerisms but i still wasnt convinced so decided to put out a couple of feelers when nick was at loretto he was captain of cricket and a damn good fast bowler this man knew that but when i reminded him that id been the first eleven wicketkeeper he didnt bat an eyelid that was his first mistake i never played cricket at school detested the game i was in the rugby fifteen a second row forwardwhich may not come as a surpriseso i walked away but i still wondered if he might have forgotten so i went back to tell him the sad news that squiffy humphries had died and that the whole town had turned out for his funeral great coach the man said that was his second mistake squiffy humphries was our house matron she ruled the boys with a rod of iron even i was frightened of her there was no way he could ever have forgotten squiffy i dont know who that man at the dorchester was but i can tell you one thing for certain he isnt nicholas moncrieff then who the hell is he asked payne i know exactly who he is said craig and whats more i can prove it danny had brought all three files up to date there was no doubt that he had wounded payne and even crippled davenport but hed hardly laid a glove on spencer craig other than possibly to delay his appointment as a qc and now hed blown his cover all three of them would be aware who was responsible for their downfall while danny had remained anonymous hed been able to pick off his opponents one by one and even select the ground on which he would fight but he no longer had that advantage now they were only too aware of his presence leaving him for the first time vulnerable and exposed they would want to exact revenge and he didnt need to be reminded what had happened the last time they worked as a team danny had hoped to defeat all three of them before they found out who they were up against now his only hope was to expose them in court but that would mean revealing that it was nick who had been killed in the shower at belmarsh not him and if he was to risk that his timing had to be perfect davenport had lost his home and his art collection and had been written out of holbycity even before hed completed a screen test he had moved in with his sister in cheyne walk which made danny feel guilty for the first time he wondered how sarah would react if she ever found out the truth payne was on the verge of bankruptcy but hall had said that his mother might have bailed him out and at the next election he could still expect to become the honorable member for sussex central and craig had lost nothing compared to his friends and certainly showed no signs of remorse danny wasnt in any doubt which one of the musketeers would lead the counterattack danny put the three files back on the shelf he had already planned his next move which he was confident would see all three of them end up in jail he would appear before the three law lords as mr redmayne had requested and would supply the fresh evidence needed to expose craig as a murderer payne as his accomplice and davenport as having committed perjury which had caused an innocent man to be sent to prison for a crime he did not commit chapter sixtyeight beth emerged from the darkness of knightsbridge tube station it was a bright clear afternoon and the pavements were busy with windowshoppers and locals walking off their sunday lunch alex redmayne could not have been kinder or more supportive over the past weeks and when she left him less than an hour ago she had felt full of confidence that confidence was now beginning to ebb away as she walked in the direction of the boltons she tried to recall everything alex had told her nick moncrieff was a decent man who had become a loyal friend of dannys when they were in prison together some weeks before he was released moncrieff had written to alex offering to do anything he could to assist danny who he was convinced was innocent alex had decided to put that offer to the test and after moncrieffs release he had written to him requesting to have sight of the diaries he had written while in prison along with any contemporaneous notes concerning the taped conversation that had taken place between albert crann and toby mortimer alex ended the letter by asking if he would agree to appear before the tribunal and give evidence the first surprise came when the diaries were delivered to alexs chambers the following morning the second was the courier albert crann could not have been more cooperative answering all the questions alex put to him only becoming guarded when he was asked why his boss wouldnt agree to appear before the law lordsin fact wouldnt even consider an offtherecord meeting with mr redmayne in chambers alex assumed it must have something to do with moncrieff wanting to avoid any confrontation with the police until he had completed his probation order but alex wasnt willing to give up that easily over lunch he had convinced beth that if she could get moncrieff to change his mind and agree to give evidence before the law lords it might be the deciding factor in having dannys name cleared no pressure beth had said with a smile but now she was on her own and beginning to feel that pressure more with every step she took alex had showed her a photograph of moncrieff and warned her that when she first saw him she might think just for a moment that she was looking at danny but she must concentrate and not allow herself to be distracted alex had selected the day even the hour that the meeting should take place a sunday afternoon around four oclock he felt that nick would be more relaxed at that time and possibly vulnerable to a distressed damsel appearing on his doorstep unannounced when beth left the main road and walked into the boltons her pace became even slower it was only the thought of clearing dannys name that kept her going she walked around the semicircular garden with its church in the center until she reached number before she opened the gate she rehearsed the words she and alex had agreed on my name is beth wilson and i apologize for disturbing you on a sunday afternoon but i think you shared a cell with danny cartwright who was by the time danny had read through the third essay recommended by professor mori he was beginning to feel a little more confident about facing his mentor he turned to a piece hed written over a year ago on j k galbraiths theories on a lowtax economy producing when the doorbell rang he cursed big al had gone to watch west ham play sheffield united danny had wanted to join him but they both agreed that he couldnt take the risk would it be possible for him to visit upton park next season he turned his attention back to galbraith in the hope that whoever it was would go away and then the bell rang a second time he reluctantly stood up and pushed back his chair who would it be this time a jehovahs witness or a doubleglazing salesman whichever it turned out to be he already had his first sentence prepared for whoever it had decided to interrupt his sunday afternoon he jogged downstairs and walked quickly along the corridor hoping that he could get rid of them before his concentration broke the bell rang a third time he pulled open the door my name is beth wilson and i apologize for disturbing you on a sunday danny stared at the woman he loved he had thought about this moment every day for the past two years and what he would say to her he stood there speechless beth turned white and began to shake it cant be she said it is my darling danny replied as he took her in his arms a man sitting in a car on the opposite side of the road continued to take photographs mr moncrieff who is this my name is spencer craig im a barrister and i have a proposition to put to you and what might that be mr craig if i were able to restore your fortune your rightful fortune what would that be worth to you name your price twentyfive percent that sounds a bit steep to give you back your estate in scotland to kick out the present occupant of your house in the boltons to restore the full amount paid for your grandfathers stamp collection not to mention ownership of a luxury penthouse in london which i suspect you dont even know about and to reclaim your bank accounts in geneva and london no i dont think thats particularly steep mr moncrieff in fact its quite reasonable when the alternative is a hundred percent of nothing but how could this be possible once youve signed a contract mr moncrieff your fathers fortune will be restored to you and there will be no fees or hidden charges asked hugo suspiciously no fees or hidden charges promised craig in fact ill throw in a little bonus which i suspect will even please mrs moncrieff and whats that you sign my contract and by this time next week shell be lady moncrieff chapter sixtynine did you get a photo of his leg asked craig not yet replied payne let me know the moment you do hold on said payne hes coming out of the house with his driver asked craig no with the woman who went inside yesterday afternoon describe her late twenties five foot eight slim brown hair great legs theyre both getting into the back of the car stay with them said craig and keep me briefed on where they go he put the phone down turned on his computer and pulled up a photo of beth wilson not surprised that she fitted the description however he was surprised that cartwright was willing to take such a risk did he now believe that he was invincible once payne had taken a photograph of cartwrights left leg craig would make an appointment to see detective sergeant fuller he would then stand aside and let the policeman take all the credit for capturing an escaped murderer and his accomplice big al dropped danny outside the entrance to the university after beth had given him a kiss he jumped out of the car and ran up the steps and into the building all his plans had been blown away with one kiss followed by a night with no sleep when the sun rose the following morning danny knew that he could no longer live a life that didnt include beth even if it meant leaving the country and having to live abroad craig slipped out of the court while the jury were considering their verdict he stood on the steps of the old bailey and phoned payne on his mobile where did they end up he asked cartwright was dropped off at london university hes doing a business studies degree there but moncrieff already has a degree in english true but dont forget that when cartwright was at belmarsh he took a levels in maths and business studies another small mistake that hes assumed no one would pick up said craig so where did the driver take the girl after hed dropped cartwright off they headed for the east end and twentyseven bacon road bow said craig how did you know its the home of beth wilson cartwrights girlfriendshe was with him that night in the alley dont you remember how could i forget snapped payne did you manage to get a photograph of her asked craig ignoring the little outburst several good but i still need a shot of cartwrights left leg just above the knee before i can pay a visit to detective sergeant fuller craig checked his watch id better get back to court the jury shouldnt take too long to find my client guilty where are you at the moment outside twentyseven bacon road stay well out of sight said craig that woman would recognize you at a hundred paces ill call you as soon as the court rises during his lunch break danny decided to take a walk and grab a sandwich before he attended professor moris lecture he tried to recall the six theories of adam smith in case the professors hovering finger ended up pointing at him he failed to notice the man sitting on a bench on the other side of the road a camera by his side craig dialed payne on his mobile moments after the court had risen she didnt leave the house for over an hour said payne and when she came out she was carrying a large suitcase where did she go asked craig she was driven to her office at mason street in the city and did she take the suitcase with her no she left it in the boot of the car so she intends to stay at the boltons for at least another night looks that way or do you think theyre planning to skip the country asked payne theyre unlikely to consider doing that until after his final meeting with his probation officer on thursday morning when he will have completed his license which means weve only got another three days to gather all the evidence we need said payne so whats he been up to this afternoon he left the university at four and was driven back to the boltons he went into the house but the driver left again straight away i followed him in case he was picking up the girl and was he yes he collected her from work and drove her back to the house and the suitcase he carried it inside perhaps she thinks its safe for her to move in now did he go for a run if he did said payne it must have been while i was following the girl dont bother with her tomorrow said craig from now on concentrate on cartwright because if were going to flush him out only one thing matters the photograph said payne but what if he doesnt go for a run in the morning all the more reason to ignore the girl and stick with him said craig meanwhile ill bring larry up to date is he doing anything to earn his keep not a lot said craig but we cant afford to antagonize him while hes still living with his sister craig was shaving when the phone rang he cursed they left the house together again so he didnt go for a run this morning not unless it was before five am ill call again if theres any change in his routine craig flicked the phone closed and continued to shave he cut himself he cursed again he needed to be in court by ten oclock when the judge would pass sentence on his aggravated burglary case his client would probably end up with a twoyear sentence despite the fact that he had asked for twentythree other offenses to be taken into consideration craig dabbed on some aftershave as he thought about the charges cartwright would end up facing escaping from belmarsh while impersonating another prisoner theft of a stamp collection worth over fifty million dollars falsifying checks on two bank accounts with at least twentythree other offenses to be taken into consideration once the judge had considered that lot cartwright wouldnt be seeing the light of day until he was eligible for his oldage pension craig suspected that the girl would also end up facing a long spell behind bars for aiding and abetting a criminal and once they found out exactly what cartwright had been up to since escaping from prison no one would be talking about offering him a pardon craig was even beginning to feel confident that the lord chancellor would be calling him back again and this time he would be offered a dry sherry while the two of them discussed the decline of english cricket wur bein followed said big al what makes you think that asked danny i spotted a car following us yisterday now its there again take a left at the next junction and see if he stays with us big al nodded and without indicating suddenly swung left is he still following us asked danny naw he drove straight on said big al checking his rearview mirror what type of car was it a dark blue ford mondeo how many of those do you imagine there are in london asked danny big al grunted he wis following us he repeated as he turned into the boltons im going for a run said danny ill let you know if i see anyone following me big al didnt laugh cartwrights chauffeur spotted me said payne so i had no choice but to drive on and keep out of sight for the rest of the day im on my way to the hire company to exchange the car for a different model ill be back on duty first thing tomorrow morning but im going to have to be more careful in future because cartwrights driver is good my bet is that hes expolice or army which means ill need to change my car every day what did you just say asked craig im going to have to change no before that cartwrights driver must be police or army trained of course he is said craig dont forget that moncrieffs driver was locked up in the same cell as him and cartwright youre right said payne crann albert crann better known as big al ive got a feeling that detective sergeant fuller is going to end up with a royal flushking queen and now jerk do you want me to go back this evening and doublecheck asked payne no crann may well turn out to be a bonus but we cant risk him working out that were onto them keep well out of their way until tomorrow afternoon because you can be sure that crann will now be on the lookout for you once he drops cartwright off at the house and leaves to pick up the girlfriend thats when i think youll find cartwrightll go for his run as danny walked down the corridor he was greeted by professor mori who was talking to students who were sitting their exams a year today nick he said and it will be your turn to take your finals danny had quite forgotten about how little time he had left before his exams and didnt bother to tell the professor that he had no idea where he would be a year today when ill be expecting great things of you added the professor lets hope i live up to your expectations nothing wrong with my expectations said mori although youre typical of someone who gets himself educated outside of the mainstream and then imagines he has a lot of catching up to do i think youll find nick that when the time comes to take your exams youll have not only caught up but overtaken most of your contemporaries im flattered professor said danny i dont do flattey said the professor as he turned his attention to another student danny marched out onto the street to find big al holding open the back door of his car anyone been following us today naw boss said big al climbing behind the wheel danny didnt let big al know that he thought it was quite possible that someone was following them he wondered how much time he had left before craig stumbled across the truth if he hadnt done so already danny only needed a couple more days before his probation would be completed and then the whole world would know the truth when they drew up outside the boltons danny jumped out and ran into the house do you want some tea molly asked as he bounded up the stairs no thanks im going for a run danny threw off his clothes and put on his running kit he had decided to go on an extended run as he needed time to think about his meeting with alex redmayne the following morning as he ran out of the front door he saw big al making his way down to the kitchen no doubt to grab a cup of tea with molly before he left to pick up beth danny jogged off down the road in the direction of the embankment a flood of adrenaline being released after sitting on his backside and listening to lectures for most of the day as he ran past cheyne walk he avoided looking up at sarahs apartment where he knew her brother was now living if he had done so he might have spotted another man he would have recognized standing by an open window taking a photograph of him danny continued toward parliament square and when he passed the st stephens entrance to the house of commons he thought about payne and wondered where he was now he was standing on the opposite side of the road focusing his camera trying to look like a tourist taking a picture of big ben did you get a halfdecent photograph asked craig enough to fill a gallery replied payne well done bring them over to my place now and we can have a look at them over dinner pizza again said payne not for much longer once hugo moncrieff pays up well not only finish off cartwright but make a handsome profit at the same time which im fairly confident wasnt part of his longterm plan im not quite sure what davenport has done to deserve his million i agree but hes still a bit flaky and we dont need him opening his mouth at the wrong time especially now hes living with sarah see you soon gerald craig put the phone down poured himself a drink and thought about what he was going to say before he called the man hed been looking forward to having a word with all week could i speak to detective sergeant fuller he said when the phone was answered inspector fuller said a voice who shall i say is calling spencer craig im a barrister ill put you through sir mr craig its been a long time since ive heard from you im unlikely to forget the last occasion you called nor me said craig and thats the reason im phoning this time inspectormany congratulations thank you said fuller but i find it hard to believe thats the only reason you called youre right said craig laughing but i do have a piece of information that might make your promotion to chief inspector even quicker you have my full attention said fuller but i have to make it clear inspector that you didnt get the information from me im sure youll understand why once you discover whos involved and id rather not talk about it over the phone of course said fuller so where and when would you like to meet the sherlock holmes twelvefifteen tomorrow how appropriate said fuller ill see you there mr craig craig put the phone down and thought hed make one more call before gerald turned up but just as he picked up the phone the doorbell rang when he opened the door he found payne standing under the porch grinning he hadnt seen him looking so pleased with himself for some time payne walked straight past craig without uttering a word marched into the kitchen and spread six photographs out on the table craig looked down at the images and immediately understood why payne was so smug just above the knee on dannys left leg was a scar from a wound that craig remembered inflicting and although the scar had faded it was still clear to the naked eye thats all the evidence fuller will need said craig as he picked up the kitchen phone and dialed a number in scotland hugo moncrieff said a voice soon to be sir hugo said craig chapter seventy as you know nicholas this will be our last meeting yes ms bennett we have not always seen eye to eye but i do feel that we have both come through the experience unscathed i agree ms bennett when you walk out of this building for the last time you will be a free man having completed your license yes ms bennett but before i can sign you off officially i have to ask you a few questions of course ms bennett she picked up a chewed biro and looked down at the long list of questions that the home office requires to be answered before a prisoner can finally be discharged are you currently taking any drugs no ms bennett have you recently been tempted to commit a crime not recently ms bennett during the past year have you mixed with any known criminals not known criminals said danny ms bennett looked up but ive stopped mixing with them and have no desire to meet up with them again unless its in court im relieved to hear that said ms bennett as she ticked the relevant box do you still have somewhere to live yes but i anticipate moving quite soon the pen hovered to a place ive been to before which is officially sanctioned the biro ticked another box are you presently living with your family yes i am ms bennett looked up again the last time i asked you that question nicholas you told me that you were living alone weve recently been reconciled im delighted to hear that nicholas she said a third of the boxes ticked do you have any dependents yes one daughter christy so are you presently living with your wife and daughter beth and i are engaged and as soon as ive sorted out one or two problems i still have to deal with we plan to be married im delighted to hear that said ms bennett might the probation service be able to assist you with these problems its kind of you to ask ms bennett but i dont think so however i do have an appointment with my counsel tomorrow morning and im rather hoping that he will be able to help me move things along i see said ms bennett returning to her questions does your partner have a fulltime job yes she does said danny she is the pa to the chairman of a city insurance company so once you find a job youll be a twoincome family yes but for the foreseeable future my salary will be considerably less than hers why what job are you hoping to take up im expecting to be offered a position as the librarian in a large institution said danny i cant think of anything more worthwhile said ms bennett ticking another box and moving on to the next question are you thinking of traveling abroad in the near future i have no plans to do so said danny and finally said ms bennett are you worried that at some time in the future you might commit another crime ive made a decision that will render that option impossible for the foreseeable future he assured her im delighted to hear that said ms bennett as she ticked the final box that completes my questions thank you nicholas thank you ms bennett i do hope said ms bennett as she rose from behind her desk that your lawyer will be able to get to grips with these problems that are troubling you thats kind of you ms bennett said danny as they shook hands lets hope so and should you ever feel in need of any help or assistance dont forget that i am only a phone call away i think its quite possible that someone will be in touch with you in the near future said danny i look forward to hearing from them said ms bennett and i hope everything works out well for you and beth thank you said danny goodbye nicholas goodbye ms bennett nicholas moncrieff opened the door and walked out onto the street a free man tomorrow he would be danny cartwright are you awake yes said beth are you still hoping ill change my mind yes but i know its pointless to try and persuade you danny youve always been as stubborn as a mule i only hope you realize that if it turns out to be the wrong decision this could be our last night together but if im right said danny well have ten thousand nights like this but we could have a lifetime of nights like this without you having to take such a risk ive been taking that risk every day since i left prison you have no idea beth what its like to be continually looking over your shoulder waiting for someone to say the games up danny boy youre going back to jail for the rest of your life at least this way someone might be willing to listen to my side of the story but what convinced you that this was the only way to prove your innocence you did said danny when i saw you standing in the doorwayim sorry to disturb you sir nicholashe mimickedi realized that i no longer wanted to be sir nicholas moncrieff im danny cartwright and im in love with beth bacon of wilson road beth laughed i cant remember when you last called me that when you were a grotty little elevenyearold in pigtails beth fell back on the pillow and didnt speak for some time danny wondered if shed fallen asleep until she gripped his hand and said but its just as likely that youll end up spending the rest of your life in jail ive had more than enough time to think about that said danny and im convinced that if i walk into a police station with alex redmayne and give myself upalong with this house all my assets and most important of all you dont you think it might cross somebodys mind that i could be innocent most people wouldnt be willing to take that risk said beth theyd be quite happy to spend the rest of their lives as sir nicholas moncrieff with everything that goes with it but thats the point beth im not sir nicholas moncrieff im danny cartwright and im not beth moncrieff but id rather be that than spending the next twenty years visiting you in belmarsh on the first sunday of every month but not a day would go by when you werent looking over your shoulder misunderstanding the slightest innuendo and having to avoid anyone who just might have known danny or even nick and who could you share your secret with your mother my mother your friends the answer is nobody and what do we tell christy when shes old enough to understand should we expect her to go on living a life of deceit never knowing who her parents really are no if thats the alternative id prefer to take the risk after all if three law lords believe my case is strong enough to consider a royal pardon perhaps theyll feel that i have an even stronger case if im willing to give up so much to prove my innocence i know youre right danny but the last few days have been the happiest of my life mine too beth but theyll be happier still when im a free man i have enough faith in human nature to believe that alex redmayne fraser munro and even sarah davenport will not rest until they see that justice is done you rather fancy sarah davenport dont you said beth running her fingers through his hair danny smiled at her i must admit that sir nicholas moncrieff did but danny cartwright never why dont we spend one more day together she said and make it something well never forget and as it could be your last day of freedom ill let you do anything you desire lets stay in bed said danny and make love all day men sighed beth with a smile we could take christy to the zoo in the morning and then have lunch at ramseys fish and chip shop then what asked beth ill go to upton park and watch the hammers while you take christy back to your mothers and in the evening you can choose whichever film you like as long as its the new james bond and after that same as every night this week he said taking her in his arms in which case i think wed better stick to plan a said beth and make sure youre on time for the appointment with alex redmayne tomorrow morning i cant wait to see his face said danny he thinks he has an appointment with sir nicholas moncrieff to discuss the diaries and the possibility that he might get him to change his mind and agree to appear as a witness while in fact hell come face to face with danny cartwright who wants to give himself up alex will be delighted said beth he never stops saying if only i had a second chance well hes about to be given one and i can tell you beth i cant wait for that meeting because it will make me free for the first time in years danny leaned across and kissed her gently on the lips as she slipped out of her nightdress he placed a hand on her thigh this is something else youre going to have to go without for the next few months whispered beth as a noise like a clap of thunder reverberated from the floor below what the hell was that said danny switching on the bedside light he heard the sound of heavy footsteps pounding up the stairs he swung his legs out of bed as three police officers dressed in flak jackets and carrying batons burst into the bedroom with three more following close behind the first three grabbed danny and threw him to the floor although he hadnt made any attempt to resist two of them pressed his face into the carpet while the third held his arms behind his back and snapped a pair of handcuffs on him out of the corner of his eye he could just see a policewoman pinning a naked beth against the wall while another handcuffed her shes done nothing he shouted as he broke away and began to charge toward them but before hed taken a second step the full force of a baton landed on the back of his skull and he collapsed to the floor two men leaped on top of him one pressing a knee into the middle of his spine while the other sat on his legs when inspector fuller walked into the room they yanked danny to his feet caution them fuller said as he sat on the end of the bed and lit a cigarette once the ritual had been completed he stood up and strolled across to danny this time cartwright he said their faces only inches apart im going to make sure they throw away the key and as for your girlfriend no more sunday afternoon visits because shes going to be safely locked away in a prison of her own on what charge spat out danny aiding and abetting should fit the bill the usual tariff is about six years if i remember correctly take them away danny and beth were dragged downstairs like sacks of potatoes and out through the front door where three police cars lights flashing back doors open awaited them bedroom lights all around the square were flicking on as neighbors whose sleep had been interrupted peered out of their windows to see what was going on at number danny was thrown into the back of the middle car to be sandwiched between two officers just a towel covering him he could see big al suffering the same treatment in the car in front of him the cars drove out of the square in convoy never breaking the speed limit no sirens blaring inspector fuller was pleased that the whole operation had taken less than ten minutes his informer had proved reliable right down to the last detail only one thought went through dannys mind who would believe him when he told them that hed had an appointment with his barrister later that morning when he had intended to give himself up before reporting to the nearest police station chapter seventyone you havent arrived a moment too soon she said that bad said alex worse replied his mother when will the home office realize that when judges retire not only are they sent home for the rest of their lives but the only people they have left to judge are their innocent wives so what are you recommending asked alex as they walked into the drawing room that judges should be shot on their seventieth birthday and their wives granted a royal pardon and given their pensions by a grateful nation i may have come up with a more acceptable solution suggested alex like what making it legal to assist judges wives to commit suicide something a little less drastic said alex i dont know if his lordship has told you but i sent him the details of a case im currently working on and frankly i could do with his advice if he turns you down alex i wont feed him again then i must be in with a chance said alex as his father strolled into the room a chance of what the old man asked a chance of some help on a case that the cartwright case said his father staring out of the window alex nodded yes ive just finished reading the transcripts as far as i can see there arent many more laws left for the lad to break murder escaping from prison theft of fifty million dollars cashing checks on two bank accounts that didnt belong to him selling a stamp collection he didnt own traveling abroad on someone elses passport and even claiming a baronetcy that should rightfully have been inherited by someone else you really cant blame the police for throwing the book at him does that mean youre not willing to help me asked alex i didnt say that said mr justice redmayne turning around to face his son on the contrary im at your service because of one thing im absolutely certain danny cartwright is innocent book five redemption chapter seventytwo danny cartwright sat on the small wooden chair in the dock and waited for the clock to strike ten so the trial could begin he looked down into the well of the court to see his two counsel deep in conversation as they waited for the judge to appear danny had spent an hour with alex redmayne and his junior in an interview room below the court earlier that morning they had done their best to reassure him but he knew all too well that although he was innocent of murdering bernie he had no defense to the charges of fraud theft deception and escaping from prison a combined tariff of eight to ten years seemed to be the general consensus from the barrackroom lawyers of belmarsh to the eminent silks plying their trade at the old bailey no one needed to tell danny that if the sentence was added to his original tariff the next time he came out of belmarsh would be for his own funeral the press benches to dannys left were packed with reporters notepads open pens poised as they waited to add to the thousands of column inches they had already written over the past six months the life story of danny cartwright the only man ever to escape from britains topsecurity prison who had stolen more than fifty million dollars from a swiss bank after selling a stamp collection that didnt belong to him and had ended up being arrested in the boltons in the early hours of the morning while in the arms of his fiancée the times sexy childhood sweetheart the sun the press couldnt make up their minds if danny was the scarlet pimpernel or jack the ripper the story had fascinated the public for months and the first day of the trial was taking on the status of an opening night in the west end with queues beginning to form outside the old bailey at four oclock that morning for a theater that seated less than a hundred and was rarely full most people agreed that danny cartwright was more likely to spend the rest of his days in belmarsh than the boltons alex redmayne and his junior the rt hon sir matthew redmayne kcmg qc could not have done more to help danny during the past six months while he had been reincarcerated in a cell little bigger than mollys broom cupboard they had both refused to charge a penny for their services although sir matthew had warned danny that if they were able to convince the jury that the profits hed accrued during the past two years belonged to him and not to hugo moncrieff he would be presenting a hefty bill plus expenses for what he called refreshers it was one of the few occasions during that time when all three of them had burst out laughing beth had been released on bail the morning after she had been arrested but no one had been surprised when neither danny nor big al were granted the same latitude mr jenkins was waiting in reception at belmarsh to greet them and mr pascoe made sure that they ended up sharing a cell within a month danny was back in his post as the prison librarian just as he had told ms bennett he would be big al was allocated a job in the kitchen and although the cooking didnt compare to mollys at least they both ended up with the best of the worst alex redmayne never once reminded danny that if he had taken his advice and pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the original trial he would now be a free man managing wilson s garage married to beth and helping to raise their family but a free man in what sense alex could hear him asking there had also been moments of triumph to sit alongside disaster the gods prefer it that way alex redmayne had been able to convince the court that although beth was technically guilty of the offense she had been charged with she had only been aware that danny was still alive for four days and they had already made an appointment to see alex in his chambers on the morning she had been arrested the judge had given beth a sixmonth suspended sentence since then she had visited danny at belmarsh on the first sunday of every month the judge had not taken quite as lenient a view when it came to the role big al had played in the conspiracy alex had pointed out in his opening speech that his client albert crann had made no financial gain from the moncrieff fortune other than to receive a salary as dannys driver while being allowed to sleep in a small room on the top floor of his house in the boltons mr arnold pearson qc representing the crown then produced a bombshell that alex hadnt seen coming can mr crann explain how the sum of ten thousand pounds was deposited in his private account only days after hed been discharged from prison big al had no explanation and even if he had he wasnt about to tell pearson where the money had come from the jury were not impressed the judge sent big al back to belmarsh to serve another five yearsthe rest of his original sentence danny made sure he quickly became enhanced and that he behaved impeccably during his period of incarceration glowing reports from senior officer ray pascoe confirmed by the governor meant that big al would be released on a tag in less than a year danny would miss him though he knew that if he even hinted as much big al would cause just enough trouble to ensure that he remained at belmarsh until danny was finally released beth had one good piece of news to tell danny on her sunday afternoon visit im pregnant christ we only had four nights together said danny as he took her in his arms i dont think that was the number of times we made love said beth before adding lets hope it will be a brother for christy if it is we can call him bernie no said beth were going to call him the klaxon signaled the end of visits and drowned out her words can i ask you a question said danny when pascoe escorted him back to his cell of course pascoe replied doesnt mean ill answer it you always knew didnt you pascoe smiled but didnt reply what made you so sure that i wasnt nick asked danny as they reached his cell pascoe turned the key in the lock and heaved open the heavy door danny walked in assuming he wasnt going to answer his question but then pascoe nodded at the photograph of beth that danny had sellotaped back on to the wall oh my god said danny shaking his head i never took her photo off the wall pascoe smiled stepped back into the corridor and slammed the cell door shut danny looked up at the public gallery to see beth now six months pregnant looking down at him with that same smile he remembered so well from their playground days at clement attlee comprehensive and which he knew would still be there until the end of his days however long the judge decreed his sentence should run dannys and beths mothers sat on either side of her a constant support also seated in the gallery were many of dannys friends and supporters from the east end who would go to their graves proclaiming his innocence dannys eyes settled on professor amirkhan mori a foulweather friend before moving on to someone seated at the end of the row whom he hadnt expected to see again sarah davenport leaned over the balcony and smiled down at him in the well of the court alex and his father were still deep in conversation the times had devoted a whole page to the father and son who would be appearing together as defense counsel in the case it was only the second time in history that a highcourt judge had returned to the role of barrister and it was certainly the first occasion in anyones memory that a son would lead his father danny and alex had renewed their friendship during the past six months and he knew they would remain close for the rest of their lives alexs father came from the same growth as professor moria rare vintage both men were passionate professor mori in the pursuit of learning sir matthew in the pursuit of justice the old judges presence in the courtroom had made even practiced lawyers and cynical journalists think more carefully about the case but they remained puzzled as to what had convinced him that danny cartwright could possibly be innocent mr arnold pearson qc and his junior were seated at the other end of the bench checking over the opening for the crown line by line and making the occasional small emendation danny was well prepared for the outburst of venom and bile that he was sure would come when pearson rose from his place and told the court that not only was the defendant an evil and dangerous criminal but that there was only one place the jury should consider dispatching him for the rest of his life alex redmayne had told danny that he only expected three witnesses to give evidence chief inspector fuller sir hugo moncrieff and fraser munro but alex and his father already had plans to ensure that a fourth witness would also be called alex had warned danny that whichever judge was appointed to try the case would do everything in his power to prevent that happening it came as no surprise to sir matthew that mr justice hackett had called both counsel to his chambers before proceedings began to warn them to steer clear of any reference to the original murder trial the verdict of which had been reached by a jury and later upheld by three judges at the court of appeal he went on to stress that should either party attempt to place on record the contents of a particular tape as evidence or mention the names of spencer craig now an eminent qc gerald payne who had been elected to parliament or the wellknown actor lawrence davenport they could expect to face his wrath it was common knowledge in legal circles that mr justice hackett and sir matthew redmayne had not been on speaking terms for the past thirty years sir matthew had won too many cases in the lower courts when they were both fledgling barristers for anyone to be left in much doubt which of them was the superior advocate the press were hoping that their rivalry would be rekindled once the trial was under way the jury had been selected the previous day and were now waiting to be called into court so that they could hear the evidence before passing a final verdict in the case of the crown versus daniel arthur cartwright chapter seventythree mr justice hackett peered around the courtroom much as an opening batsman does when checking to see where the fielders have been placed to catch him out his eyes rested on sir matthew redmayne who was at second slip waiting for the opening ball none of the other players caused the judge the slightest apprehension but he knew that he wouldnt be able to relax if sir matthew was put on to bowl he turned his attention to the opening bowler for the home team mr arnold pearson qc not known for taking early wickets mr pearson are you ready to make your opening i am mlord replied pearson rising slowly from his place he tugged on the lapels of his gown and touched the top of his ancient wig then placed his file on a little raised stand and began to read the first page as if he had never seen it before members of the jury he began beaming across at the twelve citizens who had been selected to pass judgment on this occasion my name is arnold pearson and i shall be leading for the crown in this case i will be assisted by my junior mr david simms the defense will be led by mr alex redmayne assisted by his junior sir matthew redmayne all eyes in the courtroom turned to look at the old man who was slouched on the corner of the bench seemingly fast asleep members of the jury pearson continued the defendant is charged with five counts the first is that he did wilfully escape from belmarsh prison a highsecurity establishment in southeast london while in custody for a previous offense the second count is that the defendant did steal from sir hugo moncrieff an estate in scotland comprising a fourteenbedroom mansion and twelve thousand acres of arable land the third count is that he occupied a house namely number twelve the boltons london sw which was not lawfully his the fourth count relates to the theft of a unique stamp collection and the subsequent sale of that collection for the sum of over twentyfive million pounds and the fifth count is that the defendant cashed checks on a bank account at coutts in the strand london and transferred money from a private bank in switzerland neither of which he was entitled to do and that he profited by so doing the crown will show that all five of these counts are interlinked and were committed by one person the defendant daniel cartwright who falsely passed himself off as sir nicholas moncrieff the rightful and legal beneficiary of the late sir alexander moncrieffs will in order to prove this members of the jury i will first have to take you back to belmarsh prison to show how the defendant was able to place himself in a position to commit these audacious crimes to do that it may be necessary for me to mention in passing the original offense of which cartwright was convicted you will do no such thing interjected mr justice hackett sternly the original crime committed by the defendant has no bearing on the offenses that are being tried in this court you may not refer to that earlier case unless you can show a direct and relevant connection between it and this case sir matthew wrote down the words direct and relevant connection do i make myself clear mr pearson you most certainly do my lord and i apologize it was remiss of me sir matthew frowned alex would have to develop an ingenious argument to show that the two crimes were linked if he didnt want to arouse the wrath of mr justice hackett and be stopped in full flow sir matthew had already given the matter some considerable thought i will tread more carefully in future pearson added as he turned the next page of his file alex wondered if pearson had offered up this hostage at an early stage in the hope that hackett would come down on him from a great height as he knew only too well that the judges ruling was far more helpful to the prosecution than to the defense members of the jury continued pearson i want you to keep in mind all five offenses as i am about to demonstrate how they are interwoven and therefore could only have been committed by one person the defendant daniel cartwright pearson tugged on his gown once again before proceeding june seventh is a day that may well be etched on your memories as it was the occasion on which england beat argentina in the world cup he was pleased to see how many members of the jury smiled in recollection on that day a tragedy took place at belmarsh prison which is the reason we are all here today while the vast majority of the inmates were on the ground floor watching the football match on television one prisoner chose that moment to take his own life that man was nicholas moncrieff who at approximately onefifteen that afternoon hanged himself in the prison showers during the previous two years nicholas moncrieff had shared a cell with two other inmates one of whom was the defendant daniel cartwright the two men were roughly the same height and were only a few months apart in age in fact they were so similar in appearance that in prison uniform they were often mistaken for brothers my lord with your permission i will at this juncture distribute among the members of the jury photographs of moncrieff and cartwright so that they may see for themselves the similarities between the two men the judge nodded and the clerk of the court collected a bundle of photographs from pearsons junior he handed two up to the judge before distributing the remainder among the jury pearson leaned back and waited until he was satisfied that every member of the jury had been given time to consider the photographs once they had done so he said i shall now describe how cartwright took advantage of this likeness cutting his hair and changing his accent to cash in on the tragic death of nicholas moncrieff and cash in on it is literally what he did however as in all audacious crimes a little luck was required the first piece of luck was that moncrieff asked cartwright to take care of a silver chain and key a signet ring bearing his family crest and a watch inscribed with his initials that he wore at all times except when he took a shower the second piece of luck was that moncrieff had an accomplice who was in the right place at the right time now members of the jury you may well ask how it could be possible for cartwright who was serving a twentytwoyear sentence for alex was on his feet and about to protest when the judge said dont go any further down that road mr pearson unless you wish to try my patience i do apologize my lord said pearson well aware that any member of the jury who hadnt followed the extensive press coverage of the case over the past six months would now be in little doubt what crime cartwright had originally been sentenced for as i was saying you may wonder how cartwright who was serving a twentytwoyear sentence was able to change identity with another prisoner who had only been sentenced to eight years and who more importantly was due to be released in six weeks time surely their dna wouldnt match up their blood groups were likely to be different their dental records dissimilar thats when the second piece of luck fell into place said pearson because none of this would have been possible if cartwright hadnt had an accomplice who worked as an orderly in the prison hospital that accomplice was albert crann the third man who shared a cell with moncrieff and cartwright when he heard about the hanging in the shower he switched the names on the files in the hospitals medical records so that when the doctor checked the body he would remain under the illusion that it was cartwright who had committed suicide and not moncrieff a few days later the funeral took place at st marys church in bow where even the defendants closest family including the mother of his child were convinced that the body being lowered into the grave was that of daniel cartwright what kind of man you might ask would be willing to deceive his own family ill tell you what kind of man this man he said pointing at danny he even had the nerve to turn up to the funeral posing as nicholas moncrieff so that he could witness his own burial and be certain hed got away with it once again pearson leaned back so that the significance of his words could sink into the jurys minds from the day of moncrieffs death he continued cartwright always wore moncrieffs watch his signet ring and the silver chain and key in order to deceive the prison staff and his fellow inmates into believing that he was in fact nicholas moncrieff who only had six weeks of his sentence left to serve on july seventeenth daniel cartwright walked out of the front gate of belmarsh prison a free man despite having another twenty years of his sentence left to serve was it enough for him to have escaped it was not he immediately took the first train to scotland so that he could lay claim to the moncrieff family estate and then returned to london to take up residence in sir nicholas moncrieffs town house in the boltons but it didnt even end there members of the jury cartwright then had the audacity to start drawing cash from sir nicholas moncrieffs bank account at coutts in the strand you might have felt that was enough but no he then flew to geneva for an appointment with the chairman of coubertin and company a leading swiss bank to whom he presented the silver key along with moncrieffs passport that gave him access to a vault which contained the fabled stamp collection of nicholas moncrieffs late grandfather sir alexander moncrieff what did cartwright do when he got his hands on this family heirloom that had taken sir alexander moncrieff over seventy years to assemble he sold it the following day to the first bidder who arrived on the scene netting himself a cool twentyfive million pounds sir matthew raised an eyebrow how unlike arnold pearson to do cool so now that cartwright is a multimillionaire continued pearson you may well ask yourselves what he could possibly do next i will tell you he flew back to london bought himself a topoftherange bmw employed a chauffeur and a housekeeper settled down in the boltons and carried on the myth that he was sir nicholas moncrieff and members of the jury he would still be living that myth today if it were not for the sheer professionalism of chief inspector fuller the man who arrested cartwright for his original offense in and who now singlehandedsir matthew wrote down those wordstracked him down arrested him and finally brought him to justice that members of the jury is the case for the prosecution but later i will produce a witness who will leave you in no doubt that the defendant daniel cartwright is guilty of all five charges on the indictment as pearson resumed his seat sir matthew looked across at his old adversary and touched his forehead as if he was raising an invisible hat chapeau he said thank you matthew pearson replied gentlemen said the judge looking at his watch i think this might be a suitable moment to break for lunch court will rise shouted the usher and all the officials immediately stood up and bowed low mr justice hackett returned their bow and left the courtroom not bad admitted alex to his father i agree though dear old arnold did make one mistake which he may live to regret and what was that asked alex sir matthew passed his son the piece of paper on which he had written the word singlehanded chapter seventyfour theres only one thing you have to get this witness to admit said sir matthew but at the same time we dont need the judge or arnold pearson to realize what youre up to no pressure said alex with a grin as mr justice hackett reentered the courtroom and everyone rose the judge bowed low before resuming his place in the highbacked red leather chair he opened his notebook to the end of his analysis of pearsons opening turned to a fresh page and wrote the words first witness he then nodded in the direction of mr pearson who rose from his place and said i call chief inspector fuller alex hadnt seen fuller since the first trial four years ago and he was unlikely to forget that occasion as the chief inspector had run circles around him if anything he looked even more confident than he had done then fuller took the oath without even glancing at the card detective chief inspector fuller said pearson would you please begin by confirming your identity to the court my name is rodney fuller im a serving officer with the metropolitan police stationed at palace green chelsea can i also place on the record that you were the arresting officer when daniel cartwright committed his previous offense for which he received a prison sentence that is correct sir how did you come to learn that cartwright might possibly have escaped from belmarsh prison and was passing himself off as sir nicholas moncrieff on october twentythird last year i received a telephone call from a reliable source who told me that he needed to see me on an urgent matter did he go into any detail at that time no sir hes not the sort of gentleman who would commit himself over the telephone sir matthew wrote down the word gentleman not a word a policeman would normally use when referring to a snitch his second catch in the slips on the opening morning he wasnt expecting many of those while arnold pearson was on his feet bowling the chief inspector gentle offbreaks so a meeting was arranged said pearson yes we agreed to meet the following day at a time and place of his choosing and when you met the next day he informed you that he had some information concerning daniel cartwright yes which came as a bit of a surprise said fuller because i was under the misapprehension that cartwright had hanged himself indeed one of my officers attended his funeral so how did you respond to this revelation i took it seriously because the gentleman had proved reliable in the past sir matthew underlined the word gentleman so what did you do next i placed a twentyfourhour surveillance team on number twelve the boltons and quickly discovered that the resident who was claiming to be sir nicholas moncrieff did bear a striking resemblance to cartwright but surely that would not have been enough for you to move in and arrest him certainly not replied the chief inspector i needed more tangible proof than that and what form did this tangible proof take on the third day of surveillance the suspect received a visit from a miss elizabeth wilson and she stayed the night miss elizabeth wilson yes she is the mother of cartwrights daughter and she visited him regularly while he was in prison this made me confident that the information i had been given was accurate and that was when you decided to arrest him yes but as i knew we were dealing with a dangerous criminal who had a record of violence i requested backup from the riot squad i was unwilling to take any risks when it came to the safety of the public quite understandable purred pearson would you describe to the court how you went about apprehending this violent criminal at two oclock the following morning we surrounded the house in the boltons and carried out a raid on apprehending cartwright i cautioned and arrested him for unlawfully escaping from one of her majestys prisons i also charged elizabeth wilson with aiding and abetting a criminal another section of my team arrested albert crann who was also living on the premises as we had reason to believe he was an accomplice of cartwrights and what has happened to the other two prisoners who were arrested at that time asked pearson elizabeth wilson was released on bail that morning and was later given a sixmonth suspended jail sentence and albert crann he was on license at the time and was sent back to belmarsh to complete his original sentence thank you chief inspector i have no more questions for you at the present time thank you mr pearson said the judge do you wish to crossexamine this witness mr redmayne i most certainly do mlord said alex as he rose from his place chief inspector you told the court that it was a member of the public who volunteered the information that made it possible for you to arrest daniel cartwright yes that is correct said fuller gripping the rail of the witness box so it wasnt as my learned friend suggested a singlehanded piece of police ingenuity no but as im sure you appreciate mr redmayne the police rely on a network of informers without whom half the criminals currently in jail would be on the streets committing even more crimes so this gentleman as you described your informant called you at your office the chief inspector nodded and you arranged to meet him at a mutually convenient place the following day yes replied fuller determined not to give anything away where did that meeting take place chief inspector fuller turned to the judge i would prefer mlord not to have to identify the location understandably said mr justice hackett move on mr redmayne so there would be no point in my asking you chief inspector to name your paid informant he wasnt paid said fuller regretting the words the moment he said them well at least we now know that he was an unpaid professional gentleman well done said alexs father in a loud stage whisper the judge frowned chief inspector how many officers did you find it necessary to deploy in order to arrest one man and one woman who were in bed at two oclock in the morning fuller hesitated how many chief inspector fourteen wasnt it more like twenty said alex if you count the backup team it might have been twenty sounds a little excessive for one man and one woman suggested alex he may have been armed said fuller that was a risk i wasnt willing to take was he in fact armed asked alex no he was not perhaps not for the first time began alex thats quite enough mr redmayne said the judge interrupting before he could finish the sentence good try said alexs father loud enough for everyone in the courtroom to hear do you wish to make a contribution sir matthew snapped the judge alexs father opened his eyes like a jungle beast that had been woken from a deep sleep he rose slowly from his place and said how kind of you to ask my lord but no not at this juncture possibly later he slumped back in his place the press benches were suddenly jolted into action as the first boundary was scored alex pursed his lips for fear he would burst out laughing mr justice hackett could barely restrain himself get on with it redmayne said the judge but before alex could respond his father was back on his feet i do apologize mlord he said sweetly but which redmayne did you have in mind this time the jury burst out laughing the judge made no attempt to reply and sir matthew sank back in his seat closed his eyes and whispered go for the jugular alex chief inspector you told the court that it was after you had seen miss wilson enter the house that you became convinced that it was daniel cartwright and not sir nicholas moncrieff who was living there yes thats correct said fuller still gripping the side of the witness box but once you had taken my client into custody chief inspector didnt you have a moments anxiety about whether you might have arrested the wrong man no mr redmayne not after id seen the scar on his not after youd seen the scar on his checked his dna on the police computer said the chief inspector sit down whispered alexs father youve got everything you need and hackett wont have worked out the significance of the scar thank you chief inspector no more questions mlord do you wish to reexamine this witness mr pearson asked mr justice hackett no thank you mlord said pearson who was writing down the words not after id seen the scar on his and trying to work out their significance thank you chief inspector said the judge you may leave the witness box alex leaned over to his father as the chief inspector made his way out of the courtroom and whispered but i didnt get him to admit that the professional gentleman was in fact craig that man was never going to name his contact but you still managed to trap him twice and dont forget theres another witness who must also know who reported danny to the police and hes certainly not going to feel at home in a courtroom so you should be able to corner him long before hackett works out what your real purpose is never forget we cant afford to make the same mistake as we did with lord justice browne and the unplayed tape alex nodded as mr justice hackett turned his attention to counsels bench perhaps this would be a good time to take a break all rise chapter seventyfive arnold pearson was deep in conversation with his junior when mr justice hackett said in a loud voice are you ready to call your next witness mr pearson pearson rose from his place yes mlord i call sir hugo moncrieff alex watched sir hugo carefully as he entered the courtroom never prejudge a witness his father had taught him from the cradle but hugo was clearly nervous he took a handkerchief out of his top pocket and mopped his brow even before he had reached the witness box the usher guided sir hugo into the box and handed him a bible the witness read the oath from the card that was held up in front of him then looked up toward the gallery searching for the person he wished was giving evidence in his place mr pearson gave him a warm smile when he looked back down sir hugo would you just for the record state your name and address sir hugo moncrieff the manor house dunbroath in scotland let me begin sir hugo by asking you when you last saw your nephew nicholas moncrieff on the day we both attended his fathers funeral and did you have an opportunity to speak to him on that sad occasion unhappily not said hugo he was accompanied by two prison officers who said that we were not to have any contact with him what sort of relationship did you have with your nephew asked pearson cordial we all loved nick he was a fine lad whom the family considered had been badly treated so there was no ill feeling when you and your brother learned that he had inherited the bulk of the estate from your father certainly not said hugo nick would automatically inherit the title on his fathers death and along with it the family estate so it must have come as a terrible shock to discover that he had hanged himself in prison and that an impostor had taken his place hugo lowered his head for a moment before saying it was a massive blow for my wife margaret and myself but thanks to the professionalism of the police and the rallying round of friends and family we are slowly trying to come to terms with it wordperfect whispered sir matthew can you confirm sir hugo that the garter king of arms has established your right to the family title asked mr pearson ignoring sir matthews comment yes i can mr pearson the letters patent were sent to me some weeks ago can you also confirm that the estate in scotland along with the house in london and the bank accounts in london and switzerland are once again in the custody of the family im afraid i cannot mr pearson and why is that asked mr justice hackett sir hugo appeared a little flustered as he turned toward the judge its the policy of both banks concerned not to confirm ownership while a court case is still in progress mlord they have assured me that legal transfer will take place to the rightful party as soon as this case is concluded and the jury have delivered their verdict fear not said the judge giving him a warm smile your long ordeal is coming to an end sir matthew was on his feet instantly i apologize for interrupting your lordship but does your response to this witness imply that you have already come to a decision in this case he asked with a warm smile it was the judges turn to look flustered no of course not sir matthew he replied i was merely stating that whatever the outcome of this trial sir hugos long wait is finally coming to an end i am obliged my lord it comes as a great relief to discover that you have not made up your mind before the defense has been given a chance to present its case he settled back in his place pearson glowered at sir matthew but the old mans eyes were already closed turning back to the witness he said i am sorry sir hugo that you have had to be put through such an unpleasant ordeal which is not of your own making but it has been important for the jury to see what havoc and distress the defendant daniel cartwright has brought down on your family as his lordship has made clear that ordeal is finally coming to an end i wouldnt be so sure of that said sir matthew pearson once again ignored the interruption no more questions my lord he said before resuming his place every word of that was rehearsed whispered sir matthew his eyes still closed lead the damn man down a long dark path and when he least expects it plunge a knife into his heart i can promise you alex no blood will flow blue or red mr redmayne i apologize for interrupting you said the judge but is it your intention to crossexamine this witness yes mlord pace yourself my boy dont forget that hes the one who wants to get it over with whispered sir matthew as he slumped back into his place sir hugo alex began you told the court that your relationship with your nephew nicholas moncrieff was a close onecordial was the word i think you used to describe itand that you would have spoken to him at his fathers funeral had the prison officers not prevented it yes that is correct said hugo let me ask you when was it that you first discovered that your nephew was in fact dead and not living as you had believed in his home in the boltons a few days before cartwright was arrested said hugo that would have been about a year and a half after the funeral at which you were not allowed any contact with your nephew yes i suppose so in that case i am bound to ask sir hugo how many times during that eighteenmonth period did you and your nephew whom you were so close to meet up or speak on the phone but thats the point it wasnt nick said hugo looking pleased with himself no it wasnt agreed alex but you have just told the court that you didnt become aware of that fact until three days before my client was arrested hugo looked up to the gallery hoping for inspiration this wasnt one of the questions margaret had anticipated and told him how to answer well we both lead busy lives he said trying to think on his feet he was living in london while i spend most of my time in scotland i understand that they now have telephones in scotland said alex a ripple of laughter went around the court it was a scot who invented the telephone sir said hugo sarcastically all the more reason to pick one up suggested alex what are you implying asked hugo im not implying anything replied alex but can you deny that when you both attended a stamp auction at sothebys in london in september and spent the next few days in geneva at the same hotel as the man you believed to be your nephew you made no attempt to speak to him he could have spoken to me said hugo his voice rising its a twoway street you know perhaps my client didnt want to speak to you as he knew only too well what sort of relationship you had with your nephew perhaps he knew that you had not written or spoken to him once during the past ten years perhaps he knew that your nephew loathed you and that your own fatherhis grandfatherhad cut you out of his will i see that you are determined to take the word of a criminal before that of a member of the family no sir hugo i learned all of this from a member of the family who demanded hugo defiantly your nephew sir nicholas moncrieff replied alex but you didnt even know him no i didnt admitted alex but while he was in prison where you never once in four years visited or wrote to him he kept a daily diary which has proved most revealing pearson leaped up mlord i must protest these diaries to which my learned friend refers were only placed in the jury bundle a week ago and although my junior has struggled manfully to go through them line by line they consist of over a thousand pages my lord said alex my junior has read every word of those diaries and for the convenience of the court he has highlighted any passages we might later wish to bring to the attention of the jury there can be no doubt that they are admissible they may well be admissible said mr justice hackett but i do not consider them to be at all relevant it is not sir hugo who is on trial and his relationship with his nephew is not at the heart of this case so i suggest you move on mr redmayne sir matthew tugged his sons gown may i have a word with my junior alex asked the judge if you must replied mr justice hackett still smarting from his last encounter with sir matthew but make it quick alex sat down youve made your point my boy whispered sir matthew and in any case the most significant line in the diaries ought to be saved for the next witness added to that old man hackett is wondering if hes gone too far and given us enough ammunition to apply for a retrial hell want to avoid allowing us that opportunity at all costs this will be his last appearance in the high court before he retires and he wouldnt want a retrial to be the one thing hes remembered for so when you resume say that you accept his lordships judgment without question but that as you may need to refer to certain passages in the diary on some later occasion you hope that your learned friend will find time to consider the few entries that your junior has marked for his convenience alex rose from his place and said i accept your lordships judgment without question but as i may need to refer to certain passages in the diary at a later date i can only hope that my learned friend will find enough time to read the few lines that have been marked up for his consideration sir matthew smiled the judge frowned and sir hugo looked mystified alex turned his attention back to the witness who was now mopping his brow every few moments sir hugo can i confirm that it was your fathers wish as clearly stated in his will that the estate in dunbroath should be handed over to the national trust for scotland with a sufficient sum of money to be put aside for its upkeep that was my understanding admitted hugo then can you also confirm that daniel cartwright abided by those wishes and that the estate is now in the hands of the national trust for scotland yes i am able to confirm that replied hugo somewhat reluctantly have you recently found time to visit number twelve the boltons and see what condition the property is in yes i have i couldnt see a great deal of difference from how it was before sir hugo would you like me to call mr cartwrights housekeeper in order that she can tell the court in graphic detail what state she found the house in when she was first employed that wont be necessary said hugo it may well have been somewhat neglected but as i have already made clear i spend most of my time in scotland and rarely visit london that being the case sir hugo let us move on to your nephews account at coutts bank in the strand are you able to tell the court how much money was in that account at the time of his tragic death how could i possibly know that hugo replied sharply then allow me to enlighten you sir hugo said alex extracting a bank statement from a folder just over seven thousand pounds but surely what matters is how much there is in that account at the present time retorted sir hugo triumphantly i couldnt agree with you more said alex taking out a second bank statement at close of business yesterday the account stood at a little over fortytwo thousand pounds hugo kept glancing up at the public gallery as he mopped his brow next we should consider the stamp collection that your father sir alexander left to his grandson nicholas cartwright sold it behind my back i would suggest sir hugo that he sold it right in front of your nose i would never have agreed to part with something that the family has always regarded as a priceless heirloom i wonder if you would like a little time to reconsider that statement said alex i am in possession of a legal document drawn up by your solicitor mr desmond galbraith agreeing to sell your fathers stamp collection for fifty million dollars to a mr gene hunsacker of austin texas even if that were true said hugo i never saw a penny of it because it was cartwright who ended up selling the collection to hunsacker he did indeed said alex for a sum of fiftyseven and a half million dollarsseven and a half million more than you managed to negotiate where is all this leading mr redmayne asked the judge however well your client has husbanded the moncrieff legacy it was still he who stole everything in the first place are you trying to suggest that it was always his intention to return the estate to its rightful owners no my lord however i am attempting to demonstrate that perhaps danny cartwright is not quite the evil villain that the prosecution would have us believe indeed thanks to his stewardship sir hugo will be far better off than he could have expected to be sir matthew offered up a silent prayer thats not true said sir hugo ill be worse off sir matthews eyes opened and he sat bolt upright there is a god in heaven after all he whispered well done my boy i am now completely at a loss said mr justice hackett if there is over seven and a half million dollars more in the bank account than you had anticipated sir hugo how can you possibly be worse off because i recently signed a legal contract with a third party who was unwilling to reveal the details of what had happened to my nephew unless i agreed to part with twentyfive percent of my inheritance sit back say nothing murmured sir matthew the judge called loudly for order and alex didnt ask his next question until silence had been restored when did you sign this agreement sir hugo hugo removed a small diary from an inside pocket and flicked over the pages until he came to the entry he was looking for october twentysecond last year he said alex checked his notes the day before a certain professional gentleman contacted chief inspector fuller to arrange a meeting at an unknown location i have no idea what youre talking about said hugo of course you dont said alex you had no way of knowing what was going on behind your back but i am bound to ask sir hugo once you had signed the legal contract agreeing to part with millions of pounds should your family fortune be restored what this professional gentleman could possibly be offering you in exchange for your signature he told me that my nephew had been dead for over a year and that his place had been usurped by that man sitting in the dock and what was your reaction to this incredible piece of news i didnt believe it to begin with said hugo but then he showed me several photographs of cartwright and nick and i had to admit they did look alike i find it hard to believe sir hugo that that was enough proof for a shrewd man like yourself to agree to part with twentyfive percent of his family fortune no it wasnt enough he also supplied me with several other photographs to back up his claim several other photographs prompted alex hopefully yes one of them was of the defendants left leg showing a scar above his knee that proved he was cartwright and not my nephew change the subject whispered sir matthew you have told the court sir hugo that the person who demanded twentyfive percent of what was rightfully yours in exchange for this piece of information was a professional gentleman yes he most certainly was said hugo perhaps the time has come sir hugo for you to name this professional gentleman i cant do that said hugo once again alex had to wait for the judge to bring the court to order before he was able to ask his next question why not demanded the judge let hackett run with it whispered sir matthew just pray he doesnt work out for himself who the professional gentleman is because one of the clauses in the agreement said hugo mopping his brow was that under no circumstances would i reveal his name mr justice hackett placed his pen down on the desk now listen to me sir hugo and listen carefully if you dont want a contemptofcourt order brought against you and a night in a cell to help jog your memory i suggest that you answer mr redmaynes question and tell the court the name of this professional gentleman who demanded twentyfive percent of your estate before he was willing to expose the defendant as a fraud do i make myself clear hugo began to shake uncontrollably he peered up into the gallery to see margaret nodding he turned back to the judge and said mr spencer craig qc everyone in the courtroom began speaking at once you can sit down my boy said sir matthew because i think thats what they call in dannys neck of the woods a double whammy now our esteemed judge has no choice but to allow you to subpoena spencer craig unless of course he wants a retrial sir matthew glanced across to see arnold pearson looking up at his son he was doffing an imaginary hat chapeau alex he said chapter seventysix how do you imagine munro will cope when he comes up against pearson asked alex an aging bull against an aging matador sir matthew replied experience and sheer cunning will prove more important than the charge so id have to bet on munro so when do i show the red rag to this bull you dont said sir matthew you leave that pleasure to the matador pearson wont be able to resist the challenge and it will make far more of an impact coming from the prosecution all rise announced the court usher once they had all settled back in their places the judge addressed the jury good morning members of the jury yesterday you heard mr pearson complete the case for the prosecution and now the defense will be given the opportunity to put its side of the argument after a consultation with both sides i shall be inviting you to dismiss one of the charges namely that the defendant attempted to steal the moncrieff family estate in scotland sir hugo moncrieff confirmed that this was not the case and that in accordance with his father sir alexanders wishes the estate has been taken over by the national trust for scotland however the defendant still faces four other serious charges on which you and you alone have been given the responsibility of making a judgment he smiled benignly at the jury before turning his attention to alex mr redmayne please call your first witness he said in a far more respectful tone than he had adopted the previous day thank you mlord said alex rising from his place i call mr fraser munro the first thing munro did when he entered the courtroom was to smile at danny in the dock he had visited him at belmarsh on five occasions during the past six months and danny knew that he had also attended several consultations with alex and sir matthew once again no bills for services rendered had been presented all dannys bank accounts had been frozen so all he had was the twelve pounds a week he was paid as the prison librarian which wouldnt have covered munros taxi fare from the caledonian club to the old bailey fraser munro stepped into the witness box he was dressed in a black tailcoat and pinstripe trousers a white shirt with a wing collar and a black silk tie he looked more like one of the court officials than a witness lending him an authority that had influenced many a scottish jury he gave the judge a slight bow before delivering the oath would you please state your name and address for the record said alex my name is fraser munro and i live at number fortynine argyll street dunbroath in scotland and your occupation i am a solicitor of the high court of scotland can i confirm that you are a past president of the scottish law society i am sir that was something danny didnt know and you are a freeman of the city of edinburgh i have that honor sir something else danny didnt know would you please explain to the court mr munro what your relationship is with the accused certainly mr redmayne i had the privilege as my father did before me of representing sir alexander moncrieff the first holder of the baronetcy did you also represent sir nicholas moncrieff i did sir and did you conduct his legal affairs while he was in the army and later when he was in prison yes he would telephone me from time to time while he was in prison but the bulk of our work was conducted by lengthy correspondence and did you visit sir nicholas while he was in prison no i did not sir nicholas explicitly requested me not to do so and i adhered to his wishes when did you first meet him asked alex i knew him as a child when he was growing up in scotland but before the occasion when he returned to dunbroath to attend his fathers funeral i had not seen him for twelve years were you able to speak to him on that occasion most certainly the two prison officers who were in attendance could not have been more considerate and they allowed me to spend an hour with sir nicholas in private consultation and the next time you met him was seven or eight weeks later when he came to scotland just after he had been released from belmarsh prison that is correct did you have any reason to believe that the person who visited you on that occasion was not sir nicholas moncrieff no sir i had only seen him for one hour during the past twelve years and the man who walked into my office not only looked like sir nicholas but was wearing the same clothes as he had done on the previous occasion wed met he was also in possession of all the correspondence that had taken place between us over the years and was wearing a gold ring bearing the family coat of arms as well as a silver chain and key that his grandfather had shown me some years before so he was in every sense sir nicholas moncrieff to the naked eye yes sir looking back over that time with the benefit of hindsight did you ever suspect that the man you believed to be sir nicholas moncrieff was in fact an impostor no in all matters he conducted himself with courtesy and charm rare in such a young man in truth he reminded me more of his grandfather than any other member of the family how did you eventually discover that your client was not in fact sir nicholas moncrieff but danny cartwright after hed been arrested and charged with the offenses that are the subject of this current trial can i confirm for the record mr munro that since that day the responsibility for the moncrieff estate has returned to your stewardship that is correct mr redmayne however i must confess that i have not conducted the daytoday business with the flair that danny cartwright always displayed would it be right to say that the estate is in a stronger financial position now than it has been for some years without question however the trust has not managed to maintain the same growth since mr cartwright was sent back to prison i do hope interrupted the judge that you are not suggesting mr munro that that diminishes the severity of these charges no my lord i am not said munro but i have discovered with advancing years that few things are entirely black or white but more often different shades of gray i can best sum it up my lord by saying that it was an honor to have served sir nicholas moncrieff and it has been a privilege to work with mr cartwright they are both oaks even if they were planted in different forests but then mlord we all suffer in our different ways from being prisoners of birth sir matthew opened both his eyes and stared at a man he wished hed known for many years the jury cannot have failed to notice mr munro continued alex that you retain the greatest respect and admiration for mr cartwright but with that in mind they may find it hard to understand how the same man became involved in such a nefarious deception i have considered that question endlessly for the past six months mr redmayne and have come to the conclusion that his sole purpose must have been to fight a far bigger injustice that had mr munro interrupted the judge sternly as you well know this is neither the time nor the place to express your personal opinions i am grateful my lord for your guidance said munro turning to face the judge but i took an oath to tell the whole truth and i presume you would not wish me to do otherwise no i would not sir snapped the judge but i repeat this is not the appropriate place to express such views my lord if a man cannot express his honestly held views in the central criminal court perhaps you can advise me where else he is free to state that which he believes to be the truth a ripple of applause ran around the public gallery i think the time has come to move on mr redmayne said mr justice hackett i have no more questions for this witness my lord said alex the judge looked relieved as alex resumed his seat sir matthew leaned across and whispered i actually feel a little sorry for dear arnold he must be torn between taking on this giant at the risk of being humiliated or avoiding him altogether and leaving the jury with an impression that they will regale their grandchildren with mr munro didnt flinch as he stared resolutely at pearson who was deep in conversation with his junior both of them looking equally perplexed i dont wish to hurry you mr pearson said the judge but is it your intention to crossexamine this witness pearson rose even more slowly than usual and did not tug the lapels of his gown or touch his wig he glanced down at the list of questions he had forfeited his weekend to prepare and changed his mind yes my lord but i will not be detaining the witness for long just long enough i hope murmured sir matthew pearson ignored the remark and said i am at pains to understand mr munro how a man as shrewd and experienced in legal matters as yourself could not have suspected even for a moment that his client was an impostor munro tapped his fingers on the side of the witness box and waited for as long as he felt he could get away with thats easy to explain mr pearson he eventually said danny cartwright was at all times utterly plausible though i confess that there was a single moment in our twoyearlong relationship when he lowered his guard and when was that pearson asked when we were discussing his grandfathers stamp collection and i had cause to remind him that he had attended the opening of an exhibition of that collection at the smithsonian institution in washington dc i was surprised that he did not appear to recollect the occasion which i found puzzling as he was the only member of the moncrieff family who had received an invitation did you not question him on the subject demanded pearson no said munro i felt that it would not have been appropriate at the time but if you suspected even for a moment that this man was not sir nicholas pearson said pointing a finger at danny but not looking in his direction surely it was your responsibility to pursue the matter i did not feel so at the time but this man was perpetuating a massive fraud on the moncrieff family which you had made yourself a party to i didnt see it that way responded munro but as you were the custodian of the moncrieff estate surely it was your duty to expose cartwright for the fraud he was no i didnt consider that to be my duty said munro calmly did it not alarm you mr munro that this man had taken up residence at the moncrieffs london town house when he had no right to do so no it did not alarm me replied munro were you not appalled by the thought that this outsider now had control of the moncrieff fortune which you had guarded so jealously on behalf of the family for so many years no sir i was not appalled by that thought but later when your client was arrested on charges including fraud and theft did you not feel that you had been negligent in the pursuance of your duty demanded pearson i do not require you to advise me whether i have or have not been negligent in my duty mr pearson sir matthew opened one eye the judge kept his head down but this man had stolen the family silver to quote another scot and you had done nothing to prevent it said pearson his voice rising with every word no sir he had not stolen the family silver and i feel confident that harold macmillan would have agreed with me on this occasion the only thing danny cartwright had stolen mr pearson was the family name you can no doubt explain to the court said the judge having sufficiently recovered from mr munros previous onslaught the moral dilemma i am facing with your hypothesis mr munro turned to face the judge aware that he had captured the attention of everyone in the court including the policeman on the door your lordship need not trouble himself with any moral dilemma because i was interested only in the legal niceties of the case the legal niceties said mr justice hackett treading carefully yes mlord mr danny cartwright was the sole heir to the moncrieff fortune so i was unable to work out what law if any he was breaking the judge leaned back happy to allow pearson to be the one who sank deeper and deeper into the munro mire can you explain to the court mr munro asked pearson in a whisper just what you mean by that its quite simple really mr pearson the late sir nicholas moncrieff made a will in which he left everything to daniel arthur cartwright of twentysix bacon road london e with the sole exception of an annuity of ten thousand pounds which he bequeathed to his former driver a mr albert crann sir matthew opened his other eye not sure whether to focus on munro or pearson and this will was properly executed and witnessed asked pearson desperately searching for a possible escape route it was signed by sir nicholas in my office on the afternoon of his fathers funeral aware of the gravity of the situation and my responsibility as the legal custodian of the family estateas you have been so keen to point out mr pearsoni asked senior officer ray pascoe and senior officer alan jenkins to witness sir nicholass signature in the presence of another partner of the firm munro turned to the judge i am in possession of the original document mlord should you wish to study it no thank you mr munro i am quite happy to take your word the judge replied pearson collapsed onto the bench quite forgetting to say no more questions my lord do you wish to reexamine this witness mr redmayne the judge inquired just one question my lord said alex mr munro did sir nicholas moncrieff leave anything to his uncle hugo moncrieff no said munro not a brass farthing no more questions mlord an outbreak of hushed whispers filled the courtroom as munro stepped out of the witness box walked across to the dock and shook hands with the defendant my lord i wonder if i might address you on a point of law inquired alex as munro departed from the courtroom of course mr redmayne but first i will have to release the jury members of the jury as you have just heard defense counsel has asked to discuss a point of law with me it may not have any bearing on the case but should it do so i will fully brief you on your return alex looked up at the packed public gallery as the jury left his gaze settled on an attractive young woman whom he had noticed sitting at one end of the front row every day since the trial had begun he had meant to ask danny who she was a few moments later the usher approached the bench and said the court has been cleared mlord thank you mr hepple said the judge how can i assist you mr redmayne my lord following the evidence given by the estimable mr munro the defense would suggest that there is no case to answer on counts three four and five namely the occupation of the house in the boltons benefiting from the sale of the stamp collection and the issuing of checks on the coutts bank account we would ask that all these counts be dismissed as it is selfevidently quite difficult to steal that which already belongs to you the judge took a few minutes to consider the argument before replying you make a fair point mr redmayne what is your view mr pearson i feel i should point out mlord said pearson that although it may well be the case that the defendant was the beneficiary of sir nicholas moncrieffs will there is nothing to suggest that he was aware of this at the time my lord countered alex immediately my client was well aware of the existence of sir nicholass will and of who the beneficiaries were how is that possible mr redmayne asked the judge while he was in prison mlord as i pointed out on a previous occasion sir nicholas kept a daily diary he recorded the details of his will on the day after he returned to belmarsh following his fathers funeral but that doesnt prove that cartwright was privy to his thoughts pointed out the judge i would agree with you mlord were it not for the fact that it was the defendant himself who pointed out the relevant passage for my juniors consideration sir matthew nodded that being the case said pearson coming to the judges rescue the crown has no objection to these charges being withdrawn from the list i am grateful for your intervention mr pearson said the judge and agree that it would appear to be the proper solution i will so inform the jury when they return thank you mlord said alex i am obliged to mr pearson for his assistance in this matter however said the judge im sure you dont need reminding mr redmayne that the most serious offense that of escaping from prison while in custody remains on the indictment i am indeed aware of that mlord said alex the judge nodded then i shall ask the usher to bring back the jury so i can inform them of this development there is a related matter my lord yes mr redmayne said the judge putting down his pen my lord following sir hugo moncrieffs evidence we have subpoenaed mr spencer craig qc to appear before you as a witness he has asked for your lordships indulgence as he is currently leading in a case taking place in another part of this building and will not be free to appear before your lordship until tomorrow morning several members of the press rushed out of the courtroom to phone their news desks mr pearson said the judge we have no objection mlord thank you when the jury returns after i have directed them on these two matters i shall release them for the rest of the day as you wish my lord said alex but before you do so may i alert you to a slight change in tomorrows proceedings mr justice hackett put his pen down a second time and nodded my lord you will be aware that it is a recognized tradition of the english bar to allow ones junior to examine one of the witnesses in a case in order that they may gain from the experience and indeed be given the chance to advance their career i think i can see where this is leading mr redmayne then with your permission mlord my junior sir matthew redmayne will lead for the defense when we examine the next witness mr spencer craig the rest of the press corps bolted for the door chapter seventyseven danny spent another sleepless night in his cell at belmarsh and it wasnt just big als snoring that kept him awake beth sat up in bed trying to read a book but she never turned a page as her mind was more concerned with the ending of another story alex redmayne didnt sleep because he knew that if they failed tomorrow he would not be given a third chance sir matthew redmayne didnt even bother to go to bed but went over the order of his questions again and again spencer craig tossed and turned as he tried to work out which questions sir matthew was most likely to ask and how he could avoid answering them arnold pearson never slept mr justice hackett slept soundly court number four was already packed by the time danny took his place in the dock he glanced around the courtroom and was surprised to see a melee of senior barristers and solicitors attempting to find vantage points from which to follow proceedings the press benches were filled with crime correspondents who for the past week had written hundreds of column inches and had warned their editors to expect a lead story for tomorrows first editions they couldnt wait for the encounter between the greatest advocate since f e smith and the most brilliant young qc of his generation the times or the mongoose versus the snake the sun danny looked up at the public gallery and smiled at beth who was sitting in her usual place next to his mother sarah davenport was seated at the end of the front row her head bowed on counsels bench mr pearson was chatting to his junior he looked more relaxed than at any time during the trial but then today he would only be a spectator not a participant the only empty seats to be found in the well of the courtroom were at the far end of counsels bench awaiting the entrance of alex redmayne and his junior two extra policemen had been stationed on the door to explain to latecomers that only those on official business could now be accommodated in the courtroom danny sat in the center of the dock the best seat in the house this was one performance for which he would like to have read the script before the curtain went up there was a babble of anticipation in the room as everyone awaited the four remaining participants who still had to make their entrance at five minutes to ten a policeman opened the courtroom door and a hush fell over the assembled gathering as those who had been unable to find a seat stood aside to allow alex redmayne and his junior to make their way to counsels bench this morning sir matthew made no pretense of slumping in a corner and closing his eyes he didnt even sit down he stood bolt upright and looked around the courtroom it was many years since hed appeared as an advocate in any court once hed found his bearings he unfolded a small wooden stand that his wife had retrieved from the loft the night before and which hadnt seen service for a decade he placed it on the desk in front of him and from his bag he removed a sheaf of papers on which he had written in his neat hand the questions spencer craig had spent all night trying to anticipate finally he handed alex two photographs that they both knew could decide the fate of danny cartwright only after everything was in place did sir matthew turn and smile at his old adversary good morning arnold he said i do hope that we wont be troubling you too much today pearson returned the smile a sentiment with which i am fully able to concur he said in fact im going to break the habit of a lifetime matthew and wish you luck despite the fact i have never once during all my years at the bar wanted my opponent to win today is the exception sir matthew gave a slight bow i will do my best to fulfill your wishes he then sat down closed his eyes and began to compose himself alex busied himself preparing documents transcripts photographs and other miscellaneous material in neat piles so that when his father shot out his right hand like an olympic relay runner the baton would be passed instantly the noise of uninvolved chatter ceased when mr justice hackett made his entrance he ambled across to the three chairs on the center of the stage attempting to give an impression that nothing untoward was about to take place in the court that morning having amply filled the center chair he spent longer than usual arranging his pens and checking his notebook while he waited for the jury to take their places good morning he said once they had settled the tone of his voice rather avuncular members of the jury the first witness today will be mr spencer craig qc you will recall his name being raised during the crossexamination of sir hugo moncrieff mr craig does not appear as a witness for either the prosecution or the defense but has been subpoenaed to attend this court meaning that he does not do so willingly you must remember that your only duty is to decide if the evidence mr craig presents has any bearing on the case being tried in this court namely did the defendant unlawfully escape from custody on that count and that count alone you will be asked to deliver your verdict mr justice hackett beamed down at the jury before turning his attention to junior counsel sir matthew he said are you ready to call the witness matthew redmayne rose slowly from his place i am indeed my lord he responded but did not do so he poured himself a glass of water then placed a pair of spectacles on the end of his nose and finally opened his red leather folder having satisfied himself that he was ready for the encounter he said i call mr spencer craig his words sounding like a death knell a policeman stepped out into the corridor and bellowed mr spencer craig everyones attention was now focused on the courtroom door as they awaited the entrance of the final witness a moment later spencer craig dressed in his legal garb strode into the courtroom as if it was just another day in the life of a busy advocate craig stepped into the witness box picked up the bible and facing the jury delivered the oath in a firm and confident manner he knew that it was they and they alone who would decide his fate he handed the bible back to the usher and turned to face sir matthew mr craig sir matthew began in a quiet lulling tone as if it was his desire to assist the witness in every possible way would you be kind enough to state your name and address for the record spencer craig fortythree hambledon terrace london sw and your occupation i am a barrister at law and a queens counsel so there is no need for me to remind such an eminent member of the legal profession of the significance of the oath or the authority of this court no need at all sir matthew replied craig although you appear to have done so mr craig when did you first discover that sir nicholas moncrieff was in fact mr daniel cartwright a friend of mine who had been at school with sir nicholas bumped into him at the dorchester hotel he soon realized that the man was an impostor alex placed a tick in the first box craig had clearly anticipated his fathers first question and delivered a wellprepared answer and why should this friend decide to inform you in particular of this remarkable discovery he didnt sir matthew it simply arose in conversation over dinner one night another tick then what was it that caused you to take a gigantic leap in the dark and come to the conclusion that the man posing as sir nicholas moncrieff was in fact daniel cartwright i didnt for some time said craig not until i was introduced to the supposed sir nicholas at the theater one evening and was shocked by the similarity in looks if not in manner between him and cartwright was that the moment when you decided to contact chief inspector fuller and alert him to your misgivings no i felt that would have been irresponsible so i first made contact with a member of the moncrieff family in case as you have suggested i was taking a gigantic leap in the dark alex placed another tick on the list of questions so far his father hadnt laid a glove on craig which member of the family did you contact asked sir matthew knowing only too well mr hugo moncrieff sir nicholass uncle who informed me that his nephew had not been in touch with him since the day hed been released from prison some two years before which only added to my suspicions was that when you reported those suspicions to chief inspector fuller no i still felt i needed more concrete evidence but the chief inspector could have relieved you of that burden mr craig i am at a loss to understand why a busy professional gentleman like yourself chose to remain involved as ive already explained sir matthew i felt it was my responsibility to make sure that i wasnt wasting the polices time how very publicspirited of you craig ignored sir matthews barbed comment and smiled at the jury but im bound to ask added sir matthew who it was that alerted you to the possible advantages of being able to prove that the man posing as sir nicholas moncrieff was in fact an impostor the advantages yes the advantages mr craig im not sure i follow you said craig alex placed the first cross on his list the witness was clearly playing for time then allow me to assist you said sir matthew he put out his right hand and alex handed him a single sheet of paper sir matthew ran his eye slowly down the page giving craig time to wonder just what bombshells it could possibly contain would i be right in suggesting mr craig said sir matthew that if you were able to prove that it was nicholas moncrieff and not danny cartwright who committed suicide while in belmarsh prison mr hugo moncrieff would not only inherit the family title but a vast fortune to go with it i was not aware of that at the time said craig not flinching so you were acting with entirely altruistic motives yes i was sir as well as the desire to see a dangerous and violent criminal locked up i will be coming to the dangerous and violent criminal who should be locked up in a moment mr craig but before then allow me to ask you when your acute sense of public service was overcome by the possibility of making a quick buck sir matthew interrupted the judge that is hardly the sort of language i expect from junior counsel when addressing a qc i apologize mlord i will rephrase my question mr craig when did you first become aware of the chance of making several million pounds from a piece of information you had picked up from a friend over dinner when sir hugo invited me to act on his behalf in a private capacity alex placed another tick against another anticipated question although he knew craig was lying mr craig do you consider it ethical for a qc to charge twentyfive percent of a mans inheritance in exchange for a piece of secondhand information it is now quite common sir matthew for barristers to be paid on results said craig calmly i realize the practice has only been introduced since your day so perhaps i should point out that i did not charge a fee or any expenses and that had my suspicions been proved wrong i would have wasted a considerable amount of my time and money sir matthew smiled at him then you will be delighted to learn mr craig that the altruistic side of your nature has won the day craig didnt rise to sir matthews barb although he was desperate to find out what he meant by it sir matthew took his time before he added as you may be aware the court has recently been informed by mr fraser munro the late sir nicholas moncrieffs solicitor that his client bequeathed his entire estate to his close friend mr danny cartwright so you have as you feared might be the case wasted a considerable amount of your time and money but despite my clients good fortune let me assure you mr craig that i shall not be charging him twentyfive percent of his inheritance for my services nor should you snapped craig angrily as hell be spending at least the next twentyfive years in prison and therefore will have to wait an awfully long time before he can benefit from this unexpected windfall i may be wrong mr craig said sir matthew quietly but i have a feeling that it will be the jury who makes that decision and not you i may be wrong sir matthew but i think youll find that a jury has already made that decision some time ago which brings me neatly on to your meeting with chief inspector fuller which you were so keen that nobody should find out about craig looked as if he was about to respond then clearly thought better of it and allowed sir matthew to continue the chief inspector being a conscientious officer informed the court that he would require a little more proof than photographs revealing a close similarity between the two men before he could consider making an arrest in an answer to one of my leaders questions he confirmed that you supplied him with that proof sir matthew knew that he was taking a risk had craig responded by saying that he had no idea what he was talking about and that he had simply passed on his suspicions to the chief inspector and left him to decide if any action should be taken sir matthew had no followup question he would then have to move on to a different subject and craig would have realized that he had merely been on a fishing expeditionand had landed nothing but craig did not respond immediately which gave sir matthew the confidence to take an even bigger risk he turned to alex and said in a voice loud enough for craig to hear let me have those photographs of cartwright running along the embankment the ones that show the scar alex handed his father two large photographs after a long pause craig said i may have told the chief inspector that if the man living in the boltons had a scar on his left thigh just above the knee that would prove that he was in fact danny cartwright the look on alexs face revealed nothing although he could hear his heart beating and did you then hand over some photographs to the chief inspector to prove your point i may have done admitted craig perhaps if you were to see copies of the photographs they might refresh your memory suggested sir matthew thrusting them toward him the biggest risk of all that wont be necessary said craig i would like to see the photographs said the judge and i suspect the jury would as well sir matthew alex turned to see that several members of the jury were nodding certainly mlord said sir matthew alex handed a pile of photographs to the usher who gave two to the judge before distributing the remainder to the jury to pearson and finally to the witness craig stared at the photos in disbelief they were not the ones gerald payne had taken when cartwright had been out on his evening run if he had not admitted to knowing about the scar the defense would have crumbled and the jury would have been none the wiser he realized that sir matthew had landed a blow but he was still on his feet and would not fall for a sucker punch a second time my lord said sir matthew you will see the scar that the witness referred to is on mr cartwrights left thigh just above the knee it has faded with the passing of time but still remains clear to the naked eye he turned his attention back to the witness you will recall mr craig that chief inspector fuller stated under oath that this was the evidence on which he relied before taking the decision to arrest my client craig made no attempt to contradict him sir matthew didnt press him as he felt the point had been well established he paused to allow the jury more time to study the photographs as he needed the scar to be indelibly fixed in their minds before he asked a question that he was confident craig could not have anticipated when did you first phone chief inspector fuller once again there was a silence as craig like everyone else in the court other than alex tried to work out the significance of the question im not sure i understand he replied eventually then allow me to refresh your memory mr craig you phoned chief inspector fuller on october twentythird last year the day before you met him at an undisclosed location to hand over the photographs showing danny cartwrights scar but when was the first occasion you came into contact with him craig tried to think of some way he could avoid answering sir matthews question he looked toward the judge hoping for guidance he received none he was the policeman who turned up at the dunlop arms when i called after i had witnessed danny cartwright stabbing his friend to death he eventually managed his friend said sir matthew quickly getting it on the record before the judge could intervene alex smiled at his fathers ingenuity mr justice hackett frowned he knew he could no longer prevent sir matthew pursuing the question of the original trial now that craig himself had unwittingly brought the subject into play his friend repeated sir matthew looking at the jury he expected arnold pearson to leap up and cut him short but there was no movement from the other end of counsels bench thats how bernard wilson was described in the court transcript said craig with confidence indeed he was said sir matthew and i shall be referring to that transcript later but for now i would like to return to chief inspector fuller on the first occasion you met him following the death of bernard wilson you made a statement yes i did in fact mr craig you ended up making three statements the first thirtyseven minutes after the stabbing had taken place the second which you wrote later that night because you couldnt sleep and a third seven months later when you appeared in the witness box at danny cartwrights trial i am in possession of all three of those statements and i must admit mr craig that they are admirably consistent craig didnt comment as he waited for the sting in the tail however what i am puzzled by is the scar on danny cartwrights left leg because you said in your first statementalex handed his father a single sheet of paper from which he readi saw cartwright pick up the knife from the bar and follow the woman and the other man out into the alley a few moments later i heard a scream that was when i ran out into the alley and saw cartwright stabbing wilson in the chest again and again i then returned to the bar and immediately phoned the police sir matthew looked up do you wish to make any amendments to that statement no said craig firmly that is exactly what happened well not quite exactly said mr redmayne because police records show that you made your call at eleven twentythree so one is bound to ask what you were doing between sir matthew interrupted the judge surprised that pearson hadnt leaped to his feet to intervene but remained resolutely seated in his place arms folded are you able to show that this line of questioning is relevant remembering that the only offense left on the charge sheet concerns your client escaping from custody sir matthew waited long enough for the jury to become curious about why he had not been allowed to finish his previous question before he responded no i am not mlord however i do wish to pursue a line of questioning that is relevant to this case namely the scar on the defendants left leg he once again made eye contact with craig can i confirm mr craig that you did not witness danny cartwright being stabbed in the leg which left him with the scar shown so clearly in the photographs which you handed over to the chief inspector and was the evidence he relied upon to arrest my client alex held his breath it was some time before craig eventually said no i did not so please indulge me for a moment mr craig and allow me to put forward three scenarios for your consideration you can then tell the jury from your vast experience of the criminal mind which of them you consider to be the most likely if you feel a parlor game will in any way assist the jury sir matthew sighed craig please be my guest i think you will find that its a parlous game that will assist the jury said sir matthew the two men stared at each other for some time before sir matthew added allow me to suggest the first scenario danny cartwright grabs the knife from the bar just as you suggested follows his fiancée into the alley stabs himself in the leg pulls out the knife and then stabs his best friend to death laughter broke out in the court craig waited for it to die down before he responded thats a farcical suggestion sir matthew and you know it im glad that we have at last found something on which we can agree mr craig let me move on to my second scenario it was in fact bernie wilson who grabbed the knife from the bar he and cartwright go out into the alley he stabs cartwright in the leg pulls out the knife and then stabs himself to death this time even the jury joined in the laughter thats even more farcical said craig im not quite sure what you imagine this charade is proving this charade is proving said sir matthew that the man who stabbed danny cartwright in the leg was the same man who stabbed bernie wilson in the chest because only one knife was involvedthe one picked up from the bar so i agree with you mr craig my first two scenarios are farcical but before i put the third one to you allow me to ask you one final question every eye in the courtroom was now on sir matthew if you did not witness cartwright being stabbed in the leg how could you possibly have known about the scar everyones gaze was transferred to craig he was no longer calm his hands felt clammy as they gripped the side of the witness box i must have read about it in the transcript of the trial said craig trying to sound confident you know one of the problems that an old warhorse like myself faces once hes pensioned off said sir matthew is that he has nothing to do with his spare time so for the past six months my bedside reading has been this transcript he held up a fiveinchthick document and added from cover to cover not once but twice and one of the things i discovered during my years at the bar was that often its not whats in the evidence that gives a criminal away but what has been left out let me assure you mr craig there is no mention from the first page to the last of a wound to danny cartwrights left leg sir matthew added almost in a whisper and so i come to my final scenario mr craig it was you who picked up the knife from the bar before running out into the alley it was you who thrust the knife into danny cartwrights leg it was you who stabbed bernie wilson in the chest and left him to die in the arms of his friend and it will be you who will spend the rest of your life in prison uproar broke out in the courtroom sir matthew turned to arnold pearson who still wasnt lifting a finger to assist his colleague but remained hunched up in the corner of counsels bench his arms folded the judge waited until the usher had called for silence and order was restored before saying i feel i should give mr craig the opportunity to answer sir matthews accusations rather than leave them hanging in the air i will be only too happy to do so mlord said craig evenly but first i should like to suggest to sir matthew a fourth scenario which at least has the merit of credibility i cant wait said sir matthew leaning back given your clients background isnt it possible that the wound to his leg was inflicted at some time before the night in question but that still doesnt explain how you could possibly have known about the scar in the first place i dont have to explain said craig defiantly because a jury has already decided that your client didnt have a leg to stand on he looked rather pleased with himself i wouldnt be so sure about that said sir matthew turning to his son who on cue handed him a small cardboard box sir matthew placed the box on the ledge in front of him and took his time before removing a pair of jeans and holding them up in full view of the jury these are the jeans that the prison service returned to miss elizabeth wilson when it was thought that danny cartwright had hanged himself i am sure that the jury will be interested to see that there is a bloodstained tear in the left lower thigh region which matches up exactly with the outburst that followed drowned out the rest of sir matthews words everyone turned to look at craig wanting to find out what his answer would be but he wasnt given the chance to reply as pearson finally rose to his feet mlord i must remind sir matthew that it is not mr craig who is on trial pearson declared having to almost shout in order to make himself heard and that this piece of evidencehe pointed at the jeans which sir matthew was still holding uphas no relevance when it comes to deciding if cartwright did or did not escape from custody mr justice hackett was no longer able to hide his anger his jovial smile had been replaced by a grim visage once silence had returned to his court he said i couldnt agree with you more mr pearson a bloodstained tear in the defendants jeans is certainly not relevant to this case he paused for a moment before looking down at the witness with disdain however i feel i have been left with no choice but to abandon this trial and dismiss the jury until all the transcripts of this and the earlier case have been sent to the dpp for his consideration because i am of the opinion that a gross miscarriage of justice may have taken place in the case of the crown versus daniel arthur cartwright this time the judge made no attempt to quell the uproar that followed as journalists bolted for the door some of them already on their mobile phones even before they had left the courtroom alex turned to congratulate his father to find him slumped in the corner of the bench his eyes closed he opened an eyelid peered up at his son and remarked its far from over yet my boy book six judgment chapter seventyeight though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not once father michael had blessed the bride and groom mr and mrs cartwright joined the rest of the congregation as they gathered around the grave of danny cartwright and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not it had been the brides wish to honor nick in this way and father michael had agreed to conduct a service in memory of the man whose death had made it possible for danny to prove his innocence and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not apart from danny only two people present had known the man who had come to be buried in a foreign field one of them stood upright on the far side of the grave dressed in a black tailcoat wing collar and black silk tie fraser munro had traveled down from dunbroath to the east end of london to represent the last in the line of moncrieffs that he would serve danny had tried to thank him for his wisdom and strength at all times but all munro had said was i wish id had the privilege of serving you both but that was not the lords will added the elder of the kirk something else danny hadnt known about the man when they had all met up at wilson house the marriage ceremony began munro took some considerable time admiring dannys paintings i had no idea danny that you were a collector of mctaggart peploe and lauder danny grinned i think youll find it was lawrence davenport who collected them i merely acquired them but having lived with them i intend to add more of the scottish school to my collection how like your grandfather said munro danny decided not to point out to mr munro that he had never actually met sir alexander by the way added munro sheepishly i must admit to having hit one of your adversaries below the belt while you were safely locked up in belmarsh which one sir hugo moncrieff no less and whats worse i did so without seeking your approval most unprofessional of me ive wanted to get it off my chest for some time well nows your chance mr munro said danny trying to keep a straight face so what have you been up to in my absence i must confess that i sent all the papers concerning the validity of sir alexanders second will to the procurator fiscals office alerting them to the fact that i felt an offense may have been committed danny didnt speak he had learned early on in their relationship not to interrupt munro while he was in full flow as nothing happened for several months i assumed that mr galbraith had somehow managed to have the whole episode swept under the carpet he paused that was until i read this mornings scotsman on the plane down to london he opened his everpresent briefcase took out a newspaper and passed it across to danny danny stared at the front page headline sir hugo moncrieff arrested for forgery and attempted fraud the article was accompanied by a large photograph of sir nicholas moncrieff that in dannys opinion didnt do him justice when danny finished reading the article he smiled and said to munro well you did say that if he caused me any further trouble then all bets are off did i really utter those words said munro in disgust for we know in part and we prophesy in part dannys eyes moved on to the only other person present who had been a friend of nicks and had known him far better than either he or munro had big al stood to attention between ray pascoe and alan jenkins the governor had granted him compassionate leave to attend the funeral of his friend danny smiled when their eyes met but big al quickly bowed his head he didnt want these strangers to see him weeping but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away danny turned his attention to alex redmayne who hadnt been able to hide his delight when beth had invited him to be godfather to their son the brother of christy alex stood next to his father the man who had made it possible for danny to be a free man when they had all met in alexs chambers a few days after the trial had been abandoned danny had asked sir matthew what hed meant when hed said its far from over yet the old judge had taken danny to one side so that beth could not hear his words and told him that although craig payne and davenport had all been arrested and charged with the murder of bernie wilson they were still professing their innocence and were clearly working together as a team he warned danny that he and beth would be put through the ordeal of a further trial at which they would both have to testify about what had really happened that night to another friend who was buried in st marys churchyard unless of course for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known danny couldnt resist looking across the road where a newly painted sign had recently been put in place cartwrights garage under new management once hed completed the negotiations and agreed a price with monty hughes munro had drawn up a contract that would allow danny to take over a business that he would be able to commute to each morning by crossing the road the swiss bankers had made it clear that they considered danny had paid far too high a price for the garage on the other side of the road danny didnt bother to explain to segat the difference between the words price and value as he doubted if either he or bresson would have spent much time with mr oscar wilde and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity danny gripped his wifes hand tomorrow they would fly to rome for a muchdelayed honeymoon during which they would try to forget that when they returned they would have to face another long trial before the ordeal would finally be over their tenweekold son chose that moment to express his feelings by bursting into tears and not in memory of sir nicholas moncrieff but simply because he felt that the service had gone on for far too long and in any case he was hungry shh said beth soothingly it wont be much longer before we can all go home his mother promised as she took nick in her arms in the name of the father and of the son chapter seventynine bring up the prisoners court number four at the old bailey was packed long before ten oclock in the forenoon but then it was not every day that a queens counsel a member of parliament and a popular actor were arraigned on charges of murder affray and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice counsels bench was littered with legal luminaries who were checking files arranging documents and in one case putting final touches to an opening speech as they waited for the prisoners to take their place in the dock all three defendants were being represented by the most eminent legal minds their solicitors could instruct and the talk in the corridors of the old bailey was that as long as they all stuck to their original story it was doubtful if any twelve jurors would be able to reach a unanimous verdict the chatter subsided when spencer craig gerald payne and lawrence davenport took their places in the dock craig was so conservatively dressed in a dark blue pinstriped suit white shirt and his favorite mauve tie that it appeared as if he had entered through the wrong door and that it should have been he who was seated on counsels bench waiting to deliver the opening speech payne was wearing a dark gray suit college tie and cream shirt as befitted a member of parliament representing a rural seat he appeared calm davenport wore faded jeans an opennecked shirt and a blazer he was unshaven which the press would describe the following morning as designer stubble but they would also report that he looked as if he hadnt slept for several days davenport ignored the press benches and glanced up toward the public gallery while payne and craig chatted to each other as if they were waiting to be served lunch in a busy restaurant once davenport had checked to see that she was in her place he stared blankly in front of him and waited for the judge to appear everyone who had managed to secure a place in the packed courtroom rose as mr justice armitage entered he waited for them to bow before returning the compliment taking the middle seat on the bench he smiled down benevolently as if this was just another day at the office he instructed the court usher to bring in the jury the usher bowed low before disappearing through a side door to reappear moments later followed by the twelve citizens who had been selected by rote to sit in judgment on the three defendants lawrence davenports barrister allowed the flicker of a smile to cross his face when he saw that the jury consisted of seven women and five men he felt confident that the worst result would now be a hung jury as the jury took their places in the box craig studied them with intense interest aware that they and they alone would decide his fate hed already briefed larry to make eye contact with the women jurors as they only needed three who couldnt bear the idea of lawrence davenport being sent to jail if larry could just manage that simple task they would all be set free but craig was annoyed to see that rather than obeying his simple instruction davenport appeared preoccupied and just stared fixedly in front of him once the jury had settled the judge invited the associate to read out the charges will the defendants please rise all three of them stood up spencer malcolm craig you are charged that on the night of september eighteenth you did murder one bernard henry wilson how do you plead

lawrence davenport raised his head and looked up into the public gallery where his sister was seated at the end of the front row sarah gave her brother a reassuring smile davenport lowered his head and for a moment seemed to hesitate before saying in a whisper that was barely audible guilty
