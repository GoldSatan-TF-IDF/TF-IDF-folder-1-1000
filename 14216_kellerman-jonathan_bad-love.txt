jonathan kellerman bad love the eighth book in the alex delaware series to my daughter rachel brains beauty grace wit style and a heart of gold special thanks to sheriffs deputy kurt ebert it came in a plain brown wrapper padded envelope book rate book sized i assumed it was an academic text id forgotten ordering it went on to the mail table along with mondays bills and announcements of scholarly seminars in hawaii and st croix i returned to the library and tried to figure out what i was going to do in ten minutes when tiffani and chondra wallace showed up for their second session a year ago their mother had been murdered by their father up on a ridge in the angeles crest forest he told it as a crime of passion and maybe he was right in the very worst sense id learned from court documents that absence of passion had never been a problem for ruthanne and donald dell wallace shed never been a strongwilled woman and despite the ugliness of their divorce she had held on to love feelings for donald dell so no one had been surprised when he cajoled her into taking a night ride with sweet words the promise of a lobster dinner and good marijuana shortly after parking on a shaded crest overlooking the forest the two of them got high made love talked argued fought raged and finally clawed at one another then donald dell took his buck knife to the woman who still bore his name slashed and stabbed her thirtythree times and kicked her corpse out of his pickup leaving behind an indiansilver clip stuffed with cash and his membership card in the iron priests motorcycle club a docketclearing plea bargain landed him in folsom prison on a five to ten for seconddegree murder there he was free to hang out in the yard with his methcooking aryan brotherhood bunkmates take an auto mechanics course he could have taught accrue good behavior brownie points in the chapel and bench press until his pectorals threatened to explode four months into his sentence he was ready to see his daughters the law said his paternal rights had to be considered an la family court judge named stephen huff one of the better ones asked me to evaluate we met in his chambers on a september morning and he told me the details while drinking ginger ale and stroking his bald head the room had beautiful old oak paneling and cheap country furniture pictures of his own children were all over the place just when does he plan on seeing them steve up at the prison twice a month thats a plane ride friends will chip in for the fare what kind of friends some idiocy called the donald dell wallace defense fund biker buddies vroom vroom meaning its probably amphetamine money his smile was weary and grudging not the issue before us alex whats next steve disability payments because hes stressed out being a single parent so it smells so what else is new talk to the poor kids a few times write up a report saying visitations injurious to their psyches and well bury the issue for how long he put down the ginger ale and watched the glass raise wet circles on his blotter i can kibosh it for at least a year then what if he puts in another claim the kids can be reevaluated and well kibosh it again times on their side right theyll be getting older and hopefully tougher in a year theyll be ten and eleven steve he picked at his tie what can i tell you alex i dont want to see these kids screwed up either im asking you to evaluate because youre toughminded for a shrink meaning someone else might recommend visitation its possible you should see some of the opinions your colleagues render i had one the other day said the fact that a mother was severely depressed was good for the kid teach her the value of true emotions okay i said but i want to do a real evaluation not some rubber stamp something that may have some use for them in the future therapy why not sure do whatever you want you are now shrink of record send your bill straight to me and ill see you get paid within fifteen working days whos paying our leatherclad friends dont worry ill make sure they pay up just as long as they dont try to deliver the check in person i wouldnt worry about it alex those types shy away from insight the girls arrived right on time just as they had last week linked like suitcases to the arms of their grandmother well here they are evelyn rodriguez announced she remained in the entry and pushed them forward morning i said hi girls tiffani smiled uneasily her older sister looked away have an easy ride evelyn shrugged twisted her lips and untwisted them maintaining her grip on the girls she backed away the girls allowed themselves to be tugged but unwillingly like nonviolent protesters feeling the burden evelyn let go crossing her arms over her chest she coughed and looked away from me rodriguez was her fourth husband she was anglo stout bottomheavy an old fiftyeight with dimpled elbows and knuckles nicotine skin and lips as thin and straight as a surgical incision talk came hard for her and i was pretty sure it was a character trait that preceded her daughters murder this morning she wore a sleeveless formless blouse a faded mauve and powder blue floral print that reminded me of a decorative tissue box it billowed untucked over black stretch jeans piped with red her blue tennis shoes were speckled with bleach spots her hair was short and wavy corn colored above dark roots earring slits creased her lobes but she wore no jewelry behind bifocals her eyes continued to reject mine she patted chondras head and the girl pressed her face against a thick soft arm tiffani had walked into the living room and was staring at a picture on the wall tapping one foot fast evelyn rodriguez said okay then ill just wait down in the car if it gets too hot feel free to come up the heat dont bother me she raised a forearm and glanced at a toosmall wristwatch how long we talking about this time lets aim for an hour give or take last time was twenty minutes id like to try for a little longer today she frowned okay can i smoke down there outside the house sure she muttered something anything youd like to tell me i said me she freed one finger poked a breast and smiled nah be good girlies stepping out on the terrace she closed the door tiffani kept examining the picture chondra touched the doorknob and licked her lips she had on a white snoopy tshirt red shorts and sandals with no socks a paperwrapped fruit rollup extended from one pocket of the shorts her arms and legs were pasty and chubby her face broad and puggish topped by whiteblond hair drawn into very long very tight pigtails the hair gleamed almost metallic incongruous above the plain face puberty might turn her pretty i wondered what else it might bring she nibbled her lower lip my smile went unnoticed or unbelieved how are you chondra she shrugged again kept her shoulders up and looked at the floor ten months her sisters senior she was an inch shorter and seemed less mature during the first session she hadnt said a word content to sit with her hands in her lap as tiffani talked on do anything fun this week she shook her head i placed a hand on her shoulder and she went rigid until i removed it the reaction made me wonder about some kind of abuse how many layers of this family would i be able to peel back the file on my nightstand was my preliminary research beforebed reading for the strong stomached legal jargon police prose unspeakable snapshots perfectly typed transcripts with impeccable margins ruthanne wallace reduced to a coroners afternoon wound depths bone rills donald dells mug shot wildeyed blackbearded sweaty and then she got mean on me she knew i didnt handle mean but that didnt stop her no way and then i just you know lost it it shouldnta happened what can i say i said do you like to draw chondra sometimes well maybe well find something you like in the playroom she shrugged and looked down at the carpet tiffani was fingering the frame of the picture a george bellows boxing print id bought it impulsively in the company of a woman i no longer saw like the drawing i said she turned around and nodded all cheekbones and nose and chin her mouth was very narrow and crowded with big misaligned teeth that forced it open and made her look perpetually confused her hair was dishwater cut institutionally short the bangs hacked crookedly some kind of food stain specked her upper lip her nails were dirty her eyes an unremarkable brown then she smiled and the look of confusion vanished at that moment she could have modeled sold anything yeah its cool what do you especially like about it the fighting the fighting yeah she said punching air action like wwa wwa i said world wrestling she pantomimed an uppercut pow poom then she looked at her sister and scowled as if expecting support chondra didnt move pow poom said tiffani advancing toward her welcome to wwa fighting im crusher creeper and this is the red viper in a grudge match of the century ding bellpull pantomime she laughed nervously chondra chewed her lip and tried to smile aar said tiffani coming closer she pulled the imaginary cord again ding pow poom hooking her hands she lurched forward with frankensteinmonster unsteadiness die viper aaar she grabbed chondra and began tickling her arms the older girl giggled and tickled back clumsily tiffani broke free and began circling punching air chondra started chewing her lip again i said cmon guys and took them to the library chondra sat immediately at the play table tiffani paced and shadowboxed hugging the periphery of the room like a toy on a track muttering and jabbing chondra watched her then plucked a sheet of paper off the top of a stack and picked up a crayon i waited for her to draw but she put the crayon down and watched her sister do you guys watch wrestling at home i said roddy does said tiffani without breaking step roddys your grandmothers husband nod jab hes not our grampa hes mexican he likes wrestling uhhuh pow poom i turned to chondra she hadnt moved do you watch wrestling on tv too shake of the head she likes surfriders said tiffani i do too sometimes and millionaires row chondra bit her lip millionaires row i said is that the one where rich people have all sorts of problems they die said tiffani sometimes its really for real she put her arms down and stopped circling coming over to us she said they die because money and materials are the roots of sins and when you lay down with satan your rest is never peaceful do the rich people on millionaires row lay down with satan sometimes she resumed her circuit striking out at unseen enemies hows school i asked chondra she shook her head and looked away we didnt start yet said tiffani how come gramma said we didnt have to do you miss seeing your friends hesitation maybe can i talk to gramma about that she looked at chondra the older girl was peeling the paper wrapper off a crayon tiffani nodded then dont do that theyre his its okay i said you shouldnt destroy other peoples stuff true i said but some things are meant to be used up like crayons and these crayons are here for you who bought them said tiffani i did destroyings satans work said tiffani spreading her arms and rotating them in wide circles i said did you hear that in church she didnt seem to hear punched the air he laid down with satan who wallace chondras mouth dropped open stop she said very softly tiffani came over and dropped her arm over her sisters shoulder its okay hes not our dad anymore remember satan turned him into a bad spirit and he got all his sins wrapped up like one like a big burrito chondra turned away from her come on said tiffani rubbing her sisters back dont worry wrapped up i said like one she explained to me the lord counts up all your good deeds and your sins and wraps them up so when you die he can look right away and know if you go up or down hes going down when he gets there the angelsll look at the package and know all he done and then hell burn she shrugged thats the truth chondras eyes pooled with tears she tried to remove tiffanis arm from her shoulder but the younger girl held fast its okay said tiffani you got to talk about the truth stop said chondra its okay tiffani insisted you got to talk to him she looked at me so hell write a good book for the judge and hell never get out chondra looked at me i said actually what i write wont change how much time he spends in jail maybe insisted tiffani if your book tells the judge how evil he is then maybe he could put him in longer was he ever evil to you no answer chondra shook her head tiffani said he hit us a lot sometimes with his hand or something else his hand never a stick or a belt or something else another headshake from chondra tiffanis was slower reluctant not a lot but sometimes i said when we were bad bad making a mess going near his bike he hit mom more right prodding chondra he did chondra gave a tiny nod grabbed the crayon and started peeling again tiffani watched but didnt stop her thats why we left him she said he hit her all the time and then he came after her with lust and sin in his heart and killed her tell the judge that youre rich hell listen to you chondra began crying tiffani patted her and said its okay we got to i got a tissue box tiffani took it from me and wiped her sisters eyes chondra pressed the crayon to her lips dont eat it said tiffani its poison chondra let go and the crayon flew out of her hand and landed on the floor tiffani retrieved it and placed it neatly alongside the box chondra was licking her lips her eyes were closed and one soft hand was fisted actually i said its not poisonous just wax with color in it but it probably doesnt taste too good chondra opened her eyes i smiled and she tried to smile producing only a small rise in one corner of her mouth tiffani said well its not food no it isnt she paced some more boxed and muttered i said let me go over what i told you last week youre here because your father wants you to visit him in jail my job is to find out how you feel about that so i can tell the judge why doesnt the judge ask us he will i said hell be talking to you but first he wants me to why because thats my job talking to kids about their feelings finding out how they really we dont want to see him said tiffani hes an insument of satan an an insument he laid all down with satan and became a sinful spirit when he dies hes going to burn in hell thats for sure chondras hands flew to her face stop said tiffani she rushed over to her sister but before she got there chondra stood and let out a single deep sob then she ran for the door swinging it open so hard it almost threw her off balance she caught it then she was out tiffani watched her go looking tiny and helpless you got to tell the truth she said i said absolutely but sometimes its hard she nodded now her eyes were wet she paced some more i said your sisters older but it looks like you take care of her she stopped faced me gave a defiant stare but seemed comforted you take good care of her i said shrug that must get hard sometimes her eyes flickered she put her hands on her hips and jutted her chin its okay she said i smiled shes my sister she stood there knocking her hands against her legs i patted her shoulder she sniffed then walked away you got to tell the truth she said yes you do punch jab pow poom i wanna go home chondra was already with evelyn sharing the front seat of the thirtyyearold plumcolored chevy the car had nearly bald blackwalls and a broken antenna the paint job was homemade the color nothing gm had ever conceived one edge of the cars rear bumper had been broken and it nearly scraped the ground i got to the drivers window as tiffani made her way down the steps from the landing evelyn rodriguez didnt look up a cigarette drooped from her lips a hardpack of winstons sat on the dashboard the drivers half of the windshield was coated with greasy fog her fingers were busy tying a lanyard keychain the rest of her was inert chondra was pressed up against the passenger door legs curled beneath her staring at her lap tiffani arrived making her way to the passenger side while keeping her eyes on me opening the rear door she dove inside evelyn finally took her eyes off her work but her fingers kept moving the lanyard was brown and white a diamond stitch that reminded me of rattlesnake skin well that was quick she said close that door now dont kill the battery tiffani scooted over and slammed the door i said the girls havent started school yet evelyn rodriguez looked at tiffani for a second then turned to me thats right do you need any help with that help getting them started is there some kind of problem nah we been busy i make em read at home theyre okay planning to send them soon sure when things calm down so whats next they have to come again lets try again tomorrow same time okay nope she said matter of fact it isnt got things to do whats a good time for you then she sucked the cigarette adjusted her glasses and placed the lanyard on the seat her slash lips twitched searching for an expression there are no good times all the good times already been rolled she started the car her lips were trembling and the cigarette bobbed she removed it and turned the wheel sharply without shifting out of park the car was low on steering fluid and shrieked in protest the front tires swung outward and scraped the asphalt id like to see them again fairly soon i said what for before i could answer tiffani stretched herself out along the back seat belly down and began kicking the door panel with both feet cut that out said mrs rodriguez without looking back what for she repeated so we can be told what to do and how to do it as usual no i the problem is things are upside down nonsensical those that should be dead arent and those that are shouldnt be no amount of talkings gonna change that so whats the difference upside down completely and now i got to be a mama all over again he can write a book said tiffani so that evelyn cut her off with a look you dont worry yourself about things we got to be heading back if theres time ill get you an ice cream she yanked the gear lever down the chevy grumbled and bucked then drove off rear bumper flirting with the road i stood there a while sucking up exhaust fumes then went back up to the house returned to the library and charted strong resistance to eval on part of mgm t overtly angry hostile to father talks in terms of sin retribution c still not communic will follow profound i went to the bedroom and retrieved ruthanne wallaces police file big as a phone book trial transcripts milo had said hefting it as he handed it over sure isnt because of any hotshot detection your basic moron murder hed pulled it from foothill divisions closed files filling my request without question now i flipped pages not knowing why id asked for it closing the folder i took it into the library and crammed it down into a desk drawer ten in the morning and i was already tired i went to the kitchen loaded some coffee into the machine and started going through the mail discarding junk mail signing checks filing paper then coming to the brownwrapped package that id assumed was a book slitting the padded envelope i stuck my hand in expecting the bulk of a hardcover but my fingers touched nothing and i reached deeper finally coming upon something hard and smooth plastic wedged tightly in a corner i shook the envelope an audiocassette fell out and clattered onto the table black no label or markings on either side i examined the padded envelope my name and address had been typed on a white sticker no zip code no return address either the postmark was four days old recorded at the terminal annex curious i took the tape into the living room slipped it into the deck and sank back onto the old leather couch click a stretch of staticfuzzed nothing started me wondering if this was some sort of practical joke then a shock of noise killed that theory and made my chest tighten a human voice screaming howling male hoarse loud wet as if gargling in pain unbearable pain a terrible incoherence that went on and on as i sat there too surprised to move a throatripping howling interspersed with trappedanimal panting heavy breathing then more screams louder earclapping expulsions that had no shape or meaning like the soundtrack from the rancid core of a nightmare i pictured a torture chamber shrieking black mouths convulsing bodies the howling bore through my head i strained to make out words amid the torrent but heard only the pain louder i leaped up to turn down the volume on the machine found it already set low i started to turn it off but before i could the screaming died more staticquiet then a new voice soft highpitched nasal a childs voice bad love bad love dont give me the bad love childs timbre but with no childish lilt unnaturally flat robotlike bad love bad love dont give me the bad love repeating it three times four a chant druidish and mournful so oddly metallic almost like a prayer bad love bad love no too hollow for prayer too faithless idolatrous a prayer for the dead by the dead i turned the recorder off my fingers were stiff from clenching my heart thumped and my mouth was dry coffee smells drew me to the kitchen i filled a cup returned to the living room and rewound the tape when the spool filled i turned the volume to near inaudible and pressed play my gut knotted in anticipation then the screams came on even that soft it was hideous someone being hurt then the childs chant again even worse in replay the robotic drone conjured a gray face sunken eyes a small mouth barely moving bad love bad love what had been done to strip the voice so completely of emotion id heard that kind of voice before on the terminal wards in holding cells and shelters bad love the phrase was vaguely familiar but why i sat there for a long time trying to remember letting my coffee go cold and untouched finally i got up ejected the tape and took it into the library down into the desk drawer next to ruthannes file dr delaware s black museum my heart was still chopping away the screams and chants replayed themselves in my mind the house felt too empty robin was not due back from oakland till thursday at least she hadnt been home to hear it old protective instincts during our years together id worked hard at shielding her from the uglier aspects of my work eventually i realized id erected the barrier higher than it needed to be and had been trying to let her in more but not this no need for her to hear this i sank lower into my desk chair wondering what the damned thing meant bad love what should i do about it a sick joke the childs voice bad love i knew id heard the phrase before i repeated it out loud trying to trigger a memory but the words just hovered chattering like bats a psychological phrase something out of a textbook it did have a psychoanalytic ring why had the tape been sent to me stupid question id never been able to answer it for anyone else bad love most likely something orthodox freudian melanie klein had theorized about good breasts and bad breasts perhaps there was someone out there with a sick sense of humor and a side interest in neofreudian theory i went to my bookshelves pulled out a dictionary of psychological terms nothing tried lots of other books scanning indexes not a clue i returned to the desk a former patient taunting me for services poorly rendered or something more recent donald dell wallace festering up in folsom seeing me as his enemy and trying to play with my head his attorney a dimwit named sherman bucklear had called me several times before id seen the girls trying to convince me his client was a devoted father it was ruthanne neglected them doctor whatever else donald dell did he cared about them how was he on child support times are rough he did the best he could does that prejudice you doctor i havent formed an opinion yet mr bucklear no of course not no ones saying you should the question is are you willing to form one at all or do you have your mind made up just because of what donald dell did ill spend time with the girls then ill form my opinion cause theres a lot of potential for prejudice against my client because he murdered his wife thats exactly what i mean doctor you know i can always bring in my own experts feel free i feel very free doctor this is a free country youd do well to remember that other experts was this bit of craziness an attempt to intimidate me so that id drop out of the case and clear the way for bucklears hired guns donald dells gang the iron priests had a history of bullying rivals in the meth trade but i still didnt see it how could anyone assume id make a connection between screams and chants and two little girls unless this was only the first step in a campaign of intimidation even so it was almost clownishly heavyhanded then again donald dells leaving his id at the murder scene didnt indicate finesse id consult an expert of my own dialing the west la police station i was connected to robberyhomicide where i asked for detective sturgis milo was out of the office no big surprise hed endured a demotion and six months unpaid suspension for breaking the jaw of a homophobic lieutenant whod put his life in danger then a buttnumbing year as a computer clerk at parker center the department had hoped inertia would finally drive him into disability retirement the lapd still denied the existence of gay cops and milo s very presence was an assault upon that ostrich logic but hed stuck it out and finally gotten back into active service as a detective ii back on the streets now he was making the most of it any word when hell be back i asked the detective who answered nope he said sounding put upon i left my name he said uhhuh and hung up i decided nothing further could be gained by worrying changed into a tshirt shorts and sneakers and trotted out the front door ready for a halfhour run knees be damned bounding down the steps i jogged across the motor court passing the spot where evelyn rodriguezs car had leaked oil just as i rounded the eugenia hedge that blocked my house from the old bridle path winding above the glen something stepped in front of me and stopped and stared a dog but id never seen one like it small dog about a foot high maybe twice that in length short black coat brindled with yellow hairs a lot of muscle crammed into the compact package its body bulged and gleamed in the sunlight it had thick legs a bull neck a barrel chest and a tight tuckedin belly its head was disproportionately wide and square its face flat deeply wrinkled and pendulously jowled somewhere between frog monkey and extraterrestrial a strand of drool dangled from its flews it continued to look me straight in the eye arching forward as if ready to spring its tail was an inch of stub male neutered i stared back he snorted and yawned showing big sharp white teeth a bananasized tongue curled upward and licked meaty lips a diamond of white hair in the center of his chest throbbed with cardiac excitement around his beefy neck was a nailheadstudded collar but no tag hi fella his eyes were light brown and unmoving i thought i detected a softness that contradicted the fighters stance another yawn purple maw he panted faster and remained rooted in place some kind of bulldog or minimastiff from the crust around his eyes and the heaving of his chest the early autumn heat wasnt doing him any good not a pug considerably bigger than a pug and the ears stood upright like those of a boston terrier in fact he looked a bit like a boston but shorter and a lot heavier a boston on steroids an exotic dwarf fighter bred to go for the kneecaps or a pup that would turn massive he yawned again and snorted harshly we continued to face off a bird chirped the dog cocked his head toward the sound for half a second then peered back at me his eyes were preternaturally alert almost human he licked his lips the drool strand stretched broke and fell to the pavement pant pant pant thirsty no movement friend or foe another display of teeth that seemed more smile than snarl but who knew another moment of standoff then i decided letting something this pintsized obstruct me was ridiculous even with the bulk he couldnt weigh more than twenty or twentyfive pounds if he did attack i could probably puntkick him onto the glen i took a step forward then another the dog came toward me deliberately head lowered muscles meshing in a rolling pantherish gait wheezing i stopped he kept going i lifted my hands out of mouth range suddenly aware of my exposed legs he came up to me up to my legs rubbed his head against my shin his face felt like hot suede too hot and dry for canine health i reached down and touched his head he snorted and panted faster letting his tongue loll i lowered my hand slowly and dangled it receiving a long lick on the palm but my skin remained bone dry the pants had turned into unhealthysounding clicks he tremored for a second then worked his tongue over his arid face i kneeled and patted his head again feeling a flat plate of thick ridged bone beneath the glossy coat he looked up at me with a bulldogs sadclown dignity the crust around his eyes looked calcified the folds of his face were encrusted too the nearest water source was the gardenhose outlet near the pond i stood and gestured toward it come on buster hydration the dog strained but stayed in place head cocked letting out raspy breaths that grew faster and faster and began to sound labored i thought i saw his front legs quaver i began walking to the garden heard soft pads and looked behind me to see him following a few paces behind keeping to the left a trained heeler but as i opened the gate to the pond he hung back remaining well outside the fence i went in the pond water was greening due to the heat but still clear the koi were circling lazily a couple of them saw me and approached the rim for feeding babies whod survived the surprise spawn of two summers ago most were over a foot long now a few were colored brilliantly the dog just stood there nose pointed at the water suffering come on pal i picked up the hose nothing uncoiling a couple of feet i opened the valve the rubber hummed between my fingers cmere ho the dog stared through the gateway panting gasping legs bowed with fatigue but he didnt budge cmon whats the problem sport some kind of phobia or dont you like seafood blink he stayed in place swayed a bit the hose began to dribble i dragged it out the gate sprinkling plants as i walked the dog stood his ground until the water was an inch from his fleshy mouth then he craned his neck and began lapping then gulping then bathing in it shaking his head and showering me before opening his maw and heading in for more long time since the last tipple he shook and sprayed me again turned his head away from the water and sat when i returned from replacing the hose he was still there settled on his ample haunches what now i said he ambled up to me jauntily a bit of roll in his stride putting his head against my leg he kept it there i rubbed him behind the ears and his body went loose he stayed relaxed as i used my handkerchief to wipe the crust from his face when i was through he let out a grumble of contentment youre welcome he put his head against my leg once more blowing out breath as i petted what a morning i sighed he snorted a reply i tried it again sighing audibly the dog produced an adenoidal grunt a conversationalist i said someone talks to you dont they someone cares about you grunt howd you get here grumble my voice was loud against the quiet of the glen harsh counterpoint to the flow of the waterfall nut mail and talking to a dog this is what its come to delaware the dog gazed up at me with a look i was willing to classify as friendship you take what you can get he watched as i pulled the seville out of the carport and when i opened the passenger door he jumped in as if he owned the vehicle for the next hour and a half he looked out the window as i drove around the canyon watching for lost dog posters on trees and talking to neighbors id never met no one belonged to him and no one recognized him though the checkout girl at the beverly glen market opined that he was a little stud and several other shoppers concurred while i was there i bought a few groceries and a small bag of kibble when i got home the dog bounced up the stairs after me and watched as i unloaded the staples i poured the kibble into a bowl and set it on the kitchen floor along with another bowl of water the dog ignored it choosing instead to station himself in front of the refrigerator door i moistened the kibble but that had no effect this time the stubby tail was wagging i pointed to the bowl the dog began nudging the fridge door and looking up at me i opened the door and he tried to stick his head in restraining him by the collar i scrounged and found some leftover meatloaf the dog jumped away from my grasp leaping nearly to my waist a gourmet huh i crumbled some meatloaf into the kibble and mixed it with my fingers the dog was snarfing before my hand was free coating my fingers with a slick layer of drool i watched him feast when he finished he cocked his head stared at me for a moment then walked toward the back of the kitchen circling and sniffing the floor what now sorbet to clean your palate he circled some more walked to the service porch door and began butting and scratching at the lower panel ah i said bounding up i unlatched the door and he zipped out i watched him race down the stairs and find a soft shaded spot near a juniper bush before lifting his leg he climbed back up looking content and dignified thank you i said he stared at me until i petted him then trailed me into the dining room settling next to my leg frog face lifted expectantly i scratched him under his chin and he promptly flipped onto his back paws upright i scratched his belly and he let out a long low phlegmy moan when i tried to stop one paw pressed down on my hand and bade me continue finally he turned back on his belly and fell asleep snoring jowls shaking like mudflaps someones got to be looking for you i slid the morning paper across the table plenty of lostdog ads in the classifieds but none of the animals remotely matched the creature stretched out on the floor i got animal controls number from information and told the woman who answered it what id found he sounds cute she said any idea what he is not offhand could be some kind of bulldog i guess maybe a mix what should i do with him well she said the law says you have to try to return him you could bring him in and leave him with us but were pretty crowded and i cant honestly tell you hell get anything more than basic care what if you have him and no one claims him well you know whatre my alternatives you could put an ad in the paperfounds are sometimes free you might also want to take him to a vet make sure hes not carrying anything that could cause you problems i thanked her called the newspaper and placed the ad then i pulled out the yellow pages and looked under veterinarians there was an animal hospital on sepulveda near olympic that advertised walkins and emergencies i let the dog sleep for an hour then took him for another ride the clinic was a milky blue cementblock building set between a wrought iron foundry and a discount clothing barn the traffic on sepulveda looked angry so i carried my guest to the front door upping the weight estimate to thirty pounds the waiting room was empty except for an old man wearing a golf cap comforting a giant white german shepherd the dog was prone on the black linoleum floor weeping and trembling from fright the man kept saying its okay rexie i tapped on a frosted glass window and registered using my name because i didnt know the dogs rex was summoned five minutes later then a collegeage girl opened the door and called out alex the bulldog was stretched on the floor sleeping and snoring i picked him up and carried him in he opened one eye but stayed limp whats the matter with alex today said the girl long story i said and followed her to a small exam room outfitted with lots of surgical steel the disinfectant smell reminded me of traumas gone by but the dog stayed calm the vet arrived soon after a young crewcut asian man in a blue smock smiling and drying his hands with a paper towel hi im dr uno ah a frenchie dont see too many of those a what he onehanded the towel into a waste bin a french bulldog oh he looked at me you dont know what he is i found him oh he said well thats a pretty rare dog youve got there someonell claim him he petted the dog these little guys are pretty expensive and this one looks like a good specimen he lifted his flews well cared for too these teeth have been scaled pretty recently and his ears are clean these upright ears can be receptacles for all kinds of stuff anyway what seems to be your problem with him apart from a fear of water nothing i said i just wanted him checked out fear of water how so i recounted the dogs avoidance of the pond interesting said the vet probably means hes been perimeter trained for his own safety bulldog pups can drown pretty easily real heavy boned so they sink like rocks on top of that they have no nose to speak of so they have trouble getting their head clear another patient of mine lost a couple of english bull babies that way so this guys actually being smart by shying away hes housebroken and he heels too i said the vet smiled and i realized something very close to owners pride had crept into my voice why dont you put him up here on the table and lets see what else he can do the dog was probed vaccinated and given a clean bill of health someone definitely took good care of him said uno the basic thing to watch out for is heatstroke specially now when the temperature is rising these brachycephalic dogs are really prone to it so keep him out of the heat he handed me some brochures on basic dog care reiterated the heat danger and said thats about it good luck finding the owner any suggestions along those lines put an ad in the paper or if theres a local frenchie club you could try getting in touch with them do you have a list of club addresses nope sorry we do mostly er work maybe the akc american kennel club could help they register most of the purebreds where are they new york he walked me to the door these dogs generally have good temperament i said he looked down at the dog who was staring up at us and wagging his stub from the little ive heard and read what youre seeing right now is pretty much it they ever attack attack he laughed i guess if he got attached to you he might try to protect you but i wouldnt count on it theyre really not good for much but being a friend well thats something i said sure it is he said thats where its at bottom line right i drove away from the clinic stroking the dog and thinking of the childs voice on the tape i wasnt hungry but figured id need some lunch eventually spotting a hamburger stand farther up on sepulveda i bought a takeout halfpounder the aroma kept the dog awake and drooling all the way home and a couple of times he tried to stick his nose in the bag back in the kitchen he convinced me to part with a third of the patty then he carried his booty to a corner sat masticated noisily and promptly went to sleep chin to the floor i phoned my service and found out milo had called back this time he answered at robberyhomicide sturgis hows it going joe friday the usual buckets of blood hows by you i told him about receiving the tape probably just a prank but imagine getting a kid to do that i expected him to slough it off but he said bad love thats weird what is those exact same words popped up in a case a couple of months ago remember that social worker who got murdered at the mental health center rebecca basille it was all over the news i said remembering headlines and sound bites the smiling picture of a pretty darkhaired young woman butchered in a soundproof therapy room you never said it was your case it wasnt really anyones case because there was no investigation to speak of the psycho who stabbed her died trying to take another caseworker hostage i remember i got stuck filling out the paperwork how did bad love pop up the psycho screamed it when he ran out after cutting becky clinic director was standing in the hall heard him before she ducked into her office and hid i figured it was schizo talk it may be something psychological jargon that he picked up somewhere in the mental health system cause i think ive heard it too but i cant remember where thats probably it he said a kid huh a kid chanting in this strange flat voice it may be related to a case im working on milo remember that file you got me the woman murdered by her husband the biker hes been locked up for six months two months ago he started asking for visitation with his daughters around the same time as the basille murder come to think of it if beckys murderer screaming bad love was in the news i guess he could have taken notice and filed it away for future use intimidate the shrink maybe remind you of what can happen to therapists who dont behave themselves exactly thered be nothing criminal in that would there just sending a tape wouldnt even buy him snack bar demerits but how could he figure youd make the connection i dont know unless this is just an appetizer and theres more coming whats this fools name again donald dell wallace he repeated it and said i never read the file refresh me on him he used to hang out with a biker gang called the iron priests smalltime tujunga bunch in between prison sentences he worked as a motorcycle mechanic dealt speed on the side i think hes a member of the aryan brotherhood well theres a character reference for you let me see what i find out you think this is something i should worry about not really you might think of locking your doors i already do congratulations you going to be home tonight yup hows robin fine shes up in oakland giving a seminar medieval lutes smart kid working with inanimate objects all right ill come by rescue you from your hermitude if you want me to i can fingerprint the tape check it against wallaces if its him well report him to his keepers at least let him know youre not going to roll over okay thanks yeah dont handle it anymore hard plastics a real good surface for preservation bad love sounds like something out of a movie scifi splatter flick whatever i couldnt find it in any of my psych books so maybe thats it maybe thats where beckys murderer got it too all of us are children of the silver screen the tape was mailed from the terminal annex not folsom meaning if wallace is behind it someones helping him i can check the rest of his gang too at least the ones with records dont lose any sleep over it ill try to get by around eight meanwhile back to the slaughter buckets of blood huh big sloshing buckets every morning i wake up praise the lord and thank him for all the iniquity hows that for perverse hey i said you love your work yeah he said yeah i do demotion never felt so goddamn glorious department treating you well lets not lapse into fantasy the departments tolerating me because they think theyve wounded me deeply with their pissanty pay cut and ill eventually cave in and take disability like every other goldbricking pension junkie the fact that one night of moonlighting more than makes up for the difference in takehome has eluded the brass as has the fact that im a contrary bastard theyre not very observant are they thats why theyre administrators after he hung up i called evelyn rodriguezs house in sunland as the phone rang i pictured the man whod carved up her daughter playing with a tape recorder in his cell no one answered i put the phone down i thought of rebecca basille hacked to death in a soundproof room her murder had really gotten to me gotten to lots of therapists but id put it out of my head until milo reminded me i drummed my fists on the counter the dog looked up from his empty bowl and stared id forgotten he was there what happens to therapists who dont behave themselves what if wallace had nothing to do with the tape someone else from my past i went into the library and the dog followed the closet was stacked with boxes of inactive patient files loosely alphabetized with no strict chronological order because some patients had been treated at several different time periods i put the radio on for background and started with the as looking for children whom id tagged with psychopathic or antisocial tendencies and cases that hadnt turned out well even longterm deadbeats id sent to collections i made it halfway through a sour history lesson with no tangible results nothing popped out at me by the end of the afternoon my eyes hurt and i was exhausted i stopped reading realized grumbly snores had overpowered the music reaching down i kneaded the bulldogs muscular neck he shuddered but remained asleep a few charts were fanned on the desk even if i came up with something suggestive patient confidentiality meant i couldnt discuss it with milo i returned to the kitchen fixed kibble and meatloaf and fresh water watched my companion sup burp then circle and sniff i left the service door open and he bounced down the stairs while he was out i called robins hotel in oakland again but she was still out the dog came back he and i went into the living room and watched the evening news current events were none too cheerful but he didnt seem to mind the doorbell rang at eightfifteen the dog didnt bark but his ears stiffened and tilted forward and he trailed me to the door remaining at my heels as i squinted through the peephole milo s face was a wideangle blur big and pocked its paleness turned sallow by the bug light over the doorway police open up or ill shoot he bared his teeth in a halloween grimace i unlocked the door and he came in carrying a black briefcase he was dressed for work blue hopsack blazer gray slacks white shirt stretched tight over his belly blue and gray plaid tie tugged loose suede desert boots in need of new soles his haircut was recent the usual clipped short at sides and back long and shaggy on top sideburns down to the earlobes country yokels had looked that way back in the fifties melrose avenue hipsters were doing it nowadays i doubted milo was aware of either fact the black forelock that shadowed his forehead showed a few more gray streaks his green eyes were clear some of the weight hed lost had come back he looked to be carrying at least two hundred and forty pounds on his seventyfive inches he stared at the dog and said what gee dad he followed me home can i keep him the dog gazed up at him and yawned yeah im bored too milo told him what the hell is it alex french bulldog i said rare and pricey according to a vet and this ones a damned good specimen specimen he shook his head is it civilized compared to what youre used to very he frowned patted the dog gingerly and got slurped charming he said wiping his hand on his slacks then he looked at me why marlin perkins im serious he just showed up this morning im trying to locate the owner have an ad running in the paper the vet said hes been well cared for its just a matter of time before somebody claims him for a moment i thought this tape stuff had gotten to you and youd gone out and bought yourself some protection this i laughed remembering dr unos amusement i dont think so hey he said sometimes bad things come in small packages for all i know its trained to go for the gonads the dog stood on his hind legs and touched milo s trousers with his forepaws down rover he said whats the matter you dont like animals cooked i do didja name it yet i shook my head then rover will have to do he took his jacket off and tossed it onto a chair heres what ive got so far on wallace he keeps a low profile in slam and has some associations with the aryan brotherhood but hes not a full member as for what kind of hardware hes got in his cell i dont know yet now wheres the alleged tape in the alleged tapedeck he went over and turned on the stereo the dog stayed with me i said you know where the meatloaf comes from dont you he cocked his head and licked my hand then the screams came on and the hairs rose on the back of his neck hearing it the third time was worse milo s face registered revulsion but after the sound died he said nothing taking his briefcase over to the deck he switched it off ejected the tape and removed it by inserting a pencil in one of the reel holes black surface he muttered ye olde white powder placing the cassette atop the plastic cover of my turntable he removed a small brush and a vial from the case dipping the brush into the vial he dusted the cassette with a pale ashlike powder squinting as he worked well looks like weve got some nice ridges and swirls he said but they could all be yours your prints are on file with the medical board right so i can check they printed me when i got my license meaning a week or two going through channels in order to pry it loose from sacramento noncriminal stuffs not on printrak yet you havent been arrested for anything recently have you nothing i can remember too bad okay lets get a quick fix on your digits right now he took an inkpad and fingerprint form from the case the dog watched as he inked my fingers and rolled them on the form the audiocassette was near my hand and i looked at the concentric white patches on its surface keep that pinkie loose said milo feel like a scumbag felon yet i dont say squat without my lawyer pig he chuckled and handed me a cloth as i wiped my fingers he took a small camera out of the case and photographed the prints on the tape flipping the cartridge over with the pencil he dusted raised more prints on the other side and took pictures of them muttering might as well do it right then he lowered the cassette into a small box lined with cotton sealed the container and put it into the case what do you think i said he looked at my print form then at the tape and shook his head they always look the same to me let the lab deal with it i meant about the tape sound like any movie you know he ran his hand over his face as if washing without water not really me neither didnt the kids voice have a brainwashed quality to it more like brain dead he said yeah it was ugly but that doesnt make it real far as im concerned its still filed under b for bad joke someone getting a child to chant as a joke he nodded were living in weird times doc but what if it is real what if were dealing with a sadist whos abducted and tortured a child and is telling me about it in order to heighten the kick the screamer was the one who sounded tortured alex and that was an adult someones messing with your head if its not wallace i said maybe its some psychopath picking me as his audience because i treat kids and sometimes my name gets in the papers someone who read about beckys murderer screaming bad love and got an idea and for all i know im not the only therapist hes contacted could be when was the last time you were in the papers this summer when the jones case went to trial anythings possible he said or maybe its more direct milo a former patient telling me i failed him i started going through my files got halfway and couldnt find anything but who knows my patients were all children in most cases i have no idea what kind of adults they turned into if you found anything funny would you give me the names couldnt i said without some kind of clear danger i couldnt justify breaking confidentiality he scowled the dog watched him unwaveringly whatre you staring at he demanded wag wag milo began to smile fought it picked up his case and put a heavy hand on my shoulder listen alex i still wouldnt lose any sleep over it let me take these to the lab right now instead of tomorrow see if i can get some nightshifter to put some speed on ill also make a copy and start a case file private one just for my eyes when in doubt be a goddamn clerk after he left i tried to read a psychology journal but couldnt concentrate i watched the news did fifty pushups and had another go at my charts i made it through all of them kids names vaguely remembered pathologies no allusions to bad love no one i could see wanting to frighten me at ten robin called hi honey hi i said you sound good i am good but i miss you maybe ill come home early that would be great just say when and ill be at the airport everything okay peachy weve got a visitor i described the bulldogs arrival oh she said he sounds adorable now i definitely want to come home early he snorts and drools how cute you know we should get a dog of our own were nurturant right and you had one when you were a kid dont you miss it my father had one i said a hunting cur that didnt like children it died when i was five and we never got another but sure i like dogs how about something big and protective long as its also warm and furry what breeds do you like i dont know something solid and dependable let me think about it and when i get back we can go shopping sounds good bowwow we can do other stuff too she said sounds even better just before midnight i fashioned a bed for the dog out of a couple of towels placed it on the floor of the service porch and turned out the light the dog stared at it then trotted over to the fridge no way i said time to sleep he turned his back on me and sat i left for the bedroom he heeled along feeling like simon legree i closed the door on his supplicating eyes as soon as i got under the covers i heard scratching then heavy breathing then something that sounded like an old man choking i jumped out of bed and opened the door the dog raced through my feet and hurled himself up on the bed forget it i said and put him on the carpet he made the choking sound again stared and tried to climb up i returned him to the floor a couple more tries and he gave up turning his back on me and staying hunkered against the dust ruffle it seemed a reasonable compromise but when i awoke in the middle of the night thinking about pain screams and robot chants he was right next to me soft eyes full of pity i left him there a moment later he was snoring and it helped put me back to sleep the next morning i woke up tasting the metal and bite of bad dreams i fed the dog and called the rodriguez house again still no answer but this time a machine fed me evelyns tired voice over a background of conway twitty singing slow hand i asked her to call me she hadnt by the time i finished showering and shaving neither had anyone else determined to get outdoors i left the dog with a big biscuit and walked the couple of miles to the university campus the computers at the biomed library yielded no references to bad love in any medical or psychological journals and i returned home at noon the dog licked my hand and jumped up and down i petted him gave him some cheese and received a droolcovered hand by way of thanks after boxing my charts i carried them back to the closet a single carton had remained on the shelf wondering if it contained files id missed i pulled it down no patient records it was crammed with charts and reprints of technical articles id set aside as references a thick roll of papers bound with a rubber band was wedged between the folders the word profundities was scrawled across it in my handwriting i remembered myself younger angrier sarcastic removing the band from the roll i flattened the sheaf and inhaled a snootful of dust more nostalgia a collection of articles id authored and programs from scientific meetings at which id presented papers i leafed through it absently until a brochure near the bottom caught my eye strong black letters on stiff blue paper a coffee stain on one corner good lovebad love psychoanalytic perspectives and strategies in a changing world november western pediatric medical centerlos angeles california a conference examining the relevance and application of de boschian theory to social and psychobiological issues and commemorating fifty years of teaching research and clinical work by andres b de bosch phd cosponsored by wpmc and the de bosch institute and corrective school santa barbara california conference cochairs katarina v de bosch phd practicing psychoanalyst and acting director the de bosch institute and corrective school alexander delaware phd assistant professor of pediatrics and psychology wpmc harvey m rosenblatt md practicing psychoanalyst and clinical professor of psychiatry new york university school of medicine headshot photos of all three of us katarina de bosch thin and brooding rosenblatt and i bearded and professorial the rest was a list of scheduled speakers more photos and details of registration good lovebad love i remembered it clearly now wondered how i could have forgotten nineteen seventynine had been my fourth year on staff at western peds a period marked by long days and longer nights on the cancer ward and the genetic disorders unit holding the hands of dying children and listening to families with unanswerable questions in march of that year the head of psychiatry and the chief psychologist both chose to go on sabbatical though they werent on speaking terms and the chief never returned their last official cooperative venture was designating me interim chief slapping my back and grinding their teeth around their pipe bits they worked hard at making it sound like a steppingstone to something wonderful what it had amounted to was more administrative chores and just enough of a temporary pay raise to kick me into the next tax bracket but id been too young to know any better back then western peds had been a prestigious place and i learned quickly that one aspect of my new job was fielding requests from other agencies and institutions wanting to associate with the hospital most common were proposals for jointly sponsored conferences to which the hospital would contribute its good name and its physical premises in return for continuingeducation credits for the medical staff and a percentage of the box office of the scores of requests received yearly a good many were psychiatric or psychological in nature of those only two or three were accepted katarina de boschs letter had been one of several i received just weeks after assuming my new post i scanned it and rejected it not a tough decision the subject matter didnt interest me or my staff the frontline battles we were waging on the wards placed the theorizations of classical psychoanalysis low on our want list and from my readings of his work andres de bosch was a middleweight analyst a prolific but superficial writer whod produced little in the way of original thought and had parlayed a year in vienna as one of freuds students and membership in the french resistance into an international reputation i wasnt even sure he was still alive the letter from his daughter didnt make it clear and the conference she proposed had a memorial flavor to it i wrote her a polite letter two weeks later i was called in to see the medical director a pediatric surgeon named henry bork who favored hickeyfreeman suits jamaican cigars and sawtooth abstract art and who hadnt operated in years alex he smiled and motioned to a breuer chair a slender woman was sitting in a matching nest of leather and chrome on the other side of the room she looked to be slightly older than me early thirties i guessed but her face was one of those long sallow constructions that would always seem aged the beginnings of worry lines suggested themselves at crucial junctures like a portrait artists initial tracings her lips were chapped all of her looked dry and her only makeup was a couple of grudging lines of mascara her eyes were large enough without the shadowing dark heavy lidded slightly bloodshot close set her nose was prominent down tilted and sharp with a small bulb at the tip full wide lips were set sternly her legs were pressed together at the knees feet set squarely on the floor she wore a coarse black scallopnecked wool sweater over a pleated black skirt stockings tinted to mimic a caribbean tan and black loafers no jewelry her hair was straight brown and long drawn back very tightly from a low flat brow and fastened above each ear with wide black wooden barrettes a houndstooth jacket was draped over her lap near one shoe was a black leatherette attaché case as i sat down she watched me hands resting upon one another spindly and white the top one was sprinkled with some sort of eczematous rash her nails were cut short one cuticle looked raw bork stepped between us and spread his arms as if preparing to conduct a symphony dr delaware dr katarina de bosch dr de bosch alex delaware our acting chief psychologist i turned to her and smiled she gave a nod so tiny i might have imagined it bork backed away rested a buttock on his desk and cupped both his hands over one knee the desk surface was twenty square feet of lacquered walnut shaped like a surfboard topped with an antique padded leather blotter and a green marble inkwell centered on the blotter was a single rectangle of stiff blue paper he picked it up and used it to rap his knuckles do you recall dr de boschs writing to you suggesting a collaborative venture with your division alex i nodded and the disposition of that request i turned it down might i ask why the staffs been asking for things directly related to inpatient management henry looking pained bork shook his head then handed the blue paper to me a program for the conference still smelling of printers ink full schedule speakers and registration my name was listed below katarina de boschs as cochair my picture below lifted off the professional staff roster my face broiled i took a deep breath looks like a fait accompli henry i tried to hand him the brochure but he put his hands back on his knees keep it for your records alex standing he sidled in front of the desk taking tiny steps like a man on a ledge finally he managed to get behind the surfboard and sat down katarina de bosch was inspecting her knuckles i considered maintaining my dignity but decided against it nice to know what im doing in november henry care to give me my schedule for the rest of the decade a small sniffing sound came from katarinas chair bork smiled at her then turned to me shifting his lips into neutral an unfortunate misunderstanding alex a snafu something naturally always fouls up right he looked at katarina again got nothing in return and lowered his eyes to the blotter i fanned the blue brochure snafu bork repeated one of those interim decisions that had to be made during the transition between dr greiloffs and dr franks sabbaticals and your stepping in the board offers its regrets then why bother with a letter of application katarina said because im polite i didnt know the board got involved in scheduling conferences henry bork smiled everything alex is the province of the board but youre right its not typical for us to get directly involved in that type of thing however he paused looked again at katarina who gave another tiny nod clearing his throat he began fingering a cellophaned cigar one of a trio of davidoffs sharing pocket space with a white silk handkerchief the fact that we have gotten involved should tell you something alex he said his smile was gone whats that henry dr de bosch both dr de bosches are held in extremely high esteem by westerns medical community are so the old man was still alive i see i said yes indeed the color had risen in his cheeks and his usual glibness had given way to something tentative shaky he removed the cigar from his pocket and held it between his index fingers from the corner of my eye i saw katarina watching me neither of them spoke i felt as if the next line was mine and id flubbed it high esteem said bork finally sounding more tense i wondered what was bugging him then remembered a rumor of a few years ago doctors dining room gossip the kind i tried to avoid a bork problem child the youngest of four daughters a teenaged chronic truant with learning disorders and a tendency toward sexual experimentation sent away two or three summers ago hushhush for some kind of livein remediation the family tightlipped with humiliation one of borks many detractors had told the story with relish the de bosch institute and corrective school bork was watching me the look on his face told me i shouldnt push it any further of course i said it sounded hollow katarina de bosch frowned but it made bork smile again yes he said so obviously were eager for this conference to take place expeditiously i hope you and dr de bosch will enjoy working together will i be working with both drs de bosch my father isnt well said katarina as if i should have known it he had a stroke last winter sorry to hear that she stood smoothed her skirt with brief flogging movements and picked up her attaché in the chair shed seemed tall willowy but upright she was only five two or three maybe ninetyfive bony pounds her legs were short and her feet pointed out the skirt hung an inch below her knees in fact i need to get back to take care of him she said walk me back to my car dr delaware and ill give you details on the conference bork winced at her imperiousness then looked at me with some of that same desperation thinking of what he was going through with his daughter i stood and said sure he put the cigar in his mouth splendid he said thank you alex she said henry without looking at him and stomped toward the door he rushed from behind his desk and managed to get to it soon enough to hold it open for her he was a politician and a hack a skilled physician whod lost interest in healing and had lost sight of the human factor in the coming years he never acknowledged my empathy of that afternoon never displayed any gratitude or particular graciousness to me if anything he became increasingly hostile and obstructive and i came to dislike him intensely but i never regretted what id done the moment we were out the door she said youre a behaviorist arent you eclectic i said whatever works including behavior therapy she smirked and began walking very fast swinging the attaché in a wide dangerous arc through the crowded hospital corridor neither of us talked on the way to the glass doors that fronted the building she moved her short legs furiously intent upon maintaining a halfstep advantage when we reached the entrance she stopped gripped the attaché with both hands and waited until i held one of the doors open just as shed done with bork i pictured her growing up with servants her car was parked right in front in the no stopping ambulance zone a brandnew buick big and heavy black with a silver vinyl top buffed shiny as a generals boot a hospital security guard was standing watch over it when he saw her approaching he touched his hat another door held open i half expected to hear a bugle burst as she slid into the drivers seat she started the car with a sharp twist and i stood there looking at her through a closed window she ignored me gunned the engine finally looked at me and raised an eyebrow as if surprised i was still there the window lowered electrically yes we were supposed to discuss details i said the details she said are ill do everything dont worry about it dont complicate things and it will all fall into place all right my throat got very tight she put the car into drive yes maam i said but before the second word was out shed roared off i went back into the hospital got coffee from a machine near the admittance desk and took it up to my office trying to forget about what had happened and determined to focus myself on the days challenges later seated at my desk charting the mornings rounds my hand slipped and some of the coffee spilled on the blue brochure i didnt hear from her again until a week before the conference when she sent a starchily phrased letter inquiring if i cared to deliver a paper i called and declined and she sounded relieved but it would be nice if you at least welcomed the attendees she said would it yes she hung up i did show up on the first day to offer brief words of welcome and unable to escape graciously remained on stage for the entire morning with the other cochair harvey rosenblatt the psychiatrist from new york trying to feign interest as katarina strode to the podium wondering if id see another side of her softened for public consumption not that there was much of a public attendance was thin maybe seventy or eighty therapists and graduate students in an auditorium that seated four hundred she introduced herself by name and title then read a prepared speech in a strident monotone she favored complex meandering sentences that lost meaning by the second or third twist and soon the audience was looking glazed but she didnt seem to care didnt seem to be talking to anyone but herself reminiscing about her fathers glory days such as they were anticipating the symposium id taken the time to review andres de boschs collected writings and i hadnt raised my opinion of him his prose style was clear but his theories about child rearing the good lovebad love spectrum of maternal involvement that his daughter had used to title the conference seemed nothing more than extensions and recombinations of other peoples work a little anna freud here a little melanie klein there tossed with croutons of winnicott jung harry stack sullivan bruno bettelheim he leavened the obvious with clinical anecdotes about the children hed treated at his school managed to work both his vienna pilgrimage and his war experiences into his summaries name dropping and adopting the overly casual manner of one truly selfimpressed emperors new clothes and the audience at the conference didnt show any great excitement but from the rapt look on faithful daughters face she thought it was cashmere by the second day attendance was down by half and even the speakers on the dais three labased analysts looked unhappy to be there i might have felt sorry for katarina but she seemed unaware of it all continuing to flash slides of her father darkhaired and goateed in healthier days working at a big carved desk surrounded by talismans and books drawing in crayon with a young patient writing in the brandied light of a tiffany lamp then another batch posing with his arm around hereven as a teenager shed looked old and they could have been lovers followed by shots of a blanketswaddled old man sunk low in an electric wheelchair positioned atop a high brown bluff behind him the ocean was beautiful and blue mocking his senescence a sad variation upon the homemovie trap the few remaining attendees looked away in embarrassment harvey rosenblatt seemed especially pained i saw him shade his eyes and study some scribbled notes that hed already read from a tall shambling graybearded fellow in his forties he struck up a conversation with me as we waited for the afternoon session to begin his warmth seemed more than just therapeutic veneer unusually forthcoming for an analyst he talked easily about his practice in midmanhattan his twentyyear marriage to a psychologist and the joys and challenges of raising three children the youngest was a fifteenyearold boy whom hed brought with him hes back at the hotel he said watching movies on paytv probably the dirty ones right i promised to get back in an hour and take him out to disneyland do you have any idea how late theyre open during the winter i think only till six or so oh he frowned guess well have to do that tomorrow hopefully josh can deal with it does he like arcade games i said does a duck quack why dont you try the santa monica pier its open late okay that sounds good thanks do they have good hot dogs by any chance i know they have hot dogs but i cant vouch for them being gourmet he smiled josh is a hot dog connoisseur alex he puffed his cheeks and smoothed his beard too bad about disneyland i hate to disappoint him challenges of parenthood huh i said he smiled hes a sweet kid i brought him with me hoping to turn it into a semivacation for both of us i try to do that with each of them when theyre old enough its hard to reconcile working with other peoples kids when you cant find time for your own you have any i shook my head its an education believe me worth more than ten years of school do you treat only children i said half and half actually i find myself doing less and less child work as time goes on whys that to be honest kid works just too nonverbal for me three hours in a row of play therapy makes my eyes cross narcissistic i know but i figure im not doing them much good if im fading away my wife on the other hand doesnt mind shes a real artist with it great mom too we walked to the cafeteria had coffee and donuts and chatted for a while about other places he could take his son as we headed back to the auditorium i asked him about his connection to the de bosches andres was my teacher he said in england i did a fellowship eleven years ago at southwick hospital near manchester child psychiatry and pediatric neurology id toyed with the idea of working for the government and i wanted to see how the brits ran their system neurology i said didnt know de bosch was interested in the organic side of things he wasnt southwick was heavily biological still is but andres was their token analyst kind of a he smiled i was about to say throwback but that wouldnt be kind its not as if he was some sort of relic quite vital actually a gadfly to the hardwire boys and dont we all need gadflies we entered the conference room ten minutes until the next speech and the place was nearly empty was it a good year i said after we were seated the fellowship sure i got to do lots of longterm depth work with kids from poor and workingclass families and andres was a wonderful teacher great at communicating his knowledge i thought its not genetic i said he is a clear writer rosenblatt nodded crossed his legs and looked around the deserted auditorium hows child analysis accepted here he said its not used much i said we deal mostly with kids with serious physical illnesses so the emphasis is on shortterm treatment pain control family counseling compliance with treatment not much tolerance for delayed gratification not much do you find that satisfying as an analyst im not an analyst oh he blushed around his beard i guess i assumed you were then howd you get involved in the conference katarina de boschs powers of persuasion he smiled she can be a real ballbreaker cant she when i knew her back in england she was just a kid fourteen or fifteen but even then she had a forceful personality she used to attend our graduate seminars spoke up as if she was a peer daddys girl very much so fourteen or fifteen i said so shes only twentyfive or six he thought for a moment thats about right she seems older yes she does he said as if coming up with an insight she has an old soul as the chinese say is she married he shook his head there was a time i thought she might be gay but i dont think so more likely asexual i said the temptation to think oedipally is darn near irresistible harvey for girls its elektra he said wagging a finger with amusement get your complexes straight she drives one too what her cars an electra a big buick he laughed there you go now if that doesnt convert you to fervid belief in freud i dont know what will anna freud never married either did she i said neither did melanie klein what a neurotic pattern he said still chuckling just presenting the data harvey draw your own conclusions well my daughters damned boy crazy so i wouldnt get ready to publish just yet he turned serious though im sure the impact of such a powerful paternal he stopped talking i followed his gaze and saw katarina heading toward us from the left side of the auditorium carrying a clipboard and marching forward while looking at her watch when she reached us rosenblatt stood katarina hows everything going there was guilt in his voice hed make a very bad liar fine harvey she said looking down at her board youre up in two minutes might as well take your place on stage i never saw either of them again and the events of that autumn soon faded from memory sparked briefly the following january by a newspaper obituary of andres de bosch cause of death was suicide by overdose prescription tranquilizers the eightyyearold analyst was described as despondent due to ill health his professional achievements were listed in loving inflated detail and i knew whod provided them now years later another spark good lovebad love de boschs term for mothering gone bad the psychic damage inflicted when a trusted figure betrays the innocent so donald dell wallace probably wasnt behind it someone else had picked me because of the conference someone with a long festering memory of what some transgression committed by de bosch in the name of de boschian therapy my cochairmanship made me seem like a disciple but that was my only link some kind of grievance was it even real or just a delusion a psychotic sitting at the conference listening boiling i thought back to the seventy strangers in the auditorium a collective blur and why had becky basilles murderer howled bad love another madman katarina might have the answer but she hadnt had much use for me back in seventynine and there was no reason to believe shed talk to me now unless shed gotten a tape too and was frightened i punched information there was no santa barbara listing for either the de bosch institute or the corrective school neither was there an office number for katarina de bosch phd before the operator could get away i asked her to check for a home number zilch i hung up and pulled out the latest american psychological association directory nothing there either retrieving some older volumes i finally found katarinas most recent entry five years ago but the address and number were those of the santa barbara school on the off chance the phone company had messed up i called a woman answered taco bonanza metallic clatter and shouts nearly drowned her out i cut the connection and sat at my desk stroking the top of the bulldogs head and gazing at the coffee stain on the brochure wondering how and when enlightenment had given way to enchiladas harvey rosenblatt half past one made it fourthirty in new york i got the number for nyus med school and asked for the department of psychiatry after a couple of minutes on hold i was informed that there was no dr harvey rosenblatt on either the permanent or the parttime clinical staff we do have a leonard rosenblatt said the secretary his office is out in new rochelle and a shirley rosenblatt in manhattan on east sixtyfifth street is shirley an md or a phd um one second a phd shes a clinical psychologist but no harvey no sir do you have any old rosters on hand lists of staff members whove retired there may be something like that somewhere sir but i really dont have the time to search now if youll could i have dr shirley rosenblatts number please one moment i copied it down called manhattan information for a listing on harvey rosenblatt md learned there was none and dialed shirley phds

reach him id appreciate your passing along my number i recited the ten digits and put the phone back in its cradle the mail came a half hour later nothing out of the ordinary but when i heard it drop into the bin my hands had clenched i went down to feed the fish and when i got back the phone was ringing the operator at my service said this is joan dr delaware are you free theres someone on the line about a dog sounds like a kid sure a second later a thin young voice said hello hi this is dr delaware um this is karen alnord my dog got lost and you said in the paper that you found a bulldog yes i did hes a little french bulldog oh mines a boxer dejected sorry this ones not a boxer karen oh i just thought you know sometimes people think theyre bulldogs i can see the resemblance i said the

i took him to the veterinarian oh um okay thank you sir whered you lose your dog karen near my house we have a gate but somebody left it open and he got out im really sorry hope you find him i will

i hope your bulldog finds his owner that reminded me that i hadnt yet called the kennel club information gave me the number in new york and another one in north carolina both answered with recorded messages and told me business hours were over tomorrow i told the bulldog hed been observing me maintaining that curious cocked head stance the fact that someone was probably grieving for him bothered me but i didnt know what else to do other than take good care of him that meant food water shelter a walk when it got cool enough a walk meant a leash he and i took a drive to a pet store in south westwood and i bought a lead more dog food biscuits in various flavors and a couple of nylon bones the salesman assured me were excellent for chewing when we returned it seemed temperate enough for a stroll if we stayed in the shade the dog stood still tail wagging rapidly while i put the leash on the two of us explored the glen for half an hour hugging the brush walking against traffic like regular guys when i got back i called my service joan said theres just one from a mrs rodriguez hold on thats your board theres someone ringing in right now i waited a moment and then she said ive got a mr silk on the line says he wants to make an appointment thanks put him on click dr delaware silence hello nothing mr silk no answer just as i was about to hang up and redial the service a low sound came through the receiver mumbles no laughter a deep throaty giggle huh huh huh who is this i said huh huh huh gloating i said nothing huh huh huh the line went dead i got the operator back on the line joan that guy who just called did he leave anything other than his name no he just asked if you treated adults as well as children and i said hed have to speak to you about that and his name was silk as in the fabric thats what i heard why doctor is something wrong he didnt say anything just laughed well thats kind of crazy but thats your business isnt it doctor evelyn rodriguez answered on the first ring when she heard my voice hers went dead hows everything i said fine i know its a hassle for you but i would like to see the girls yeah its a hassle she said driving all the way out there how about if i come out to you no answer mrs rodriguez youd do that i would whats the catch no catch id just like to make this whole thing as easy as possible for you why to show donald dell wallace i cant be intimidated to help the girls uhhuh theyre paying for your time right his bunch a heathens the judge made donald dell responsible for the costs of the evaluation mrs rodriguez but as we talked about the first time that doesnt obligate me to him in any way uhhuh has that been a problem for you i said the fact that hes paying she said nothing for a moment then bet youre charging plenty im charging my usual fee i said realizing i sounded like a watergate witness bet it includes your driving time and all door to door just like the lawyers yes it does good she said stretching the word then you can drive instead of me drive slow keep your meter running and make them devils pay angry laughter i said when can i come out how bout right now theyre running around like wild injuns maybe you can settle em down how about you drive out here right this minute and see em you ready for that i can probably be there in fortyfive minutes whenever well be right here were not taking any vacations to honolulu she hung up before i could ask for directions i looked up her address in my case file the ten thousand block of mcvine terrace in sunland and matched it to my thomas map setting the dog up with water food and a bone i left not at all unhappy about running up the iron priests tab the freeway deposited me in a scramble of northbound traffic just beginning to clot facing hills so smogged they were no more than shrouded gray lumps on the horizon i did the la stopandgo boogie for a while listening to music and trying to be patient finally made it to the east then the and cruised into the high desert northeast of the city picking up speed as both the road and the air got clearer exiting at sunland i hooked north again and got onto a commercial stretch of foothill boulevard that ran parallel to the mountains auto parts barns body shops unfinished furniture outlets and more roofers than id ever seen in one area i spotted mcvine a few minutes later and turned left the street was narrow with grass growing down to the curb instead of sidewalks and planted haphazardly with eucalyptus and willow the curb grass was dry and yellow the houses behind it were small and low some of them no more than trailers on raised foundations the rodriguez residence was on a northwest corner a boxcar of mocha stucco with a gutterless black composition roof and a flat porchless face broken by three metalsashed windows one of the windows was blocked by a tilting sheet of lattice the squares were broken in spots warped in others and a few dead branches wormed around them a high pink block wall enveloped the rear of the property i got out and walked up a hardpack lawn stippled with blemishlike patches of some sort of lowgrowing succulent and split by a footworn rut evelyns plumcolored chevy was parked to the left of the pathway next to a red halfton pickup with two stickers on the bumper one sang the praises of the raiders the other dared me to keep kids off drugs a stickon sign on the door said r and r masonry i pressed the bell and a waspbuzz sounded a woman opened the door and looked at me through the smoke vining upward from a freshly lit virginia slim in her late twenties five seven and lanky she had dirty blond hair gathered in a high streaked ponytail and pale skin slanted dark eyes and broad cheekbones gave her a slavic look the rest of her features were sharp beginning to pinch her shape was perfect for the hardbody era sinewy arms high breasts straightedge tummy long legs leading up to flaring hips just a little wider than a boys she wore skintight lowriding jeans and a babyblue sleeveless midriff top that showcased an apostrophe of a navel some obstetrician should have been mighty proud of her feet were bare one of them tapped arrhythmically you the doctor she said in a husky voice talking around the cigarette just the way id seen evelyn rodriguez do dr delaware i said and extended my hand she took it and smiled amusement rather than friendliness gave a hard squeeze then dropped it im bonnie theyre waiting for you cmon in the living room was half the width of the boxcar and smelled like a drowned cigar carpeted in olive shag and paneled with knotty pine it was darkened by drawn drapes a long brown corduroy sofa ran along the back wall above it hung a bornagain fish symbol to the left was a console tv topped with some sort of cable decoder and a vcr and a beige velveteen recliner on a hexagonal table an ashtray brimmed over with butts the other half of the front space was a kitchendining area combo between the two rooms was an ochrecolored door bonnie pushed it open letting in a lot of bright western light and took me down a short shagged hall at the end was a den walled in grayish mock birch and backed by sliding glass doors that looked out to the backyard more recliners another tv porcelain figurines on the mantel below three mounted rifles bonnie slid open a glass door the yard was a small flat square of scorched grass surrounded by the high pink walls an avocado tree grew at the rear huge and twisted barely out of its shade was an inflatable swimming pool oval and bluer than anyones heaven chondra sat in it splashing herself without enthusiasm tiffani was in a corner of the property back to us jumping rope evelyn rodriguez sat between them in a folding chair working on her lanyard and smoking she had on white shorts a dark blue tshirt and rubber beach sandals on the grass next to her was her purse bonnie said hey and all three of them looked up i waved the girls stared evelyn said go get him a chair bonnie raised her eyebrows and went back into the house putting some wiggle in her walk evelyn shaded her face looked at her watch and smiled fortytwo minutes couldnt ya have stopped for coffee or something i forced a chuckle course she said dont really matter what you actually do you can always say you done it right just like a lawyer you can say anything you please she stubbed her cigarette out on the grass i went over to the pool chondra returned my hi with a small silent smile some teeth this time progress tiffani said you write your book yet not yet i need more information from you she nodded gravely i got lots of truth we dont want to ever see him she grabbed hold of a branch and started swinging humming something i said have fun but she didnt answer bonnie came out with a folded chair i went and took it from her she winked and went back into the house rear twitching violently evelyn wrinkled her nose and said well does it i unfolded the chair does it what does it matter what actually happens youre just gonna do what you want to write what you want to anyway right i sat down next to her positioning myself so i could see the girls chondra was motionless in the pool gazing at the trunk of the avocado evelyn humphed you ready to come out chondra shook her head and began splashing herself again doing it slowly as if it were a chore her white pigtails were soaked the color of old brass above the pink walls the sky was static and blue bottomed by a sootcolored cloud bank that hid the horizon someone in the neighborhood was barbecuing and a mixture of scorching fat and lighter fluid spread its cheerful toxin through the autumn heat you dont think ill be honest huh i said been burned by other doctors or is it something about me she turned toward me slowly and put her lanyard in her lap i think you do your job and go home she said just like everyone else i think you do whats best for you just like everyone else fair enough i said im not going to sit here and tell you im some saint whod work for free or that i really know what youve been going through cause i dont thank god but i think i understand your rage if someone had done it to my child id be ready to kill him no question about it she took her winstons out of her pocket and knocked a cigarette loose sliding it out and taking it between two fingers she said oh you would would you well that would be revenge and the bible says revenge is a negational action she lit up with a pink disposable lighter inhaled very deeply and held it when she let the smoke out her nostrils twitched tiffani began jumping very fast i wondered if we were within her earshot evelyn shook her head gonna break her head one of these days lots of energy i said apple dont fall far ruthanne was like that she smoked nodded and started to cry letting her tears drip down her face and wiping them with short furious movements her torso pushed forward and for a moment i thought she was going to leave ruthanne was just like that when she was little always moving i never felt i could she had spirit she was she had wonderful spirit she tugged her shorts down and sniffed want some coffee sure wait right here she went into the house hey girls i called out tiffani kept jumping chondra looked up her mouth hung slightly open and water droplets bubbled her forehead like oversized sweat i went over to her swim a lot she gave a very small nod and splashed one arm turning away and facing the avocado tree young fruit hung from the branches veiled by a cloud of whiteflies some of it was blackened with disease tiffani waved at me then she began to chant in a loud voice i went to the chinese restaurant to get a loaf of bread bread bread a man was there with a big mustache and this is what he said said said el eye el eye chicholo beauty pompom cutie evelyn came back holding a couple of mugs bonnie marched behind her carrying a small plate of sugar wafers the look on her face said shed been created for better things i walked back to the lawn chairs bonnie said here you go handed me the plate and sashayed off evelyn gave me a mug black or cream black we sat and sipped i balanced the cookie plate on my lap have one she said or are you one of those healthfood types i took a wafer and chewed on it lemonflavored and slightly stale i dunno she said maybe i shoulda been a health fooder too i always gave my kids sugar and stuff whatever they wanted maybe i shouldnta got a boy went awol over in germany two years ago dont even know where he is the baby dont know zero about what she wants to do with her life and ruthie she shook her head and looked over at tiffani watch your head on that branch you bonnies the baby i said nod she got all the brains and the looks just like her daddy he coulda been a movie star only time i ever went gaga for the looks and boy what a mistake that was she gave a full smile he cleaned me out thirteen months after we were married left me with the baby in diapers and went down to louisiana to work the deepsea rigs got killed soon after in a fall that they said was an accident never took out the right insurance for himself so i got nothing she smiled wider he had a temper on him all my men do roddys got a fuse on him too though it takes a while to get it lit hes a mexican but hes the best of the lot she patted the tshirt pocket that held the cigarette pack sugar and bad tempers and cancer sticks i really go for all the good things in life huh her eyes watered again she lit up all the good things she said all the blessed good things she kept the cigarette in her mouth busied her hands by squeezing them together letting go repeating the motion the lanyard lay on the grass neglected theres no room for your guilt i said she yanked the cigarette out of her mouth and stared at me whatd you say theres no room for your guilt all the guilt belongs to donald dell one hundred percent of it she started to say something but stopped i said no one else should carry that burden evelyn not ruthanne for going with him that night and certainly not you for the way you raised her junk food had nothing to do with what happened neither did anything but donald dells impulses its his cross to bear now her eyes were on me but wavering i said hes a bad guy he does bad things no one knows why and now youre having to be a mom all over again when you werent planning on it and youre going to do it without complaining too much and youre going to do your best no ones going to pay you or give you any credit so at least give yourself some you talk sweet she said telling me what i want to hear wary but not angry sounds like you got a temper on you too i talk straight for my own sake youre right about that all of us do what we thinks best for us and i do like to make money i went to school a long time to learn what i do im worth a high fee so i charge it but i also like to sleep well at night me too so what she smoked coughed ground out the cigarette with disgust been a long time since i slept peacefully takes time yeah how long i dont know evelyn least youre honest smile maybe what about the girls i said how do they sleep not good she said how could they the little one wakes complaining shes hungry which is a laugh cause she eats all day though you wouldnt know it to look at her would you i used to be like that believe it or not squeezing her thigh she gets up two three times a night wanting hersheys and licorice and ice cream does she ever get those things hel heck no theres a limit i give her a piece of orange or something maybe a half a cookie and send her right back not that it stops her the next time what about chondra she dont get up but i hear her crying in her bed under the blanket she looked over at the older girl who was sitting motionless in the center of the pool shes the soft one soft as jelly she sighed and looked down at her coffee with disdain instant shoulda made real stuff its fine i said and drank to prove it its okay but its not great dont see great around here too often my second husband brians dad owned a big place up near fresno table grapes and alfalfa some quarter horses we lived up there for a few years that was close to great all that space then he went back to his drinking brian senior and it all went to straight down the tubes ruthie used to love that place especially the horses theres riding stables around here too out in shadow hills but its expensive we always said wed get over there but we never did the sun dropped behind the cloud bank and the yard dimmed whatre you gonna do to us she said to you whats your plan id like to help you if you wanna help them keep them away from him thats all hes a devil tiffani called him an instrument of satan i told her that she said defiantly you see something wrong with that not at all its my faith it props me up and he is one howd ruthanne meet him her shoulders dropped she was waitressin at a place out in tujunga okay it was a bar he and his bunch hung out there she went out with him for months before tellin me then she brought him home and the first look i got i said no no no my experiences i can spot a bad apple like that snap of fingers i warned her but that didnt do no good maybe i gave up too easy i dont know i was havin problems of my own and ruthie didnt think i had a single intelligent thing to say to her she lit another cigarette and took several hard fast drags she was stubborn that was her only real sin i drank more coffee nothing to say anymore doc or am i boring you she flicked ashes onto the dirt id rather listen and they pay you all that money for that good racket you got there beats honest labor i said she smiled first friendly one id seen stubborn she said she smoked and sighed and called out five more minutes then into the house for homework both a you the girls ignored her she kept looking at them drifted off as if shed forgotten i was there but then she turned and looked at me so mr easy listener what do you want from me and my little girls same question shed asked me the first time she met me i said enough time to find out exactly how theyve been affected by their moms death how do you think theyve been affected they loved their mama theyre crushed to dirt i need to get specific for the court what do you mean i need to list symptoms that prove theyre suffering psychologically you gonna say theyre crazy no nothing like that ill talk about symptoms of anxiety like the sleep problems changes in appetite things that make them vulnerable to seeing him otherwise theyre going to get swept up in the system some of it you can tell me but ill also need to hear things directly from them wont that mess them up more talking about it no i said just the opposite keeping things inside is more likely to create problems she gave a skeptical look i dont see them talkin to you much so far i need time with them need to build up their trust she thought about that so what do we do just sit here jawing we could start with a history you telling me as much as you remember about what they were like as babies anything else you think might be important a history huh she took a deep drag as if trying to suck maximum poison out of the cigarette so now weve got a history yeah ive got plenty to tell you why dont you get out a pencil and start writing she talked as the sky darkened further letting the girls play on as she recounted nightmares and weeping spells the terrors of orphanhood at fivethirty bonnie came out and switched on floodlights that turned the yard sallow it stilled her mothers voice and evelyn stood and told the girls go in the house you right after they did a man came out rubbing his hands together and sniffing the air five three or so in his late fifties or early sixties low waisted dark skinned and weak chinned with long tattooed arms bowlegs gave him a tottering walk his eyes were shadowed by thick gray thatches and a drooping ironcolored zapata mustache obscured his mouth his bushy gray hair was slicked straight back he wore a khaki workshirt and blue jeans with handrolled cuffs his hands were caked with plaster and he rubbed them more vigorously as he approached evelyn saluted him he returned the gesture and looked at me stretching to stand taller this heres that doctor she said we been having a nice talk he nodded the shirt was embroidered with a white oval tag that said roddy in red script up close i saw that his face was severely pockmarked a couple of crescentshaped scars ran down his chin i held out a hand he looked at his palm gave an embarrassed smile and said dirty his voice was soft and hoarse i put my hand down he smiled again and saluted me dr delaware roddy pleased to meetchu boyle heights accent as he lowered his fingers i noticed tattooed letters across the knuckles love homemade job on the other hand was the inevitable hate in the fold between his thumb and forefinger was a crude blue crucifix next to that a tiny redeyed spider climbed a tiny web above the legend nr he put his hands in his pockets hows your day evelyn asked him she looked as if she wanted to touch him okay he sniffed hungry yeah i could eat the tattooed hands emerged and rubbed together gotta wash up sure patron he went into the house well she told me id better get into the kitchen guess its too late for you to talk to them but you can come back tomorrow great we walked inside chondra and tiffani were on the sofa in the rear den watching cartoons on tv a cat was being cheerfully decapitated tiffani held the remote control bye girls glazed eyes say bye to the doctor the girls looked up small waves and smiles im leaving now i said ill be coming out here tomorrow maybe we can get a chance to talk see you said tiffani she nudged her sister chondra said bye evelyn was gone i found her out in the kitchen pulling something out of the freezer rodriguez was stretched back in the velveteen recliner eyes closed a beer in his hand see you tomorrow i said one sec evelyn came over the package in her hand was a diet frozen entree enchilada fiesta better be the day after i forgot theres some things i got to do okay same time sure she looked at the frozen package and shook her head how bout new york steak she called out to her husband yeah he said without opening his eyes he likes his steak she said quietly for a fella his size hes a real meat eater she followed me all the way out to the front lawn looked at the tv dinner in her hand no one likes this one maybe ill have it i hit bad traffic on the western end of the and by the time i pulled into the carport it was after seven when i got in the house the dog greeted me but he had his head down and looked subdued i smelled the reason first then saw it on the service porch floor near the door oh i said he drooped lower my mistake for locking you in i rubbed his neck and he gave me a grateful lick then trotted over to the fridge lets not push things bucko i cleaned up the mess reflecting on the responsibilities of pet fosterparenthood and phoned in for messages wondering if anyone had responded to my ad no one had nothing from shirley rosenblatt phd either or mr silk the operator gave me a few business calls i decided to put the tape out of my mind but the childs chant stayed there and i couldnt sit still i fed the dog and was contemplating what to do about my own dinner when milo called at eightten no prints on the tape except yours any mail problems today he sounded tired no but i did get a call i told him about the giggling man silk huh well thats a pisser what is sounds like youve got a nutcase on your hands you dont think its serious pause most of these guys are cowards like to stay in the background but to be honest alex who knows i said i think i may have found what bad love means and filled him in about the symposium seventynine he said nut with a real long memory think thats a bad sign i lets put our heads together and hash it out you eat yet nope im over in palms got to finish up a few things i could meet you at that place on ocean in about half an hour dont think id better i said left my guest alone too long already what guest oh him why cant you leave him is he lonely and depressed its more of a gastrointestinal issue i said rubbing the dog behind the ears he just ate and will be needing easy ingress and egress ingr oh fun well get a dog door alex then get a life a dog door means sawing a hole hes only a shortterm lodger suit yourself fine i said ill put a door in robin wants a dog anyway how about you bring one over ill install it and then we can go out where the hell am i gonna find a dog door at this hour youre the detective slam he arrived at ninefifteen pulling an unmarked ford into the carport his tie was loose he looked wilted and he carried two bags one from a pet store the other from a chinese restaurant the dog came up and nuzzled his cuffs and he gave the animal a grudging pat and said ingress and egress removing a metal and plastic contraption from the pet store bag he handed it to me seeing as i dont feel like manual labor before dinner and the handy resident of this household is out of town i figured wed better do takeout he went over to the fridge dog following watching his slow trudge i said you look wiped new blood buckets he got a grolsch opened it and nodded armed robbery what i was working on in palms little momandpop grocery pop died a few months ago moms eighty barely hanging on two little shits came in this afternoon flashed knives and threatened to rape her and cut off her breasts if she didnt hand over the cashbox old lady puts them at around thirteen or fourteen shes too shook to say much else chest pains shortness of breath they admitted her to st johns for observation poor thing thirteen or fourteen yeah the timing of the robbery might mean the little assholes waited till after school to do it hows that for your extracurricular activities or maybe theyre just your basic truant psychopaths out for a fun day urban huck and tom i said sure smoke a corncob of crack gangbang becky thatcher he sat down at the table and sniffed the top of the beer bottle the dog had remained at the refrigerator and was looking at him as if contemplating approach but milos tone and expression stilled him and he came over and settled at my feet i said so no one elses prints were on the tape not a one what does that mean someone took the trouble to wipe it clean or handled it with gloves or there were prints and they got smeared when you touched the tape he stretched his legs so show me this brochure you found i went to the library got the conference program and gave it to him he scanned it no one named silk here maybe he was in the audience you look intense he said pointing to my photo that beard kind of rabbinic actually i was bored i told him how id become a cochair he put down his bottle nineteen seventynine someone carrying around a grudge all this time or something happened recently that triggered a recollection from seventynine i tried calling katarina and rosenblatt to see if maybe theyd gotten anything in the mail but shes closed up shop in santa barbara and hes no longer practicing in manhattan i found a psychologist in new york who may be his wife and left her a message he examined the brochure again so what could the grudge be about i have no idea milo maybe its not even the conference maybe its someone who sees himself as victimized by the therapist or the therapy maybe the grievance isnt even real something paranoid a delusion that would never occur to you or me meaning were normal everythings relative he smiled so you cant remember anything weird happening at the conference nothing at all this de bosch was he controversial in any way the kind to make enemies not that i know but my only contact with him was through his writings theyre not controversial what about the daughter i thought about that yeah she could have made enemies a real sourpuss but if shes the target of someones resentment why would i be my only link to her was the conference he waved the brochure reading this someone could believe you were esteemed colleagues she hemmed you in huh expertly she had clout with the medical director of the hospital my guess was that it was because shed treated one of his daughters a kid with problems and called in a marker but it could have been something else completely he put his beer bottle down on the coffee table the dog looked up then lowered his chin to the floor the kids voice on the tape i said how does that figure in and the guy who killed becky basille hewitt dorsey hewitt yeah i know what does he have to do with it maybe he was treated by the de bosches too maybe bad love was a phrase they used in therapy but what does that mean a whole slew of therapy graduates freaking out getting back at their doctors wait a second said milo im sorry about your tape and your nutcall but thats a far cry from murder he handed the brochure back to me wonder if donald wallace was ever treated by the de bosches still waiting for more info from the prison howre those girls doing the kinds of problems youd expect documenting a good case against visitation shouldnt be a problem the grandmothers opening up a bit too i went out to the house this afternoon her latest husband looks like a retired cholo lots of homemade tattoos i described rodriguezs skin art dealing with the elite he said you and me both he crossed his legs and glanced down at the dog cmere rove the dog ignored him good dog he said and drank his beer he left at tenthirty i decided to put off installing the dog door till the next day robin called at tenfifty and told me shed decided definitely to come home early tomorrow evening at nine i wrote down her flight number and said id be at lax to pick her up told her i loved her and went to sleep i was dreaming about something pleasantly sexual when the dog woke me just after three in the morning growling and pawing the dust ruffle i groaned my eyes felt glued shut he pawed some more what silence scratch scratch i sat up what is it he did the oldmanchoking bit ingress and egress cursing myself for not installing the door i forced myself out of bed and made my way blindly through the dark house to the kitchen when i opened the service porch door the dog raced down the stairs i waited yawning and groggy muttering make it fast instead of stopping to squat near the bushes he kept going and was soon out of sight ah exploring new ground i forced one eye to stay open cool air blew in through the door i looked outside couldnt see him in the darkness when he didnt return after a minute or so i went down to get him it took a while to find him but i finally did sitting near the carport as if guarding the seville huffing and moving his head from side to side what is it guy pant pant he moved his head faster but didnt budge his body i looked around some more still unable to see much the mixed smells of nightblooming plants hit my nose and the first spray of dew moistened my skin the night sky was hazy just a hint of moonlight peeking through just enough to turn the dogs eyes yellow hound of the basketballs i said remembering an old mad magazine sketch the dog scratched the ground and sniffed started turning his head from side to side what he began walking toward the pond stopping several feet from the fence just as he had during our first encounter then he came to a dead halt the gate was closed it had been hours since the timed lights had shut off i could hear the waterfall peering over the fence i caught a glimpse of moonstreaked wetness as my eyes started to accommodate i looked back at the dog still as a rock did you hear something head cock probably a cat or a possum pal or maybe a coyote which might be a little too much for you no offense head cock pant he pawed the ground listen i appreciate your watchfulness but can we go back up now he stared at me yawned gave a low growl im bushed too i said and headed for the stairs he did nothing until id gotten all the way up then raced up with a swiftness that belied his bulk no more interruptions okay he wagged his stub cheerfully jumped on the bed and sprawled across robins side too exhausted to argue i left him there he was snoring long before i was wednesday morning i assessed my life crank letters and calls but i could handle that if it didnt accelerate and my true love returning from the wilds of oakland a balance i could live with the dog licking my face belonged in the plus column too i supposed when i let him out he disappeared again and stayed out this time hed gotten closer to the gate stopping only a couple of feet from the latch i pushed it open and he took another step then he stopped stout body angling forward his little frog face was tilted upward at me something had caused it to screw up the eyes narrowing to slits i anthropomorphized it as conflict struggling to get over his water phobia canine selfhelp hampered by the lifesaving training some devoted owner had given him he growled and jutted his head toward the gate looking angry wrong guess something near the pond bothering him the growls grew louder i looked over the fence and saw it one of my koi a red and white kohaku the largest and prettiest of the surviving babies was lying on the moss near the waters edge a jumper damn sometimes it happened or maybe a cat or coyote had gotten in and thats what hed heard but the body didnt look torn up i opened the gate and went in the bulldog stepped up to the gatepost and waited as i kneeled to inspect the fish it had been torn but no fourlegged predator had done it something was sticking out of its mouth a twig thin stiff a single shriveled red leaf still attached a branch from the dwarf maple id planted last winter i glanced over at the tree saw where the bough had been cut off the wound oxidized almost black clean cut hours old a knife i forced my eyes back to the carp the branch had been jammed down its gullet and forced down through its body like a spit it exited near the anus through a ragged hole ripping through beautiful skin and letting loose a rush of entrails and blood that stained the moss creamgray and rusty brown i filled with anger and disgust other details began to leap out at me painful as spattering grease a spray of scales littering the moss indentations that might have been footprints i took a closer look at them to my untrained eye they remained characterless gouges leaves beneath the maple where the branch had been sheared the fishs dead eyes stared up at me the dog was growling i joined in and we did a duet i dug a grave for the fish the sky was alpine clear and the beauty of the morning was a mockery of my task i thought of another beautiful sky katarina de boschs slide show azure heavens draping her fathers wheelchaired form good lovebad love definitely more than just a sick joke now flies were divebombing the kois torn corpse i nudged the body into the hole and shoveled dirt over it as the bulldog watched should have taken you more seriously last night he cocked his head and blinked brown eyes gentle the dirt over the grave was a small umber disc that i tamped with my foot after taking one last look i dragged myself up to the house feeling like a dependent child i called milo he wasnt in and i sat at my desk baffled and angry someone had trespassed on my property someone had watched me the blue brochure was on my desk my name and photo the perfect logic of trumpedup evidence reading this someone could believe you were esteemed colleagues i phoned my service still no callback from shirley rosenblatt phd maybe she wasnt harveys wife i tried her number again got the same recorded message and slammed down the phone in disgust my hand started to close around the brochure crumpling it then my eyes dropped to the bottom of the page and i stopped and smoothed the stiff paper other names the three other speakers wilbert harrison md facp practicing psychoanalyst beverly hills california grant p stoumen md facp practicing psychoanalyst beverly hills california mitchell a lerner msw acsw psychoanalytic therapist north hollywood california harrison chubby around fifty fair and jolly looking with darkrimmed glasses stoumen older bald and prune faced with a waxed white mustache lerner the youngest of the three afroed and turtlenecked full bearded like rosenblatt and myself i had no memory beyond that the topics of their papers meant nothing to me id sat up on the dais mind wandering angry about being there three locals i opened the phone book neither harrison nor lerner was in there but grant p stoumen md still had an office on north bedford drive beverly hills couch row a service operator answered beverly hills psychiatric this is joan same service i used same voice id just spoken to its dr delaware joan hi dr delaware fancy talking to you so soon small world i said yeah no actually it happens all the time we handle lots of psych docs who in the group are you trying to reach dr stoumen dr stoumen her voice lowered but hes gone from the group from uh from life dr delaware he died six months ago didnt you hear no i said i didnt know him oh well it was really pretty sad so unexpected even though he was pretty old what did he die of a car accident last may i think it was out of town i forget exactly where he was at some kind of convention and got run over by a car isnt that terrible a convention you know one of those medical meetings he was a nice man too never lost patience the way some of the nervous laugh scratch that comment dr d anyway if youre calling about a patient dr stoumens were divided up among the rest of the doctors in the group and i cant be sure which one took the one youre calling about how many doctors are in the group carney langenbaum and wolf langenbaums on vacation but the other two are in town take your pick any recommendations well another nervous laugh theyre both all right wolf tends to be a little better about returning calls wolfll be fine is that a him or a her a him stanley wolf md hes in session right now ill put a message on his board to call you thanks a lot joan sure bet dr d have a nice day i installed the dog door making slow progress because i kept pausing between saw swings and hammer blows convinced id heard footsteps in the house or unwarranted noise out on the terrace a couple of times i actually went down to the garden and looked around hands clenched the grave was a dark ellipse of dirt dried fish scales and a slick graybrown stain marked the pond bank i went back up did some touchup painting around the door frame cleaned up and had a beer the dog tried his new passageway ingressing and egressing several times and enjoying himself finally tired and panting he fell asleep at my feet i thought about whod want to scare me or hurt me the dead fish stayed in my head a cognitive stench and i remained wideawake at eleven he awoke and raced for the front door a moment later the mail chute filled standardsized envelopes that i sorted through one had a folsom pob return address and an elevendigit serial number handprinted above it in red ink inside was a single sheet of ruled notebook paper printed in the same red doctor a delaware phd dear dr delaware phd i am writing to you to express my feelings about seeing my daughters namely chondra wallace and tiffani wallace as their natural father and legal guardian whatever was done to our family including done by myself and no matter how bad is in my opinion water under the bridge and such as it is i should not be denied permission and my paternity rights to see my lawful legal daughters chondra wallace and tiffani wallace i have never done anything to hurt them and have always worked hard to support them even when this was hard i dont have any other children and need to see them for us to have a family children need their fathers as im sure i dont have to tell a trained doctor like yourself one day i will be out of incarceration i am their father and will be taking care of them chondra wallace and tiffani wallace need me please pay attention to these facts yours sincerely donald dell wallace i filed the letter in the thick folder next to the coroners report on ruthanne milo called at noon and i told him about the fish makes it more than a prank doesnt it pause more than i expected donald dell knows my address i just got a letter from him saying what one day hell be out and wanting to be a fulltime dad so i shouldnt deny him his rights now subtle threat could you prove it no he could have gotten your address through his lawyer youre reviewing his claim so hed be entitled to it legally incidentally according to my sources he doesnt have an audio recorder in his cell tv and vcr yes cruel and unusual so what do i do let me come over and check out your pond notice any footprints or obvious evidence there were some prints i said though they didnt look like much to my amateur eyes maybe theres some other evidence that i wasnt sophisticated enough to spot i was careful not to disturb anything oh hell i buried the fish was that a screwup dont worry about it its not like were gonna do an autopsy he sounded uneasy whats the matter i said nothing ill come by and have a look as soon as i can probably the afternoon he spoke the last words tentatively almost turning the statement into a question i said what is it milo what it is is that i cant do any fullcourt press for you on this killing a fish just isnt a major felony at the most weve got trespassing and malicious mischief i understand i can probably take some footprint molds myself he said for what its worth look i said i still dont consider it a federal case this is cowardly bullshit whoevers behind it probably doesnt want a confrontation probably not he said but he still sounded troubled and that started to rattle me something else i said though its also probably no big deal i was looking at the conference brochure again and tried to contact the three local therapists who gave speeches two werent listed but the one who was had been killed this past spring hit by a car while attending a psychiatric symposium i found out because his answering service just happens to be the same one i use and the operator told me killed here in la out of town she didnt remember where ive got a call in to one of his associates symposium he said curse of the conference like i said its probably nothing the only thing that is starting to bug me is i cant reach anyone associated with the de bosch meeting then again its been a long time people move yeah milo youre bugged about something what is it pause i think given everything thats been happening putting it all together youd be justified getting a little watchful no paranoia just be extra careful fine i said robins coming home early tonight im picking her up at the airport what do i tell her tell her the truth shes a tough kid some welcome home what time are you picking her up nine ill get over well before then and well put our heads together you want i can stay at the house while youre gone just feed me and water me and tell rover not to make demands rovers a hero as far as im concerned hes the one who heard the intruder yeah but there was no followthrough alex instead of eating the sucker he just stood around and watched what youve got is a fourlegged bureaucrat thats cold i said didnt you ever watch lassie screw that my thing was godzilla theres a useful pet by three no one had returned my calls and i felt like a cartoon man on a desert island i did paperwork and looked out the window a lot at threethirty the dog and i hazarded a walk around the glen and when i arrived back home there were no signs of intrusion shortly after four milo arrived looking hurried and bothered when the dog came up to him he paid no mind he held an audiocassette in one hand his vinyl attaché case in the other instead of making his usual beeline to the kitchen he went into the living room and loosened his tie putting the case on the coffee table he handed me the tape the originals in my file this is your copy seeing it brought back the screams and the chants that child i put it in my desk and we went down to the pond where i showed him the footprints he kneeled and inspected for a long time stood frowning youre right these are useless looks to me like someone took the time to mess them up he checked around the pond area some more taking his time getting his pants dirty nope nothing here worth a damn sorry that same troubled tone in his voice that id heard over the phone he was holding back something but i knew it was useless to probe back in the living room i said something to drink later he opened the vinyl case and took out a brown plastic box removing a videocassette from it he bounced it against one thigh the tape was unmarked but the box was printed with the call letters of a local tv station rubberstamped diagonally across the label was the legend property lapd evidence rm and a serial number dorsey hewitts last stand he said definitely not for prime time but theres something i want you to check out if your stomach can take it ill cope we went into the library before inserting the cartridge into the vcr he peered into the machines load slot whens the last time you lubricated this never i said i hardly use it except to record sessions when the court wants visuals he sighed slid the cartridge in picked up the remote control pressed play and stood back watching the monitor with his hands folded across his waist the dog jumped up on a big leather chair settled and regarded him the screen went from black to bright blue and a hiss filtered through the speakers a half minute more of blue then the tv station logo flashed over a digital date two months old another few moments of video stutter were followed by a long shot of an attractive onestory brick building with a central arch leading to a courtyard and woodgrilled windows tile roof brown door to the right of the arch close up on a sign los angeles county mental health center westside swing back to a long shot two small darkgarbed figures crouched on opposite sides of the arch toylike gi joe figurines holding rifles a side shot revealed police barriers fencing the street no sound other than static but the dogs ears had perked and pitched forward milo raised the volume and a soup of incomprehensible background speech could be heard above the white noise nothing for a few seconds then one of the dark figures moved still squatting and repositioned itself to the left of the door another figure came from around a corner and lowered itself to a deep crouch both hands on its weapon a closeup inflated the new arrival turning dark cloth into navy blue revealing the bulk of protective vesting white letters spelling out lapd across a broad back combat boots blue ski mask revealing only eyes i thought of munich terrorists and knew something bad was going to happen but nothing did for the next few moments the dogs ears were still stiff and his breathing had quickened milo rubbed one shoe with another and ran his hand over his face then the brown door on the screen swung open on two people a man bearded longhaired scrawny the beard a matted frenzy of blond and gray corkscrews above a blemished knotted forehead his hair haloed in spiky clumps recalling a childs clumsily drawn sun the camera moved in on him highlighting dirty flesh sunken cheeks bloodshot eyes so wide and bulging they threatened to shoot off the shaggy launchpad of his face he was naked from the waist up and sweating furiously the wild eyes began rotating madly never blinking never settling his mouth was agape like a dental patients but no sound issued forth he appeared to be toothless his left arm was clamped around a heavy black woman imbedded so tightly in her soft skirted waist that the fingers disappeared the skirt was green over it the woman wore a white blouse that had come partially untucked she was around thirtyfive and her face was wet too perspiration and tears her teeth were visible lips stretched back in a rictus of horror the mans right arm was a bony yoke around her neck something silvery flashed in his hand as he pressed it up against her throat she closed her eyes and kept them clenched the man was leaning her back pressing her to him convexing her neck and revealing the full breadth of a big shiny carving knife redstained hands redstained blade only her heels touched the pavement she was off balance an unwilling dancer the man blinked darted his eyes and looked at one of the swat cops several rifles were aimed at him no one moved the woman trembled and the collaring hand moved involuntarily and brought forth a small red mark from her neck the blotch stood out like a ruby she opened her eyes and stared straight ahead the man screamed something to her shook her and they closed again the camera stayed on the two of them then shifted smoothly to another of the swat men no one moved the dog was standing on the chair breathing hard the bearded mans knife elbow quivered the man closed his mouth opened it looked to be screaming at the top of his lungs but the sound wasnt carrying the womans mouth was still open her wound had already coagulated just a nick the man propelled her onto the sidewalk very slowly one of her shoes came off he didnt notice it was looking from side to side cop to cop screaming nonstop all at once the sound came on very loud new microphone the dog began barking the man with the knife screamed a howling hoarse and wet panting wordless pain scream my hands dug into my thighs milo faced the screen immobile the bearded man shifted his head from side to side some more faster harder as if being slapped screaming louder pressing the knife up under the womans chin her eyes shot open the dogs barks turned to growls guttural and bearish loud enough to be scary and a lot more threatening than the warning sounds hed uttered last night the man with the knife was directing his screams at a swat man to his left haranguing wordlessly as if the two of them were friends turned hateful the cop might have said something because the madman upped his volume roaring shrieking the man backed away hugging the woman more tightly concealing his face behind hers as he dragged her into the doorway then a smile and a short sharp twist of his wrist another spot of blood larger than the first formed on the womans throat she raised her hands reflexively trying to bend out from under the knife losing her balance and stumbling her weight and the movement surprised the man and for one brief moment as he tried to keep her upright and haul her backward he lowered his right arm a quick sharp sound like a single handclap and a red dot appeared on the mans right cheek he spread his arms another dot materialized just left of the first one the woman fell to the pavement as a rain of gunfire sounded corn popping in an echo chamber the mans hair blew back his chest burst and the front of his face turned into something amoebic and rosy a pink and white kaleidoscope that seemed to unfold as it imploded the hostage was facedown fetal bloodspray showered down on her the man now faceless slumped and sagged but he remained on his feet for one hellish second a goretopped scarecrow still gripping the knife as red juice poured out of his head he had to be dead but he continued to stand bending at the knees his ruined head shadowing the hostages shoulder then all at once he let go of the knife and collapsed falling on the woman limp as a blanket she twisted and struck out at him finally freed herself and managed to rise to her knees sobbing and covering her head with her hands policemen ran to her one of the dead mans bare feet was touching her leg she didnt notice it but a cop did and kicked it away another officer still skimasked stood over the faceless corpse legs spread gun pointed the screen went black then bright blue the dog was barking again loud and insistent i made a shushing sound he looked at me cocked his head stared at me confused i went over to him and patted his back his back muscles were jumping and drool trickled from his flews its okay fella my voice sounded false and my hands were cold the dog licked one of them and looked up at me its okay i repeated milo rewound the tape his jaw was bunched how long had the scene lasted a few minutes i felt as if id aged watching it i stroked the dog some more milo stared at the numbers on the vcrs counter its him isnt it i said hewitt screaming on my tape him or a good imitation whos the poor woman another social worker at the center adeline potthurst she just happened to be sitting at the wrong desk when he ran out after killing becky how is she physically shes okay minor lacerations emotionally he shrugged she took disability leave refused to talk to me or anyone else he ran a hand along the edge of a bookshelf grazing book spines and toys howd you figure it out i said hewitt on the bad love tape im not sure what i figured actually he shrugged his forelock cast a hatbrim shadow over his brow and in the weak light of the library his green eyes were drab the tape ejected milo put it on an end table and sat down the dog waddled over to him and this time milo looked pleased to see him rubbing the animals thick neck he said when i first heard your tape something about it bugged me reminded me of something but i didnt know what it was so i didnt say anything to you i figured it was probably bad love hewitts using the phrase my reading about it in the clinic directors witness report had you watched the video before he nodded but at the station with half an ear a bunch of other detectives sitting around cheering when hewitt bit it splatters never been my thing i was filling out forms doing paperwork when you told me about the tape it still didnt trigger but i wasnt that bugged i figured what you did a bad joke the phone call and the fish make it more than a joke dont they the phone call by itself is stupidity like you said cowardly shit someone coming on your property in the middle of the night and killing something is more all of it put together is more how much more i dont know but id rather be a little paranoid than get taken by surprise after we spoke on the phone this afternoon i really wracked my brains about what was bothering me went back into the basille files found the video and watched it and realized it wasnt the phrase that i remembered it was the screams someone had stuck hewitts screams on your little gift he pulled his wet hand away from the dogs maw looked at it wiped it on his jacket whered the video come from i said tv stations raw footage he nodded how much of it was actually broadcast not much at all this tv station has a twentyfourhour crimewatch van with a scanner anything for the ratings right they got to the scene first and were the only ones to actually record the whole thing their total footage is ten minutes or so mostly noaction standoff before hewitt comes out with adeline what you just saw is thirtyfive seconds thats all it seemed a lot longer seemed like a goddamn eternity but thats what it was the part that actually made it to the six oclock news was nine seconds five of hewitt with adeline three of rambo closeups on the swat guys and one second of hewitt down no blood no screaming no standing dead man wouldnt sell deodorant i said pushing the image of the teetering corpse out of my head why was the sound off for most of it technical difficulties yup loose cable on their parabolic mike the sound man caught it midway through what did the other stations broadcast postmortem analysis by the department mouthpiece so if the screams on my tape were lifted the source had to be this particular piece of footage looks that way meaning what mr silks an employee of the tv station or a spouse kid lover pal significant other whatever if you give me your patient list i can try to get hold of the stations personnel records and crosscheck be better if you give me the personnel list i said let me check it against my patients so i can preserve confidentiality fine another list you might try to get is the one for your bad love conference anyone who attended it was a long time ago but maybe the hospital keeps records ill call tomorrow he got up and touched his throat now im thirsty we went into the kitchen opened beers and sat at the table drinking and brooding the dog positioned himself between us licking his lips milo said he doesnt get to go for the gusto teetotaler i got up and slid the water bowl over the dog ignored it bullshit he wants hops and malt said milo looks like hes closed a few taverns in his day theres a marketing opportunity for you i said brew a hearty lager for quadrupeds though im not sure you could set your criteria too high for a species that imbibes out of the toilet he laughed i managed a smile both of us trying to forget the videotape and everything else theres another possibility i said maybe hewitts voice wasnt lifted from the video footage maybe he was taped simultaneously by someone at the mental health center someone who happened to have a recorder handy the day of the murder and switched it on during the standoff thered probably be machines lying around the center for therapy youre saying theres a therapist behind this i was thinking more of a patient some paranoids make a fetish of keeping records ive seen some lug tape recorders around with them someone whod been bearing a grudge since seventynine could very well be highly paranoid he thought about that nutcase with a pocket sony huh someone you once treated who ended up at the mental health center or just someone who remembered me from the conference and ended up at the center someone tying me in with bad love whatever it means to him probably anger at bad therapy or therapy he perceived as bad de boschs theory has to do with bad mothers letting their kids down betrayal if you think of therapists as surrogate parents the stretch isnt hard to make he put down his bottle and looked at the ceiling so weve got a nut one of your old patients gone downhill cant afford private treatment so hes getting county help happens to be at the center the day hewitt freaks out and butchers becky recorder in his pocket keeping tabs on all the people talking behind his back he hears the screams presses record i guess its possible anythings possible in this city if were dealing with someone whos been stewing for a long time witnessing becky basilles murder and the swat scene could have set him off hearing hewitt screaming about bad love could have done it too if hed had experiences with de bosch or a de boschian therapist he rolled the bottle between his palms maybe but two nuts with a bad love fixation just happening to show up at the same place on the same day is too damned cute for my taste mine too i said he drank some more what if it wasnt a coincidence at all milo what if hewitt and the taper knew each other even shared a common rage about bad love de bosch therapists in general if the mental health centers typical its a crowded place patients waiting for hours it wouldnt be that strange for two disturbed people to get together and discover a mutual resentment would it if they were paranoid to begin with they could have played upon each others fears and delusions confirming for each other that the way they saw the world was valid the taper might even be someone who wouldnt have been violent under different circumstances but seeing hewitt murder his therapist and then seeing hewitts face blown off could have pushed him over so now hes ready to do his own therapist so whats the tape and the call and the fish preparing the scene or maybe he wont go any further i dont know and something else i might not even be his only target he might have a current therapist whos in danger any idea who it could be from your patient list no thats the thing theres no one who fits but my patients were all kids lots can happen over time he sat back in his chair and looked up at the ceiling speaking of kids he said where does the kids voice fit in with your twonut scenario i dont know dammit maybe the tapers got a kid or hes abducted one god i hope not but that voice stank of coercion didnt it so flat did hewitt have any children nope the report has him as unmarried unemployed uneverything be good to know who he hung out with at the center we could also try to verify that my tape was taken from the video footage because if it wasnt we wouldnt have to bother crossreferencing the station personnel list he smiled and you wouldnt have to expose your patient list right right that would be a major betrayal i still cant justify it youre sure its not any of them no im not sure but what am i going to do call hundreds of people and ask them if theyve grown up to be hatecrazed nuts no mr silk in your past huh only silk i know is in my ties one thing i can tell you your tapes not an exact lift off the video the footage has hewitt screaming for just over twentyseven seconds out of the thirtyfive and your segment only lasts sixteen i had a brief go at it before i came over here tried running both tapes simultaneously on two machines to see if i could pick out any segments that coincided exactly i couldnt it was tricky going from machine to machine onoff onoff trying to synchronize and its not like were dealing with words here doesnt take long before all the screaming starts to sound the same what about doing some kind of voiceprint analysis trying to get an electronic match from what i know you need actual words for a match and the department doesnt do voiceprints anymore why not probably not enough call what theyre useful for mostly is kidnapping ransom calls and thats usually the fbis game also phone scams bunco stuff which is low priority with all the buckets of blood i think one guy at the sheriffs is still doing them ill find out the dog finally put his head in the bowl and began slurping water milo lifted his bottle said cheers and emptied it why dont you and i try a little bit of lowtech teamwork right now i said you take audio ill take video and ill be in screamland afore ye he took the portable tapedeck into the library and loaded the video we sat across from one another listening to screams trying to shut out the context even with two people it was difficult hard to divide the howls into discrete segments we played and rewound doing it over and over trying to locate the sixteen seconds of the bad love tape amid the pain and noise of the longer video segment the dog tolerated only a minute or so before scooting out of the room milo and i stayed and sweated after half an hour a triumph of sorts a discrepancy a second or two of singsong wordless jabber at the tail end of my tape that didnt materialize anywhere on the soundtrack of the video ya ya ya the screamer lowering his volume just a bit a barely discernible shift not much longer than an eyeblink but once i pointed it out it mushroomed as obvious as a billboard two separate taping sessions i said as stunned as milo looked has to be otherwise why would the shorter tape have something on it thats missing from the longer segment yeah he said quietly and i knew he was angry at himself for not catching it first he sprang to his feet and paced looked at his timex whend you say you were going to the airport nine if youre comfortable leaving the place unguarded i could go get something done sure i said rising what talk to the clinic director about hewitts social life he collected his things and we walked to the door okay im off he said got the porsche and the cellular so you can always reach me if you need to thanks for everything milo whatre friends for ugly answers flashed in my head but i kept them to myself just as i was preparing to head out for lax dr stanley wolf returned my call he sounded middleaged and spoke softly and hesitantly as if doubting his own credibility i thanked him and said id called about dr grant stoumen yes i got the message he asked several tortuous questions about my credentials then were you a student of grants no we never met oh what do you need to know im being harassed by someone dr wolf and i thought dr stoumen might be able to shed some light on it harassed annoying mail phone calls it may be linked to a conference i cochaired several years ago dr stoumen delivered a paper there a conference i dont understand a symposium on the work of andres de bosch entitled good lovebad love the term bad love was used in the harassment how long ago was this seventynine de bosch the child analyst did you know him no child analysis is outside of my purview did dr stoumen ever talk about de bosch or this particular conference not to my recollection nor did he mention any annoying mail maybe annoying is too mild i said its fairly nasty stuff uhhm he didnt sound convinced i said last night it went a little further someone trespassed on my property i have a fish pond they took a fish out killed it and left it for me to see hmm how bizarre and you think this symposiums the link i dont know but its all ive got so far im trying to contact anyone who appeared on the dais to see if theyve been harassed so far everyone ive tried to reach has moved out of town do you happen to know a psychiatrist named wilbert harrison or a social worker named mitchell lerner no they also delivered papers the cochairs were de boschs daughter katarina and a new york analyst named harvey rosenblatt i see well as i mentioned im not a child analyst and unfortunately grants no longer with us so im afraid where did his accident take place seattle he said with sudden strength in his voice at a conference as a matter of fact and it wasnt a simple accident it was a hitandrun grant was heading out for a latenight walk he stepped off the curb in front of his hotel and was struck down im sorry yes it was terrible what was the topic of the conference something to do with child welfare the northwest symposium on child welfare i believe grant was always an advocate for children terrible i said and this was in may early june grant was on in years his eyesight and hearing werent too good we prefer to think he never saw it or heard it coming how old was he eightynine was he still in practice a few old patients stopped by from time to time and he kept an office in the suite and insisted on paying his share of the rent but mostly he traveled art exhibitions concerts and conferences his age made him a contemporary of andres de bosch i said did he ever mention him if he did i dont recall it grant knew lots of people he was in practice for almost sixty years did he treat especially disturbed or violent patients you know i cant discuss his cases dr delaware im not asking about specific cases just the general tenor of his practice the little that i saw was pretty conventional children with adjustment problems okay thanks is there anyone else who could talk to me about him just dr langenbaum and he knows about as much as i do did dr stoumen leave a widow his wife died several years ago and they had no children now i really do have to get going thanks for your time dr wolf yes hmm good luck on working this through i got my car keys left a lot of lights on in the house and turned on the stereo to loud jazz the dog was sleeping noisily on his towel bed but he roused himself and followed me to the door stay and guard the home front i said and he harrumphed stared for a moment finally sat down i walked out closed the door listened for a protest and when i didnt hear any went down to the carport the night had cooled massaged by sea current the waterfall seemed deafening and i drove away listening to it diminish as i coasted down toward the glen a sense of dread dropped over me dark and smothering like a condemned mans hood i paused at the bottom of the road looking at black treetops and slate sky a faint bit of light from a distant house blinked through the foliage like an earthbound star no way to gauge its distance i had no real neighbors because an acrewide strip of county land unbuildable due to a quirky water table cut through this section of the glen mine was the only buildable site on the plot plan years ago the isolation had been just what i wanted now a nosy streetmate didnt seem half bad a car sped down the glen from the north appearing suddenly around a blind curve going too fast its engine flatulent with power i tensed as it passed took another look backward and hooked right toward the sunset onramp of the south by the time i got on the freeway i was thinking of robins smile and pretending nothing else mattered slow night at the airport cabbies circled the terminals and skycaps looked at their watches i found a space in the passenger loading zone and managed to stay there until robin came out toting her carryon i kissed her and hugged her took the suitcase and put it in the trunk of the seville a man in a hawaiian shirt was looking at her over cigarette smoke so were a couple of kids with backpacks and surfer hair she had on a black silk tshirt and black jeans and over that a purple and red kimonotype shirt tied around her waist the jeans were tucked into black boots with tooled silver toes her hair was loose and longer than ever well past her shoulder blades the auburn curls bronzed by the light from the baggage claim area her skin gleamed and her dark eyes were clear and peaceful it had been five days since id seen her but it seemed like a long separation she touched my cheek and smiled i leaned in for a longer kiss whoa she said when we stopped ill go away more often not necessary i said sometimes there is gain without pain she laughed and hugged me and put her arm around my waist i held the door open as she got in the car the man in the hawaiian shirt had turned his back on us as i drove away she put her hand on my knee and looked over at the back seat wheres the dog guarding hearth and home how was your talk fine plus i may have sold that archtop guitar i did last summer the one joey shah defaulted on i met a jazz musician from dublin who wants it great i said you put a lot of time into that one five hundred hours but whos counting she stifled a yawn and put her head on my shoulder i drove all the way to sunset before she woke up shaking her curls boy must have hit me all of a sudden sitting up she blinked at the streets of bel air home sweet home she said softly i waited until shed roused herself before telling her the bad news she took it well okay she said i guess it goes with the territory maybe we should move out for a while and stay at the shop move out at least till you know whats going on i thought of her studio separated from the mean streets of venice by a thin veneer of white windows and locks saws and drills and wood shavings on the ground floor the sleeping loft in which wed made love so many times thanks i said but i cant stay away indefinitely the house needs maintenance not to mention the fish thatre left that sounded trivial but she said that poor fish and you worked so hard to keep them alive she touched my cheek welcome home i said glumly dont worry about that alex lets just figure out how to deal with this stupidity until its resolved i dont want to put you in any danger maybe you should move to the shop and leave you alone in the middle of this i just want to make sure youre okay how okay do you think im going to be worrying every minute about you i mean the fish are wonderful alex but you can hire someone to feed them hire someone to look after the whole house for that matter pack up the wagons and head out whats wrong with being a little cautious honey i dont know it just seems awfully drastic all thats really happened is malicious mischief so why were you so upset when you told me about it sorry i didnt want to upset you of course it upsets me she said someone sending you weird tapes sneaking in and she put her arm around my shoulder the light changed to green and i turned left goes with the territory she repeated all those troubled people youve worked with over the years all that misdirected passion the surprising thing isnt that it happened its how long it took you never said it worried you it wasnt a matter of worry i didnt obsess on it just thought about it from time to time you never said anything what would have been the point i didnt want to upset you i lifted her hand from my shoulder and kissed it okay she said so we protect each other curly aint that what true loves all about i pulled up in front of the house no obvious signs of intrusion i said just let me check around for a sec before you get out oh really she said but she stayed in the car i gave the pond a quick inspection the fish moved with nighttime languor and none was missing i jogged up the stairs to the landing checked the front door peered in through the living room window something moved as the drapes parted the dogs face pressed against the glass wetting it i raised my hand in greeting he pawed the window i could hear the jazz through the redwood walls by the time i got back down robin was lifting her valise from the trunk when i tried to take it from her she said ive got it and headed for the steps as i unlocked the front door she said we could at least get an alarm everyone else has one never been a slave to fashion i said but when she didnt smile i added okay ill call a company tomorrow we walked in and almost tripped over the bulldog whod positioned himself on the welcome mat he stared from robin to me then back to her where he lingered with churchillian dignity robin said my god what i said he invented cute alex come here sweetie she bent down to his level with one hand extended palm down he trotted forward without hesitation jumped up put his paws on her shoulders and embarked on a lickfest ooh she laughed what a handsome boy you are what a cutielook at those muscles she stood wiping her face still laughing the dog continued to nuzzle and paw her legs his tongue was out and he was panting she placed a hand on my shoulder and gave me a grave look sorry alex there is now another man in my life bending she rubbed him behind the ears crushed i said placing a hand over my heart and you might reconsider he doesnt have gonads thems the breaks she said smiling look at that face also he snores so do you once in a while you never told me she shrugged i kick you and usually you stop well just look at you you little hunk apathys not your problem is it she knelt back down and got her face rebathed what a doll think of the ramifications on your social life i said meatloaf and kibble by candlelight she laughed again and roughed the dogs fur as the two of them played i picked up the suitcase and carried it into the bedroom checking rooms as i passed trying not to be obvious everything looked fine i took robins clothes out and arranged them on the bed when i got back she was on the leather couch the dogs head in her lap i know this is heartless alex but i hope his owner never calls how long legally do you have to run the ad im not sure theres got to be a limit right some sort of statute of limitations probably her smile disappeared with my luck someonell show up tomorrow and cart him off she covered another yawn the dog looked at her fascinated tired i said a little everything okay around here im sure you looked perfect ill get unpacked did it i said why dont you run a bath ill put your stuff away then join you thats sweet of you thanks she looked at the dog see he really is a nice guy our dr d how bout you you like baths too as a matter of fact he hates the water wont even get near it so its just you and me kid how machiavellian of you where does he sleep last night he slept in the bed tonight he moves back into the kitchen she pouted i shook my head uhuh no way oh cmon alex its just temporary do you want those eyes watching us watching us do what the crossword puzzle hell be lonely out there alex all of a sudden were into voyeurism im sure hes a gentleman and as you so unkindly pointed out he has no balls or no balls hes a nudist robin and hes got the hots for you the kitchen she tried a bigger pout i said put it out of your mind cruel she said heartless and cruel sounds like a law firm heartless cruel and horny think ill put em on retainer the dog posted himself at the bathroom door as robin stepped into the suds she soaped up and i picked him up and carried him grumbling to his towel bed the moment i put him down he tried to escape i closed the kitchen doors and gave him a milkbone and as he began chewing i snuck out he fussed for a while attempting a sonorous rendition of the oldmanchoking bit but i applied sound behavior theory principles and ignored him while trying to suppress my guilt after a minute or so he calmed down and soon i heard him snoring in twofour time when i got back robin looked at me reproachfully her hair was up and the waters soapy surface reached just below her nipples hes fine i got out of my clothes enjoying the slumber of the truly virtuous well she said putting her arms behind her head and watching i suppose its best forgiven i said sinking into the heat of the bath she contemplated breathed in smiled i dont know i kissed her she kissed back i touched one breast kissed a soapy nipple umm she said breaking away well well what you can forget mr cruel and mr heartless but i think its time to take a meeting with their partner whats his name thursday morning she was up and out of the shower by sixfifteen when i got to the kitchen i expected to see her dressed for work that restless look in her eyes but she was still in her robe drinking coffee and reading artforum shed set out food for the dog and only a few bits remained he was at her feet and looked up at me only briefly before returning his head to the side of her leg she put the magazine down and smiled up at me i kissed her and said you can get going ill be fine what if i just want to be with you that would be great of course if you have other plans nothing till the afternoon whats then patient appointment out in sun valley at threethirty making a house call i nodded custody case some resistance and i want to see the kids in their natural environment threethirty thats good we can hang out together till then terrific i poured myself a cup sat down and pointed to the magazine whats new in the art world the usual foolishness she closed it and pushed it aside actually i have no idea whats going on in the art world or anywhere else i cant concentrate alex woke up in the middle of the night thinking about everything thats been happening to you and that poor psychiatrist up in seattle do you really think there is a connection i dont know it was a hitandrun but he was eightynine and couldnt see or hear well like freud said sometimes a cigar is just a cigar did you get any sleep a bit was i snoring no would you tell me if i was yes she gave my hand a gentle cuff why didnt you wake me to talk i said you were deep asleep i didnt have the heart next time wake me we can talk right now if you want this whole things giving me very definite creeps the more i think about it im worried about you what will the next call or mail delivery bring milos looking into it i said well get to the bottom of it i took her hand and squeezed it she squeezed back hard you cant think of anyone whod want to get back at you out of all the patients youve known not really when i worked at the hospital i saw physically ill kids in practice it was basically normal children with adjustment problems the same kinds of patients grant stoumen had treated what about your legal cases all that custody garbage anythings possible theoretically i said but ive gone through my files and found nothing the conference has to be the link bad love what about that madman hewitt why was he shouting it i dont know i said she let go of my hand he killed his therapist alex guess i could switch careers but im really not good for anything else be serious okay what happened to becky basille is the extreme its a long way from tapes and a crank call and a mangled carp to murder the look on her face made me add ill be careful scouts honor ill call an alarm company get a referral from milo you wont consider moving out just for a while lets just see what happens over the next few days what are you waiting for alex things to get worse oh never mind lets not bicker she got up shaking her head and went to the coffeepot for a refill stayed there drinking and looking out the window honey im not trying to tough it out i said i just want to see what milo comes up with before i shake up our lives completely lets at least give him a day or two to look into it okay if he doesnt well move to the studio temporarily a day or two youve got a deal the dog padded over to her she smiled at him then at me maybe im overdoing it was the tape that bad bizarre i said like some kind of sick gag its the sick part that bothers me the dog snorted and jangled his collar she took some cheese out of the fridge told him to sit and rewarded his obedience with small bites he gobbled noisily and licked his flews what do you call this she said operant conditioning aplus i said next weeks topic is stress management she grinned the last bit of cheese disappeared amid the soft folds of the dogs mouth robin washed her hands the dog continued to sit and stare at her shouldnt we give him a name alex milo calls him rover figures ive stuck with hey you because i keep expecting someone to call and claim him true why get attached are you hungry i can dish something up why dont we go out go out like normal people sure ill go change the sparkle in her eyes made me say how about changing into something semifancy and we can hit the bel air the bel air what are we celebrating the new world order if only there was one what about him milkbone en le kitchen i said i dont have a suit that fits him she put on a silver crepe de chine blouse and a black skirt and i found a lightweight sportcoat brown turtleneck and khaki slacks that looked decent i told my service where id be and we took sunset to stone canyon road and drove up the half mile to the bel air hotel pinkshirted valets opened our doors and we walked across the covered bridge to the main entrance swans glided below in the still green pond cutting through the water with blissful ignorance a white lattice marriage canopy was being set up on the banks huge pine and eucalyptus umbrellaed the grounds airconditioning the morning we passed through the pink stucco arcade hung with blackandwhite photos of monarchs gone by the stone pathways had been freshly watered the ferns dripped dew and the azaleas were in bloom room service waiters rolled carts to sequestered suites an emaciated androgynous longhaired thing in brown velvet sweats walked past us unsteadily carrying the wall street journal under one atrophied arm death was in its eyes and robin bit her lip i held her arm tighter and we entered the dining room exchanged smiles with the hostess and were seated near the french doors several years ago soon after wed met wed lingered right here over dinner and seen bette davis through those same doors gliding across the patio in a long black gown and coronationquality diamonds looking as serene as the swans this morning the room was nearly empty and none of the faces had a measurable qrating though all looked well tended an arab in an ice cream suit drank tea alone at a corner table an elderly dewlapped couple who could have been pretenders to a minor throne whispered to each other and nibbled on toast in a big booth at the far end half a dozen dark suits sat listening to a crewcut whitehaired man in a red tshirt and khakis he was telling a joke gesturing expansively with an unlit cigar the other mens body language was half humble servant half iago we had coffee and took a long time deciding what to eat neither of us felt like talking after a few moments the silence began to feel like a luxury and i relaxed we finished a couple of fresh grapefruit juices and put in our breakfast order holding hands until the food came id just taken the first bite of my omelet when i spotted the hostess approaching two steps ahead of someone else a tall broad someone easily visible over her coiffure milos jacket was light blue a tint that clashed with his aqua shirt pigeongray pants and brownandbluestriped tie rounded off the ensemble he had his hands in his pockets and looked dangerous the hostess kept her distance from him clearly wanting to be somewhere else just before she reached our table he stepped ahead of her after kissing robin he took a chair from another table and pulled it up perpendicular to us will you be ordering sir said the hostess coffee yes sir she walked away hastily milo turned to robin welcome home you look gorgeous as ever thank you milo flight okay just fine every time im up in one of those things i wonder what gives us the right to break the law of gravity robin smiled to what do we owe the honor he ran his hand over his face has he told you about whats going on she nodded were thinking of moving into the shop until things clear up milo grunted and looked at the tablecloth the waiter brought the coffee and a place setting milo unfolded the napkin over his lap and drummed a spoon on the table as the coffee was being poured he glanced around the room lingering on the suits in the far booth meals and deals he said after the waiter left either showbiz or crime theres a difference i said his smile was immediate but very weak it seemed to torment his face theres a new complication he said this morning i decided to have a go at the computer tracking down any references to bad love in the case files i really didnt expect to find anything just trying to be thorough but i did two unsolved homicides one three years old the other five one beating one stabbing oh god said robin he covered her hand with his hate to spoil your breakfast kids but i wasnt sure when id be able to catch both of you service said you were here no no im glad you came she pushed her plate away and gripped milos hand who got killed i said does the name rodney shipler mean anything to you no is he a victim or a suspect victim what about myra paprock he spelled it i shook my head youre sure he said neither of them could have been old patients i repeated both names to myself no never heard of them how does bad love figure into their murders with shipler he was the beating it was scrawled on a wall at the crime scene with paprock im not sure what the connection is yet the computer just threw out bad love under miscellaneous factors no explanation did the same detectives work both cases he shook his head shipler was in southwest division paprock over in the valley far as i can tell the cases were never crossreferenced two years apart different parts of the city im going to try to get the actual case files this afternoon for what its worth i said i spoke to dr stoumens associate last night the accident was a hitandrun it happened in seattle in june of last year milos eyebrows rose it may have just been a hitandrun i said stoumen was almost ninety couldnt see or hear well someone ran into him as he stepped off a curb at a psych conference yes but unless shipler or paprock were therapists what link could there be dont know what they were yet the computer doesnt give out that level of detail robins head had dropped curls spilling onto the table she looked up clear eyed so what do we do well said milo you know im not mr impulsive but with everything weve got here nut mail nut call dead fish two coldcase homicides hazardous conferences he looked at me movings not a bad idea at least till we find out what the hells going on but i wouldnt go to the shop just in case whoevers bothering alex has done enough research on him to know the location she looked out the window and shook her head he patted her shoulder she said im fine lets just figure out where were going to live she looked around this place aint shabby too bad were not oil sheiks as a matter of fact said milo i think ive got an option for you private client of mine investment banker i moonlighted for last year hes in england for a year put his house up for rent and hired me to keep an eye on the premises its a nice size place and not that far from you beverly hills po off benedict canyon its still empty you know the real estate market and hes coming back in three months so he unlisted it im sure i can get his permission for you to use it benedict canyon robin smiled close to the sharon tate house not far but the place is as safe as youre gonna get the owners security conscious has a big art collection electric gates closedcircuit tv screaming siren alarm it sounded like prison i didnt say a thing the alarms hooked up to beverly hills pd he went on and their response times averaging two minutes maybe a little longer up in the hills but still damn good im not going to tell you its home chillun but for temporary lodgings you could do worse and this client of yours wont mind nah its a piece of cake thanks milo said robin youre a doll no big deal what do i do about my work can i go to the shop wouldnt hurt to avoid it for a few days at least until i find out more about these unsolveds she said i had orders piled up before i went to oakland milo the time i spent up there already set me back she grabbed her napkin and crushed it im sorry here you are getting threatened baby and im griping i took her hand and kissed it milo said in terms of work you could set up shop in the garage its a triple and theres only one car in it thats big enough said robin but i cant just pack up the table saw and the band saw and cart them over i may be able to help you with that too said milo an alternative i said would be moving to the studio and hiring a guard why take a chance said milo my philosophy is when trouble calls dont be there to answer the doorbell you can even take rover with owner keeps cats a friends taking care of them now but were not talking pristine environment sounds good i said but my throat had gone dry and a refugee numbness was rising up from my feet as long as were talking critters therere the rest of the koi the pond maintenance people can probably board them for a while time to get organized robin began folding her napkin over and over ending up with a small thick wad that she pressed between her hands her knuckles were ivory knobs and her lips were clamped together she gazed over my shoulder as if peering into an uncertain future the waiter came over with the coffeepot and milo waved him away from the big booth came the sound of male laughter the levity had probably been going on for a while but i heard it now because the three of us had stopped talking the arab got up from his table smoothed his suit put cash on the table and left the dining room robin said guess its time to hitch up the wagons but she didnt move this whole thing seems so unreal i said maybe itll turn out weve hassled for nothing milo said but you two are among the few humans i hold any positive regard for so i do feel an obligation to protect and serve he looked at our barely touched food and frowned thisll set you back some have some i pushed my plate toward him he shook his head the stress diet i said lets write a book and hit the talkshow circuit he followed us home in an unmarked ford when the three of us stepped into the house the dog thought it was a party and began jumping around take a valium rover said milo be nice to him said robin kneeling and holding her arms out the dog charged her and she tussled with him for a second then stood id better figure out what im going to need to take she left for the bedroom dog at heel true love said milo i said is there anything more you want to tell me you mean am i shielding her from gory details no didnt figure i should no of course not i said i just i guess i still want to protect her then youre doing the right thing by moving i didnt answer nothing to be ashamed of he said the protective instinct i keep my work out of ricks face he does the same for me if anything happened to her from the back of the house came robins footsteps rapid and intermittent pause and decision dull sounds as clothing hit the bed soft sweet words as she talked to the dog i paced some more circling trying to focus what to take what to leave looking at things i wouldnt be seeing for a while ring around the rosy he said now youre looking like me when im uptight i ran my hand over my face he laughed unbuttoned his jacket and pulled a notepad and pen out of an inner pocket he was wearing his revolver in a brown cowhide hip holster do you have any more details for me he said like about the psychiatrist stoumen just the approximate date early june and the fact that the conference was the northwest symposium on child welfare im pretty sure its sponsored by the child welfare league and they have an office here in town maybe you can pry an attendance roster out of them you have a go at the western pediatric roster yet no ill try right now i called the hospital and asked for the office of continuing education the secretary told me records of past symposia were only kept for one year i asked her to check anyway and she did nothing doctor therere no archives or anything archives with our budget problems were lucky to get bedpans doctor milo was listening in when i hung up he said okay scratch that onward im going to hook up with the fbis violent crime data bank and see if bad love shows up on any outoftown homicides what about dorsey hewitt i said could he have killed shipler and paprock let me try to find out if he was living in la during their murders im still trying to get hold of jean jeffers the clinic director see if hewitt had clinic buddies the taper i said you know that second session could have taken place the day of the murder someone taping hewitt right after he killed becky before he ran out and the tv mikes picked him up thats pretty damn cold almost premeditated same kind of mind who could turn a childs voice robotic what if the taper knew exactly what hewitt was going to do and was ready to tape him an accomplice or at least a knowing confederate someone who knew becky was going to die but didnt stop it he stared at me grimaced wrote something down said ready to start packing now it took an hour or so for robin and me to throw together suitcases plastic shopping bags and cardboard cartons a smaller collection than i would have expected milo and i carried all of it into the living room then i called my pond maintenance people and arranged for them to collect the fish when i returned to the pile milo and robin were staring at it she said im going to go over to the shop and get the small tools and the breakable things together if thats okay sure just be careful said milo anyone weird hanging around just turn around and come back weird this is venice were talking about relatively speaking gotcha she took the dog with her i walked her down to her truck and watched as they drove away milo and i had a couple of cokes then the doorbell rang and he went to get it after looking through the peephole he opened the door and let in three men boys really around nineteen or twenty they were thick faced and had power lifters rhino physiques two white one black one of the white ones was tall they wore perforated tank tops kneelength baggies in nauseating color combinations and black laceup boots that barely closed around their treestump calves the white boys had their hair cut very short except at the back where it fringed around their excessive shoulders the blacks head was shaved clean despite their bulk all three seemed awkward intimidated milo said morning campers this is dr delaware hes a psychologist so he knows how to read your minds doctor this is keenan chuck and delongpre they havent figured out what to do with their lives yet so they abuse themselves over at silvers gym and spend keenans money right boys the three of them smiled and cuffed one another through the open door i saw a black van parked near the carport jackedup suspension blackmatte reversed hubcaps darkened windows diamondshaped bulb of black plastic set into the side panel a skullandcrossbones decal just below that tasteful huh said milo tell dr delaware who recovered your wheels for you after a miscreant scumbag junkie made off with it because you left it on santa monica boulevard with the key in the ignition you did mr sturgis said the shorter white boy he had a crushed nose puffy lips a very deep voice and a slight lisp the confession seemed to relieve him and he gave a big grin one of his canines was missing and who didnt charge you his usual private fee because youd run out of trust fund that month keenan you didnt sir was that a gift no sir am i a chump shake of the thick head what did i demand in return boys slave labor they shouted in unison he nodded and rapped the back of one hand against the palm of the other payoff time all this stuff goes into the deathmobile the really heavy gears over in venice pacific avenue know where that is sure said keenan near muscle beach right very good follow me there and well see what youre made of once youre finished youll keep your mouths shut about it period understood yes sir and be careful with it pretend its bottles of liver shake or something we met up with robin and loaded her pickup watching her shop empty made her blink but she wiped her eyes quickly and said lets go we set up a caravan milo in the lead robin and the dog in the truck me in the seville the van trailing and headed back to sunset passing beverly glen as if it were someone elses neighborhood entering beverly hills and driving north onto benedict canyon milo turned off on a narrow road poorly paved and sided with eucalyptus a cheerless white iron gate appeared fifty feet up he slipped a card key into a slot and it opened the caravan continued up a steep pebbled drive hedged with very high columns of italian cypress that looked slightly motheaten then the road kinked and we descended another two or three hundred feet toward a shallow bowl of an unshaded lot maybe half an acre wide a low offwhite onestory house sat in the bowl a long straight concrete drive led to the front door as i got closer i saw that the entire property was hilltop the depression an artificial crater scalped from the tip canyon and mountain views surrounded the property lots of brown slopes and a few green spots flecked with the lint of occasional houses i wondered if mine could be seen from up here looked around but couldnt get my bearings the house was wide and free of detail roofed too heavily with deep brown aluminum tile supposed to simulate shake and windowed with aluminumcased rectangles a flattopped detached garage was separated from the main building by an unfenced paddle tennis court a tenfoot satellite dish perched atop it aimed at the cosmos a few cactus and yuccas grew near the house but that was it in terms of landscaping what could have been front lawn had been converted to concrete pad an empty terra cotta planter sat next to the coffeecolored double doors as i got out of the car i noticed the tv camera above the lintel the air was hot and smelled sterile i got out and went over to robins truck she smiled looks like a motel doesnt it long as the owners not named norman the black van dieseled as its ignition shut down the three beefboys exited and threw open the rear doors tarped machines filled the cabin the boys did some squats and grunts and began unloading milo said something to them then waved to us his jacket was off but he still wore his gun the heat had returned crazy weather i said robin got out and lifted the dog out of the pickup we walked to the front door and milo let us into the house the floor was white marble streaked with pink the furniture teakwood and ebony and bright blue velour the far wall was taken up by single light french doors all the others were covered with paintings hung frame to frame so that only scraps of white plaster were visible the doors looked out onto a yard encircled by a nearly invisible fence glass panes in thin iron frames a strip of sodgrass separated a cement patio from a long narrow lap pool the pool had been dug at the edge of the lot someone aiming for a mergewiththesky effect but the water was blue and the sky was gray and the whole thing ended up looking like an offbalance cubist sculpture the dog ran to the french doors and tapped the glass with his paws milo let him out and he squatted in the grass before returning make yourself right at home why dont you to us called london everythings set up therell be a token rent but you dont have to worry about it until he gets back we thanked him he dusted off one of the couches and i studied the art impressionist pictures that looked french and important nudged up against preraphaelite mythology syrupy orientalist harem scenes neighbored with english hunt paintings modern pieces too a mondrian a frank stella chevron a red grooms subway cartoon something amorphous fashioned out of neon the dining area was all maxfield parrish cobalt skies heavenly forests and beautiful blond boys lots of nude male statuary too a lamp whose black granite base was a limbless muscular torso venus de milo in drag a framed cover from the advocate commemorating the christopher street riot side by side with a paul cadmus drawing of a reclining adonis a framed arrow man shirt ad from an old issue of colliers kept company with a blackandwhite gelatin print of a paul newman lookalike in nothing but a gstring i felt less comfortable than i would have expected or maybe it was just the suddenness of the move milo brought us back to the door and demonstrated the closedcircuit surveillance system two cameras one in front the other panning the rear of the house two blackandwhite monitors mounted over the door one of them captured the three behemoths shlepping and swearing milo opened the door and shouted careful closing it he said what do you think great i said plenty of space thanks a lot beautiful view said robin really gorgeous we followed him into the kitchen and he opened the door of a subzero cooler empty except for a bottle of cooking sherry ill get you some provisions robin said dont worry i can take care of that whatever lets get you a bedroom youve got your choice of three he took us down a wide windowless hallway lined with prints a wall clock in a motherofpearl case read two thirtyfive in less than an hour i was expected in sunland robin read my mind your afternoon appointment what time said milo threethirty i said where wallaces motherinlaw im supposed to see the girls out there no reason not to go is there he thought for a moment none that i can see robin caught the hesitation why should there be a reason this particular case i said is potentially ugly two little girls their father killed their mother and now wants visitation thats absurd among other things the court asked me to evaluate and make a recommendation in the very beginning milo and i talked about the father possibly being behind the tape trying to intimidate me hes got a criminal record and hangs with an outlaw motorcycle gang thats been known to use strongarm tactics this creeps walking free no hes locked up in prison maximum security at folsom i just got a letter from him telling me hes a good father wonderful she said hes not behind this it was just a working guess until i learned about the bad love symposium my problems have something to do with de bosch she looked at milo he nodded all right she said taking hold of my jacket lapel and kissing my chin im going to stop being mama bear and go about my business i held her around the waist milo looked away ill be careful i said she put her head on my chest the dog began pawing the floor oedipus rover said milo robin pushed me away gently go help those poor little girls i took benedict into the valley and picked up the ventura freeway at van nuys boulevard traffic was hideous all the way to the and beyond and i didnt make it to mcvine until when i got to the rodriguez house no cars were parked in front and no one answered my ring evelyn showing her displeasure at my tardiness i tried again knocked once then harder and when that brought no response went around to the back managing to hoist myself up high enough to peer over the pink block wall i scanned the yard empty not a toy or a piece of furniture in sight the inflatable pool had been put away the garage was shut and drawn drapes blocked the rear windows returning to the front i checked the mailbox and found yesterdays and todays deliveries bulk stuff coupon giveaways and something from the gas company i put it back and looked up and down the street a boy of around ten zoomed by on rollerblade skates a few seconds later a red truck came speeding down from foothill and for an instant i thought it was roddy rodriguezs but as it passed i saw that it was lighter in shade than his and a decade newer a blond woman sat in the drivers seat a big yellow dog rode in the bed tongue out watchful i returned to the seville and waited for another twentyfive minutes but no one showed up i tried to recall the name of rodriguezs masonry company and finally did r and r driving back to foothill boulevard i headed east until i spotted a phone booth at an arco station the directory had been yanked off the chain so i called information and asked for r and rs address and phone number the operator ignored me and switched over to the automated message leaving me only the number i called it no one answered i tried information a second time and got a street address right on foothill about ten blocks east the place was a graytopped lot forty or fifty feet behind a shabby brown building surrounded by barbed link it had a green clapboard beer bar on one side a pawnshop on the other the property was empty except for a few brick fragments and some paper litter the brown building looked to have once been a double garage two sets of oldfashioned hinge doors took up most of the front above them ornate yellow letters shouted r and r masonry cement cinder and custom brick below that retaining walls our specialty followed by an overlapping rs logo meant to evoke rollsroyce fantasies i parked and got out no signs of life the padlock on the gate was the size of a baseball i went over to the pawnshop the door was locked and a sign above a red button said press and wait i obeyed and the door buzzed but didnt open i leaned in close to the window a man stood behind a nipplehigh counter shielded by a plexiglas window he ignored me i buzzed again he made a stabbing motion and the door gave i walked past cases filled with cameras cheap guitars cassette decks and boomboxes pocket knives and fishing rods the man was managing to examine a watch and check me over at the same time he was sixty or so with slicked dyedblack hair and a pumpkincolored bottle tan his face was long and baggy i cleared my throat he said yeah through the plastic and kept looking at the watch turning it over with nicotined fingers and working his lips as if preparing to spit the window was scratched and cloudy and outfitted with a tickettaker remote speaker that he hadnt switched on the store had soft wooden floors and stank of wd sulfur matches and body odor a sign over the gun display said no loonies im looking for roddy rodriguez next door i said have some work for him to do on a retaining wall he put the watch down and picked up another excuse me i said got something to buy or sell no i was just wondering if you knew when rodriguez was he turned his back on me and walked away through the plexiglas i saw an old desk full of papers and other timepieces a semiautomatic pistol served as a paperweight he scratched his butt and held the watch up to a fluorescent bulb i left and walked over to the bar two doors down the green board was rubbed to raw timber in spots and the front door was unmarked a sunshaped neon sign said sunnys sun valley a single window below it was filled with a budweiser sign i walked in expecting darkness billiard clicks and a cowboy jukebox instead i got bright lights zz top going on about a mexican whore and a nearly empty room not much larger than my kitchen no pool table no tables of any kind just a long pressedwood bar with a black vinyl bumper and matching stools some of them patched with duct tape up against the facing wall were a cigarette machine and a pocket comb dispenser the floor was grubby concrete the man working the bar was thirtyish fair balding stubbled he wore tinted eyeglasses and one of his ears was double pierced hosting a tiny gold stud and a white metal hoop he had on a soiled white apron over a black tshirt and his chest was flabby his arms were soft looking too white and tattooed he wasnt doing much when i came in and he continued along those lines two men sat at the bar far from each other more tattoos they didnt move either it looked like a poster for national brain death week i took a stool between the men and ordered a beer draft or bottle draft the bartender took a long time to fill a mug and as i waited i snuck glances at my companions both wore billed caps tshirts jeans and work shoes one was skinny the other muscular their hands were dirty they smoked and drank and had tired faces my beer came and i took a swallow not much head and not great but not as bad as id expected any idea when roddyll be back i said who said the bartender rodriguez the masonry guy next door hes supposed to be doing a retaining wall for me and he didnt show up he shrugged place is closed i said no answer great i said guys got my goddamned deposit the bartender began soaking glasses in a gray plastic tub i drank some more zz gave way to a disc jockeys voice hawking car insurance for people with bad driving records then a series of commercials for ambulancechasing lawyers polluted the air some more whens the last time youve seen him around i said the bartender turned around who rodriguez shrug has his place been closed for a while another shrug he returned to soaking great i said he looked over his shoulder he never comes in here i got nothing to do with him okay not much of a drinker shrug fucking asshole said the man on my right the skinny one sallow and pimpled barely above drinking age his cigarette was dead in the ashtray one of his index fingers played

heard a metallic click to the left looked over and saw the muscular man light up a cigarette late twenties or early thirties twoday growth of heavy beard thick black fu manchu mustache his cap was black and said cat he blew smoke toward the bar i said you know rodriguez too he gave a long slow headshake and held out his mug the bartender filled it then extended his own hand the mustachioed man jostled the pack until a cigarette slid forward the bartender took it nodded and lit up guns n roses came on the radio the bartender looked at my halfempty mug anything else i shook my head put money down on the bar and left asshole said the skinny man raising his voice to be heard over the music i drove back to the rodriguez house still dark and empty a woman across the street was holding a broom and she began looking at me suspiciously i called over any idea when theyll be back she went inside her house i drove away and got back on the freeway exiting on sunset and heading north on beverly glen i realized my error just as i completed the turn but continued on to my house anyway pulling up in front of the carport looking over my shoulder with paranoid fervor i decided it was safe to get out of the car i walked around my property looking remembering though it made no sense the house already looked sad you know how places get when theyre empty i took a quick look at the pond the fish were still there they swam up to greet me and i obliged with food see you guys i said and left wondering how many would survive i made it to benedict a few minutes later the black van and the unmarked were gone two of the three garage doors were open and i saw robin inside wearing work clothes and goggles standing behind her lathe she saw me coming and turned off the machine a gold bmw coupe was parked in the third garage the rest of the space was a near duplicate of the venice shop looks like youre all set up i said she pushed her goggles up on her forehead this isnt too bad actually as long as i leave the door open for ventilation how come youre back so soon no one home flake out on you it looks like theyre gone for a while moved out must be the week for it how could you tell two days mail in the box and her husbands business was padlocked considerate of her to let you know etiquette isnt her strong suit she wasnt thrilled about my evaluation in the first place though i thought we were making progress she probably took the girls out of state maybe hawaii when i spoke to her yesterday she made a crack about a honolulu vacation or mexico her husband may have family there id better call the judge we set up an office for you in one of the bedrooms she said leaning over and pecking my cheek gave you the one with the best view plus theres a hockney on the wall two guys showering she smiled poor milo he was a little embarrassed about it started muttering about the atmosphere almost apologizing after all he did to help us i sat him down and we had a good talk about what stuff the meaning of life i told him you could handle the atmosphere what he say to that just grunted and rubbed his face the way he does then i made coffee and told him if he ever learned to play an instrument id build one for him safe offer i said maybe not when we were talking it came up that he used to play the accordion when he was a kid and he sings have you ever heard him no well he sang for me this afternoon after some prodding did an old irish folk song and guess what hes got a really nice voice basso profundo tenor of all things he used to be in the church choir when he was a little boy i smiled thats a little hard to picture theres probably a lot about him you dont know probably i said each year i get in touch with more of my ignorance speaking of grunts wheres our guest sleeping in the service porch i tried keeping him here while i worked but he kept charging the machines he was ready to take on the bandsaw when i got him out of here and locked him in tough love huh did he do his little strangulation routine oh sure she said she put her hand around her throat and made a gagging sound i yelled at him to be quiet and he stopped poor guy he probably thought you were going to be his salvation she grinned i may be sultry and sensual but i aint easy i let the dog loose gave him time to pee outside and took him into my new office a chromeandglasstopped desk was pushed up against one wall my papers and books were piled neatly on a black velour couch the view was fantastic but after a few minutes i stopped noticing it i phoned superior court got steve huff in his chambers and told him about evelyn rodriguezs noshow maybe she just forgot he said denial avoidance whatever i think theres a good chance shes gone steve i described roddy rodriguezs locked yard sounds like it he said there goes another one cant say that i blame her when i saw her two days ago she really opened up about the girls problems theyre having plenty of them and donald wrote me a letter no remorse just tooting his own horn as a good dad wrote you a letter his lawyers been calling me too any intimidation i hesitated no just nagging too bad no law against that no cant say that i blame her either alex off the record do you want to wait and try again or just write up your report now document all the crap she told you whats the difference the difference is how quickly you want to get paid versus how much lead time you want to give her if she has hightailed it once you put it in writing and i receive it im obligated to send it over to bucklear even with reasonable delays he gets it in a couple of weeks or so then he files paper and gets warrants out on her a murderer gets warrants on a grandmother taking her grandkids out of town do we file that under i for irony or n for nuts do i take that to mean youll wait how much lead time can i give her a reasonable period consistent with typical medicalpsychological practice meaning meaning what shrinks normally do three four even five weeks wouldnt chafe any hides you guys are notorious for being sloppy about your paperwork you might even stretch it to six or seven but you never heard that from me in fact we never had this talk did we judge who i said attaboy oops bailiffs buzzing me time to be solomonic again byebye i put the phone down the bulldog placed his paws on my knees and tried to get up on my lap i lifted him and he settled on me like a warm hunk of clay at least thirty pounds the hockney was right in front of me great painting as was the thomas hart benton drawing on the opposite wall a mural study depicting hypermuscular workmen cheerfully constructing a wpa dam i looked at both of them for a while and wondered what robin and milo had talked about the dog stayed as motionless as a little furry buddha i rubbed his head and his jowls and he licked my hand a boy and his dog i realized i hadnt gotten the number for the bulldog club yet almost five pm too late to call the akc id do it tomorrow morning denial avoidance whatever that night i slept fitfully friday morning at eight i phoned north carolina and got an address for the french bulldog club of america in rahway new jersey a post office box no phone number was available at eightten i called the rodriguez house a phone company recording said that line had been disconnected i pictured evelyn and the girls barreling over a dirt road in baja rodriguez following in his truck or maybe the four of them wandering through waikiki with glazed tourists eyes if only they knew how much we had in common now i began unpacking books at eight thirtyfive the doorbell rang and milo appeared on one of the tv monitors tapping a foot and carrying a white bag breakfast he said as i let him in i already gave ms castagna hers god that woman works whatve you been doing getting organized sleep okay great i lied thanks a lot for setting us up he looked around hows the office perfect great view huh to die for we went into the kitchen and he took some onion rolls and two styrofoam cups of coffee out of the bag we sat at a blue granite table he said whats your schedule like today its pretty open now that the wallace things on hold looks like grandma decided to take matters into her own hands i recounted what id found in sunland he said theyre probably better off if you feel like taking on a little assignment ive got one for you what go over to the mental health center and talk to ms jean jeffers i finally got through to her she actually called me back last night which i thought was pretty cool for a bureaucrat better attitude than i expected too down to earth not that she shouldnt cooperate after what happened to becky i told her wed come across some harassment crimes didnt go into specifics that we had reason to believe might be coming from one of her patients someone we also had reason to believe was a buddy of hewitts mentioning his name got her going she went on about how beckys murder had traumatized all of them still sounds pretty shook up he tore an onion roll into three pieces placed the segments on the table like monte cards picked one up and ate it anyway i asked her if she knew who hewitt hung out with and she said no then i asked her if i could look at her patient roster and she said she wanted to help but no the confidentiality thing so i threw tarasoff at her hoping she didnt know the law that well but she did no specific threat against a specific victim no tarasoff obligation at that point i played my trump card told her the department had a consultant doing some profiling work for us on psycho crimes a genuine pee aitch dee who respected confidentiality and would be discreet and i gave her your name in case maybe she heard of you and guess what she thought she had especially after i told her you were semifamous hoohah hoohah to the max she said she couldnt promise anything but shed be willing to at least talk to you maybe thered be some way to work something out the more we talked the friendlier she got my feeling is she wants to help but is afraid of being burned by more publicity so be gentle with her no brass knucks i said how much do i tell her he ate another piece of roll as little as possible when can she see me this afternoon heres the number he took a scrap of paper out of his pocket gave it to me and stood where you going i said over the hill van nuys try to find out what i can about who cut up myra paprock five years ago after he was gone i called in for messages still nothing from shirley rosenblatt in new york then wrote a letter to the bulldog club informing them id found what might possibly be a members pet at ninethirty i phoned jean jeffers and was put through to her secretary who sounded as if shed been expecting me an appointment with ms jeffers was available in an hour if i was free i grabbed a roll put on a tie and left the center was in a block of cheerless pastelcolored apartments in a quiet part of west la not far from santa monica an old workingclass district near an industrial park whose galloping expansion had been choked off by hard times constructus interruptus had left its mark all over the neighborhood halfframed buildings empty lots dug out for foundations and left as dry sumps pigeonspecked for sale signs boardedup windows on condemned prewar bungalows the clinic was the only charming bit of architecture in sight its front windows were barred but boxes filled with begonias hung from the iron the spot on the sidewalk where dorsey hewitt had fallen dead was clean but for a couple of trashchoked shopping carts in front it could have been a private sanitarium a generous lot next door was twothirds empty and marked employees only no patient parking i decided a consultant qualified as someones employee and parked there i made my way back to the front of the building passing the section of wall that had been obsessed upon by the tv camera a cement cornerstone etched with names of forgotten politicos stated that the building had been dedicated as a veterans clinic in the door hewitt had come out of was just to the right unmarked and locked two locks each almost as large as the one sealing roddy rodriguezs brickyard the main entrance was dead center through a squat arch leading to a courtyard with an empty fountain a loggia to the right of the fountain the path hewitt would have taken to get to the unmarked door was sectioned off by thick steel mesh that looked brandnew an open hallway on the opposite side led me around the fountain to glasspaned doors a blueuniformed guard stood behind the doors tall old black chewing gum he looked me over and unlatched one of the doors then pointed to a metal detector to his left one of those walkthrough airport things i set it off and had to give the guard my keys before passing silently go head he said handing them back i walked up to a reception desk a young black woman sat behind more mesh can i help you dr delaware for ms jeffers one minute she got on the phone behind her were three other women at desks typing and talking into receivers the windows behind them were barred through the bars i saw trucks cars and shadows the gray graffitied walls of an alley i was standing in a small unfurnished area painted light green and broken only by a single door to the right claustrophobic it reminded me of the sally port at the county jail and i wondered how a paranoid schizophrenic or someone in crisis would handle it how easy it would be for someone with a muddled psyche to make it from the noparking lot through the metal detector to this holding cell the receptionist said okay shes all the way down at the end and pressed a button the door buzzed not quite as loudly as the one at the pawnshop but just as obnoxiously and i opened it and stepped into a very long creamcolored hall marked by lots of doors thick gray carpeting covered the floor the light was very bright most of the doors were blank a few were labeled therapy and even fewer bore slidein signs with peoples names on them the cream paint smelled fresh how many coats had it taken to cover up the blood the corridor was silent except for my footsteps the kind of womblike damping that comes only from real soundproofing as i made my way to the end a door on the left opened spilling out people but no noise three people two women and a man poorly dressed and shuffling not a group each walked alone the man was lanternjawed and stooped the women heavy and redfaced with cracked swollen legs and stringy hair all of them looked down at the carpet as they passed me they grasped small white pieces of paper rx stamped at the top the room theyd exited was classroomsized and crowded with another thirty or so people queued up before a metal desk a young man sat at the desk talked briefly to each person who stood before him then filled out a prescription blank and handed it over with a smile the people in line scuffed forward as automatically as cans on a conveyor belt some of them held out their hands in anticipation before they got to the doctor none of them left without paper none seemed cheered i resumed walking the door at the end had a slidein that said jean jeffers msw lcsw director inside was a fivebyfive secretarial area occupied by a young fullfaced asian woman her desk was barely big enough to hold a pc and a blotter the wall behind her was so narrow that a dark mock wood door almost filled it a radio on an end table played soft rock almost inaudibly a nameplate in front of the computer said mary chin she said dr delaware go right in jean will see you thank you she began to open the door a woman caught it from the other side and pulled it all the way back fortyfive or so tall and blond she wore a crimson shirtdress gathered at the waist by a wide white belt doctor im jean she held out her hand almost as big as mine lanolin soft the left one bore a ruby solitaire ring over a broad gold wedding band more white in her teardrop earrings and a mock ivory bracelet around one wrist a sensiblelooking watch encircled the other she had a strong frame and carried no extra fat the belt showed off a firm waist her face was long lightly tanned with soft generous features only her upper lip had been skimped upon by nature not much more than a pencil line its mate was full and glossed dark blue eyes studied me from under black lashes goldframed halfglasses hung from a white cord around her neck her hair was frosted almost white at the tips clipped short in back and layered back at the sides pure utility except for a thick veronica lake flap in front it swooped to the right almost hiding her right eye a handsome woman she flipped her hair and smiled thanks for seeing me i said of course doctor please have a seat her office was the standard twelvebytwelve setup with a real wood desk two upholstered armchairs a threedrawer double file a nearly empty bookcase and some paintings of seagulls on the desk were a pen a memo pad and a short stack of file folders a photo in a standup frame was centered on one of the shelves she and a nicelooking heavyset man about her age the two of them in hawaiian shirts and bedecked with leis social work diplomas made out to jean marie laporte were propped on another shelf all from california colleges i scanned the dates if shed graduated college at twentytwo she was exactly fortyfive youre a clinical psychologist right she said sitting behind the desk i took one of the chairs yes you know when detective sturgis mentioned your name i thought i recognized it though i still cant figure out from where she smiled again i returned it she said how does a psychologist come to be a police consultant by accident really several years ago i was treating some children whod been abused at a daycare center i ended up testifying in court and getting involved in the legal system one thing led to another daycare center the man who took pictures the one involved with that horrible molesters club i nodded well that must be where i remember your name from you were quite a hero werent you not really i did my job well she said sitting forward and pushing hair out of her eyes im sure youre being modest child abuse is so to tell you the truth i couldnt work with it myself which may sound funny considering what we deal with here but children she shook her head it would be too hard for me to find any sympathy for the abusers even if they were once victims themselves i know what you mean to me thats the lowest violating a childs trust how do you manage to deal with it it wasnt easy i said i saw myself as the childs ally and tried to do whatever helped tried you dont do abuse work anymore occasionally when it comes up as part of a custody case mostly i consult the court on trauma and divorce issues do you do any therapy at all not much me neither she sat back my main goal in school was to become a therapist but i cant remember the last time i actually did any real therapy she smiled again and shook her head the wave of hair covered her eyes and she flipped it back a curiously adolescent mannerism anyway she said about what detective sturgis wants i just dont know how i can really help i really need to safeguard our peoples confidentiality despite what happened to becky she folded her lips inward lowered her eyes and shook her head i said it must have been terrifying it happened too quickly to be terrifying the terrifying part didnt hit me until after it was over seeing her what he now i really know what they mean by posttraumatic stress no substitute for direct experience huh she pressed the skinny upper lip with one finger as if keeping it still no one knew what he was doing to her i was right here going about my business the whole time he was the treatment rooms are totally soundproofed he she removed her finger a white pressure circle dotted her lip then slowly faded then i heard noise from the hall she said that horrible screaming he just kept screaming bad love i said her mouth remained open the blue eyes dulled for a second yes he i went out to marys office and she wasnt there so i opened the door to the hall and saw him screaming waving it the knife splashing blood the wall he saw me i saw his eyes settle on me focusing and he kept screaming i slammed the door shoved marys desk up against it and ran back into my office slammed that door and blocked it i hid behind my chair the whole time it was it wasnt till later that i found out hed grabbed adeline she wiped her eyes im sorry you dont need to hear this no no please she glanced at her message pad blank picking up the pen she wrote something on it no thats it ive told it so many times no one knows how long he if she suffered for a long time thats the one thing i can hope that she didnt the thought of her trapped in there with him she shook her head and touched her temples they soundproofed the rooms back in the sixties when this place was a vietnam veterans counseling center we sure dont need it whys that because no one does much therapy around here she took a deep breath and slapped her hands lightly on the desk life goes on right would you like something to drink weve got a coffee machine in the other wing i can have mary go get some no thanks lucky choice smile its actually pretty vile how come no one does much therapy i said too disturbed a population too disturbed too poor too many of them they need food and shelter and to stop hearing voices the preferred treatment is thorazine and haldol and lithium and tegretol and whatever else chases the demons away counseling would be a nice luxury but with our caseload it ends up being a very low priority not to mention funding thats why we dont have any psychologists on our staff just caseworkers and most of them are swas assistants like becky on the way in i saw a doctor giving out prescriptions thats right she said its friday isnt it thats dr wintell our onceaweek psychiatrist hes just out of his residency a real nice kid but when his practice builds up hell be out of here like all the others if no one does therapy what was becky doing with hewitt in the therapy room i didnt say we never talk to our people just that we dont do much insight work sometimes we get cramped for space and the workers use the treatment rooms to do their paperwork basically all of us use whats on hand as to what becky was doing with him it could have been anything giving him a voucher for an sro hotel telling him where to get deloused then again maybe she was trying to get into his head she was that kind of person what kind is that an optimist idealistic most of us start out that way dont we i nodded did hewitt have a history of violence none that was listed in our files hed been arrested just a few weeks before for theft and was due to stand trial maybe she was counseling him about that there was nothing on paper that would have warned us and even if he was violent theres a good chance the information would never have gotten to us with all the red tape she put down her pen and looked at me flipped her hair the truth is he was exactly like so many others who come in and out of here theres still no way to know she picked up one of the folders this is his file the police confiscated it and returned it so i guess its not confidential anymore inside were only two sheets one clipped to each of the covers the first was an intake form listing dorsey hewitts age as thirtyone and his address as none under reason for referral someone had written multiple social problems under diagnosis prob chron schiz the rest of the categories prognosis family support medical history other psych treatmenthad been left blank nothing about bad love at the bottom of the form were notations of referral for food stamps the signature read r basille swa the facing page was white and smooth marked only with the notation will follow as needed rb swa the date was eight weeks prior to the murder i handed the folder back not much i said she gave a sad smile paperwork wasnt beckys forte so you have no idea how many times she actually saw him guess that doesnt say much for my administrative skills does it but im not one of those people who believes in riding the staff checking out every little picayune detail i try to find the best people i can motivate them and give them room to move generally it works out with becky she threw up her hands she was a doll a really sweet person not much for rules and regulations but so what she shook her head wed talked about it helping her get her paperwork in on time she promised to try but to tell the truth i didnt harbor much hope and i didnt care because she was productive where it counted getting on the phone all day with agencies and arguing for every last penny for her cases she stayed late did whatever it took to help them who knows maybe she was going that extra mile for hewitt she picked up the phone mary coffee please no just one putting it down she said the real horror is that it could happen again we have a steel corral now to direct them out onto the street after they get their meds the county finally sent us a guard and the detector but you tell me how to predict which of them is going to blow were not very good prophets under the best of circumstances no were not hundreds of people file in here each week for meds and vouchers weve got to let them in were the court of last resort any of them could be another hewitt even if we wanted to lock them up we couldnt the state hospitals that havent been shut down are filled to capacity i dont know what your theory is about psychosis but mine is that most psychotics are born with it its biological like any other illness but instead of treating them we demonize them or idealize them and they get caught in the squeeze between the dogooders who think they should be allowed to run free and the skinflints who think all they need is to pull themselves up by the bootstraps i know i said when i was in grad school the whole community psych thing was in full bloom schizophrenia as an alternative lifestyle liberating patients from the back wards and empowering them to take over their own treatment empowering she laughed without opening her mouth i had a professor who was a fanatic on the subject i said studied the mental health system in belgium or somewhere and wrote a book on it he had us do a paper on deinstitutionalization the more i researched it the less feasible it seemed i started to wonder what would happen to psychotics who needed medication and couldnt be counted upon to take it he handed the paper back with one comment medication is mind control and gave me a cminus well i give you an a some of our patients cant be counted upon to feed themselves let alone calibrate dosage in my opinion deinstitutionalizations the major culprit in the homeless problem sure some street people are working folks who hit the skids but at least thirty or forty percent are severely mentally debilitated they belong in hospitals not under some freeway and now with all the weird street drugs out there the old cliché that the mentally ill arent violent just isnt true anymore each year it gets uglier and uglier dr delaware i pray there wont be another hewitt but i dont count on it do you try at all to identify which patients are violent if we have police records we take them seriously but like i said thats rare weve got to be our own police here if someone goes around making threats we call security but most of them are quiet hewitt was didnt really relate to anyone else that im aware of thats why were probably not going to be much help to detective sturgis what exactly is he after anyway apparently he suspects hewitt had a friend who may be harassing some people and hes trying to find out if the friend was a patient here well after sturgis called me i asked some of the other workers if theyd seen hewitt with anyone and none of them had the only one who might have known was becky is she the only one who worked with him she nodded how long had she been working here a little over a year she got her assistantship from junior college last summer and applied right afterward one of those second careers shed worked as a secretary for a while decided to go back to school in order to do something socially important her words her eyes flickered and her mouth set the lower lip compressing and making her look older such a sweet girl she said she shook her head then looked at me you know i just thought of something hewitts attorney the one defending him on that theft thing he might know if hewitt had any friends i think ive got his name tucked away somewhere hold on she went to the file opened the middle drawer and began flipping just one second so much junk in here he called me the attorney after beckys murder wanting to know if there was anything he could do i think he wanted to talk to get his own guilt off his chest i didnt have time for ah here we go she pulled out a piece of cardboard stapled with business cards working a staple free with her fingernails she removed a card and gave it to me cheap white paper green letters andrew coburg attorneyatlaw the human interest law center lincoln avenue venice california human interest law i said i think its one of those storefront things thanks i said pocketing the card ill pass it along to detective sturgis the door opened and mary came in with the coffee jean jeffers thanked her and told her to tell someone named amy that shed be ready to see her in a minute when the door closed she began stirring her coffee well she said it was nice talking to you sorry i couldnt do more thanks for your time i said is there anyone else i could talk to who might be able to help no one i can think of what about the woman he took hostage adeline now theres a really sad story shed transferred over here a month before from a center in south central because she had high blood pressure and wanted a safer environment she threw up her hands again and gave a sour laugh any particular reason hewitt grabbed her i said you mean did she know him yes she shook her head the hair flap obscured her eye and she left it there just pure bad luck she happened to be sitting at a desk in the hall working just as he was running out and he grabbed her she walked me to the door people kept coming out of the psychiatrists office she looked at them how can you ever know someone like that anyway she said when you get down to it how can you ever really know anyone i decided to drive to andrew coburgs office and tender an appeal to his human interest getting onto pico i drove to lincoln and headed south into venice the human interest law center turned out indeed to be a storefront one of three set into an old mustardcolored onestory building the brick facade was chipped next door was a liquor store advertising screwtop wine on special the other side was vacant on the window was painted deli lunch dinner the law office window was papered with wrinkled aluminum foil an american flag hung over the doorway printed on one of the white stripes was know your rights the door was closed but unlocked as i pushed it open a bell tinkled but no one came out to greet me in front of me was a particleboard partition a black arrow pointed left and handpainted signs said welcome and bienvenidos a mass of noise voices phone rings clicking typewriter keys came from the other side i followed the arrow around the partition to a single large room long and narrow the walls were graywhite and crowded with bulletin boards and posters the ceiling a high dark nest of ductwork electrical wiring and stammering fluorescent tubes no secretary or receptionist eight or nine mismatched desks were spread around the room each equipped with a black dial phone a typewriter and a facing chair behind each chair was a ushaped construction of pvc tubing white muslin curtains hung from the frame the kind used for mock privacy in hospitals some of the curtains were drawn others were open shoes and cuffs were visible beneath the hems of the drawn drapes young people sat behind the desks talking into phones or to people in the chairs the clients were mostly black or hispanic some looked asleep one of them an old man of indeterminate race held a terrier mutt on his lap a few small children wandered around looking lost the desk nearest to me was occupied by a darkhaired man wearing a green plaid suit jacket white shirt and bolo tie he needed a shave his hair was greased and his face was as sharp as an icepick though the phone receiver was cradled under his chin he didnt appear to be talking or listening and his eyes drifted over to me what can i do for you im looking for andrew coburg back there making a small meaningless movement with his head but i think hes with someone which desk i said he put the phone down swiveled and pointed to a station in the center of the room drapes drawn dirty sneakers and an inch of hairy shin below the hem of the muslin okay if i wait sure you an attorney no sure wait he picked up the phone and began dialing laboriously someone must have answered because he said yeah hi its hank over at hi yeah me too yeah laughter listen what about that nolo we talked about go and check yeah i think so yeah i stood against the partition and read the posters one featured a bald eagle on crutches and said heal our system another was printed in spanish something to do with immigración and liberación the sharpfaced man started talking in lawyers jargon jabbing the air with a pen and laughing intermittently he was still on the phone when the curtains at andrew coburgs station parted an emaciated man wearing a filthy cableknit sweater and cutoff shorts got up he was bearded and had matted hair and my chest tightened when i saw him because he could have been dorsey hewitts brother then i realized i was seeing the brotherhood of poverty and madness he and coburg shook hands and he left eyes half closed as he passed me i backed away from the stench he passed close to the man named hank too but the lawyer didnt notice kept talking and laughing coburg was still standing he wiped his hands on his pants yawned and stretched early thirties six one two hundred pear shaped fair haired arms slightly too short for his longwaisted body his hair was brass colored worn full at the sides with no sideburns he had a soft face fine features and rosy cheeks had probably been a beautiful baby he wore a chambray work shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbows loosened paisley tie five years too narrow rumpled khakis saddle shoes the laces on one shoe were untied stretching again he sat picked up his phone and began dialing most of the other lawyers were on the phone now the room sounded like a giant switchboard i walked over to him his eyebrows rose as i sat down but he didnt show any signs of annoyance probably used to walkins he said listen gotta go into the phone whats that fine i accept that just as long as we have a clear understanding okay what no ive got someone here okay bye cheers he hung up and said hi how can i help you in a pleasant voice his tie was clipped with an unusual bit of jewelry red guitar pick glued to a silver bar i told him who i was and that i was trying to locate any friends of dorsey hewitt dorsey one of my triumphs he said all the pleasantness gone he sat back crossed his legs so what paper do you work for im a psychologist just like i said he smiled really i smiled back scouts honor and a police consultant too thats right you dont mind if i see some id do you i showed him my psych license my med school faculty card and my old lapd consultants tag the police he said as if he still couldnt believe it is that a problem for you in what way working with the police mentality all that intolerance the authoritarianism not really i said police officers vary like anyone else that hasnt been my experience he said there was a jar of licorice sticks near his typewriter he took one and held out the container no thanks high blood pressure no licorice raises it he said chewing mine tends to be low im not saying theyre intrinsically bad the police im sure most of them start out as okay human beings but the job corrupts too much power too little accountability i guess the same could be said for doctors and lawyers he smiled again thats no comfort the smile stayed on his face but it began to look out of place so why does a police consultant need to know anything about dorseys friends i gave him the same explanation id offered jean jeffers midway through his phone rang he picked it up said what okay sure hi bill what is it what what youve got to be kidding no walkie no talkie i mean it this is a bullsquat misdemeanor were talking abou i dont care what else hes okay you do that good idea go ahead talk to him and get back to me bye he put the phone down where were we oh yeah harassment what kind i dont know all the details he pulled his head back and squinted his neck was thick but soft his short arms folded over his abdomen and didnt move cops ask you to consult but dont let you in on the details typical i wouldnt take the gig not seeing any way out of it i said someones been sending people harassing tapes with what may be hewitts voice on them screaming bad love the same thing he screamed after he murdered becky basille coburg thought for a minute so someone taped him off the tv no shortage of strange souls out there keeps both of us busy maybe i said but the police think its worth looking into whos getting these tapes that i dont know must be someone important for the cops to go to all this trouble i shrugged you could ask them i recited milos name and number he didnt bother to write it down taking another licorice stick from the jar he said tapes so whats the big deal the police are wondering if hewitt might have had a close friend someone influenced by what he did someone with the same dangerous tendencies influenced he looked puzzled what some kind of harassment club street people going after the good citizenry hewitt wasnt exactly harmless he began twisting the licorice stick actually he was he was surprisingly harmless when he took his medicine on one of his good days you might have met him and found him a nice guy was he off his medicine when he committed the murder thats what the coroner says too much alcohol not enough thorazine given the biochemistry he must have stopped eating pills a week or so before why who knows i doubt it was a conscious decisionhmm guess i wont take my meds this morning and lets see how the day goes more likely he ran out tried to get a refill and ran into such a hassle he gave up then as he got crazier and crazier he probably forgot all about the pills and why he was taking them in the first place happens all the time to people at the bottom every detail of daily livings a struggle for them but theyre expected to remember appointments fill out forms wait in line follow a schedule i know i said ive been to the center wondered how the patients coped not well is how they cope even when they play by the rules they get turned away mean old mr recession do you have any idea how hard it is for a sick person without money to get help in this city sure do i said i spent ten years at western pediatric medical center over in hollywood i nodded okay he said so you do know not that im glossing over what dorsey did that poor girl every attorneys nightmare i still lose sleep thinking about it but he was a victim too as sappy and kneejerk as that sounds he should have been taken care of not forced to fend for himself institutionalized his eyes turned angry i noticed their color for the first time very pale brown almost tan taken care of not jailedoh hell even jail wouldnt have been bad if that would have meant treatment but it never does had he been psychotic for a long time i dont know he wasnt someone you just sat down and had a chat with so tell me your life history pal most of the time he was somewhere else where was he from originally oklahoma i think but hed been in la for years living on the street since he was a kid any family none that i know of he took hold of the licorice touched it to his lip and used his other hand to caress his tie somewhere else himself when he touched his phone i knew he was ready to break off the conversation what kind of music do you play i glanced at the guitarpick clasp what oh this i just noodle around on weekends me too i worked my way through college playing guitar yeah guess lots of guys did he pulled the front end of the tie down and looked at the ceiling i felt his interest continue to slip what do you do mostly electric or acoustic lately ive been getting into electric smile so whats this gaining rapport with the subject got to hand it to you at least you didnt get into the usual policeprosecutor rap guilttripping me for what dorsey did asking me how can i live with myself defending scum thats because i dont have a problem with that i said its a good system and youre an important part of it and no im not patronizing you he held out his hands whoa i smiled actually its an okay system he said ill bet if you met the founding fathers you wouldnt think they were such great guys slaveowners fat cats and they sure didnt think much of women and kids the phone rang again he took the call while gnawing on the remains of the licorice talking lawyerese bartering some defendants future never raising his voice when he hung up he said we try to make the system work for the people the founding fathers didnt care about who funds you grants donations interested in contributing ill think about it he grinned sure you will either way well get by bad salaries no expense accounts thats why most of these peoplell be gone by next year soon as they start thinking home equity and german cars what about you he laughed me im a veteran five years and thriving because its a heck of a lot more satisfying than drawing up wills or defending polluters he turned serious looked away from me sure it gets ugly he said as if responding to a question what dorsey did was as ugly as it gets eye flicker jesus what a it was a tragedy how else can you put it a goddamn stupid tragedy i know i couldnt have done anything differently but it shouldnt have happened it just stinks but what can you do when society keeps lowering itself to the brutal denominator dorseyd never shown me any signs of violence nothing i was serious when i said you would have liked him most of the time he was pleasant softspoken passive one of my easier clients actually a little paranoid but it was always low key he never got aggressive with it what kind of delusions did he have the usual voices in his head telling him to do stuff cross the street six times one day drink tomato juice the next i dont remember exactly did the voices make him angry they annoyed him but no i wouldnt call it anger it was as if he accepted the voices as being a part of him i see that a lot in the longtimers theyre used to it deal with it nothing aggressive or hostile thats for sure as long as he took his medication i assumed he was taking it because he was always okay with me how well did you know him i wouldnt call it knowing i did some basic legal stuff for him when did you first meet him he looked up at the ductwork again lets see it would have to be around a year ago walkin no he was referred by the court what kind of theft were you defending him on smile cops didnt tell you i dont get involved in more than i need to smart theft is an overstatement he lifted a bottle of gin from a liquor store and a couple of sticks of beef jerky did it in plain sight of the clerk and got busted im sure he didnt even mean it clerk nearly broke his arm restraining him what defense were you planning what do you think plea bargain what else he had no prior record other than petty stuff the way the jails are crowded it would have been a slamdunk he sat up and inserted five fingers into his thick hair massaging his scalp he said gritz pardon me its a name gritz as in hominy with a z the closest i can come to someone who might be called dorseys friend first name or last dont know he came by here a couple of times with dorsey another homeless guy the only reason i know his name is because i noticed him hanging around over there pointing to the partitionasked dorsey who he was and dorsey said gritz first thing i said was what you just did as in hominy that went right over dorseys head and i tried to explain it spelled grits told him what they were asked him if it was a last name or a first name he said no it was a name and it was spelled with a z he spelled it for me really slowly he always talked slow gritz like it was profound for all i know he was making it up did he tend to do that he was schizophrenic what do you think did he ever mention the term bad love to you he shook his head first time i heard about that was from the police asking me why dorsey had screamed it as if id know pushing himself away from the desk he wheeled back in his chair then sat up and thats about all she wrote can you describe this gritz fellow he thought it was a while ago about the same age as dorsey though with street people you cant really tell shorter than dorsey i think he looked at his watch theres a call ive got to make i got up and thanked him for his time he waved it off and picked up the phone any idea where this gritz might be located i said as he dialed nope where did dorsey hang out wherever he could and im not being flip when it was warm he liked to go down by the beach pacific palisades park all up and down the beaches on pch when it cooled down i was able to get him into a shelter or an sro a couple of times but he actually preferred sleeping outdoors lots of times he bunked down in little calcutta wheres that freeway overpass west la which freeway san diego just past sepulveda never saw it i shook my head he shook his too smiled and put down the phone the invisible city there used to be these little hovels there called komfy kort built god knows when for mexican workers doing the daylabor pickup thing on sawtelle those i remember i said did you happen to notice theyre not there anymore city tore them down a few years ago and the street people moved onto the property nothing to tear down with them so what could the city do but keep chasing them out and what with voodoo economics taking hold that became too expensive so the city let them stay little calcutta yeah its a great little suburb you look like a west side kind of guy live anywhere near there not that far go by and take a look if you can spare the time see who your neighbors are i drove east to the overpass coburg had described the freeway formed a concrete ceiling over a fenced dirt lot an arcing canopy of surprising grace supported by columns that would have challenged samson the shade it cast was cool and gray even with my windows closed i could hear the roar of unseen cars the lot was empty and the dirt looked fresh no tents or bedrolls no signs of habitation i pulled over across the street in front of a selfstorage facility the size of an army base and idled the seville little calcutta the fresh dirt suggested a bulldozer party maybe the city had finally cleared it i drove farther slowly past exposition boulevard the west side of the street was lined with apartment buildings the freeway concealed by ivied slopes a few more empty spots peeked behind the usual chain link a couple of overturned shopping carts made me stop and peer into the shadows nothing i cruised several more blocks until the freeway twisted out of sight then i turned around as i neared exposition again i spied something shiny and huge a whitemetal mountain some sort of factory or plant giant canisters duodenal twists of pipe fivestory ladders valves that hinted at monstrous pressure running parallel to the machine works was a blackened length of railroad track bordering the rails was a desertpale table of sand twenty years in la and id never noticed it before invisible city i headed toward the tracks getting close enough to read a small redandblue sign on one of the giant towers avalon gravel and asphalt as i prepared to reverse direction again i noticed another fenced lot catercorner to the plant darker almost blackened by the freeway blocked from street view by greengray shrubs the chainlink fence was obscured by sections of bowed graffitied plywood the wood nearly blotted out by the hieroglyphics of rage pulling to the curb i turned off the engine and got out the air smelled of dust and spoiled milk the plant was as still as a mural the only other vehicle in sight was the burntout chassis of something twodoored with a crushed roof my seville was old and in need of a paint job but here it looked like a royal coach i crossed the empty street over to the plywooded fence and looked through an unblocked section of link shapes began forming in the darkness materializing through the metal diamonds like holograms an overturned chair bleeding stuffing and springs an empty linemans spool stripped of wire and cracked down the middle food wrappers something green and shredded that might once have been a sleeping bag and always the overhead roar constant as breath then movement something on the ground shifting rolling but it was submerged deeply in the shadows and i couldnt tell if it was human or even real i looked up and down the fence searching for an entrance to the lot had to walk a ways until i found it a square hatch cut into the link held in place with rusty baling wire prying the wires loose took a while and hurt my fingers finally i bent the flap back squatted and passed through retying one wire from the other side making my way across the soft dirt my nostrils full of shit smell i dodged chunks of concrete styrofoam food containers lumps of things that didnt bear further inspection no bottles or cans probably because they were recyclable and redeemable lets hear it for green power but nothing green here just blacks grays browns perfect camouflage for a covert world a vile smell overcame even the excremental stench hearing the buzz of flies i looked down at a cats carcass that was so fresh the maggots hadnt yet homesteaded and gave it a wide berth onward past an old blanket clumps of newspaper so sodden they looked like printed bread dough no people that i could see no movement where had the movement come from i arrived at the spot where i thought the thing had rolled toward the back of the covered lot just a few feet from the inner angle of a canted concrete wall standing again i focused waited felt my back itch saw it again movement hair hands someone lying rolled up in a sheet several sheets a mummy wrap of frayed bed linens twitchy movements below lovemaking no no room for two people in the swaddle i walked toward it slowly making sure i approached headon not wanting to startle my shoes kicked something hard the impact was inaudible over the roar but the figure in the sheeting sat up a young dark latina bare shouldered soft shoulders a large vaccine crater on one arm she stared at me pressing the sheets up to her chest long hair wild and sticky looking her mouth was open her face round and plain scared and baffled and humiliated the sheet dropped a bit and i saw that she was naked something dark and urgent snuffled at her breast a small head a baby the rest of it concealed by the filthy cotton i backed away smiled held up my hand in greeting the young mothers face was electric with fear the baby kept suckling and she placed one hand over its tiny skull near her feet was a small cardboard box i got down and looked inside disposable diapers new and used more flies a can of condensed milk and a rusty opener a nearly empty bag of potato chips a pair of rubber sandals and a pacifier the woman tried to nourish her baby while rolling away from me unraveling more of the sheets and exposing a mottled thigh as i started to turn away the look in her eyes changed from fear to recognition and then to another type of fear i whipped around and found myself facetoface with a man a boy actually seventeen or eighteen also latin small and flimsily built with a fuzz mustache and a sloping chin so weak it seemed part of his skinny neck his eyes were downslanted and frantic his mouth hung open a lot of his teeth were gone he had on a torn checked flannel shirt stretchedout doubleknit pants and unlaced sneakers his ankles were black with dirt his hands trembled around an iron bar i stepped away he hesitated then came toward me a high sound pierced the freeway din the woman screaming startled the boy looked at her and i moved in grabbed the bar and twisted it out of his grip the inertia threw him backwards onto the ground so easily that i felt like a bully he stayed there looking up at me shielding his face with one hand ready to be beaten the woman was up tripping out of the sheets naked the baby left squalling on the dirt her belly was pendulous and stretchmarked her breasts limp as a crones though she couldnt have been much older than twenty i threw the bar as far as i could and held out both hands in what i hoped was a gesture of peace the two of them looked at me now i felt like a bad parent the baby was openmouthed with rage clawing the air and kicking i pointed to it the woman rushed over and picked it up realizing she was naked she crouched and hung her head the chinless boys hands were still shaking i tried another smile and his eyes drooped tugged down by despair i took out my wallet removed a ten walked over to the woman and held it out to her she didnt move i put the bill in the cardboard box went back to the boy took out another ten and showed it to him more of that same hesitation hed shown before coming at me with the bar then he took a step biting his lip and teetering like a highwire artist and snatched the money holding out yet another bill i headed for the place where id broken through the fence checking my back as i trotted through the muck after a few steps the boy started following me i picked up the pace and he tried to catch up but couldnt walking was an effort for him his mouth was open and his limbs looked rubbery i wondered when hed last eaten i made it to the flap untied the wire and walked out to the sidewalk he came through several moments later rubbing his eyes the light hurt my pupils he appeared to be in agony he finally stopped rubbing i said habla inglés im from tucson man he said in unaccented english his hands were fisted but the tremor and his small bones mocked his fighters stance he started to cough dry and wheezing tried to bring up phlegm and couldnt didnt mean to scare you i said he was looking at the money i extended my arm and he snatched the bill and crammed it under his waistband the pants were much too big for him and held together with a red plastic belt one of his sneakers was patched with cellophane tape as his hand balled up around the bill i saw that the pinkie of his left hand was missing gimme more he said i didnt say anything gimme more but she won fuck you anyway i dont want her to he flinched thought a moment i won neither im not interested in that either he frowned put a finger inside his mouth and rubbed his gums i gave a quick look around saw no one and took out a fourth ten whu he said yanking his hand free and making a grab for it holding it out of reach i said is that little calcutta huh the place we just were is that little calcutta maybe maybe yeah he coughed some more hit his chest with the fourfingered hand how many people live there i dunno are there others in there right now people i didnt see he considered his answer shook his head are there ever others sometimes where are they now around he looked at the money worked his tongue against his cheek and came closer she fucks you its twenty bucks i put the bill in my pocket hey he said as if id cheated at a game i dont want to fuck anyone i said i just want some information answer my questions and youll get paid okay why man because im a curious guy cop no he flexed his shoulders and rubbed his gums some more when he removed his hand the fingers were bloody is the baby yours i said thas what you wanna know is it i dunno it needs to be looked at by a doctor i dunno is she your woman he smiled sometimes whats your name terminator three glaring challenging me to mock him okay i said are there more people in there i told you man not now just at night they come back at night yuh every night he looked at me as if i were stupid shook his head slowly some nights it changes places i dunno it moves from place to place yeah tent city as a concept some new wave journalist would have a ball with it what about a guy named gritz huh gritz i began the description coburg had given me and to my surprise he broke in yeah you know him i seen him does he live there the hand went back into his mouth he fiddled twisted pulled out a tooth and grinned the root was inky with decay he spit blood onto the pavement and wiped his mouth with his sleeve does gritz hang out here he didnt hear me was looking at the tooth fascinated i repeated the question he kept staring finally dropped the tooth into his pocket not no more he said whens the last time you saw him dunno days weeks dunno he reached out to touch the sleeve of my jacket fifteenyearold harris tweed the cuffs were starting to fuzz i stepped back wool he said yeah he licked his lips what do you know about gritz nuthin but you definitely know him i seen him around whens the last time you saw him around he closed his eyes opened them a week a week definitely or a week maybe i think i dunno man any idea where he is now to get rich to get rich yeah thats what he said he was drinking and partying you know and singing sometimes he liked to sing and he was singing about hey man im gonna get rich soon gonna get me a car and a boat that kind of shit did he say how he was going to get rich nah a hint of threat sharpened his eyes fatigue wiped it out he slumped he didnt say how i repeated no man he wuz partying and singing he was nuts thats it man is gritz a first name or a last name dunno man he coughed hit his chest wheezed fuck if i told you to see a doctor youd shine me on wouldnt you gaptoothed grin you gonna pay me to go what if you had a disease you could give to her or the baby gimme more money holding out a hand again the baby needs to see a doctor gimme more money whod gritz hang out with no one no one at all i dunno man gimme more money what about a guy named hewitt huh a guy named dorsey hewitt ever see gritz with him i described hewitt the boy stared not that much blanker than his general demeanor but enough to tell me his ignorance was real hewitt i repeated don know the dude how long have you been hanging out here hunerd years phlegmy laugh hewitt killed a woman it was on the news dont got cable a social worker named rebecca basille at the westside mental health center yeah i heard something what grin music in my head he tapped one ear and smiled its like rock and soul man the def cool nofool i sighed involuntarily he brightened latching on to my frustration like a buzzard on carrion gimme money man cough gimme anything else you want to tell me yeah tapping one foot waiting for the straight man what i said the babys mine smile his remaining teeth were pink with fresh blood congratulations got a cigarette i dont smoke then gimme money i aks around for you man you come back and i tell you everything i aksed i counted what i had in my wallet two twenties and three singles gave him all of it the jacket too he scrambled back through the fence and disappeared i hung around until his footsteps died then walked back to the car the air had cooled sudden shifts were becoming the rule this autumn and a soft wind from the east was nudging scraps of garbage off the sidewalk i gassed up the seville at a station on olympic and used the pay phone to get the number of the nearest social services office after being put on hold several times and transferred from bureaucrat to bureaucrat i managed to reach a supervisor and tell her about the infant living under the freeway was the baby being mistreated sir no did the baby look malnourished actually no but were there bruises or scars anywhere visible on the babys body or other signs of abuse nothing i said the mother was caring for the baby but theyre living in filthy conditions out there and the boy who might be the babys father has a cough that sounds tubercular was the baby coughing not yet for a tuberculosis investigation youd have to call public health ask for a communicable disease officer theres nothing you can do doesnt sound like theres anything we should be doing sir how bout getting the baby some shelter theyd have to ask sir the baby would the legal guardians we dont just go out looking for people click the dial tone was as loud as the freeway i felt nuts how did the certifiable psychotics handle it i wanted to call robin then i realized i hadnt memorized my new phone number didnt even know the name of the houses owner i called milo he was at his desk and gave me the seven digits then said before you hang up i just got through with myra paprocks file she wasnt a therapist real estate agent killed on the job showing a house and somebody cut her robbed her raped her and wrote bad love on the wall with her lipstick oh jesus yeah in the photos the lipstick looks like blood real estate agent i said thats sometimes a second career maybe she worked as some kind of therapist first if she did its not down here in the file and the van nuys guys seem to have done a pretty thorough job plus shipler the beating victim wasnt a shrink either so i dont see any obvious mental health connection here what did he do janitor night custodian at jefferson high i havent gotten his file yet but i had a records clerk over at central give me the basics was he killed on the job too nope in the comfort of his own home whered he live budlong avenue south la black yeah what happened to him pounded to mush and the house was trashed robbery doubtful his stereo tv and some jewelry were left behind what then someone looking for something or someone got really angry i want to read the whole file got a call in for it real estate agent and janitor i said doesnt make any sense any connection between them other than bad love on the wall there doesnt seem to be any nothing matches she was thirtyfive he was sixtyone he was killed early morning right after he finished work on the nightshift and she got it in the middle of the day she was stabbed he was clubbed there were even differences in what the killer used to write bad love shiplers was done in molasses from his fridge in both cases the killer was opportunistic used something of the victims weapons too he said she was killed with a kitchen knife from the house she was showing shipler with a fireplace poker that was identified as his so i dont know maybe it indicates some kind of power thing dominance over the victims turning the victims against themselves like using my tree branch on the koi were there any bondage or s m overtones to either murder paprocks bra was wrapped around her neck but the coroner said it was done when she was already dead far as i can tell there were no sexual overtones at all to shipler still i said the message was important it must mean something to the killer im sure it does he said without enthusiasm did shipler live alone yeah divorced what about paprock no match there either married two kids if nothing was taken from shiplers house i said what was the assumed motive a gang thing there was lots of activity in shiplers neighborhood even back then lots more now like you said before a trashed house could mean someone looking for something central figured dope figured shipler was involved on some level and bad love was some sort of gangbanger slogan they hadnt heard of yet they checked it out with the crash detail and they hadnt heard of it but new stuff comes up all the time did shipler turn out to be involved in gangs or dope far as i can tell he had no record but plenty of scrotes slip through the cracks in terms of there being no burglary southwest figured it was punks panicking and leaving before they could take anything which is consistent with gang wannabees new recruits out on a virgin adventure an initiation thing yeah they start em young automatics in the diapers speaking of which i caught my little truant bastards on the palms robbery thirteen and fifteen no doubt theyll get referred for some kind of therapy want a referral no thanks cynic was there gang activity where paprock was killed a little on the fringes its mostly workingclass tough north end of van nuys no one made the gang assumption in that one but maybe if van nuys had talked to southwest they would have neither of them knew about the other case still dont going to tell them i said first im gonna read shiplers file thoroughly see what i can pull out of it then yeah ill have to tell them do the old network blah blah both cases are real cold be interesting to see what kind of responses i get hopefully the whole thing wont deteriorate into endless memories though if bad love shows up anywhere in stoumens file weve got interstate blah blah hear from seattle yet very briefly theyre sending down records itll probably take a week or so both detectives on that one are retired and unavailable probable translation burnouts gone fishing if anything provocative comes up in the file ill bug em anyway what about the fbi records on other bad love murders not yet them gears grind slowly a real estate agent a janitor and bad love i said i still think it has something to do with that conference or de bosch himself paprock and shipler could have been his patients so why would someone kill them maybe its another patient mad about something then whats your connection i dont know nothing makes sense dammit you learn anything from jeffers no one at the center remembers hewitt having any friends but she referred me to hewitts lawyer and he gave me a name and possible address i described my encounter with the people under the freeway gritz he said as in hominy with a z could be a first name or a last or just a nickname ill run it through the kid i spoke to said hes been gone about a week he also said gritz was talking and singing about getting rich singing thats what he said oh those romantic hoboes strumming around the campfire maybe gritz had some kind of job lined up or maybe its baloney the kid could very well have been putting me on for what its worth he said hed ask around i should come back later getting rich he said everyone talks and sings about it that calcutta place might be the dregs but its still la true i said but wouldnt it be interesting if gritz really did expect to get paid for something like killing my koi and other nasties hitman on a fish so whos doing the hiring the anonymous bad guy i know its a ridiculous idea at this point nothings ridiculous alex but if someone was looking to hire a nighttime skulker would they choose a homeless nutcase true maybe what gritz was hired for was to scream on tape to imitate hewitt because he knew what hewitt sounded like imitate he said those voice tracks sounded identical to me alex though we may never be able to verify it i talked to the voiceprint guy over at the sheriffs and screams are useless legally in order to make a match that can be used in court you need two samples minimum of twenty words on each and the exact same phrases even then it gets challenged a lot and thrown out what about for nonadmissible comparison matching screams is still an iffy business its words that have unique characteristics i asked the sheriff to give a listen anyway he said hes backlogged but would try to get to it eventually why would someone want to imitate hewitt i dont know i cant help but think the tapes part of a ritual something ceremonial that means something only to the killer what about the kid on the tape could be a homeless kid someone from little calcutta or some place like it living down there could explain the robot quality of the voice despair you should have seen it milo the boys teeth were rotting he had a tubercular cough the girl was naked wrapped up in a sheet trying to feed the baby if id offered enough money i probably could have bought the baby ive seen it he said softly i know you have i have too its all around but i havent really let it register for a while whatre you gonna do solve everyones problems plenty of your own to deal with for the time being you get names on the freeway people not the girl he calls himself terminator three he laughed no one else down there besides them and the baby no one i could see and i was flashing tendollar bills real smart alex i watched my back yeah the kid said the place fills up at night i could go back after dark and see if anyone else knows gritz youre really in the mood to get your throat cut arent you if i had a macho cop with me id be safe right dont count on it yeah okay its probably a waste of time but that makes me feel right at home robin was still working in the garage hunched over her bench wielding shiny sharp things that resembled dental picks her hair was tied up and her goggles were lodged in her curls under her overalls her tshirt was tightened by perspiration she said hi doll as her hands continued to move the dog was at her feet and he stood and licked my hand as i looked over robins shoulder a tiny rectangle of abalone was clamped to a padded section of the bench the edges were beveled and the corners were inlaid with bits of ivory and gold wire shed traced the shell with minuscule curlicue shapes cut out some of them and was in the process of excising another beautiful i said fretboard inlay uhhuh thanks she blew away dust and cleaned the edge of a pick with a fingernail you do root canal too she laughed and hunched lower the tools clicked as she carved out a speck of shell kind of baroque for my taste but its for a stockbroker who wants a showpiece for his wall she worked some more finally put the tools down wiped her forehead and wiggled her fingers enough for one day im cramping up everything okay i rubbed her neck nice and quiet how about you not bad i kissed her the wind got stronger and drier ruffling the cypress trees and shooting a cold stream through the open garage robin unclamped the abalone and put it in her pocket her arms were goosebumped i put mine around them and the two of us headed for the house by the time we got to the door the wind was whipping the trees and stirring the dust causing the bulldog to blink and sniff santa ana she said too cold probably the tail end of something arctic brr she said unlocking the door leave your jacket in the car i shook my head we went inside you were wearing one werent you she said rubbing her hands together that baggy brown tweed artists eye yup did you lose it not exactly not exactly i gave it away she laughed you what no big deal it was fraying whod you give it to i told her about little calcutta she listened with her hands on her hips shaking her head and went into the kitchen to wash her hands when she came back her head was still moving from side to side i know i know i said it was a bleedingheart reflex but they really were pitiful it was a cheap old thing anyway you wore it the first time we went out i never liked it you didnt nope too philosophy prof why didnt you tell me she shrugged it wasnt that important snoring poor taste in haberdashery what else dont you like that you havent informed me about nothing now that youve ditched the coat youre perfect she ruffled my hair walked to the french doors and looked out at the mountains they were shimmering denuded in patches where the foliage was brushed back like blowdried hair the pool water was choppy the surface gritty with leaves and dirt robin loosened her hair i hung back and kept looking at her perfect female statuary rockstill against the turbulence she unsnapped one overall strap then the other letting the baggy denim collapse around her feet and stood there in tshirt and panties half turning hands on hips she looked back at me how bout giving me something big boy she said in a mae west voice the dog grumbled robin cracked up quiet you youre wrecking my timing now it feels like a home she said snuggling under the covers though i do prefer our little love nest be it ever so humble so whatd you find out today my second summation of the day i did it quickly adding what milod told me about the murders and leaving out the gross pathology even sanitized it was bad and she turned quiet i rubbed her lower back allowing my hand to linger on swells and dimples her body loosened but only for a moment youre sure youve never heard of those other two people she said stilling my hand im sure and there doesnt even seem to be any connection between the two of them the woman was a white real estate agent the man a black janitor he was twentysix years older they lived on opposite ends of the city were killed in different ways nothing in common but bad love maybe they were patients of de bosch they couldnt be old patients of yours no way i said ive been through every one of my case files to be honest i dont see the patient angle as too likely period if someone has a hangup with de bosch why go after the people he treated what about group therapy alex things can get rough in groups cant they people lashing out at one another maybe someone got dumped on badly and never forgot it i guess its possible i said sitting up a good therapist always tries to keep a handle on the groups emotional climate but things can get out of control and sometimes theres no way to know someones feeling victimized once at the hospital i had to calm down the father of a kid with a bone tumor who brought a loaded pistol onto the ward when i finally got him to open up it came out that hed been boiling for weeks but there was no warning at all till then hed been a really easygoing guy there you go she said so maybe some patient of de boschs sat there and took it and never told anyone finally years later he decided to get even but what kind of therapy group would bring together a real estate agent from the valley and a black janitor i dont know maybe they werent the patients maybe their kids were a parents group for problem kids de bosch was basically a child therapist wasnt he i nodded trying to imagine it shipler was a lot older than paprock i suppose she could have been a young mother and he an old father we heard scratching and thumping at the door i got up and opened it and the dog bounded in he headed straight for robins side of the bed stood on his hind legs put his paws on the mattress and began snorting she lifted him up and he rewarded her with lusty licks settle down she said uhoh look hes getting excited without testicles yet see the effect you have on men but of course she batted her lashes at me turned back to the dog and finally got him to lie still by kneading the folds of flesh around his jowls he lapsed into sleep with an ease that i envied but when i leaned over to kiss her he opened his eyes snuffled and insinuated himself between us curling atop the covers and licking his paws i said maybe milo can get hold of paprocks and shiplers medical histories see if de boschs name or the corrective school appears on them sometimes people conceal psych treatment but with the cost its more likely theres some kind of insurance record ill ask him when i see him tonight whats tonight we were planning on going back to the freeway try to talk to more of the homeless people in order to get a handle on this gritz character is it safe going back there ill have milo with me whether or not its productive remains to be seen all right she said uneasily if you want it to be productive why dont you stop at a market and get those people some food good idea youre full of them today arent you motivation she said she turned serious reached up and held my face in both of her hands i want this to be over please take care of yourself promise we managed to maintain a convoluted embrace despite the dog i fell asleep smelling perfume and kibble when i woke up my stomach was sour and my feet were sore inhaling and letting out the air i sat up and cleared my eyes what is it robin mumbled her back to me just thinking about what she rolled over and faced me someone in a therapy group getting wounded and keeping it inside all these years she touched my face what the hell do i have to do with it i said am i just a name on a damned brochure or did i hurt someone without ever knowing it i heard the unhealthysounding engine from inside the house milos fiat reduced to a squat little toy on the monitor i went outside the wind had stopped the car expelled a plume of smoke then convulsed it didnt look as if it would survive the evening figured it would blend in where were going he said getting out he carried a large white plastic bag and was wearing work clothes the bag smelled of garlic and meat more food i said sandwiches italian just consider me your official lapd delivery boy robin was back in the garage working under a funnel of fluorescence the dog was there too and he charged us heading straight for the bag milo lifted it out of reach sit stay better yet go away the dog snorted once turned his back on us and sank to his haunches milo said well one out of three aint bad he waved at robin she raised a hand and put down her tools she looks right at home he said how bout you nick danger im fine anything on gritz in the records before he could answer robin came over hes brought us dinner i said what a prince she kissed his cheek are you hungry right now not really he said touching his gut and looking down at the ground had a little appetizer while i waited good for you she said growing boy growing the wrong way youre fine milo youve got presence she patted his shoulder from the way her fingers were flexing i knew she was eager to get back to her bench i was itchy too thinking of the freeway people the dog continued to sulk how bout you hon she said to me the dog came over thinking or pretending it was meant for him i can wait me too so let me stick this in the fridge and when you guys get back well chow down sounds good milo gave her the bag the dog tried to lick it and she said relax ive got a milkbone for you above the roofline the sky was black and empty lights from the houses across the canyon seemed a continent away youll be okay i said ill be fine go she gave me a quick kiss and a small shove milo and i headed for the fiat the dog watched us drive away the sound of the gate clanking shut made me feel better about leaving her up there milo coasted to benedict shifted to first then upward squeezing as much speed as possible out of the little car shifting roughly big hands nearly covering the top of the steering wheel as we headed south i said anything on gritz one possible citation thank god its an unusual name lyle edward male white thirtyfour years old five six one thirty i forget the color of his eyes coburg said he was shorter than hewitt he nodded bunch of drunk and disorderlies from back when we still bothered with those possession of narcotics couple of shoplifting busts nothing heavy when did he come to la first arrest was fourteen years ago the computer gives him no known address no parole officer either he got probation for some of his naughties lived at county jail for the others and paid his debt in full any mention of mental illness there wouldnt be unless he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender or committed some other kind of violent psycho crime ill call jean jeffers monday see if i can find out if he ever got treated at the center meanwhile we can talk to the offrampers for what its worth all he is is a name so far robin suggested we should bring them food increase the rapport he shrugged why not theres a minimarket over on olympic we drove a bit more he frowned and rubbed his face with one hand something the matter i said nah just the usual justice got raped again my truant scumbags the old lady died this afternoon im sorry does that make it murder he pumped his gas pedal leg it makes it shit she had badly clogged arteries and a big tumor growing in her colon autopsy said it was just a matter of time that her age and the fact that the kids never actually touched her means the das office doesnt want to bother to prove it was an unnatural death once they hospitalized her she was never well enough to get even a deathbed declaration and without her testimony theres not much of a case against the little bastards even for robbery so they probably get a stern lecture and walk wanna make a bet by the time they start shaving someone elsell be dead he got to sunset and joined the smooth fast traffic flowing west from beverly hills amid the teutonic tanks and cigarillo sports jobs the fiat looked like a mistake a mercedes cut in front of us and milo swore viciously i said you could give him a ticket dont tempt me a mile later i said robin came up with a possible link between paprock and shipler both could have been in group therapy with de bosch treatment for themselves or some kind of parents group to talk about problem kids the killer could also have been in the group gotten treated roughly or thought he had and developed a grudge group therapy some kind of common problem what else would draw two people from such different backgrounds to de bosch interesting but if it was a parents group de bosch didnt run it he died in eighty and paprocks kids are six and seven years old now so they werent alive when he was in fact at the time myra died they were only babies so what kind of problems could they have had maybe it was a childrearing program or some kind of chronic illness support group and are you sure paprock was only married once according to her file she was okay i said so maybe katarina was the therapist or someone else at the school maybe the killer believes in collective guilt or it could have been an adult treatment group child therapists dont always limit themselves to kids fine but now were back to the same old question whats your link has to be the conference the killers gotten severely paranoid let his rage get out of control to him anyone associated with de bosch is guilty and where better to start than a bunch of therapists paying public homage to the old man maybe stoumens hitandrun was no accident what majorleague mass murder the killers going after patients and therapists i dont know im just grasping he heard the frustration in my voice its okay keep grasping doesnt cost the taxpayers a dime for all i know were dealing with something so crazy itll never make sense we rode for a while then he said de boschs clinic was private expensive how could a janitor like shipler afford getting treatment there sometimes private clinics treat a few hardship cases or maybe shipler had good health insurance through the school system what about paprock did she have money nothing huge as far as i can tell husband worked as a car salesman can you get hold of their insurance records if they had any and havent been destroyed i thought of two motherless gradeschool children and said how old exactly were paprocks children at the time of her murder dont remember exactly little who raised them i assume the husband is he still in town dont know that either yet if he is maybe hell be willing to talk about her tell us if she was ever a therapy patient at de boschs clinic he hooked a finger toward the rear seat got the file right there check out the address i swung around toward the darkened seat and saw a file box right on top he said the brown one colors were indistinguishable in the darkness but i reached over groped around and came up with a folder opening it i squinted theres a penlight in the glove compartment i tried to open the compartment but it was stuck milo leaned across and slammed it with his fist the door dropped open and papers slid to the floor i stuffed them back in and finally found the light its skinny beam fell on a page of crimescene photos stapled to the righthand page lots of pink and red writing on a wall a closeup of bad love in big red block letters that matched the blood on the floor neat lettering a bloody thing below i turned to the facing page the name of myra paprocks widower was midway through the intake data ralph martin paprock i said valley vista cadillac the home address is in north hollywood ill run it through dmv see if hes still around i said i need to keep looking for the other conference people to warn them sure but if you cant tell them who and why what does that leave dear sir or madam this is to inform you you might be bludgeoned stabbed or run over by an unidentified revengecrazed psycho maybe one of them can tell me the who and why and i know id have liked to have been warned the problem is finding them none of them are working or living where they were at the time of the conference and the woman i thought might be rosenblatts wife hasnt returned any of my calls another stretch of silence youre wondering he said if theyve been visited too it did cross my mind katarinas not been listed in the apa directory for five years she could have just stopped paying dues but it doesnt seem like her to just drop out of psychology and close up the school she was ambitious very much taken with carrying on her fathers work well he said it should be easy enough to check tax rolls and social security records on all of them find out whos breathing and who aint he reached hilgard and turned left passing the campus of the university where id jumped through academic hoops for so many years so many people gone i said now the wallace girls its as if everyones folding up their tents and escaping hey he said maybe they know something we dont the stripmall at olympic and westwood was dark except for the flagrant white glare from the minimart the store was quiet with a turbaned pakistani drinking gatorade behind the counter we stocked up on overpriced bread canned soup lunch meat cereal and milk the pakistani eyed us unpleasantly as he tallied up the total he wore a company shirt printed repetitively with the name of the marts parent company in lawn green the nametag pinned to his breast pocket was blank milo reached for his wallet i got mine out first and handed the clerk cash he continued to look unhappy whatsamatter said milo too much cholesterol in our diet the clerk pursed his lips and glanced up at the video camera above the door the machines cyclops eye was sweeping the store slowly the screen below filled with milky gray images we followed his gaze to the dairy case an unkempt man stood in front of it not moving staring at cartons of halfandhalf i hadnt noticed him while shopping and wondered where hed come from milo eyed him for a long moment then turned back to the clerk yeah police works strenuous he said in a loud voice got to shovel in those calories in order to catch the bad guys he laughed even louder it sounded almost mad the man at the dairy case twitched and half turned he glared at us for a second then returned to studying the cream he was gaunt and hairy wearing a dirtblackened army jacket jeans and beach sandals his hands shook and one clouded eye had to be blind another member of dorsey hewitts extended family he slapped the back of his neck with one hand turned again tried to match milos stare milo gave a salute evening pal the man didnt move for a second then he shoved his hands into his pockets and left the store sandals slapping the vinyl floor the clerk watched him go the cash register gave a computer burp and expelled a receipt the clerk tore off the tape and dropped it into one of the halfdozen bags wed filled got a box for all this said milo no sir said the clerk what about in back shrug we carried the food out the gaunt man was at the far end of the lot kicking asphalt and walking from store to store staring at black glass hey milo called out no response he repeated it pulled a cereal variety pack out of one of the bags and waved it over his head the man straightened looked toward us but didnt approach milo walked ten feet from him and underhanded the cereal the man shot his arms out missed the catch sank to his knees and retrieved it milo was heading back to the car and didnt see the look on the mans face confusion distrust then a spark of gratitude that fizzled just short of ignition the gaunt man hobbled off into the darkness fingers ripping at the plastic wrapping sprinkling cereal onto the pavement milo said lets get the hell out of here we got into the fiat and he drove around toward the back of the mall where three dumpsters sat several empty cartons were piled up loosely against the bins most of them torn beyond utility we finally found a couple that looked and smelled relatively clean put the bags in them and stashed the food in back of the car next to myra paprocks homicide file a sliver of moon was barely visible behind a cloudveil and the sky looked dirty the freeway was a stain topped with light and noise after we rounded exposition little calcutta continued to elude us the darkness and the plywood barrier concealed the lot totally but the place on the sidewalk where id talked to terminator three was just within the light of an ailing street lamp and i was able to point it out to milo we got out and found gaps in the plywood through them blue tongues quivered thin gaseous alcohol flames sterno i said milo said frugal gourmets i took him to the spot along the fence where id unhinged the makeshift hatch a few hours before extra wires had been added since then rusty and rough wound too tightly to unravel by hand milo took a swiss army knife out of his trouser pocket and flipped out a tiny plierslike tool twisting and snipping he managed to free the hatch we went back to the car took out the boxes of groceries and stepped through blue lights began extinguishing as if wed brought a hard wind milo reached into his trousers again and pulled out the penlight id used in the car id replaced it in the glove compartment and hadnt seen him pocket it he removed something from one of the grocery bags and shined the light on it plasticwrapped bologna slices he held it up and shouted food barely audible over the freeway fires continued to go out training his beam more directly on the bologna he waved the meat back and forth the package and the hand that held it seemed suspended in midair a special effect when nothing happened for several more seconds he placed the meat on the ground making sure to keep the penlight trained on it then removed more groceries from his bag and spread them out on the dirt walking backward toward the hatch he created a snaky trail of food that led out to the sidewalk goddamn hansel and gretel he muttered then he slipped back out i followed him he was standing against the fiat had emptied one bag and crumpled it and was tossing it from hand to hand as we stood there and waited cars rocketed overhead and the concrete hummed milo lit up a bad panatela and blew shortlived smoke rings a few minutes later he stubbed out his cigar and jammed it between his fingers walking back to the hatch he stuck his head through didnt move for a second then beckoned me to follow him through we stopped just a few feet from the hatch and he aimed the penlight upward highlighting movement about fifteen feet up frantic choppy a scramble of arms squinting i managed to make out human forms down on their knees scooping and snatching just as the man at the minimart had done within seconds they were gone and the food had vanished milo cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted over the freeway lots more folks nothing he clicked his light off and we retreated to the other side of the fence again it seemed like a game a futile one but he looked at ease he began emptying another bag placing food on the streetlit patch of sidewalk just out of reach of the hatch then he returned to the car sat on the rear deck causing the springs to groan and relit his cigar luring and trapping enjoying the hunt more time passed milos eyes kept shifting to the fence then leaving it his expression didnt change the cigar tilted as he bit down on it then he stayed on the fence a large dark hand was reaching out straining to grab a loaf of white bread milo went over and kicked the package away and the hand drew back sorry said milo no grain without pain he took his badge out and shoved it at the hatch just talk thats it he said nothing sighing he picked up the bread tossed it through the hatch picking up a can of soup he wiggled it make it a balanced meal pal a moment later a pair of unlaced sneakers appeared in the opening above them the frayed cuffs of greasylooking plaid pants and the bottom seam of an army blanket the head above the cloth remained unseen shielded by darkness milo held the soup can between thumb and forefinger new orleans gourmet gumbo lots more where this came from he said just for answering a few questions no hassles one plaid leg angled forward through the opening a sneaker hit the pavement then the other a man emerged into the streetlight wincing he had the blanket wrapped around him to the knees covering his head like a monks cowl and shrouding most of his face what showed of the skin was black and grainy the man took an awkward step as if testing the integrity of the sidewalk and the blanket dropped a bit his skull was big and half bald above a long bony face that looked caved in his beard was a kinky gray rash his skin cracked and caked fifty or sixty or seventy a battered nose so flat it almost merged with his crushed cheeks spreading like melted tar his eyes squinted and watered and didnt stop moving he had the white bread in his hand and was looking at the soup milo tried to give it to him the man hesitated working his jaws his eyes were quieter now know what a gift horse is said milo the man swallowed drawing his blanket around himself he squeezed the bread so hard the loaf turned into a figure eight i went over to him and said we just want to talk thats it he looked into my eyes his were jaundiced and clogged with blood vessels but something shone through maybe intelligence maybe just suspicion he smelled of vomit and alcohol belch and breath mints and his lips were as loose as a mastiffs i worked hard at standing my ground milo came up behind me and covered some of the stench with cigar smoke he put the soup up against the mans chest the man looked at it and finally took it but continued to stare at me you are not police his voice was surprisingly clear you are definitely not police true i said but he is the man glanced at milo and smiled rubbing the part of the blanket that covered his abdomen he shoved both hands under it secreting the bread and the soup a few questions friend said milo simple stuff nothing in life is simple said the man milo hooked a thumb at the bags on the sidewalk a philosopher theres enough there to feed you and your friends have a nice little party the man shook his head it could be poison why the hell would it be poison smile why not the worlds poison a while back someone gave someone a present and it was full of poison and someone died whered this happen mars seriously venus okay said milo blowing smoke suit yourself well ask our questions elsewhere the man licked his lips go ahead ive got the virus makes no difference to me the virus huh said milo dont believe me you can kiss me the man flicked his tongue the blanket fell to his shoulders underneath he wore a greasy bushquayle tshirt his neck and shoulders were emaciated ill pass said milo the man laughed bet you will now what gonna beat it out of me beat what out of you whatever you want youve got the power nah said milo this is the new lapd were new age sensitive guys the man laughed his breath was hot and emetic bearshit youll always be savages got to be to keep order milo said have a nice day and began to turn what do you want to know anyway anything about a citizen named lyle edward gritz said milo you know him like a brother that so yup said the man unfortunately this day and age families deteriorating and all that means not well at all milo looked over at the hatch he in there now nope see him recently nope but he did hang out here from time to time when was the last time the man ignored the question and began staring at me again what are you he said some kind of journalist riding along hes a doctor said milo oh yeah smile got any penicillin things get pretty infectious down here amoxicillin erythromycin tetracycline anything to zap those little cocci boogers i said im a psychologist ooh said the man as if wounded he closed his eyes and shook his head when he opened them they were dry and focused then youre not worth a damn to me pardon my linguistics gritz said milo can you tell me anything about him the man appeared to be contemplating white trash juicehead low iq but ablebodied he had no excuse ending up down here not that i do you probably think i was some kind of white collar overachiever dont you cause im black and i know grammar smiling i smiled back wrong he said i collected garbage professionally city of compton good pay you wear your gloves its fine terrific benefits my mistake was leaving and starting my own business vinyl flooring i did good work had six people working for me did fine until business slumped and i let the dope comfort me he produced one arm from under the blanket raised it and let the sleeve fall back from a bony forearm the underside of the limb was knotted with scars and abscesses keloidal and bunched raw in spots this is a fresh one he said eyeing a scab near his wrist got off just before sundown i waive my rights why dont you take me in give me a bunk for the night not my thing said milo not your thing the man laughed what are you some kind of liberal milo looked at him and smoked the man put his arm back well at least get me a real doctor so i can get hold of some methadone what about the county county ran out cant even get antibiotics from the county well said milo i can give you a lift to an emergency room if you want the man laughed again scornfully for what wait around all night with gunshots and heart attacks ive got no active diagnosis just the virus no symptoms yet so all theyll do is keep me waiting jails better they process you faster here said milo dipping into his pocket for his wallet he took out some bills and handed them to the man find a room keep the change the man gave a warm broad smile and tucked the money under his blanket thats real nice mr policeman you made this po unfortunate homeless individuals evening milo said was gritz into dope too just juice like i said white trash him and his hillbilly singing he liked to sing all the time this yodely whitetrash voice wanted to be elvis any talent the man shrugged did he ever get violent with anyone not that i saw what else can you tell me about him not much sticks to himself we all do this is little calcutta not some hippie commune he ever hang out with anyone not that i saw how about dorsey hewitt the mans lips pursed hewitt hewitt the one that did that caseworker you knew him no i read the paper when that fool did that i was worried backlash citizens coming down here and taking it out on all us po unfortunates you never met hewitt nope dont know if he and gritz were buddies how would i know that if i never met him someone told us gritz talked about getting rich sure he always did the fool gonna cut a record gonna be the next elvis pour a bottle down his gullet and he was number one on the charts the man turned to me what do you think my diagnosis is dont know you well enough i said they the interns over at county said i had an affective disease severe mood swings then they cut off my methadone he clicked his teeth together and waited for me to comment when i didnt he said supposedly i was using stuff to selfmedicate being my own psychiatrist he laughed bearshit i used it to be happy milo said back on track what else do you know about gritz thats it smile do i still get to keep the money is terminator three still here i said who a kid from arizona missing pinkie bad cough he has a girlfriend and a baby oh yeah wayne hes calling himself that now laughter nah they all packed up this afternoon like i said people come and go speaking of which he hooded himself with the blanket and keeping his eyes on us began edging toward the fence what about your room for the night said milo the man stopped and looked back nah ill camp out tonight fresh air grin milo laughed a little bit with him then eyed the food what about all this the man scrutinized the groceries yeah ill take some of that gatorade the pepsi too he picked up the beverages and stashed them under the blanket thats it said milo on a diet said the man you want you can bring the rest of it inside im sure someonell take it off your hands the hooded man led us through the darkness walking unsteadily but without hesitation like a wellpracticed blind man milo and i stumbled and fought to keep our balance hauling boxes with only the skimpy guidance of the penlight beam as we progressed i sensed human presence the heat of fear then the petrol sweetness of sterno urine shit tobacco mildew the ammonia of fresh semen the hooded man stopped and pointed to the ground we put the boxes down and a blue flame ignited then another the concrete wall came into focus in front of it bedrolls piles of newspaper bodies and faces bluelit by the flames suppertime chillun shouted the man over the noise of the freeway then he was gone more lights ten or so people appeared faceless sexless huddled like storm victims milo took something out of the box and held it out a hand reached out and snatched it more people collected around us blue tinted rabbity openmouthed with expectation milo leaned forward moving his mouth around his cigar what he said made some of the people bolt others stayed to listen and a few talked back he distributed more food i joined in feeling hands brush against mine finally our boxes were empty and we stood alone milo swung the penlight around the lot exposing cloth heaps leantos people eating the hooded black man sitting with his back up against the freeway wall plaid legs splayed one naked arm stretched out over a skinny thigh bound at the biceps by a coil of something elastic a beautiful smile on his face a needle buried deep in his flesh milo snapped his head away and lowered the beam cmon he said loud enough for me to hear he headed west rather than back toward beverly hills saying well that was a big goddamn zero none of them had anything to say the consensus for what its worth is that lyle gritz hasnt been seen for a week or two and that its no big deal he drifts in and out he did indeed mouth off a bit about getting rich before he split but theyve all heard that before the next elvis he nodded music fantasies not fish murder i pressed for details and one of them claimed to have seen him get into someones car a week or so ago across the street over at the cement yard but that same person seemed rather addled and had absolutely no clue as to make model color or any other distinguishing details and im not sure he didnt just say it because i was pushing ill see if gritzs name shows up on any recent arrest files you can ask jeffers if he was ever a patient at the center if he was maybe you can get her to point you in any direction he may have gone but even if we do find him im not convinced it means a damn thing now you up for a little reststop im still smelling that hellhole he drove to a cocktail lounge on wilshire in the drab part of santa monica neon highball glass above a quilted door id never been there but the way he pulled into the parking lot told me he knew it well inside the place wasnt much brighter than the overpass we washed our hands in the mens room and took stools at the bar the decor was red vinyl and nicotine the resident rummies seemed to be elderly and listless a few looked dead asleep the jukebox helped things along with lowvolume vic damone milo scooped up a handful of bar nuts and fed his face ordered a double chivas and didnt comment when i asked for a coke wheres the phone i said he pointed to a corner i called robin hows it going not bad she said the other man in my life and i are cuddled up watching a sitcom funny i dont think so and hes not laughing just drooling any progress not really but we did give away lots of food well she said good deeds dont hurt coming home milo wanted to stop for a drink depending on his mood i may need to drive him home go ahead and eat without us okay ill leave a light in the window and a bone in your dish though milo seemed coherent by the time we reached benedict canyon i suggested he sack out in one of the bedrooms and he agreed without protest when i awoke saturday morning at seven he was gone and the bed hed slept in was in perfect order at nine my pond maintenance people called to confirm theyd be moving the fish at two pm robin and i had breakfast then i drove to the biomed library i looked up wilbert harrison in the psychiatric section of the directory of medical specialists his most recent listing was ten years old an address on signal street in ojai no phone number i copied it down and read his bio medical education at columbia university and the menninger clinic a fellowship in social anthropology at uc santa barbara and a clinical appointment at the de bosch institute and corrective school the anthro training was interesting suggesting interests that stretched beyond private practice but hed had no academic appointments and his fields of specialty were psychoanalysis and the treatment of impaired physicians and health professionals his birthdate made him sixtyfive old enough to have retired the move to ojai from beverly hills and the lack of a phone listing implied a yearning for the quiet life i flipped forward to the rs and found harvey rosenblatts citation complete with the nyu affiliation and an office on east sixtyfifth street in manhattan same address as the shirley id been trying to reach had she ignored my call because they were no longer together divorced or something worse i read on rosenblatt had graduated from nyu done his clinical training at bellevue the robert evanston hale psychoanalytic institute in manhattan and southwick hospital in england fields of specialty psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy fiftyeight years old he was listed in the next volume of the directory too i worked my way forward in time until his name no longer appeared four years ago right between the paprock and shipler murders youre wondering if theyve been visited too one way to check like most house organs the journal of the american medical association ran obituaries each month i went up to the stacks and retrieved bound copies four and five years old for rosenblatt ten and eleven for harrison there were no notices on either psychiatrist but maybe they hadnt bothered to join the ama i consulted the american journal of psychiatry nothing there either perhaps neither man had been a member of the specialty guild bound copies of the american psychological association directory were just a few aisles over the fiveyearold listing on katarina de bosch that id found in my volume at home was indeed her last no death notice on her either so maybe i was working myself up for nothing i thought of another possible way to locate addresses bylines in scientific publications the index medicus and psychological abstracts revealed that katarina had coauthored a couple of articles with her father but nothing since his death one of them had to do with child rearing and contained a reference to bad love the process of motherchild bonding forms the foundation for all intimate relationships and disruptions in this process plant the seed of psychopathology in later life good love the nurturant altruistic psychosocial suckling by the motherparenting figure contributes to the childs sense of security and hence molds his ability to form stable attachments bad love the abuse of parental authority creates cynicism alienation hostility and in the worst cases violent actingout that is the childs attempt to seek retribution from the breast that has failed him retribution the abuse of parental authority someone had been failed someone was seeking revenge i checked for articles by harrison and rosenblatt neither had published a word no great surprise most practitioners never get into print but it still seemed odd that i couldnt locate any of them one therapist to go the social worker mitchell lerner hed been last counted a member in good standing of the national social work organization six years ago i made a note of his office address on laurel canyon and the accompanying phone number ba from cal state northridge msw from berkeley clinical training at san francisco general hospital followed by two years as a staff social worker at the corrective school another disciple under specialties hed listed family therapy and substance abuse not hoping for much i took the stairs back up to the stacks and pulled out six and sevenyearold bound volumes of the social work journal no obits on him either but a paragraph headed suspensions just below the death notices in a december issue caught my eye a list followed thirteen clinical social workers dropped by the organization because of ethics violations dead center among the names lerner mitchell a no details were given about his or any of the others sins the state board of behavioral science examiners was closed for the weekend so i jotted down the date hed been expelled and made a note to call first thing monday morning figuring id learned as much as i could from books i left the library back at the house on benedict robin was working and the dog looked bored he followed me into the house and slavered as i fixed myself a sandwich i did some paperwork and shared my lunch with him and he tagged along as i walked outside to the seville where to said robin the house i want to make sure the fish get transferred okay she gave a doubtful look but said nothing therell be plenty of people around i said she nodded and looked over at the car the dog was pawing the front bumper it made her smile someones in a traveling mood why dont you take him along sure but pond drainage isnt his thing the water phobia why dont you try some therapy with him why not i said this could be the start of a whole new career the fourman crew had arrived early and when i got there the pond was half empty the waterfall switched off and the fish transferred to aerated blue vats that sat in the bed of a pickup truck workers uprooted plants and bagged them shoveled gravel and checked the air lines to the vats i checked in with the crew boss a skinny brown kid with blond rasta locks and a dyed white chin beard the dog kept his distance but followed me as i went up to the terrace to pick up two days worth of mail lots of stuff most of it routine the exception was a long white envelope cheap paper that id seen before sherman bucklear attorneyatlaw above a return address in simi valley inside was a letter informing me that petitioner donald dell wallace had good reason to believe that i had knowledge of the whereabouts of said petitioners legal offspring chondra nicolette wallace and tiffani starr wallace and was demanding that i pass along said information to said petitioners attorney without delay so that said petitioners legal rights would not be abridged the rest consisted of threats in legalese i put the letter back in the envelope and pocketed it the dog was scratching at the front door nostalgic already i unlocked the door and he ran ahead of me straight into the kitchen straight to the refrigerator milos spiritual son scratch scratch pant pant i realized that in all the haste of moving id forgotten to remove the perishables from the fridge i did a quick visual survey of the shelves spilled out milk and dumped cheese that had turned and fruit that was beginning to brown putting the unspoiled food in a bag i thought of the people under the freeway some meatloaf remained in a plastic container it smelled okay and the dog looked as if hed seen the messiah okay okay i put it in a bowl and set it down before him bagged the good fruits and vegetables and brought them down to the car the pond crew was finishing up the koi in the truck all seemed to be swimming fine the crew boss said okay weve got the sump running itll take another hour or so to drain off you want us to wait we can but youre paying us by the hour so you can stick around and turn it off yourself no problem i said glancing at the truck take care of them sure when do you think youll be wanting em back dont know yet some kind of long vacation something like that cool he handed me a bill and got behind the wheel of the truck a moment later they were gone and all i heard was the slow gurgle of draining water i sat down on the bank of what was now a muddy hole waiting and watching the level drop the heat and the quiet combined to lull me and i wasnt sure how long id been there when someone said hey i jerked up groggily a man stood in the gateway holding a tire iron late twenties or early thirties heavy growth of dark stubble thick black fu manchu that drooped to his chin he had on greasy jeans and wellington boots with chains a black tshirt under a heavy black leather vest black thinning hair gold hoop earring steel chains around his neck big tattooed arms big hard belly bowlegs maybe six one two hundred redrimmed eyes at sunnys sun valley next door to rodriguezs masonry yard hed been wearing a black cap that said cat the muscular guy at the bar who hadnt said much he whistled once and came closer let one hand drop from the iron lowered the metal swung it parallel to his leg in a slow small arc and came a few steps closer looked at my face his wore a slow lazy smile of recognition retaining wall huh what do you want donalds kids man deep slurry voice he sounded as if hed come straight from the bar theyre not here where man i dont know the iron arc widened i said why would i know you were lookin for the little brown brother man maybe you found him i didnt maybe you did man stepping forward just a few feet away now lots of missing teeth mustache clogged with dandruff an angry pus pimple had erupted under his left eye the tattoos were badly done a greenblue riot of female torsos bloody blades and gothic lettering i said i already got a letter from wallaces lawyer fuck that he came within swinging range smelling like the bottom of a clothes hamper that needed emptying i backed up not much room to maneuver behind me was shrubbery hedges and the maple tree whose branch had been used to skewer the koi youre not helping donald dell i said this wont look good for him who gives a fuck man youre off the case he swung the iron listlessly pointing downward and hitting the dirt looking at the pond just for a second then back at me i searched the area for possible weapons slim pickings oversized polyethylene bags left behind by the pond crew lengths of rubber hosing a couple of sheets of scummy filter screen maybe the koi net six feet of stout oak handle below a steelmesh cup but it was out of reach since when i said what since when am i off the case since we said so man the iron priests wherere the kids man i told you i dont know he shook his head and advanced dont get hurt over it man its just a job what the fuck you like fish i said huh fish finny creatures seafood piscinoids hey ma you like to sneak around spearing em breaking branches off trees and doing the old rotisserie bit what youve been here before havent you sportfishing carp you sick fuck confusion tugged at his face zipping it up into something peevish and tight and offering a hint of what hed look like on the offchance he made it to old age then anger took its place a brattish resentment and he lifted the iron and took a poke at my middle i danced away hey he said annoyed he jabbed again missed sloshed but not enough to stagger and there was force in his movements here chickie chick he laughed i kept moving away from his blows managed to get up on the rock rim of the pond the stones were slick with algae and i used my arms for balance that made him laugh some more he shouted came after me clumsy and slow caught up in the game as if it were what hed come for he began making barnyard clucks i split my focus between the iron and his eyes readying myself for the chance to use surprise and his own weight against him if i missed my hand would get shattered boom boom boom he said chickiechick cmon stupid i said his face puffed up and reddened twohanding the iron he made a sudden swing for my knees i jumped back stumbled pitched forward onto the pond rim breaking my fall with my palms the iron landed on rock and clanged he raised it high over his head the next sounds came from behind him deep bark angry snorts he wheeled toward them holding the iron in front of his own chest in instinctive defense just in time to see the bulldog racing toward him a little black bullet its teeth bared in a pearly grimace just in time for me to spring to my feet and throw my arms around his front not enough force to knock him over but i got my hands on the ends of the iron and slammed it hard into his rib cage something cracked he said ohh sounding curiously girlish buckled bent the dog was on him now fixing his teeth on denim leg shaking his head from side to side growling and spraying spit the mans back was pushing against me i pressed up on the iron sharply forcing it under his chin got it against his adams apple and pulled in steadily until he made gagging noises and started to loosen his grip i held on finally he dropped his arms and let his full weight fall against me struggling to remain on my feet i let him sink to the ground hoping i hadnt destroyed his larynx but not torturing myself over it the dog stayed on him grunting and eating denim the man sank to the dirt i felt for a pulse nice and steady and he was already starting to move and groan i looked for something to bind him the polyethylene bags telling the dog stay i ran to get them i tied them together managed to fashion two thick plastic ropes and used one to secure his hands behind his back the other his legs the dog had stepped back to watch me head cocked i said you did great spike but you dont get to eat this one how about sirloin instead its higher grade the man opened his eyes tried to speak but produced only a retching cough the front of his neck was swollen and a deep blue bruise that matched his tattooes was starting to blossom the dog padded over to him the mans eyes sparked he turned his head away and grimaced in pain i said stay spike no blood the dog looked up at me with soft eyes that i hoped wouldnt betray him the man coughed and choked the dogs nostrils opened and shut saliva dripped from his maw and he growled good boy spike i said watch him for a sec and if he gives you any problems youre allowed to rip out his throat for an appetizer what an idiot said milo putting his notepad away his names hurley keffler and hes got a sheet but not much of one more of a bad guy wannabee we found his bike parked down the road he claims he wasnt stalking you got here just as the pond people drove away and decided to have a talk just one of those impulsive weekend jaunts huh yeah we were up on the landing watching the police cars drive away the dog watched too sticking his flat face through the slats of the railing ears pricked i found a letter from the wallaces lawyer in my mailbox i said he wanted to know where the girls were and threatened me with legal action if i didnt tell him looks like the priests decided not to wait it might not be an official priest mission he said just keffler having a few too many and deciding to improvise his dinky record hes probably low man in the gang trying to impress the hairy brothers what are you booking him on adw trespassing dui if his blood alcohols high enough to prove he drove over here soused if the priests go his bail hell probably be out within a few days ill have a talk with them tell them to lock him in the house what a clown he chuckled bet your little chokehold didnt do much for his powers of comprehension either whatd you use one of those karate things im always ribbing you about actually i said bending and patting the dogs muscular neck he gets the credit pulled a sneak attack from the back that allowed me to jump keffler plus he overcame his water phobia ran right up to the pond no kidding smile okay ill put him up for sainthood he bent too and rubbed the dog behind the ears congrats st doggus youre a k hero the driver of one of the blackandwhites looked up at us and milo waved him on good boy i said to the dog seeing as hes saved your kneecaps alex dont you think he deserves a real name my votes still for rover when i was trying to intimidate keffler i called him spike very manly only problem is i said hes already got a name someones bound to come get him what a drag im getting kind of attached to him what he elbowed my ribs gently were afraid of getting hurt so we dont reach out for intimacy give him a goddamn name alex empower him so he can fulfill his dogly potential i laughed and rubbed the dog some more he panted and put his head against my leg kefflers not the one who killed the koi i said when i mentioned it he fuzzed over completely probably he said that tree branch was too subtle for the priests they would have taken out all the fish and mashed em up maybe eaten them and left the bones back to our bad love fiend i said anything new on lyle gritz not yet i was over at the library this morning checking out the professional directories no current listings on rosenblatt or katarina de bosch harrison moved to ojai and has no phone number which sounds like retirement and the social worker lerner was suspended from the social work organization for an ethics violation what kind of violation the directory didnt say whats it usually mean sleeping with a patient thats the most common but it could also be financial shenanigans betrayal of confidentiality or a personal problem like drug or alcohol addiction he rested his arms on the top of the railing the squad cars were gone now my pond was a dry hole and the sump pump was sucking air i went down to the garden dog at my heels and turned it off when i got back milo said if lerner was a bad boy he could have done something that pissed off a patient sure i said i looked up de boschs writings on bad love specifically it refers to abuse of parental authority leading to alienation cynicism and in extreme cases violence de bosch actually used the term retribution but pardon the whining i still dont know what the hell i could have done why dont you try to get in touch with harrison in ojai see if he has any idea whats going on if his numbers unlisted i can get it for you okay i said and harrison may be a good source for another reason when therapists are suspended theyre usually required to get therapy one of harrisons specialties was treating impaired therapists wouldnt it be interesting if he treated lerner its not that farfetched lerner turning to someone he knew get me that number right now and ill call he went to his car and got on the radio returned ten minutes later and said no listing at all even though the address is still on the tax roles can you spare the time for a little drive ojais nice this time of year cute little shops antiques whatever take the lovely miss c for a cruise up the coast combine business with pleasure get out of town for a while he shrugged okay i said and ojais close to santa barbara i can extend my trip de boschs school is defunct but it might be interesting to see if any of the neighbors remember it maybe there was some kind of scandal something that closed it down and left someone with a longterm grudge sure snoop around if robin can stand it who am i to try and stop you he slapped my back im off where to a little more research on paprock and shipler anything new nope im planning to drop in on paprocks husband tomorrow hes still a car salesman at the cadillac place and sundays a good day for those guys ill go with you thought you were cruising to ojai monday i said mondays a good day for psychologists oh yeah whys that blue day for everyone else we get to concentrate on other peoples problems and forget our own i went back into the house and looked through the freezer in our haste to move we hadnt emptied it and there were several steaks in the top compartment i took out a choicecut rib eye and put it in the oven to broil the dogs eyes were glued to my every move as the aroma of broiling meat filled the kitchen his nose started to go crazy and he got down on the floor in a supplicatory posture restrain the caballos i said all good things come to those who salivate i petted him and called my service for messages only one from jean jeffers the clinic director had called at eleven am leaving an return number did she say what it was about i asked the operator no just to call her doctor i did and got an answering tape with a friendlysounding male voice backgrounded by neil diamond i was starting to leave a message when jeans voice broke in hi thanks for calling back hi whats up i thought i heard her sigh ive got some i think it would be best if we met personally something about hewitt somethi im sorry id rather just talk about it in person if you dont mind sure where and when would you like to meet tomorrow would be okay for me tomorrows fine great she said where do you live west la im in studio city but i dont mind coming over the hill on the weekend i can come out to the valley no actually i like to come out when its not for work never get a chance to enjoy the city whereabouts in west la near beverly hills okay how about amandas its a little place on beverly drive what time say one pm one it is nervous laughter i know this must seem strange coming out of the blue but maybe oh lets just talk about it tomorrow i gave the dog a few bites of steak wrapped the rest in plastic and pocketed it then we drove to the pet store where i let him sniff around the food bags he lingered at some stuff that claimed to be scientifically formulated organic ingredients twice the cost of any of the others you earned it i said and i purchased ten pounds along with several packets of assorted canine snacks going home he munched happily on a baconflavored pretzel bon appetit spike i said your real names probably something like pierre de cordon bleu back at the house on benedict canyon i found robin reading in the living room i told her what had happened with hurley keffler and she listened quiet and resigned as if i were a delinquent child with no hope of rehabilitation what a good friend you turned out to be she said to the dog he jumped up on the couch and put his head in her lap so what are they going to do with him this keffler hell be in jail for a while how longs a while probably not long his gangs likely to make his bail and then and then hell be out but he wont know this address okay want to take a drive up to ojai and santa barbara next couple of days business or pleasure both i told her about lerner and harrison my wanting to speak to the corrective schools neighbors love to but i really shouldnt alex too much work down here sure i am hon sorry she touched my face theres so much piled up and even though ive got all my gear set up it feels different here im working slower need to get back on the track im really putting you through it arent i no she said smiling and mussing my hair youre the one being put through the smile lingered and grew into a soft laugh whats funny i said the way men think as if our going through some stress together would be putting me through it im worried about you but im glad to be here with you to be part of it putting me through it means something totally different such as constantly diminishing me condescending to me dismissing my opinions anything that would make me question my worth do those kinds of things to a woman and she may stay with you but shell never think the same of you oh oh she said laughing and hugging me pretty profound huh are you mad at me for not wanting to go to ojai no just disappointed you go anyway promise to be careful i promise good she said thats important we had dinner at an indian place near beverly hills eastern border with la washing the meal down with clove tea and driving home feeling good robin went to run a bath and i phoned milo at home and told him about jeans call she has something to tell me but wouldnt elaborate over the phone sounded nervous my guess is she found something about hewitt that scares her im meeting her at one and ill ask her about gritz when were you planning to see ralph paprock right around then care to make it earlier dealership wont be open i suppose we could catch him just as he comes in ill pick you up sunday morning i drove to west hollywood milos and ricks place was a small perfectly kept spanish house at the end of one of those short obscure streets that hide in the grotesque shadow of the design centers bluegreen mass cedarssinai was within walking distance sometimes rick jogged to work today he hadnt the white porsche was gone milo was waiting outside the small front lawn had been replaced by ground cover and the flowers were blooming bright orange he saw me looking at it and said drought resistant as he got into the car that environmental designer i told you about guy would upholster the world in cactus if he could i took laurel canyon up into the valley passing stiltbox houses and postmodern cabins the decaying palladian estate where houdini had done tricks for jean harlow a governor had once lived right around there none of the magic had rubbed off at ventura i turned left and traveled two miles to valley vista cadillac the showroom was fronted by twentyfoot slabs of plate glass and bordered by a huge outdoor lot banners were strung on hightension wire the lights were off but morning sun managed to get in and bounce off the sparkling bodies of brandnew coupes and sedans the cars out on the lot were blinding a trim black man in a wellcut navy suit stood next to a smokegray seville when he saw us get out of my seventynine he went over to the front door and unlocked it even though business hours hadnt begun when milo and i stepped in his hand was out and his smile was blooming brighter than milos lawn he had a perfectly trimmed pencil mustache and a pincollar shirt as white as an avalanche off to the side of the showroom beyond the cars was a warren of cubicles and i could hear someone talking on the phone the cars were spotless and perfectly detailed the whole place smelled of leather and rubber and conspicuous consumption my car had smelled that way once even though id bought it used someone had told me the fragrance came in aerosol cans thats a classic youve got said the man looking through the window been good to me i said keep it and garage it thats what id do one of these days youll see it appreciate like money in the bank meanwhile you can be driving something new for every day good lines this year dont you think very nice got those foreign deals beat hands down get folks in to actually test drive they see that you a lawyer psychologist he gave an uncertain smile and i found a business card in my hand john allbright sales executive got a real good suspension this year too he said with all due respect to your classic i think youll find it a whole other world drivewise great sound system too if you go for the bose option and were looking for ralph paprock said milo allbright looked at him squinted put his hand to his mouth and compressed his smile manually ralph he said sure ralphs over there pointing to the cubicles he walked away fast ending up in a glass corner where he lit up a cigarette and stared out at the lot the first two compartments were empty ralph paprock sat behind a desk in the third he was in his late forties narrow and tan with sparse grayblond hair on top and a bit more of it on the sides combed over his ears his doublebreasted suit was the same cut as allbrights olive green just a bit too bright his shirt was cream with a longpoint collar his tie crowded with parrots and palm trees he was hunched over some papers the tip of his tongue protruded from the corner of his narrow mouth the pen in his right hand tapped his blotter very fast his nails were shiny when milo cleared his throat the tongue zipped in and an eager grin took hold of paprocks face despite the smile his face was tired the muscles loose and droopy his eyes were small and amber the suit gave them a khaki tint gentlemen how can i help you milo said mr paprock im detective sturgis los angeles police and handed him a card the look that took hold of the salesman next what are you hitting me with this timemade me feel lousy we had nothing to offer him and plenty to take he put his pen down i caught a side view of a photo on his desk propped up next to a mug printed with the cadillac crest two roundfaced fairhaired children the younger one a girl was smiling but the boy seemed to be on the verge of tears behind them hovered a woman of around seventy with butterfly glasses and coldwaved white hair she resembled paprock but she had a stronger jaw milo said sorry to bother you mr paprock but weve come across another homicide that might be related to your wifes and wondered if we could ask you a few questions another a new one said paprock i didnt see anything on the news not exactly sir this crime occurred three years ago three years ago three years and youve just come across it did you finally get him no sir jesus paprocks hands were flat on the desk and his forehead had erupted in sweat he wiped it with the back of one hand just what i need to start off the week there were two chairs facing his desk he stared at them but didnt say anything else milo motioned me into the office and closed the door behind us there was very little standing room paprock held a hand out to the chairs and we sat a certificate behind the desk said hed been a prizewinning salesman the date was three summers ago whos the other victim he said a man named rodney shipler a man yes sir a man i dont understand you dont recognize the name no and if it was a man what makes you think it has anything to do with my myra the words bad love were written at the crime scene bad love said paprock i used to dream about that make up different meanings for it but still he closed his eyes opened them took a bottle out of his desk drawer enteric aspirin popping a couple of tablets he dropped the bottle into his breast pocket behind the colored handkerchief what kind of meanings said milo paprock looked at him crazy stuff trying to figure out what the hell it meant i dont remember whats the difference he began moving his hands around stirring the air very quickly as if searching for something to grab was there any some sign of was this shipler what im getting at is was there something sexual no sir paprock said cause thats what they told me they thought it might mean the first cops some psychotic thing using sex in a bad way some sort of sex nut a pervert bragging about what he did bad love nothing like that had been in myra paprocks file milo nodded a man said paprock so what are you telling me the first cops had it all wrong they went and looked for the wrong thing we dont really know much at all at this point sir just that someone wrote bad love at the scene of mr shiplers homicide shipler paprock squinted youre opening the whole thing up again cause of him were taking a look at the facts mr paprock paprock closed his eyes opened them and took a deep breath my myra was taken apart i had to identify her to you that kind of things probably old hat but shake of the head its never old hat sir paprock gave him a doubtful look after i did it identified her it took me a long time to be able to remember her the way she used to be even now the first cops said whoever did those things to her did them after she was dead alarm brightened his eyes they were right about that werent they yes sir paprocks hands gripped the edge of his desk and he wheeled forward tell me the truth detective i mean it i dont want to think of her suffering but if no forget it dont tell me a damn thing i dont want to know she didnt suffer sir the only thing new is mr shiplers murder more sweat another wipe afterwards said paprock after i identified her i had to go tell my kids the older one anyway the little one was just a baby actually the older one wasnt much more than a baby either but he was asking for her i had to tell him something he knocked the knuckles of both hands together shook his head tapped the desk it took a helluva long time to get it set in my mind what had happened when i went to tell my boy all i could think of was what id seen in the morgue imagining her and here he is asking for mommy mommy mommy he was two and a half i told him mommy got sick and went to sleep forever when his sister got old enough i gave him the job of telling her theyre great kids my mothers been helping me take care of them shes close to eighty and they dont give her any problems so who needs to change that who needs myras name in the papers and digging it all up there was a time finding out who did it was all that mattered to me but i got over that whats the difference anyway shes not coming back right i nodded milo didnt move paprock touched his brow and opened his eyes wide as if exercising the lids that it he said just a few questions about your wifes background said milo her background her work background mr paprock before she became a real estate agent did she do anything else why just collecting facts sir she worked for a bank okay what kind of work did this shipler do he was a janitor what bank did she work for trust federal over in encino she was a loan officer thats how i met her we used to channel our car loans through there and one day i went down there on a big fleet sale and she was at the loan desk milo took out his notepad and wrote she would have probably made vice president said paprock she was smart but she wanted to work for herself had enough of bureaucracies so she studied for her brokers license at night then quit was doing real well lots of sales he looked off to one side fixing his gaze on a poster two perfectlooking tennisclad people getting into a turquoise coupe de ville with diamondbright wire wheels behind the car the marbleandglass facade of a resort hotel crystal chandelier perfectlooking doorman smiling at them bureaucracies said milo did she deal with any others before the bank yeah said paprock still turned away she taught school but that was before i met her here in la no up near santa barbara goleta goleta said milo do you remember the name of the school paprock faced us again some public school why what does her work have to do with anything maybe nothing sir but please bear with me did she ever teach in la not to my knowledge by the time she moved down here she was fed up with teaching whys that the whole situation kids not interested in learning lousy pay whats to like about it a public school i said yeah milo said what subjects did she teach all of them i guess she taught fifth grade or maybe it was fourth i dunno in elementary school you teach all the subjects right we never really had any detailed discussions about it did she teach anywhere before goleta said milo not as far as i know i think that was her first job out of school when would that be lets see she graduated at twentytwo shed be forty this may he winced so that would have been what eighteen years ago i think she taught maybe four or five years then she switched to banking he looked at the poster again and wiped his forehead milo closed his pad the sound made paprock jump his eyes met milos milo gave as gentle a smile as id ever seen him muster thanks for your time mr paprock is there anything else you want to tell us sure said paprock i want to tell you to find the filthy fuck who killed my wife and put me in a room with him he rubbed his eyes made two fists and opened them and gave a sick smile fat chance milo and i stood a second later paprock rose too he was mediumsized slightly roundbacked almost dainty he patted his chest removed the aspirin bottle from his breast pocket and passed it from hand to hand walking around the desk he pushed the door open and held it for us no sign of john allbright or anyone else paprock walked us through the showroom touching the flanks of a gold eldorado in passing whyncha buy a car as long as youre here he said then he colored through his tan and stopped milo held out his hand paprock shook it then mine we thanked him again for his time look he said what i said before about not wanting to know that was bullshit i still think about her i got married again it lasted three months my kids hated the bitch myra was special the kids someday theyre gonna have to know ill handle it i can handle it you find something you tell me okay you find anything you tell me i headed for coldwater canyon and the drive back to the city public school near santa barbara i said lousy pay so maybe she moonlighted at a local private place a reasonable assumption said milo he lowered the sevilles passenger window lit up a bad cigar and blew smoke out at the hot valley air the city was digging up ventura boulevard and sawhorses blocked one lane bad traffic usually made milo curse this time he kept quiet puffing and thinking i said shipler was a school janitor maybe he worked at de boschs school too that could be our connection they were both staffers not patients twenty years ago wonder how long the school district keeps records ill check see if shipler transferred down from santa barbara more reasons for me to drive up there i said when are you doing it tomorrow robin cant make it all for the best between trying to find remnants of the school and looking for wilbert harrison in ojai it wont be a pleasure trip those other guys the therapists at the symposium they worked at the school too right harrison and lerner did but not rosenblatt he trained with de bosch in england im not sure about stoumen but he was a contemporary of de bosch and katarina asked him to speak so there was probably some kind of relationship so one way or the other it all boils down to de bosch anyone seen as being close to him is fair game for this nut bad love destroying a kids sense of trust huh thats the concept i reached coldwater and started the climb he drew on his cigar and said paprock was right about his wife you saw the pictures she was taken apart poor guy i said walking wounded what i told him about her being dead when she was raped true but she suffered alex sixtyfour stab wounds and plenty of them landed before she died that kind of revenge rage someone must have gotten fucked up bigtime i made it to beverly hills with five minutes to spare for my one oclock with jean jeffers parking was a problem and i had to use a city lot two blocks down from amandas waiting at the curb as a contemplative valet decided whether or not to put up the full sign he finally let me in and i arrived at the restaurant five minutes late the place was jammed and it reeked of parmesan cheese a hostess was calling out names from a clipboarded list and walking the chosen across a deliberately cracked white marble floor the tables were marble too and a gray fauxmarble treatment had been given to the walls the crypt look nice and cold but the room was hot with impatience and i had to elbow my way through a cranky crowd i looked around and saw jean already seated at a table near the back next to the south wall of the restaurant she waved the man next to her looked at me but didnt move i recalled him as the heavyset fellow from the photo in her office a little heavier a little grayer in the picture he and jean had been wearing leis and matching hawaiian shirts today theyd kept the bobbsey twins thing going with a white linen dress for her white linen shirt for him and matching yellow golf sweaters i waved back and went over they had halfempty coffee cups in front of them and pieces of buttered olive bread on their bread plates the man had an executive haircut and an executive face great shave sunburnt neck blue eyes the skin around them slightly bagged jean rose a little as i sat down he didnt though his expression was friendly enough this is my husband dick jeffers dick dr alex delaware doctor mr jeffers he smiled as he shot out his arm dick alex fair enough i sat down across from them both their yellow sweaters had crossed tennisracquet logos his bore a small gold masonic pin well said jean some crowd hope the foods good beverly hills said her husband the good life she smiled at him looked down at her lap a large white purse sat there and one of her arms was around it dick jeffers said guess ill be going jeanie nice to meet you doctor same here okay honey said jean cheek pecks then jeffers stood he seemed to lose balance for a second caught himself by resting one palm on the table jean looked away from him as he straightened he shoved the chair back with the rear of his thighs and gave me a wink then he walked off limping noticeably jean said he has one leg just got a brand new prosthesis and its taking a while getting used to it sounded like something shed said many times before i said that can be tough years ago i worked with children with missing limbs did you she said well dick lost his in an auto accident pain in her eyes i said recently oh no several years ago before anyone really appreciated the value of seat belts he was driving a convertible was unbelted got hit from behind and thrown out another car ran over his leg terrible thank god he wasnt killed i met him when he was in rehab i was doing a rotation at rancho los amigos and he was there for a couple of months he made a great adjustment to his appliance always had until it started bothering him a few months ago hell get used to the new one hes a good guy very determined i smiled so she said how are you fine and intrigued by your call oh the sheet of hair fell over her eye she let it stay there well i didnt mean to be overly dramatic its just she looked around why dont we order first and then we can talk about it we read the menu someone in the kitchen had a thing for balsamic vinegar when she said well i know what i want i waved over a waiter asian kid around nineteen with a waistlength ponytail and ten stud earrings rimming the outer cartilage of his left ear it hurt to look at him and i stared at the table as jean ordered an insalata something or other i asked for linguine marinara and an iced tea ruined ear came back quickly with the drink and a refill of her coffee when he left she said so you live pretty close to here not far for a while dick and i thought about moving over the hill but then prices started to go crazy theyve slid quite a bit recently not enough she smiled not that im complaining dicks an aerospace engineer and he does well but you never know when the governments going to cancel a project the place weve got in studio city is really pretty nice she looked at her watch hes probably over at rudnicks now he likes to shop there for sweaters hes not having lunch what i need to talk to you about is confidential dick understands that so why did i bring him with me right to be honest its because im still shaky still havent gotten used to being alone i dont blame you dont you think i should be past it by now i probably wouldnt be thats a very nice thing to say its the truth another smile she reached over and touched my hand just for a second then back to her coffee cup im sleeping a little better she said but still far from perfect in the beginning id be up all night heart pounding away nauseated now i can get to sleep but sometimes i still wake up all in a knot sometimes the thought of going to work makes me just want to crawl back in bed dick works in westchester near the airport so sometimes we take one car and he drops me off and picks me up i guess ive become pretty dependent on him she gave a small smile the unspoken message for a change meanwhile im telling the staff and the patients theres nothing to worry about nothing like consistency ear brought the food this looks yum she said pushing her fork around in her salad bowl but she didnt eat and one arm stayed around her purse i tried a little linguine memories of school lunch she nibbled on a piece of lettuce dabbed at her mouth looked around unsnapped the purse you have to promise me to keep this absolutely confidential she said at least where you got it from okay does it relate to hewitt in a way mostly its nothing that can help detective sturgis not that i can see anyway i shouldnt even be showing it to you but people are being harassed and i know what its like to feel besieged so if this does lead anywhere please keep me out of it please all right i said thank you she inhaled shoved her hand into the purse and drew out a legalsized envelope white clean unmarked she held on to it the paper made her nails look especially red remember how sketchy beckys notes on hewitt were she said how i made excuses for her saying shed been a good therapist but not big on paperwork well it bothered me more than i let on even for becky that was cursory i guess i just didnt want to deal with anything related to her murder but after you left i kept thinking about it and went looking to see if shed taken any other notes that had somehow been misfiled with all the upheaval right after housekeeping wasnt exactly a high priority i didnt find anything so i asked mary my secretary she said all beckys active charts had been distributed to other caseworkers but it was possible some of her inactive files might have ended up in our storage room so she and i took some time on friday and looked around for a few hours and sure enough stuck in a corner was a box with beckys initials on itrb who knows how it got there inside was junk that had been removed from her desk pens paper clips whatever underneath all that was this her hand shook slightly as she handed me the envelope i removed the contents three sheets of horizontalruled chart paper slightly grimy and bearing deep fold marks each partially filled with typed notations the

said putting the papers down physical contact she said miserably i went over and over it and its the only thing that makes sense i reread the notes i think youre right hewitt was getting attached to her progressively more physical she shuddered look at the last one she let him kiss her she must have totally lost control of the situation i had no idea she never told me she obviously thought of telling youtalk to jj but she didnt follow through look what she wrote right after that i read out loud worth the progress yes sounds like she convinced herself she was helping him she convinced herself she knew what she was doing she shook her head and looked down at the table my god beginners euphoria i said she was such a sweet thing so naive i should have kept a closer eye on her maybe if i had it couldve been prevented she pushed her salad away her hair hung in a sheet her head rested in her hands and i heard her sigh i said hewitt was psychotic jean who knows what set him off she looked up letting him kiss her sure didnt help she talks about setting limits but he probably saw it as rejection what with his paranoia shed allowed her voice to climb the man at the next table looked up from his cappuccino jean smiled at him picked up her napkin and wiped her face i scanned the notes again yeah therapy rah rah she held out her hand i need them back i gave her the papers and she slipped them back in the envelope i said what are you going to do with them destroy them can you just imagine what the media would do with it blaming becky turning the whole thing into something sleazy please alex keep it to yourself i dont want to see becky victimized a second time she flipped her hair again also to be perfectly honest i dont want to be blamed for not supervising her it took guts for you to show it to me i said guts she laughed softly stupidity maybe but for some reason i trust you i dont even know why i did show it to you getting it off my chest i guess she put the envelope in her purse and shook her head again how could she have let it happen she talks about him trying to touch her and kiss her but what i got between the lines was her developing some sort of feelings for him all that pcing as if it was a cute little game dont you agree fondness for him definitely comes across i said whether or not it was sexual i dont know even if it was plain affection it was irrational the man was psychotic couldnt even keep himself clean and this g person she keeps mentioning i still have no idea who that is probably hewitts girlfriend some other psychotic he met on the street and dragged in with him becky was getting herself involved in a love triangle with psychotics for gods sake how could she she was naive but she was bright how could she have shown such poor judgment she probably didnt think she was doing anything wrong jean otherwise why would she have kept notes but if she thought what she was doing was okay why not keep those notes right in hewitts chart good point i said its a mess i should have supervised her more closely i should have been more in touch i just cant understand how she could have let him get that close to her countertransference i said happens all the time with someone like that prison therapists get attached to convicts who knows what causes attraction i should have known no sense blaming yourself no matter how closely you supervise someone you cant be with them twentyfour hours a day she was trained jean it was up to her to tell you i tried to supervise her i made appointments but she broke more than she kept still i could have clamped down further i shouldve if id had any idea she never gave a hint always had a smile on her face like one of those kids who works at disneyland she was happy i said she thought she was curing him yup what a mess i probably showed it to you because you were sympathetic and im still so uptight over what happened i thought i could talk to you you can i appreciate that she said wearily but lets be honest what good will more talking do beckys dead and im going to have to live with the fact that i might have been able to prevent it i dont see it that way you did all you could youre sweet she looked at my hand as if ready to touch it again but she didnt move and her eyes shifted to her salad happy lunch she said glumly jean its possible the notes might be relevant to detective sturgis how g may not be a woman you know who it is this time her hand did move covering mine taking hold of my fingers ice cold that lawyer whose card you gave me andrew coburg i went over to see him and he told me hewitt had a friend named gritz lyle edward gritz no reaction i said gritz is a heavy drinker and he has a criminal record he and hewitt hung out together and now no one can find him a week or two ago gritz told some street people he expected to get rich then he disappeared get rich how he didnt say though in the past hed talked about becoming a recording star for all i know it was drunk talk and has nothing to do with becky but if g does refer to him it indicates tension between him and becky gritz she said i assumed g was a woman are you saying hewitt and this gritz had something homosexual going on and becky stepped in the middle of it oh god it just keeps getting worse doesnt it maybe there was nothing sexual between gritz and hewitt just a close friendship that becky intruded upon maybe she pulled out the envelope removed the notes ran her finger down the page and read yes i see what you mean once you think of g as a man you dont have to see it that way at all just friendship but whatever the reason becky felt g was hostile to her she was getting between them i said the whole therapy process was challenging whatever hewitt had with gritz how did becky phrase it in that last note let me see here it is relationship between d and g strained me ds growth yes i see what you mean then right after that she mentions another pc the session where he actually kissed her you know you could read this and feel almost as if she was seducing him she crumpled the notes god what a travesty why are you interested in this gritz you think he could be the one harassing people its possible why what else has he done criminally im not sure of the details but the harassment involved the words bad love what hewitt screamed does that actually mean something whats going on her fingers had become laced with mine i looked at them and she pulled away and fooled with her hair the flap covered one eye the exposed one was alive with fear i said i dont know jean but given the notes i have to wonder if gritz played a role in getting hewitt to murder becky played a role how by working on hewitts paranoia telling hewitt things about becky if he was a close friend hed know which buttons to push oh god she said and now hes missing its not over is it maybe it is this is all conjecture jean but finding gritz would help clear it up any chance he was a patient at the center the name doesnt ring a bell bad love i thought hewitt was just raving now youre saying maybe he was reacting to something that had gone on between him and becky that he killed her because she rejected him could be i said i found a reference to bad love in the psych literature its a term coined by a psychoanalyst named andres de bosch she stared at me nodded slowly i think ive heard of him what did he say about it he used it to describe poor child rearing a parent betraying a childs trust building up faith and then destroying it in extreme cases he theorized it could lead to violence if you consider the therapistpatient relationship similar to child rearing the same theory could be applied to cases of transference gone really bad hewitt may have heard about bad love somewhere probably from another therapist or even from gritz when he felt becky had rejected him he fell apart became a betrayed child and lashed out violently betrayed child she said youre saying his killing her was a tantrum a tantrum heated to the boiling point by hewitts delusions and by his failure to take his medication who knows gritz may have convinced him not to take it gritz she said how do you spell it i told her be good to know if he was one of your patients ill comb the files first thing tomorrow take that damned storage room apart if i have to if hes anywhere in there ill call you right away we need to know for our own safety ill be out of town tomorrow you can leave a message with my service all day tomorrow a touch of panic in her voice i nodded santa barbara and back i love santa barbara its gorgeous taking some vacation time de bosch used to have a clinic and a school up there im going to try and find out if hewitt or gritz were ever patients ill let you know if he was ours call me back okay let me know what you find sure she looked at her salad again i cant eat i waved ear over and got the bill she said no i invited you and tried to take it but she didnt put up much of a fight and i ended up paying she stashed the notes in her purse and glanced at her watch dicks not coming back for another half an hour i can wait no i wont keep you but i wouldnt mind some fresh air ill walk you to your car just outside the restaurant she paused to button her sweater and smooth her hair the first time the buttons were out of line and she had to redo them we walked to the city lot without speaking she looked in shop windows but seemed uninterested in the wares they displayed waiting until id redeemed the keys from the attendant she accompanied me to the seville thanks i said shaking her hand i opened the drivers door she said what i said before still stands right about keeping all this quiet of course its nothing detective sturgis could ever use anyway she said legally speaking what does it really prove just that people are fallible oh boy are they i got into the car she leaned in through the window youre more than just a consultant on this arent you what makes you say that your passion consultants dont go this far i smiled i take my work seriously she moved her head back as if id blown garlic in her face so do i she said sometimes i wish i didnt monday morning at nine i set out for ojai taking the to the and making it to the strawberry fields of camarillo in less than an hour migrant workers stooped in the stubby green rows the crop became blue cabbage and the air turned bitter kissyface billboards boosted housing developments and home equity loans just past the ventura county fairgrounds i turned onto north speeding by an oil refinery that resembled a giant junkyard another few miles of trailer parks and mower rental sheds and things got pretty two lanes draped by eucalyptus black mountains off to the northwest the peaks flesh colored where the sun hit the town of ojai was a quarter of an hour farther announced by a bike and equestrian trail orange groves and signs directing the motorist to the ojai palm spa the humanos theosophic institute marmalade hot springs to the south were the clean green slopes of a country club the cars were goodlooking and so were the people ojai proper was quiet and slow moving with one traffic light the main drag was ojai avenue lined with the kind of lowrise neospanish architecture that usually means tight zoning laws unrestricted parking plenty of spaces tans and smiles natural fibers and good posture on the left side of the avenue a colonnaded tileroofed building was filled with storefronts native american art and antiques body wraps and herbal facials a little olde tea shoppe across the street was an old theater freshly adobed playing tonight leningrad cowboys i had my ventura county thomas guide on the passenger seat but i didnt need it signal was a couple of intersections up and north meant a left turn big trees and small houses residential lots alternating with olive groves a drainage ditch paved with fieldstones ran alongside the left side of the street spanned every few yards by onestride foot bridges wilbert harrisons address was near the top one of the last houses before open fields took over it was a shingleroofed wooden cottage painted an odd purplishred and nearly hidden behind unruly snarls of agave cactus the purple was vivid and it shone through the agaves sawtooth leaves like a wound atop a steep dirt driveway a chevy station wagon was parked up against a single garage four stone steps led up to the front porch the screen door was shut but the wooden one behind it was wide open i knocked on the frame while looking into a small dark living room plank floored and crowded with old furniture shawls throw pillows an upright piano a bay window was lined with dusty bottles chamber music came from another room i knocked louder one minute the music turned off and a man appeared from a doorway to the right short chubby as in his old picture and white haired he had on a polyester jumpsuit the same purplishred as the house some of the furniture was upholstered that color too he opened the screen door and gave me a curious but friendly look his eyes were gray but they picked up magenta accents from his surroundings there was a softness to his face but no weakness dr harrison yes im bert harrison his voice was a clear baritone the jumpsuit was zipped in the front and had large floppy lapels shortsleeved it exposed white freckled arms his face was freckled too and i noticed reddishblond tints in his white hair he wore a pinkie ring set with a violet cabochon and a bolo tie with leather thongs held together by a big shapeless purple rock sandals on his feet no socks my name is alex delaware im a clinical psychologist from los angeles and i wondered if i could talk to you about andres de bosch and bad love the eyes didnt change shape or hue but they became more focused he said i know you weve met somewhere nineteen seventynine i said there was a conference at western pediatric medical center on de boschs work you presented a paper and i was a cochair but we never actually met yes he said smiling you were there as the hospitals representative but your heart wasnt in it you remember that distinctly the entire conference had that flavor ambivalence all around you were very young you wore a beard then didnt you yes i said amazed the beginnings of old age he said still smiling distant memories become clearer but i cant remember where i put my keys im still impressed doctor i remember the beard vividly perhaps because i have trouble growing one and your voice full of stress just as it is right now well come in lets take care of it coffee or tea there was a small kitchen beyond the living room and a door that led to a single bedroom the little i could see of the sleeping chamber was purple and booklined the kitchen table was birch not more than four feet long the counters were old white tile trimmed with purplered bullnoses he fixed instant coffee for both of us and we sat the scale of the table put us close together elbows nearly touching in answer to your unasked question he said whitening his coffee with lots of cream then adding three spoonfuls of sugar its the only color i can see a rare genetic condition everything else in my world is gray so i do what i can to brighten it makes sense i said now that thats out of the way tell me whats on your mind concerning andres and bad love that was the title of the conference wasnt it yes you dont seem surprised that i just popped in oh i am but i like surprises anything that breaks up routine has the ability to freshen our lives this may not be a pleasant surprise dr harrison you may be in danger his expression didnt change how so i told him about the bad love tape my revenge theory the possible links to dorsey hewitt and lyle gritz and you think one of these men may have been a former patient of andress its possible hewitt was thirtythree when he died and gritz is a year older so either of them could have been his patient as a child hewitt killed one psychotherapist perhaps under gritzs influence and gritz is still out there possibly still trying to even scores what would he be trying to avenge some kind of mistreatment by de bosch himself or a disciple something had happened at the school no response i said real or imagined hewitt was a paranoid schizophrenic i dont know gritzs diagnosis but he may be delusional as well the two of them could have influenced each others pathology symbiotic psychosis or at least shared delusions playing on each others paranoia he blinked hard tapes calls no i havent experienced anything like that and the name of this person who giggled over the phone was silk i nodded hmm and what role do you think the conference played it may have triggered something i really dont know but its my only link to de bosch i felt an obligation to tell you because one of the other speakers dr stoumen was killed last year and i havent been able to loca grant he said leaning forward close enough for me to smell the mint on his breath i heard he died in an auto accident a hitandrun accident while attending a conference he stepped off the curb and was knocked down by a car it was never solved dr harrison the police put it down to dr stoumens old age poor vision faulty hearing a conference he said poor grant he was a nice man did he ever work at the school he did occasional consultations coming up summers for a week or two combining vacation with business hitandrun he shook his head and as i was saying i cant locate any of the other speakers or cochairs youve located me youre the only one dr harrison bert please just out of curiosity how did you find me from the directory of medical specialists oh i suppose i forgot to cancel it he looked troubled i didnt want to impose on your privacy but no no thats fine youre here for my own good and to tell the truth i welcome visitors after thirty years in practice its nice to talk to people rather than just listen do you know where any of the others are katarina de bosch mitchell lerner harvey rosenblatt katarina is just up the coast in santa barbara shes still there i havent heard that shes moved do you have her address and her phone number here let me call it for you he reached over pulled a crimson rotary phone from the counter and put it on the table as he dialed i wrote down the number on the phone then he held the receiver to his ear for a while before putting it down no answer he said whens the last time you saw her he thought i suppose about a year or so by coincidence i was in a bookstore in santa barbara and ran into her browsing psychology he smiled no fiction actually she was in the sciencefiction section would you like her address please he wrote it down and gave it to me shoreline drive the ocean side he said just up from the marina i remembered the slide katarina had shown blue skies behind a wheelchair the ocean did she live there with her father i said since the two of them came to california she was very attached to him wasnt she she worshiped him he continued to look preoccupied did she ever marry he shook his head when did the school close i said not long after andres died eightyone i believe katarina didnt want to keep it going he put his hands around his coffee cup he had hammer thumbs and his other digits were short youd have to ask her about that does she do any kind of psychological work now not to my knowledge early retirement he shrugged and drank put his cup down and touched the stone of his bolo tie something bothering him i said i only met her twice but i dont see her as someone with hobbies bert he smiled you encountered the force of her personality she was the reason i was at the conference against my will she pulled strings with the chief of staff that was katarina he said life as target practice set your sights aim and shoot she pressured me to speak too you were reluctant yes but lets get back to grant for a moment hitandrun isnt really the same as premeditated murder maybe im wrong but i still cant find anyone who was up on that dais he grabbed the cup with both hands i can tell you about mitch mitchell lerner hes dead also the result of an accident hiking down in mexico acapulco he fell from a high cliff when two years ago one year before stoumen one year after rodney shipler fill in the gaps the time he was saying i had no reason to assume it was anything but an accident especially in view of it being a fall whys that he worked his jaws and his hands went flat on the table his mouth twisted a couple of times anxiety and something else dentures mitchell had occasional balance problems he said alcohol he stared at me i know about his suspension i said im sorry i cant talk any more about him meaning he was your patient your bio mentioned your specialties impaired therapists silence that served as affirmation then he said he was trying to ease his way back into work the trip to mexico was part of that he was attending a conference there he put his finger in his mouth and fooled with his bridgework well he said smiling i dont go to conferences anymore so maybe im safe does the name myra paprock mean anything to you he shook his head who is she a woman who was murdered five years ago the words bad love were scrawled at the murder scene in her lipstick and the police have found one other killing where the phrase was written a man named rodney shipler beaten to death three years ago no he said i dont know him either are they therapists no then what would they have to do with the conference nothing that i know of but maybe they had something to do with de bosch myra paprock was working as a real estate agent at the time but before that she was a teacher in goleta maybe she moonlighted at the corrective school this was before she married so her surname would have been something other than paprock myra he said rubbing his lip there was a myra who taught there when i was consulting a young woman just out of college blond pretty a little he closed his eyes myra myra what was her name myra evans i think yes im pretty sure thats what it was myra evans and now youre saying she was murdered what else were you going to say about her bert excuse me you just said she was blond pretty and something else nothing really he said i just remembered her as being a little hard nothing pathologic the dogmatism of youth was she rough on the kids abusive i never saw it it wasnt that kind of place andress force of personality was enough to maintain a certain level of order what was myras method for maintaining order lots of rules one of those everythingbytherules types no shades of gray was dr stoumen like that too grant was orthodox he liked his rules but he was an extremely gentle person somewhat shy and lerner anything but rigid lack of discipline was his problem harvey rosenblatt dont know him at all never met him before the conference so you never saw myra evans come down too hard on a child no i barely remember her these are just impressions they may be faulty i doubt it he moved his jaws from side to side all these murders you actually think shaking his head i said how important was the concept of bad love to de boschs philosophy id say it was fairly central he said andres was very concerned with justice he saw achieving consistency in our world as a prime motive saw many symptoms as attempts to accomplish that the search for order nod and good love when did you become disillusioned about him he looked pained i held my gaze and said you said katarina pressured you to speak at the symposium why would a faithful student have to be pressured he got up turned his back on me and rested his palms on the counter a little man in ridiculous clothing trying to bring color to his world i really wasnt that close to him he said after i began my anthropology studies i wasnt around much taking a couple of steps he wiped the counter with one stubby hand your own search for consistency he stiffened but didnt turn racism he said i heard andres making remarks about who blacks mexicans were there black and mexican children at the school yes but he didnt malign them it was the workers hired laborers there was acreage behind the school andres hired people down on lower state street to come clear the weeds every month or so what did you hear him say about them the usual garbage that they were lazy stupid genetically inferior he called the blacks one halfstep up from apes said the mexicans werent much better he said this to your face hesitation no to katarina i overheard it i said she didnt disagree with him did she he turned around she never disagreed with him how did you happen to overhear their conversation i wasnt eavesdropping he said that would almost have been better i walked in on the middle of the conversation and andres didnt bother to interrupt himself that really troubled me the fact that he thought i would laugh along with it and it wasnt just once i heard him say those things several times almost taunting me i didnt respond he was my teacher and i became a worm he returned to his chair slumping a bit i said did katarina respond at all to his remarks she laughed i was disgusted lord knows im no paragon of virtue ive done my share of pretending to listen to patients when my mind was elsewhere pretending to care been married five times never longer than twentysix months when i finally achieved enough insight to realize i should stop making womens lives miserable i opted for the solitary life drew plenty of blood along the way so i dont put myself up on any moral pedestal but i have always prided myself on tolerance im sure part of it is personal i was born with multiple anomalies other things besides the lack of color vision he looked away as if considering his choices held out his short fingers and waved them pointing at his mouth he said im completely edentulous born without adult teeth my right foot has three toes the left one is clubbed im unable to sire children and one of my kidneys atrophied when i was three most of my childhood was spent in bed due to severe skin rashes and a hole in the ventricular septum of my heart so i guess im a little sensitive to discrimination but i didnt speak up just left the school i nodded did de boschs intolerance come out in other ways no thats the thing on a daytoday basis he was extremely liberal publicly he was liberal took in minority patients most of them charity cases and seemed to treat them as well as the others and in his writings he was brilliantly tolerant have you ever read his essay on the nazis no brilliant he repeated he composed it while fighting in the french resistance taking the bastards own pseudotheories of racial superiority and throwing it all back in their faces with good sound science that was one of the things that attracted me to him when i was a resident the combination of social conscience and psychoanalysis too many analysts live in a twelvefootsquare world the office as universe rich people on the couch summers in vienna i wanted more is that why you studied anthropology i wanted to learn about other cultures and andres supported me in that told me it would make me a better therapist he was a great mentor alex thats why it was so crushing to hear him sneer at those field hands like seeing ones father in a disgusting light i swallowed it in silence several times finally i resigned and left town for beverly hills i did a year of research in chile then caved in and returned to my own twelvefootsquare world did you tell him why you were leaving no just that i was unhappy but he understood he shook his head he was an intimidating man i was a coward it had to take force of personality to dominate katarina oh yes and he did dominate her after i returned from chile he called me just once we had a frosty conversation and that was that but katarina wanted you at the conference anyway she wanted me because i was part of his past the glory years by then he was a vegetable and she was resurrecting him she brought me pictures of him in his wheelchair you abandoned him once bert dont do it again guilts a great motivator he looked away worked his jaws i dont see any obvious tiein i said but rodney shipler the man who was beaten to death was black at the time of his murder he was a school janitor in la do you have any memory of him at all no that name isnt familiar he looked back at me edgy guilty what is it bert whats what somethings on your mind i smiled your face is full of stress he smiled back and sighed something came into my mind your mr silk probably irrelevant something about lerner no no this is something that happened after the bad love conference soon after a couple of days i believe he closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead as if coaxing forth memories yes it was two or three days he said working his jaws again i received a call in my office after hours i was on my way out and i picked up the phone before the answering service could get to it a man was on the other end very agitated very angry a young man or at least he sounded young he said hed sat through my speech at the conference and wanted to make an appointment wanted to go into longterm psychoanalysis with me but the way he said it hostile almost sarcastic brought my guard up and i asked him what kinds of problems he was experiencing he said there were many too many to go into over the phone and that my speech had reminded him of them i asked him how but he wouldnt say his voice was saturated with stress real suffering he demanded to know if i was going to help him i said of course id stay late and see him right away you considered it a crisis at the least a borderline crisis there was real pain in his voice an ego highly at risk and he smiled i had no pressing engagements other than dinner with one of my wives the third one i think you can see why i was such a poor matrimonial prospect anyway to my surprise he said no right now wasnt a good time for him but he could come in the next evening standoffish all of a sudden as if id come on too strong for him i was a bit taken aback but you know patients the resistance the ambivalence i nodded he said so we made an appointment for the following afternoon but he never showed up the phone number hed given me was out of order and he wasnt listed in any local phone books i thought it odd but after all odd is our business isnt it i thought about it for a while then i forgot about it until today his being at the conference all that anger shrug i dont know was his name silk this is the part i hesitate about alex he never became my patient formally but in a sense he was because he asked for help and i counseled him over the phone or at least i attempted to there was no formal treatment bert i dont see any problem legally thats not the point morally its an issue moral issues transcend the law he slapped his own wrist and smiled gawd doesnt that sound selfrighteous there is a moral issue i said but weigh it against the alternatives two definite murders three if you include grant stoumen maybe four if someone pushed mitchell lerner off that cliff myra paprock was raped as well taken apart physically she left two small children i just met her husband he still hasnt healed youre quite good at guilt yourself young man whatever works bert hows that for a moral stance he smiled no doubt youre a practical therapist no his name wasnt silk another type of fabric thats what made me think of it merino he spelled it out first name he didnt give one called himself mister mr merino it sounded pretentious in someone so young awful insecurity can you pinpoint his age twenties early twenties would be my guess he had a young mans impetuousness poor impulse control to call like that and make demands but he was stressed and stress causes regression so maybe he was older when was the corrective school established nineteen sixtytwo so if he was in his twenties in seventynine he could easily have been a patient or one of the field hands merinos an hispanic name or someone with no connection to the school at all he said what if he was just someone with deepseated problems who sat in on the conference and reacted to it for one reason or another could be i said calculating silently dorsey hewitt would have been around eighteen in lyle gritz a year older all right i said thanks for telling me and i wont give out the information unless its essential is there anything else you remember that might help no i dont think so thank you for warning me he looked around his small house with longing i knew the feeling do you have a place to go i said nod there are always places new adventures he walked me to my car the heat had turned up a bit and the air was thick with honeybees off to santa barbara now he said yes give katarina my best when you see her the easiest way is highway pick it up just out of town and take it all the way its no more than a halfhour drive thanks we shook hands one more thing bert yes mitchell lerners problems could they have resulted in any way from his work at the school or did they cause problems there i dont know he said he never spoke about the school he was a very closed person highly defensive so you did ask him about it i asked him about every element of his past he refused to talk about anything but his drinking and even then just in terms of getting rid of a bad habit in his own work he despised behaviorism but when it came to his therapy he wanted to be reconditioned overnight something short term and discreet hypnosis whatever youre an analyst why did he come to you safety of the familiar he smiled and ive been known to be pragmatic from time to time if he was so resistant whyd he bother to go into therapy in the first place as a condition of his probation the social work ethics committee demanded it because it had affected his work missed appointments failure to submit insurance forms so his patients could recover im afraid he acted the same way as a patient not showing up very unreliable how long did you see him obviously not long enough there seemed little doubt that myra evans and myra paprock were the same person and that her murder and the deaths of others were related to de bosch and his school silk merino the conference putting someone in touch with his problems some sort of trauma bad love taken apart a childs voice chanting i felt a sudden stab of panic about leaving robin alone stopped in the center of ojai and called her from a pay phone no answer the benedict number had been channeled through my answering service and on the fifth ring an operator picked up i asked her if robin had left word where she was going no she didnt doctor would you like your messages please just one actually from a mr sturgis he called to say van nuys will be getting to your tape soon got a broken stereo dr delaware nothing that simple i said well you know how it is doctor they keep making things more complicated so people have to feel stupid i picked up a few miles out of town and headed northwest on two curving lanes lake casitas meandered parallel to the highway massive and gray under a listless sun the land side was mostly avocado groves gold tipped with new growth halfway to santa barbara the road reconnected with and i traveled the last twelve miles at freeway speed i kept thinking about what harrison had told me about de boschs racism and wondered what id tell katarina when i found her how id approach her i got off the highway without an answer bought gas and called the number harrison had given me no answer deciding to delay confrontation for a while i looked through my thomas guide for the site where the corrective school had once been near the border with montecito several miles closer than shoreline drive an omen it turned out to be a straight shady street lined with gated properties the eucalyptus here grew huge but the trees looked dried out almost dessicated despite the fire risk shake roofs were in abundance so were mercedes the exact address corresponded to a newlooking tract behind high stone walls a sign advertised six custom homes what i could see of them was massive and cream colored across the way was a pink and brown tudor mansion with a sign out in front that said the bancroft school a semicircular gravel drive girdled the building a black lincoln was parked under a spreading live oak a man got out of the car midsixties old enough to remember i drove across the road pulled up next to his drivers side and lowered my window his expression wasnt friendly he was big and powerful looking dressed in tweeds and a light blue sweater vest despite the heat and he had very white very straight hair and knockedabout features a leather briefcase an old one with a brass clasp dangled from one hand the leather had been freshly oiled i could smell it several pens were clasped to his breast pocket he looked the seville over with narrow dark eyes then had a go at my face excuse me i said was the corrective school once across the street scowl thats right he turned to leave how long has it been gone quite a while why i just had a few questions about it he put his briefcase down and peered into the car are you an alumnus no he looked relieved do alumni come back frequently i said no not frequently but you do know what kind of school it was troubled children a bad lot we were never happy with it we were here first you know my father broke ground thirty years before they came really we were here before most of the houses this was all agricultural back then did the students from the corrective school cause problems and whats your interest in that im a psychologist i said and gave him a card im doing some consulting to the los angeles police department and theres some evidence one of the alumni is involved in something unpleasant something unpleasant well thats not much of a surprise is it he scowled again his eyebrows were bushy lowset and still dark giving him a look of perpetual annoyance what kind of unpleasantness im sorry but i cant go into detail is it mr bancroft it certainly is he produced a card of his own white heavy stock a heraldic shield in one corner the bancroft school est by col c h bancroft ret building scholarship and character condon h bancroft jr ba ma headmaster by unpleasant do you mean criminal he said its possible he gave a knowing nod i said why did the place close down he died the frenchman and no one was left to run it its an art education didnt he have a daughter his eyebrows arched she offered me the place but i turned her down error on my part i should have done it for the land alone now theyve come and built those he cast a glare at the stone wall they some sort of foreign group asians of course she offered me all of it lock stock but she wanted an outlandish amount of money and refused to negotiate for them moneys no object shes still here in town isnt she shes in santa barbara he said i wondered where he thought he was then i answered my own question montecito wannabee this unpleasantness he said it isnt anything that would impinge upon my school is it i dont want publicity the police traipsing around did de boschs students ever impinge no because i made sure they didnt for all practical purposes this property line was as impermeable as the berlin wall he drew a line in the gravel with the toe of one wingtip some of them had been to reform school fire setters bullies truants all sorts of miscreants must have been difficult being this close no it wasnt difficult he reprimanded if they chanced to wander i sent them hopping right back so you never had any problems noise was a problem there was always too much noise the only untoward thing occurred after they were gone one of them showed up and made quite a nuisance of himself smile his condition didnt speak well of the frenchmans methods what condition was that a tramp he said unwashed uncombed high on drugs his eyes had that look how do you know he was an alumnus because he told me he was said it in those words im an alumnus as if that should have impressed me how long ago was this quite a while lets see i was interviewing the crummer boy the youngest one and he applied around ten years ago and how old was this tramp twenties a real churl he barged right into my office past my secretary i was interviewing young crummer and his parents a fine family the elder boys had attended bancroft quite successfully the scene he created dissuaded them from sending the youngest lad here what did he want where was the school what had happened to it raising his voice and creating a scene poor mrs crummer i thought id have to call the police but i was finally able to convince him to leave by telling him the frenchman was long dead that satisfied him the eyebrows dipped i dont know what it did to him but he left lucky for him id had my fill a big fist shook he was insane must have been on drugs can you describe him dirty uncombed whats the difference and he didnt have a car he walked away on foot i watched him probably on his way to the highway god help anyone who picked him up he watched me leave too standing with his arms folded across his chest as i drove away i realized i hadnt heard or seen any children at his school bullies and fire setters a tramp in his twenties trying to dig up the past the same man whod called harrison merino silk a thing for fabrics hewitt and gritz two tramps who would have been in their twenties back then myra paprock was killed five years ago two years after that shipler then lerner then stoumen was rosenblatt still alive katarina was just a few miles up this beautiful road that gave us something in common i was ready to talk to her cabrillo boulevard swept up past the ocean cleansed of the weekend tourist swarm and the bad sidewalk art the wharf looked depopulated and its far end disappeared in a bank of fog a few cyclists pumped in the bike lane and joggers and speed walkers chased immortality i passed the big new hotels that commandeered the prime ocean views and the motels that followed them like afterthoughts passed a small seafood place where robin and i had eaten shrimp and drunk beer people were eating there now laughing tan santa barbara was a beautiful place but sometimes it spooked me too much psychic space between the haves and the havenots and not enough geography a walk up state street took you from welfare hotels and mean bars to custom jewelers custom tailors and twobucksascoop ice cream the fringes of isla vista and goleta were as hard as any inner city but montecito was still a place where people ate cake sometimes the tension seemed murderous i pictured andres de bosch trolling lower state for day laborers his daughter listening and laughing as he dehumanized those hed found cabrillo climbed higher and emptied of pedestrians and i caught an eyeful of endless pacific sailboats were out in force at the marina most of them floundering as they searched for a tailwind nearer to the horizon fishing scows sat still as artists models the boulevard flattened once again turned into shoreline and got residential i began checking the numbers on the curb most of the houses were fifties rancheros several of them in renovation i remembered the neighborhood as well planted today lots of the plants were gone and the ones that remained looked discouraged the drought had come hard to this town kissed by salt water the lawns were suffering the most most of them dead or dying a few were vivid green too green spray paint santa barbara trying to free itself from dependence on sierra snowpack had declared mandatory rationing long before la now the town was returning to desert but the addiction to emerald was hard to shake i reached katarinas house older than its neighbors and considerably smaller a pale blue english country cottage with two turrets a slate roof that needed mending and a big dirt expanse in front a privet hedge rimmed the plot uneven and picked apart in spots what had once been a rose garden was now a collection of trellised sticks an oldfashioned wirelink gate was fastened across an asphalt driveway but as i pulled up i could see it was unlocked i got out and pushed it open and walked up the drive the asphalt was old and cracked stretching a hundred feet to the tail end of a small japanese car drapes whited all the windows of the house the front door was paneled oak its varnish bubbling a neighborhood watch sticker affixed just below the lions head knocker below that was another one bearing the name of an alarm company i rang the bell waited did it again waited some more used the lion nothing no one was around i could hear the ocean i went around the side past the little white car and a highpeaked garage with sagging swivel doors left half open the backyard was twice the size of the front plot and denuded the borders with its neighbors were obscured by thick plantings of dead citrus and dead avocado on the ground were shapeless patches of lifeless shrubbery even the weeds were struggling but a couple of giant pines toward the back had survived nicely their roots deep enough to tap into groundwater their trunks yearned for the ragged cliff that overlooked the beach through their boughs the ocean was gray lacquer the property was at least a hundred feet up but the tide was a drum roll loud enough to block out every other sound i looked at the rear of the house buttoned up and curtained near the cliff was an old redwood table and two chairs guano specked and faded to ash but half of the table was covered with a white tablecloth and on the cloth were a cup and saucer and a plate i walked over coffee dregs in the cup crumbs on the plate and an orange smear that looked like ossified marmalade the ocean grumbled and seabirds shrieked in response i walked to the edge of the cliff to the spot where katarina had photographed her father slumped in his wheelchair dry dirt no fence easy fall i peered over and a splinter of vertigo pierced my chest when it subsided i looked over again the hillside was gouged with erosion giant fingermarks that traced a dead drop down to the rocky beach the gulls screamed again a reprimand that reminded me i was trespassing the coffee and crumbs said katarina was in town probably gone out for an errand i could wait here but the more efficient thing would be to call milo and catch him up on becky basilles notes harrison and bancroft as i started to leave i passed the garage once again and saw the rear end of another car parked in front of the little white sedan bigger and darker black the distinctive vertical slash taillights of a buick electra same car id seen at the front of the hospital in seventynine something near the rear tire fingers white and thin a hand the top speckled by an eczematous rash no another kind of speckling darker than eczema she was lying on the cement floor faceup parallel to the buick nearly concealed under the chassis the other hand was over her head palm exposed gouged with deep cuts tendons looped from some of the wounds limp as tired elastic bands defense cuts she had on a pink housedress under a white terry cloth robe the robe was splayed open and the dress was pushed up past her waist nearly reaching her chin her feet were bare the soles grimed by garage dirt her eyeglasses were a few feet away one of the sidepieces twisted nearly off one of the lenses cracked her neck was cut too but most of the damage had been done to her abdomen it was black and red ripped apart a jumble of viscera but oddly bloated the vertigo returned i wheeled around then checked my back i faced the body again and felt myself grow weirdly calm time slowed and an internal rush and roar filled my head as if the ocean had been transplanted there something missing where was the inevitable message i forced myself to look for red letters searching for two words nothing nothing in the garage but the car and katarina and a small metal workbench off to one side backed by a pegboard panel a workbench like robins but cluttered with paint cans tools gluepots jars of shellac hanging from the pegboard hooks bearing hammers gouges chisels one of the chisel hooks empty a knife on the table its blade glazed red birchwood handle wide tapered blade everything glazed the bench stained but no words just a spatter of stains old paint blotches new ones all mixed in with the telltale redbrown dribs and droplets but no proclamation something white underneath the handle of the killing tool a scrap of paper not white almost white beige a nice classy shade of ecru business card confidentlooking brown letters said sdi inc wilshire boulevard suite beverly hills ca something else in the upper right tiny hand printed by ballpoint printed neatly the characters identical to the lettering on my tape package so much pressure on the pen that the stiff paper had been torn through in spots bl i ran down the driveway threw myself into the car and sped down to the marina there was a pay phone on the boat moorings near some trash cans the stench was welcome i tried robin again still no answer a detective at west la robberyhomicide said hes not in its an emergency sorry dont know where he is maybe hes out in his car i said could you try radioing him his voice hardened who is this assistant chief murchison i said without thinking marveling at the ease of the lie second of silence something that might have been a gulp one moment sir thirty seconds later sturgis its me milo pause alex i said you palmed yourself off as murchison katarinas dead i just found her body i gave him the details describing the crime scene in a rapid word storm the card with the bad love message same printing as the package the tape came in sdi he said its right there in beverly hills maybe he chose to use it for the message for a reason sdi sure as hell not the strategic defense initiative could you check on robin i know the place is secure but the killers picking up speed and the idea of her being alone up there i tried calling her twice but shes not in probably went out to do some shopping but ill stop by thanks what do i do now i havent even called the local police yet where are you pay phone a few minutes from the house okay go back there stay away from the actual crime scene and just wait ill call santa barbara pd tell em youre kosher then ill head up there myself what time is it threethirty i should be there by six the latest i waited near the cliff as far from the garage as i could be staring at the ocean inhaling brine and trying to make sense of things two young uniforms showed up first one stayed with the body and the other took a superficial report from me name rank serial number time and place listening courteously and just a bit suspiciously twenty minutes later a pair of detectives arrived one was a woman named sarah grayson tall slim attractive in her forties her eyes were slightly slanted colored an even brown they moved slowly but frequently taking things in reserving judgment her partner was a big heavy man named steen with a bushy dark mustache and not much hair on top he went straight into the garage and left me to grayson somehow wed ended up back near the cliff edge i told her tape recorder everything i knew and she listened without interruption then she pointed at the water and said theres a seal flipping around out there i followed her arm and made out a small black dot ten breaststrokes from the tideline cutting a perpendicular line through the breakwaters or a sea lion she said those are the ones with the ears right i shrugged lets go over it again doctor when i finished she said so you were looking for dr de bosch to warn her about this revenge nut that and i wanted to find out if she could tell me anything about why hes out for revenge and you think it has something to do with this school she and her father ran it its the only thing i can come up with what was the exact name of the school she said the de bosch institute and corrective school it closed in eightyone and you thought shed know what happened because she was the owners daughter i nodded and looked at the rear of the house there could be records in there therapy notes something about an incident that traumatized one of the students enough to set him off years later what kind of students went to this school emotionally disturbed mr bancroft the owner of the school across the street described them as antisocial fire setters truants and other miscreants she smiled i know mr bancroft so when do you think this traumatic episode might have occurred some time before nineteen seventynine because of that conference thats right she thought for a while and how long was the school around from nineteen sixtytwo to eightyone well thats verifiable she said more to herself than to me maybe if there was a trauma well have a record of it assuming something happened what do you mean you just told me you think this guys crazy doctor this supposed avenger she kept her eyes on me and turned one of her earrings so maybe he cooked it all up in his head maybe but being psychotic doesnt mean being totally delusional most psychotics have periods of lucidity and psychotics can be traumatized too plus he might not even be psychotic just extremely disturbed she smiled again you sound like an expert witness cautious ive been to court i know detective sturgis told me and i discussed you with judge stephen huff too just to play it safe you know steve know him well i used to work juvenile down in la steve was handling that kind of thing back then i know milo too you keep good company doctor she looked at the house this victim down in la ms paprock you think she taught at the school yes under the name of evans myra evans her day job was with the public school system in goleta there might still be records of that and the male victim rodney shipler worked as a school janitor in la so he may have had a similar job up here shipler she said still looking at the house whereabouts in la do you practice westside child counseling i do mostly forensic work now custody evaluations injury cases custody that can get mean she turned her earring again well well go and look around in the house soon as the tech team and the coroner come and okay it she gazed at the ocean some more brought her eyes back to the redwood table and lingered on the coffee cup having her breakfast she said the dregs still havent solidified so my guess is this is from this morning i nodded thats why i thought she was home but if she was eating out here and he surprised her wouldnt the house be open look how sealed up it looks and why didnt anyone hear her scream holding up a finger she slung her purse over her shoulder and went to the garage she and steen came out a few minutes later he was holding a metal tape measure and a camera listening to her and nodding she took something out of her purse surgical gloves after shaking them out she donned them and tried a rear door it opened she stuck her head inside for a moment then drew it back another conference with steen back to me whats in there i said total mess she said wrinkling her nose another body not that i can see so far look doctor its going to take a long time to get things sorted out here why dont you just try to relax until detective sturgis gets here sorry you cant sit on these chairs but if you dont mind the grass get yourself a place over on that side indicating the south end of the yard i already checked it for footprints and its okay ah look theres another sea lion its real pretty up here isnt it milo made it by five fortyeight id staked out a position in a corner of the yard and he walked straight to it after talking to grayson robin was still out when i checked he said her truck and her purse were gone and so was the dog and shed written down something on the fridge pad about salad so she probably went shopping i saw absolutely nothing wrong dont worry maybe she should stay with you why im not safe to be around he looked at me okay sure if it helps your peace of mind but well keep you safe he put a hand on my shoulder for a moment then entered the garage and stayed there for twenty minutes or so the coroner had come and gone and so had the body and the technicians were still working dusting and peeking and making casts i watched them until milo came out lets go he said where out of here they dont need me anymore did you tell sally everything you know yup then lets go we left passing the garage steen was on his knees by a chalk body outline talking into a tape recorder sarah grayson was standing near him writing in a notepad she saw me and waved then returned to her work nice lady i said as we walked away she was one of central juveys best investigators used to be married to one of the watch commanders real asshole mean drunk rumor had it he was rough on her and the kids physically rough he shrugged i never saw bruises but he had a vicious temper finally they got divorced and a couple of months later he came over to her place raising a ruckus and ended up shooting himself in the foot and losing a toe smile whole big investigation afterward sally moved up here and the asshole retired on disability and packed out to idaho in the foot i said not exactly a marksman he smiled again actually he was a crack shot had once been a range instructor a lot of people found it hard to believe hed done it to himself but you know how it is with chronic alcohol abuse all that loss of muscle control no telling we reached the street santa barbara police cars were parked at the curb sandwiching the seville neighbors were pressing up against the crime scene tape and a tv van was driving up i looked in vain for milos fiat or an unmarked wheres your car back in la i took a chopper to where the airport howd you get here from there santa barb uniform picked me up status i said hoohah yeah he said sally used to live in mar vista i was the detective on her exs toe job oh yeah oh now you drive me lets split before the press leeches start sucking i headed down cabrillo he said are you too wiped out or grossed out to eat i havent eaten since breakfast i can probably hold something down or at least watch you voyeur this looks okay pull in he pointed to a small seafood place tucked next to one of the beach motels inside was a scattering of oilclothdraped tables with abaloneshell ashtrays sawdust floors netted walls a live bar and a selforder counter the special of the day was salmon and chips both milo and i ordered it took a number and sat down at a window table we tried to look through the traffic at the water a young waitress inquired if we wanted anything to drink brought us two beers and left us alone i called robin again using a phone at the back next to a cigarette machine still out when i got back to the table milo was wiping foam from his upper lip katarina was pregnant he said coroner actually found the fetus hanging out of her god i said remembering the mess and the bloated abdomen how far along was she five to six months coroner could tell it was a boy i tried to push aside my revulsion harrison said she never married and she lived alone who could the father have been probably some med student with a mensa membership sdi stands for seminal depository and inventory a sperm bank this particular one claims to screen its donors for both brains and brawn designer babies i said yeah i can see katarina going for something like that artificial insemination would give her total control over the child rearing no emotional entanglements at five months shed probably be showing thats why the killer concentrated on her belly focused his anger there wiping out de boschs line he frowned i said maybe the sperm banks card was chosen for the message for that same reason the way it was pinned under the murder weapon was deliberate setting the scene its all a big ritual for him the waitress brought the food a look at our faces erased the smile on hers i said hes trying to obliterate everything associated with de bosch and once again he used a weapon he found on hand turning the victim against herself insult and injury trying to reverse what he thinks was done to him but he must have brought another weapon with him to intimidate her his fists could have been all he needed for that lots of bruises around her eyes did he hit her hard enough to knock her out hard to tell without an autopsy but sally said the coroner didnt think so if she was conscious why didnt anyone hear her scream sometimes people dont scream he said lots of times they freeze and cant get a sound out or the head blows could have stunned her even if she did scream it might not have helped neighbors on both sides are away and the ocean blocks out lots of sound to begin with what about other neighbors didnt anyone see someone enter the property no ones come forward yet sally and steen are gonna do a doortodoor canvass sally said the house was a mess did she mean poor housekeeping or a toss a toss there was overturned furniture ripped upholstery rage i said or he could have been looking for old school records something that might incriminate him getting rid of the evidence hes been bumping off people for years why start covering now maybe hes getting more nervous my experience is just the opposite he said killers acquire a taste for it enjoy it more and more and get careless hope he did get careless and you find something in there itll take a couple of days to do a thorough workover from the outside the place looked sealed up if i hadnt seen the breakfast dishes i would have assumed katarina was out of town the killer must have closed the drapes after he killed her then tossed in peace like you said its a ritual something he sets up carefully so were not dealing with a raving psychotic everything thats happened is too calculated for a schizophrenic traveling around to conventions simulating accidents skewering my fish taping hewitt screaming stalking delaying gratification for years this is calculated cruelty milo some kind of psychopath beckys notes mean we have to look at gritz carefully if hes silkmerino his streetbumalkie thing may be a disguise the perfect disguise when you think about it milo the homeless are everywhere part of the scenery to most of us they all look alike i remember seeing a guy at coburgs office he looked so similar to hewitt it startled me all bancroft really remembered about his intruder besides age was dirt and hair he thought how many years ago did bancroft say this guy barged in around ten the guy was in his twenties so hed be in his thirties now which would fit gritz bert harrisons mr merino fits that time frame too both merino and bancrofts tramp were agitated merino talked about the conference putting him in touch with his problems a few years later the tramp returned to his old school causing a scene trying to dig up his past so it could be the same guy or maybe there are lots of corrective school alumni wandering around trying to put their lives together whatever the case something happened there milo bancroft called the schools students miscreants and fire setters he denied thered been any major problems that he couldnt handle but he could have been lying well he said local records can be checked and sallyll be talking to bancroft again see if she can get more details good luck to her he doesnt suffer the middle class lightly he smiled and lifted his glass thats okay sally doesnt suffer assholes lightly he drank some beer but didnt touch his food i looked at mine it appeared well prepared but had all the appeal of fried lint i said myra paprock taught school here during the late sixties to the midseventies so thats probably the time frame were looking at lyle gritz would have been around ten or eleven harrison remembers myra as being young and very dogmatic so maybe she got heavyhanded with discipline something a child could perceive as bad love shipler could have worked there too as a janitor got involved somehow in whatever happened and most of the conference speakers were on staff then too ive got the exact dates in my notes back home lets finish up here get back to la and check you check he said ill be staying up here for a day or two working with sally and bill steen leave messages at her desk he gave me a business card i said the killers been accelerating his pace one year between victims now only a few months between stoumen and katarina unless there are other victims we dont know about true i still cant find harvey rosenblatt and his wife hasnt returned my call maybe shes a widow who just doesnt want to deal with it but ive got to keep trying if rosenblatts alive i need to warn him need to warn harrison too let me call him right now and tell him about katarina i returned to the pay phone and dialed ojai while reading the warning label on the cigarette machine no answer no tape i hoped it was because harrisons selfpreservation instincts were sharp the little man would make an easy crimson target when i returned to the table milo still hadnt eaten gone i said maybe hiding already he said he had somewhere to go ill ask an ojai cop to stop by what about becky basille how do you fit her into this hewitt screaming bad love the killer taping hewitt maybe hewitt was a corrective school alumnus too or maybe the killer indoctrinated hewitt about bad love if g is our guy beckys notes imply a close relationship of some kind between him and hewitt if im right about the killer not being psychotic hed have been the more puttogether partner the dominant one able to push hewitts buttons feed hewitts paranoia get him off his medication and turn him against his therapist because of his hatred of therapists plus he had another reason to hate becky hewitt was getting attached to her milo began cutting salmon with his fork stopped and ran his hand over his face im still looking for mr gritz pulled his complete sheet and its all minor league he told the calcutta folks he was going to get rich could there be some kind of profit motive to these murders maybe he was just bragging psychopaths do that he looked at his food and shoved his plate away whom i kidding the kid on the tape i said any record of gritz having children he shook his head the chant i said bad love bad love dont give me the bad love sounds like something an abused kid might say having a child recite it could be part of the ritual reliving the past using de boschs own terminology god only knows what else hes done trying to work through his pain he took out his wallet pulled out cash and put it on the table tried to catch the waitresss attention but her back was to us milo i said becky might still be a link she could have talked to someone about hewitt and g like who a relative a friend did she have a boyfriend youre saying she broke confidentiality she was a beginner and we already know she wasnt that careful dont know about any boyfriend he said but why would she not tell jeffers then go and gab to a layperson because telling jeffers would have meant getting pulled off hewitts case and she could have talked without feeling she was breaching confidentiality leaving out names but she might have said something to someone that can give us a lead the only member of her family i ever met was her mother and that was just once to listen to her cry a mother can be a confidante he looked at me after that picnic with paprocks husband youd be willing to do another exhumation what else do we have going he pushed food around his plate she was a nice person the mother what approach would you take with her straight and narrow hewitt had a friend who may be involved in other killings someone whose name starts with g did becky ever talk about him he caught the waitresss eye and waved her over she smiled and held up a finger finished reciting the specials to a couple across the room she lives near park labrea he said near the art museum ramona or rowena something like that i think shes in the book though she may have unlisted it after the murder if she did call me at sallys and ill get it for you he looked at our untouched plates took a toothpick from a can on the table and poked at his incisors got your message about the sheriff i said when does he plan to get to the tape next couple of days unless some emergency comes up dont know what itll accomplish but at least well feel scientific speaking of science i said any estimates yet about when katarina was killed coroners initial guess is anywhere from eight to twenty hours before you found her eights more likely the coffee dregs were still moist if id gotten there a little earlier i might have gotten hurt yourself he leaned forward forget the rescue fantasies alex my head hurt and so did my eyes i rubbed them and drank water the waitress came over and looked at our uneaten meals is something wrong no said milo something just came up and weve gotta run i can doggybag it for you no thats okay he handed her the cash she frowned okaay ill be back with your change sir keep it her smile was as wide as the beach thank you sir were offering a complimentary custard dessert today milo patted his gut maybe another time youre sure sir theyre real good she touched his arm briefly really okay he said you twisted my arm pack a couple to go right away sir she ran off and came back seconds later with a paper bag printed with the face of a happylooking hound and the words for bowser milo carried it and we left the restaurant and headed for the seville as i got in the car i realized he wasnt with me and i turned back to see him standing over a skinny barechested kid of around eighteen the kid was sitting on the breezeway in front of the motel and holding a shirtcardboard sign that said will work for food his tan was intense his cheeks were sunken and his hair was a greasy umbrella milo gave him the bag the kid said something milo looked angry but he reached into his wallet and handed the kid something green then he got in the passenger seat and growled take me to work the scene in the garage stayed with me during the drive back to la bad traffic just past thousand oaks had me sitting still katarinas mangled body filling my head i listened to the seville idle thought about pain and vengeance and robin all alone up on benedict canyon mr silk whoever he was had won a partial victory things finally got moving again i escaped made it to and had a clear sail to sunset i was heading up benedict shortly after ninethirty when i noticed two red dots floating ahead of me brake lights a car stopped it seemed to be paused right in front of the narrow road that led to my adopted home though from this distance i couldnt be sure i put on speed but before i got there the lights dimmed and the car was gone traveling too fast for me to catch up probably nothing but i was stumbling along the thin line between paranoia and caution and my heart was pounding i waited everything stayed silent i drove up to the white gate slipped the cardkey in the slot and raced up the cypresslined driveway the house was lit from within the garage shut i approached the front door wet with sweat turned the key and stepped inside chest bursting robin was stretched out on a sofa reading a design magazine the bulldog was wedged between her legs head nestled in her lap trapdoor mouth open and snoring beauty and the beast i said but my voice was weak she looked up smiled and held out her hand the dog opened one eye then let the lid drop been shopping all afternoon i said taking off my jacket i tried calling a bunch of times uhhuh she said lots of errands whats the matter alex i told her what id found on shoreline drive oh no she propped herself on her elbows the dog grumbled awake but he stayed down you came so close to walking in on it i sat down as she squeezed my hand i recounted what id found and what id learned from bert harrison and condon bancroft she listened with her fingers at her mouth whoevers behind this is relentless i said i want you to move somewhere else temporarily she sat up completely what just for a while im not safe to be around we moved so you would be alex how could anyone know youre here thinking of the brake lights i said im sure no one does but i just want to be careful i spoke to milo you can move into his place just till things ease up its not necessary alex the dog was completely awake now shifting his glance from robin to me his brow wrinkles deeper the confusion and fear of a kid watching his parents fight just temporarily i said temporarily if this persons done everything you think he has he waits years so what kind of temporary are we talking about here i had no answer she said no no way alex i wont leave you to hell with him he cant do that to us robin she was pregnant i saw what he did to her no she said eyes brimming please i dont want to hear about it okay i said she pitched forward as if falling and grabbed my shoulders with both hands pulling me closer she held on tight as if still off balance her cheek was up against mine and her breath was in my ear hot and quick its okay i said well work it out she squeezed me oh alex lets just move to another planet the dog jumped from the couch to the floor sat down and stared at us whistling noises came from his compressed nostrils but his eyes were clear and active almost human hey spike i said reaching over he been good the best the affection in her voice made his ears go up he trotted up to the edge of the couch and rested his flews on her knee she caressed his head and he lifted his chin and gave her palm a long wet tongue swipe you could take him with you i said youd have constant masculine attention put it out of your mind alex her nails dug into my back we probably wont have him much longer anyway i got a call this morning from a group called french bulldog rescue very sweet lady over in burbank you wrote to the national club and they forwarded it to her shes putting out feelers says these little guys are almost never intentionally abandoned so its just a matter of time before the owners call to claim him no ones reported him missing so far no but dont get your hopes up shes got a pretty good communication network seems pretty sure shell find his owner she offered to come by and take him off our hands but i said wed care for him in the meantime the dog was looking up at me expectantly i rested my hand on his head and he made a low satisfied noise robin said now i know how foster parents feel she grabbed a handful of soft chin and kissed it her shorts had rolled high on her thighs and she tugged them down have you had dinner yet no i bought stuff chilies rellenos enchiladas even got a sixpack of corona so we could pretend we were party animals its a little late now to start a whole feast but i can put something together if youre hungry dont bother ill make a sandwich no let me alex i need something to do with my hands afterward we can get in bed with the crossword and some really bad tv and who knows what else who knows i said drawing her to me we turned off the lights around midnight i fell away easily but i woke up feeling as if id been drained of body fluids i endured breakfast feeding the dog bits of scrambled egg and making conversation with robin until the two of them went to the garage as soon as i was alone i called dr shirley rosenblatt in manhattan and got the same taped message i repeated my pitch told her it was more urgent than ever and asked her to get in touch as soon as possible when no callback had come in by the time id finished showering shaving and dressing i phoned jean jeffers she was out for the day some kind of meeting downtown and hadnt left word with her secretary about lyle gritz remembering her eagerness to look for him i figured shed come up empty information had no listing for a ramona or rowena basille but there was a basille r on south hauser street right near park labrea an older womans voice answered hello mrs basille this is rolanda whore you scratchy timbre the midwestern tones id grown up with my names alex delaware im a psychologist consulting to the los angeles police department yes rise in pitch sorry to be bothering you what is it whats happened nothing

psychotherapists he leaves a message at the crime scene the words bad love thats the same thing that scum yelled out thats why we think there may be a connection last week i received a tape with someone chanting bad love as well as a sample of hewitt screaming shortly after that i got a crank phone call then someone snuck onto my property and did damage what are you saying that rebecca was part of something i really dont know mrs basille but maybe thats what it was someone else was involved in my beckys a loud bang percussed in my ear a few seconds later dropped the phone you still there yes so whatre you saying this gritz could have been involved in hurting my baby i wish i could tell you mrs basille gritz and hewitt were friends so its possible gritz had some influence on hewitt but theres no evidence bad love she said no one was ever able to explain to me what it meant its a psychological term coined by katarina de boschs father dr andres de bosch debauch de bosch he was a psychologist who ran a remedial school up in santa barbara no reaction i said lyle gritz may have been a patient there for all i know hewitt may have been also did rebecca ever mention anything

heart starts going like its going to explode you want to come down and see me its okay let me see what you look like i hate the phone how about i come to your house sure no forget it the place is depressing i never was a homemaker now i dont do a darn thing why dont you meet me over in hancock park not the neighborhood the actual park know where it is over by the tar pits yeah meet me on the sixth street side behind the museums theres a shady area some benches whatre you gonna wear jeans and a white shirt fine ill be wearing no this is wrinkled gotta change it ill be wearing a green blouse green with a white collar just look for an ugly old woman with a green blouse and a crappy disposition the blouse was grass green she was sitting under a thatch of mismatched trees on a bench facing the rolling lawn that separated the county art museum from the dinosaur depository george page had built with mission pack money at the end of the lawn the tar pits were an oily black sump behind wrought iron pickets through the fence plaster mastodons reared and glared at the traffic on wilshire boulevard tar leaked through the entire park seeping up in random spots and i just missed stepping in a bubbling pool as i made my way toward rolanda basille her back was to sixth street but i had a threequarter view of her body around sixtyfive her collar was a snowy peter pan job her slacks olive wool much too heavy for the weather she had hair dyed as black as the tar cut in a flapper bob with eyebrowlength bangs her face was crinkled and small arthritic hands curled in her lap red tennis shoes covered her feet over white socks folded over once a big green plastic purse hung from her shoulder if she weighed a hundred pounds it was after thanksgiving dinner the ground was covered with dry leaves and i made noise as i approached she kept gazing out at the lawn and didnt look back children were playing there mobile dots on an emerald screen but i wasnt sure she saw them the random trees had been trimmed to form a canopy and the shadows they cast were absolute several other benches were scattered nearby most of them empty a black man slept on one a paper bag next to his head two women of rolanda basilles approximate age sat on another strumming guitars and singing i walked in front of her she barely looked up then slapped the bench i sat down music drifted over from the two guitarists some sort of folk song a foreign language the stepne sisters she said sticking out her tongue theyre here all the time they stink did you ever see a picture of my daughter just in the paper that wasnt a flattering one she opened the big purse searched for a while and took out a mediumsized envelope withdrawing three color photographs she handed them to me professional portraits passable quality rebecca basille sitting in a white wicker chair posed three different ways in front of a mountainstream backdrop wearing a powderblue dress and pearls big smile terrific teeth very pretty soft curvy build soft arms a trifle heavy the dress was lowcut and showed some cleavage her brown hair was shiny and long and ironcurled at the ends her eyes full of humor and just a bit of apprehension as if shed been sitting for a long time and had doubts about the outcome very lovely i said she was beautiful said rolanda inside and out she held out her hand and i returned the photos after shed replaced them in the purse she said i just wanted you to see the person she was though even these dont do it she didnt like having her picture taken used to be chubby when she was little her face was always gorgeous i nodded she said there was a wounded bird within five miles beckyd find it and bring it home shoeboxes and cotton balls and eyedroppers she tried to save anything bugsthose little gray curly things potato bugs those moths ladybugs whatever shed save em when she was real little she went through this stage of not wanting anyone to cut the lawn because she thought it hurt the grass she tried to smile but her lips got away from her and began trembling she covered them with one hand you see what im saying she said finally i do she never changed in school she went straight for the outcasts anyone who was different or hurting the retarded kids harelips you name it sometimes i think she was attracted to hurt another forage in the purse she found redframed sunglasses and put them on given the ambient shade they must have blacked out the world i said i can see why she went into social work exactly i always figured she would do something like that always told her nursing or social work would be perfect for her but of course when you tell them they do something else so it took her a while to know what she wanted she didnt want to go to college did some waitressing some file clerking secretarial my other kids were different real driven got a boy practicing orthopedic medicine in reno and my older girl works in a bank in st louis assistant vice president was becky the youngest she nodded nine years between her and kathy eleven between her and carl she was i was fortyone when i had her and her father was five years older than me he walked out on us right after she was born left me high and dry with three kids sugar diabetic and he refused to stop drinking he started losing feeling in his feet then the eyes started going finally they began cutting pieces off of him and he decided with no toes and one arm it was time to be a swinging bachelor crazy huh she shook her head he moved to tahoe didnt last long after that she said becky was two when he died we hadnt heard from him all that time suddenly the government started sending me his veterans benefits you think thats what made her so vulnerable no what do you people call it father role model how was becky vulnerable i said too trusting she touched her collar smoothed out an invisible wrinkle she went straight for the losers believed every cockandbull story what kind of losers more wounded birds guys she thought she could fix she wanted to fix the world her hands began to shake and she shoved them under her purse the stepne sisters were singing louder she said shut up did the losers mistreat her losers she said as if she hadnt heard the great poet with no poems to show for it living off welfare bunch of musicians socalled not men little boys i nagged her all the time all the deadends she was choosing in the end none of that mattered a whit did it she lifted her sunglasses and wiped an eye with one finger putting the shades back she said you dont need to hear this youve got your own problems i saw faint reflections of myself in her black lenses distorted and tense you seem like a nice young fellow listening to me go on like this ever save any bugs yourself maybe a couple of times she smiled bet it was more than a couple bet you punched those holes in the top of the jars so the bugs could breathe right bet your mother loved that too all those creepy things in the house i laughed im right arent i i should be a psychologist it does bring back certain memories i said sure she said out to save the world all of you you married no a fellow like you same attitude as my becky you would have been okay for her you could have saved the world together but to be honest she probably wouldnt have gone for you no offense youre just too puttogether thats a compliment believe me she patted my knee frowned im sorry for what youre going through and be sure to take good care of yourself something happens to you your mothers going to die over and over youll be gone but shell be left dying every dayunderstand the hand on my knee clawed i nodded something happens to you your mothers going to lie in bed and think about you over and over and over wondering how much you suffered wondering what you were thinking when it happened to you why it happened to her kid and not someone elses do you understand what im saying i do so be careful thats why im here i said to protect myself she whipped off the sunglasses her eyes were so raw the whites looked brown gritz no she never said a word about anyone named that or silk or merino did she ever talk about hewitt no not really she seemed to be deliberating i didnt move or speak the raw eyes moistened she mentioned him once maybe a week or two before said she was treating this really crazy person and thought she was helping him she said it respectfully this poor sick fellow that she really wanted to help schizophrenic whatever hearing voices no one else had been able to help him but she thought she could he was starting to trust her she spat on the ground she mentioned him by name no she made a point of not talking about any of them by name big point of following the rules remembering beckys sketchy notes and lack of followthrough with jean i said a real stickler huh that was becky back when she was in grade school her teachers always said they wished they had a classroom full of beckys even with her loser boyfriends she always stayed on the straight and narrow not using drugs nothing thats why they wouldnt she shook her head put her glasses back on and showed me the back of her head between thin strands of dyed hair her neck was liverspotted and looseskinned i said why they wouldnt what no answer for a moment then they wouldnt stick with her they always left her can you beat that the ones who were going to get divorced always went back to their wives the ones who were on the wagon always fell off and left her she was ten times the human being any of them were but they always walked out on her can you beat that they were the unstable ones i said exactly deadend losers what she needed was someone with high standards but she wasnt attracted to that only the broken ones was she in a relationship at the time she died i dont know probably the last time i saw her couple of days before she stopped by to give me some laundry i asked her how her social life was and she refused to talk about it what that usually meant was she was involved with someone she knew id nag her about i got upset with her we didnt talk much how was i supposed to know it was the last time and i should have enjoyed every minute i had with her her shoulders bowed and quivered i touched one of them and she sat up suddenly enough of this i hate this moping around thats why i quit that survivors group your friend sturgis recommended too much selfpity meanwhile i havent done a damn thing for you my head was full of assumptions and guesses learning of beckys attraction to losers had firmed up the suspicions left by her notes i smiled and said its been good talking to you good talking to you too do i get a bill no the first hours free well look at that handsome a caddy and a sense of humor to boot you do pretty well dont you financially i do okay modesty bet you do better than okay thats what i wanted for becky security i told her what are you wasting your time for doing dirty work for the county finish up your degree get some kind of license open up an office in beverly hills and treat fat people or those women who starve themselves make some money no crime in that right but she wouldnt hear of it wanted to do important work with people who were really needy she shook her head saving the bugs she said almost inaudibly she thought she was dealing with those potato thingies but a scorpion got into the jar her description of becky as a stickler for the rules didnt fit with jean jeffers recollections a mothers vision could be overly rosy but shed been frank about beckys chronic attraction to losers had becky finally been attracted to the ultimate loser how loose had things gotten between her and hewitt and what twisted dynamic bound the two of them to g bad love blaming the victim bothered me but revenge seemed to be the fuel that powered the killers engine and i had to wonder if becky had been a target of something other than random psychosis i drove home straining to make sense of it no strange vehicles within a hundred yards of the gate and last nights anxiety seemed silly robin was working looking preoccupied and content and the dog was chewing a nylon bone milo just called from santa barbara she said the numbers on the kitchen counter i went into the house found an exchange that wasnt sally graysons and punched it a voice answered records dr delaware returning detective sturgiss call one minute i waited five sturgis hi just got through talking to beckys mother becky never mentioned anyone by name but she did talk about helping a poor unfortunate psychotic who could very well have been hewitt no mention of gritz nor of silk or merino one thing that was interesting though she said becky liked to mend broken wings and had a penchant for losers guys who involved her in deadend relationships if you think of hewitt as the ultimate loser it supports what we suspected about things getting unprofessional between them having said all that i dont know that it leads us anywhere well were not doing much better here no school records at katarinas house so either she never kept them or the killer made off with them we do have confirmation that myra evans was myra paprock but its a nogo on rodney shipler his tax records show him working for the la unified school district for thirty years right after he got out of the army never up here and i verified it with the sb district no connection at all to the de bosch school what about summer vacations i said school personnel sometimes take parttime jobs during the offseason summers he worked in la how long was he in the army fifteen years staff sergeant most of it over in the philippines honorable discharge no blots on his record he made somebody mad it doesnt look like it was someone at the school in fact we cant find any records of anything fishy happening out at the school no fires or felonies or anything anybody would want to avenge alex just a few complaints about noise from bancroft and one vehicular accident that did occur when myra evans was teaching there may of seventythree but it was clearly an accident one of the students stole a school truck and took a joyride made it up to the riviera district and spun off a mountain road he died santa barbara pd investigated found no foul play how old was the student fifteen vehicular accident off a mountain road i said grant stoumen was hit by a car and mitchell lerner was pushed off a mountain thats a little abstract alex maybe not if matching things achieving consistency is part of the killers fantasy pause youd know more about that than i would but why focus on the school when weve got a victim with no connection to it no obvious connection to de bosch period shipler could have been connected to the symposium how a janitor with a side interest in psychology or did he sweep up afterward maybe its the race angle somehow shipler was black and de bosch was a covert bigot why would someone pissed off about racism beat a black man to death i dont know but im sure de bosch is at the core of this the school the conference all of it merino told harrison the conference set off something in him maybe it was seeing de bosch lauded publicly when he knew the truth to be otherwise maybe but so far the schools got a clean record bancroft seemed to think it was a hotbed of antisocial behavior bancroft isnt your most reliable witness sally says hes been known to hit the bottle pretty hard and his world views somewhat to the right of the klan compared to his old man hes a pussycat the two of them had a special thing for de bosch because de bosch overbid bancroft senior for the land the school was built on when de bosch broke ground in sixtytwo they tried to mobilize the neighbors against it disturbed kids running amok but no one went along with it because the bancrofts had alienated everyone over the years the neighbors didnt mind a school for problem kids there were some worries but the lot being vacant bothered them more vagrants used to come off the highway light fires toss trash make a mess bancroft senior had dickered with the owner for years making offers withdrawing them de boschs school was an improvement as far as the neighborhood was concerned real quiet no problems except for a fifteenyearold kid in a stolen truck one incident in twenty years alex considering that de bosch dealt with emotionally disturbed kids wouldnt you say thats pretty good id say its excellent i said exemplary and one way to keep things so tidy is through firm discipline very firm discipline he sighed sure its possible but if de bosch was running a torture chamber wouldnt there be complaints five dead people is a complaint okay but if you want a hostility motive look at bancroft he had a hardon for de bosch for over twenty years but that doesnt mean he ran around the country murdering everyone associated with him maybe he should be looked into he will be he said wearily hes being looked into meanwhile you be careful and sit tight im sorry alex i wish the goddamn pieces had fit together neatly but its turning out to be messy just like real life i said anything new on katarina coroner still cant decide if she was conscious or unconscious after those blows to the face her baby was indeed a twentytwoweekold normal male caucasian i called the sperm bank they wouldnt even verify she was a customer sally and i can probably pry some information loose eventually meanwhile is robin coming to us rick says no problem except for rover excuse me spike dog allergy but if robin really wants to take the pooch with her he can put himself on antihistamines he wont need to i said robin insists on staying with me must be your charm well dont sweat it im sure youre safe hope so i told him about the brake lights the previous night just lights nothing funny just lights and then the car drove off what time was this nine fortyfive or so any other cars around quite a few sounds like nothing if you see anything funny call beverly hills pd they protect their citizenry i will thanks for everything the kid who went off the mountain did he have a name still on that huh he gave a small laugh his name was delmar parker and he originally came from new orleans what was he being treated for at the school dont know theres no complete police report because the case was closed and filed were working from summary cards at the coroners office and lucky to find them lets see name date age cause of death multiple traumas and internal injuries place of birth nawleens parent or guardian here it is the mother marie a parker any address no why you want to dig up another one no i said i dont want to dig up anything believe me im just grasping milo silence okay ill try but dont count on it it was a long time ago people move people die i pretended everything was normal robin and i ate lunch out by the pool the sky was clear and beautiful bracing itself for a smog cloud heading over from the east lifestyles of the rich and fearful terror and anger still gnawed at my spine but i thought of the people under the freeway and knew i had it damned good the phone rang my service operator said theres a longdistance call for you dr delaware from new york a mr rosenblatt mister not doctor misters what he said okay i said put him on she did but no one answered my hello a few seconds later a young woman with an allbusiness voice clicked in and said schechter mohl and trimmer who are you holding for mr rosenblatt one moment a few seconds later a young voice said this is mr rosenblatt this is dr delaware throat clear dr delaware my name is joshua rosenblatt im a practicing attorney here in new york and im calling to ask you to stop phoning my mother dr shirley rosenblatt ive been phoning because i was concerned about your father then you have nothing to be concerned about hes all right silence i said is he all right no i wouldnt say that pause my fathers deceased i felt myself deflate im sorry be that as it may dr delaware when did it happen was it four years ago long silence throat clear i really dont want to get into this doctor was it made to look like an accident i said some kind of fall something to do with a vehicle were the words bad love left anywhere at his death scene doctor he began but his voice broke on the second syllable and he blurted weve been through enough already at this point theres no need to rake it up im in danger i said maybe from the same person who killed your father what i called because i was trying to warn your father and im so sorry its too late i only met him once but i liked him he seemed like a really decent guy long pause when did you meet him he said softly in nineteen seventynine here in los angeles he and i cochaired a mental health symposium called good lovebad love strategies in a changing world a tribute to a teacher of your fathers named andres de bosch no response mr rosenblatt none of this makes any sense you were with him on that trip i said dont you remember i went on lots of trips with my father i know i said he told me he talked about you quite a bit said you were his youngest you liked hot dogs and video games he wanted to take you to disneyland but the park closed early in the fall so i suggested he take you to the santa monica pier did you go hot dogs his voice sounded weak so what whats the point i think that trip had something to do with his death no no thats crazy no back in seventynine some kind of longterm revenge plot i said something to do with andres de bosch the person who murdered your father has killed other people at least five others maybe more i gave him names dates places he said i dont know any of those people this is crazy this is really insane yes it is but its all true and i may be next i need to talk to your mother the killer may have presented himself to your father as a patient lured him that way if shes still got your fathers old appointment books it could no she has nothing leave her out of this my lifes at stake why wont your mother just talk to me whyd she have you call me instead of calling herself because she cant he said angrily cant talk to anyone she had a stroke a month ago and her speech was severely affected it just came back a few weeks ago but shes still weak im sorry but listen im sorry too for what youre going through but at this point i just dont see what i can do for you your mothers talking now yes but shes weak really weak and to have her talk about my father she just started rehab and shes making progress dr delaware i cant have her interrogated you never told her i called im taking care of her it calls for decisions i understand i said but i dont want to interrogate her i just want to talk to her a few questions at her pace i can fly out to new york if thatll help and do it facetoface as many sessions as she needs go as slowly as she needs youd do that fly out here what choice do i have i heard him blow out breath even so he said her talking about dad no its too risky im sorry but i have to hold firm ill work with her doctors mr rosenblatt clear my questions with them and with you ive done hospital work for years i understand illness and recovery what makes you think she knows anything that could help you at this point shes my last hope mr rosenblatt the creep whos after me is picking up his pace he murdered someone in santa barbara yesterday de boschs daughter she was pregnant he cut her up made it a point to go after the fetus oh god hes stalking me i said to tell the truth id be safer in new york than here one way or the other i may come out another exhalation i doubt she can help you but ill ask i really apprecia dont thank me yet im not promising anything and fax your credentials to me so i can check them out include two verifiable references no problem i said and if your mother wont speak to me please ask her if she knows anything about the term bad love and did your father report anything unusual about the nineteen seventynine conference you can also throw out some names lyle gritz dorsey hewitt silk merino whore they hewitts a definite killer murdered a therapist out here and was shot by the police gritz was his friend may have been an accomplice he may also be the one who killed your father silk and merino are possible aliases fake names he said this is so bizarre one more thing i said theres an lapd detective working the case out here named milo sturgis im going to inform him of your fathers murder and hell be contacting the new york police and asking for records that wont help you he said believe me milo was no longer at records and sally graysons number was picked up by a male detective who hadnt seen her all morning and had no idea who milo was i left a message and wondered why joshua rosenblatt had been so sure the police couldnt help my offer to go to new york had been impulsive probably an escape reflex but maybe something would come out of my talk with shirley rosenblatt id leave as soon as possible robin would have to move out now i looked out at the pool still as a slab of turquoise a few leaves floated on top who cleaned it how often i didnt know much about this place didnt know when id be able to leave it i got up ready to drive into beverly hills to find a fax service just as i put my wallet in my pants pocket the phone rang and my service operator said a mr bucklear wants to talk to you doctor put him on click doctor sherman bucklear hello have you received my correspondence yes i have i havent received any reply doctor didnt know there was anything to reply to i have reason to believe you have knowledge of the whereabouts i dont can you prove that do i have to pause doctor we can go about this civilly or things can get complicated complicate away sherman now wait a sec i hung up it felt great to be petty before i could put down the phone the service patched in again with a call from new york dr delaware josh rosenblatt again my mothers willing to talk to you but ive got to warn you she cant handle much just a few minutes at a time i havent discussed any details with her all she knows is you knew my father and think he was murdered she may have nothing to tell you you may end up wasting your time ill take the chance when would you like me there whats today tuesday fridays bad and she needs her weekends for total bedrest thursday i guess if i can catch a flight tonight how about tomorrow tomorrow i guess so but itll have to be in the afternoon mornings she has her therapy then she naps come to my office first fifth avenue schechter mohl and trimmer the thirtythird floor have you faxed me your credentials yet just on my way out to do it good because thatll be a prerequisite send me something with a picture too if everything checks out ill see you say twothirty i found a quickprint place on cañon drive and faxed my documents to new york returning home i postponed telling robin and called an airline booking myself a ten pm flight out of lax i asked the ticket agent about hotels she said midtown i really dont know sir but you might try the middleton the executives from our company stay there but its expensive of course everything in new york is unless you want a real dive i thanked her and phoned the hotel a very boredsounding man took my credit card number then grudgingly agreed to give me a single room for two hundred and twenty dollars a night when he quoted the price he suppressed a yawn i told robin about rosenblatt first she shook her head took hold of my hand four years ago i said another gap filled in howd he die the son didnt go into any details but if the killers being consistent it was probably something to do with a car or a fall all those people my god pressing my hand up against her cheek she closed her eyes the smell of glue hung in the garage along with coffee and dust and the sound of the dogs breathing i felt him nosing up against my leg looked down at his wide flat face he blinked a couple of times and licked my hand i told robin of my plan to fly east and offered to have her come with me she said thered be no point to it would there its not going to be a vacation just more digging up peoples misery im starting to feel like a ghoul she looked off at her tools and her molds only time ive been in new york was a family trip we went all the way up to niagara falls mom and dad squabbling the whole time i havent been there myself since grad school she nodded touched my biceps rubbed it you have to go things are getting uglier and uglier here when are you leaving i was thinking tonight ill take you to the airport when will you be coming home so i can pick you up depends on what i find probably within a day or two do you have a place to stay i found a hotel a hotel she said you alone in some room she shook her head could you please stay with milo and rick while im gone i know its disruptive and unnecessary but id have a lot more peace of mind she touched my face again you havent had much of that lately have you sure why not i tried a couple more times to reach milo without success wanting to get robin settled as soon as possible i phoned his house rick was there and i told him wed be coming over well take good care of her alex im really sorry for all this crap youve been going through im sure the big guy will get to the bottom of it im sure he will too will the dog be a problem no i dont think so milo tells me hes pretty cute milo never expressed any affection for him in my presence does that surprise you no i said he laughed are you badly allergic rick dont know never had a dog but dont worry ill pick up some seldane in the er or write myself a scrip speaking of which i have to head over to cedars pretty soon when were you planning on coming this evening any idea when miloll be back your guess is as good as mine tell you what ill leave a key in back of the house therere two sago palms growing up against the rear wall you havent been here since we relandscaped have you just to pick up milo came out great our water consumptions way down the sago palms do you know what they are squat things with leaves that look like fan blades exactly ill leave the key under the branches of the smaller one the one on the right milo would kill me if he knew more laughter we have a new alarm code too he changes it every couple of months he rattled off five numbers i copied them down and thanked him again pleasure he said this should be fun weve never had a pet i packed my carryon and robin packed hers we took the dog for a walk around the property and played with him and finally he got sleepy we left him resting and drove into town for an early dinner taking robins truck cholesterol palace on south beverly drive thick steaks and homefried potatoes served in lumberjack portions at prices no lumberjack could afford the food looked great and smelled great and my taste buds told me it probably tasted great too but somewhere along the line the circuitry between my tongue and my brain fizzed and i found myself chewing mechanically forcing meat down a dry tight throat at seven we cleaned the house on benedict picked up the dog locked up and drove over to west hollywood the key was where rick had said it would be placed on the ground precisely at the middle of the palms corrugated trunk the rest of the yard was desertpale and composed droughttolerant plants spread expertly around the tiny space the walls were higher and topped with ragged stone inside the place was different too whitewashed hardwood floors big leather chairs glass tables gray fabric walls the guest room was pine an old iron bed was freshly made and turned down a single white rose rested on the pillow and a bar of swiss chocolate was on a dish on the nightstand how sweet said robin picking up the flower and twirling it she looked around this is like a great little inn sheets of newspaper were spread on the floor next to the bed on them were a white ceramic bowl filled with water a plasticwrapped hunk of cheddar cheese and a shirt cardboard lettered in fountain pen in ricks perfect surgeons hand poochs corner the dog went straight for the cheese nosing it and having trouble with the concept of seethrough plastic i unwrapped it and fed it to him in bits we let him explore the yard for a while then went back inside every time i come here theyve done something else robin said they i dont think so rob true you know sometimes i have trouble imagining milo living here i bet he loves it refuge from all the ugliness someone else to worry about the details for a change youre probably right we can all use a refuge cant we at eight she drove me to lax the place had been rebuilt a few years ago for the olympics and was a lot more manageable but incoming arteries were still clogged and we waited to enter the departure lanes the whole city had been freshened up for the games more energy and creativity mustered during one summer than the braindead mayor and the pissandmoan city council had come up with in two decades now they were back to their old apathyandsleaze routine and the city was rotting wherever the rich didnt live robin pulled up to the curb the dog couldnt enter the terminal so we said our goodbyes right there and feeling lost and edgy i entered the building the main hall was a painfully bright temple of transition people looked either bone weary or jumpy security clearance was slow because the westerngarbed man in front of me kept setting off the metal detector finally someone figured out it was due to the metal shanks in his snakeskin boots and we started moving again i made it to the gate by ninefifteen got my boarding pass waited a half hour then stood in line and finally got to my seat the plane began taxiing at tenten then stopped we sat on the runway for a while and finally lifted off a couple of thousand feet up la was still a giant circuit board then a cloud bank then darkness i slept on and off for most of the flight woke varnished in sweat kennedy was crowded and hostile i lugged my carryon past the hordes at the baggage carousels and picked up a cab at the curb the car smelled of boiled cabbage and was plastered with nosmoking signs in english spanish and japanese the driver had an unpronounceable name and he wore a blue tank top and a white ski hat the hat was rolled triple so the edge created a brim it resembled a soft bowler i said the middleton hotel on west fiftysecond street he grunted something and drove off very slowly the little i saw of queens from the highway was lowrise and old bricks and chrome and graffiti but when we got on the queensboro bridge the water was calm and lovely and the skyline of manhattan loomed with threat and promise the middleton was twenty stories of black granite sandwiched between office buildings that dwarfed it the doorman looked ready for retirement and the lobby was shabby elegant and empty my room was on the tenth floor small as a death row cell filled with colonial furniture and sealed by blackout drapes clean and well ordered but it smelled of mildew and roach killer a dead quailhunt print hung over the bed the airconditioner was a heavymetal instrument street noise made it up this far with little loss of volume no rose on my pillow unpacking i changed into shorts and a tshirt ordered a threedollar english muffin and fivedollar eggs then punched the operators and asked for a wakeup call at one the food came surprisingly quickly and even more amazing was tasty when i finished i put the tray on a glasstopped bureau pulled back the covers and got into bed the tv remote was bolted to the nightstand a cardboard guide listed thirty or so cable stations the last choice was an early morning public access show featuring a dull pudgy nude man interviewing dull nude women he had narrow womanish shoulders and a very hairy body okay velvet he said leering so what do you do for uh fun a painfully thin blond with a beak nose and frizzy hair touched a nipple and said macramé i switched off the set lights out the blackout drapes did their job well my heart was as dark as the room i beat the wakeup call by more than an hour after showering shaving and dressing i drew open the drapes on a view of the redbrick building across the street men in white shirts and ties were framed in its windows sitting at desks talking into phones and stabbing the air with pens down below the streets were clogged with doubleparked cars horns blatted someone was using a compression drill even through the sealed windows i could smell the city i phoned robin at just past nine la time we told each other we were fine and chatted for a while before she put milo on talk about bicoastal he said expedition or escape bit of both i guess thanks for taking care of the lady and the tramp pleasure got a little more info on mr gritz traced him to a small town in georgia and just got finished talking to the police chief seems lyle was a weird kid acted goofy walked funny mumbled a lot didnt have any friends out of school more than he was in never learned to read properly or speak clearly his home life was predictably bad too no father on the scene and he and his mother lived in a trailer on the outskirts of town he started drinking slid straight into trouble shoplifting theft vandalism once in a while hed get into a fight with someone bigger and stronger than himself and come out the loser chief said he locked him up plenty but he didnt seem to care jail was as good as his home or better he used to sit in his cell and rock and talk to himself as if he was in his own world sounds more like the early signs of schizophrenia than a developing psychopath i said onset during adolescence fits the schizophrenic pattern too what doesnt fit is the kind of calculated thing were dealing with does this sound like a guy who could blend in at medical conferences delay gratification long enough to plot murders years in advance not really but maybe he changed when he grew up got smoother mr silk i said maybe hes a good faker always was faked looking nuts even back then psychopaths do that all the time right they do i said but did this police chief sound like someone easily fooled no he said the kid was nuts but had one thing going for him musical talent taught himself to play guitar and mandolin and banjo and a bunch of other instruments the next elvis yeah and for a while people thought he might actually make something of himself then one day he just left town and no one heard from him again how long ago was this nineteenseventy so he was only twelve any idea why he left chief had just busted him for drunk and disorderly again gave him the usual lecture then added a few bucks for him to get some new clothes and a haircut figured maybe if the kid looked better hed act better lyle walked out of the police station and headed straight for the train depot police chief later found he used the money to buy a oneway ticket to atlanta twelve years old i said he could have kept traveling and ended up in santa barbara been taken in by de bosch as a charity case de bosch liked to put forth the humanitarian image publicly wish i could get hold of school records no one seems to have any not the city or the county what about federal if de bosch applied for government funding for the charity cases there might be some kind of documentation dont know how long those agencies hold on to their records but ill check so far im drawing a blank on this bastard first time he shows up in california is an arrest nine years ago no ncic record prior to that so thats over a decade between his leaving georgia and the beginnings of his west coast life of crime if he got busted for petty stuff in other small towns it might very well not have been entered into the national computer but still youd expect something hes a bad egg where the hell was he all that time how about in a mental institution i said twelve years old out on his own god knows what could have happened to him out on the street he might have suffered a mental breakdown and got put away or if he was at the school the same time as delmar parker maybe he observed delmars death and broke down over that big assumption he and delmar knowing each other it is but there are some factors that might point in that direction he and delmar were around the same age both were southern boys a long way from home maybe gritz finally made a friend maybe he even had something to do with delmar stealing the truck if he did and escaped death but saw delmar die that could have pulled the rug out from under him psychologically so now hes blaming the school and de bosch and everyone associated with it sure why not i just wish we could push it past theory place gritz in santa barbara let alone the school let alone knowing the parker kid et cetera et cetera any luck finding parkers mother she doesnt live in new orleans and i havent been able to find any other relatives so where does this silkmerino thing come in why would a southern boy pick himself a latino alias merinos a type of wool i said or a sheep the flock following the shepherd and getting misled baaa he said when are you planning to see rosenblatts kid couple of hours good luck and dont worry everything heres cool ms castagna lends a nice touch to the place maybe well keep her no i dont think so sure he said chuckling why not womans touch and all that hell we can keep the beast too put up a picket fence around the lawn one big happy family new york was as clear as an etching all corners and windows vanishing rooflines skinny strips of blue sky i walked to the law firm heading south on fifth avenue swept along in the midtown tide comforted somehow by the forced intimacy the shop windows were as glossy as diamonds people wearing business faces hurtled toward the next obligation threecard monte players shouted invitations took quick profit then vaporized into the crowd street vendors hawked silly toys cheap watches tourist maps and paperback books stripped of their covers the homeless squatted in doorways leaned against buildings bearing crudely lettered signs and paper cups their hands out their eyes leeched of expectation so many more of them than in la but yet they seemed to belong part of the citys rhythm five hundred fifth avenue was a sixhundredfoot limestone tower the lobby an arena of marble and granite i arrived with an hour to spare and walked back outside wondering what to do with the time i bought a hot dog from a pushcart ate it watching the throng then i spotted the main branch of the public library just across fortysecond street and made my way up the broad stone stairs after a bit of asking and wandering i located the periodicals room the hour went fast as i checked fouryearold new york newspapers for obituaries on harvey rosenblatt nothing i thought of the psychiatrists kind open manner the loving way hed spoken about his wife and children a teenaged boy whod liked hot dogs the taste of mine was still on my lips sour and warm my thoughts shifted to a twelveyearold leaving town on a oneway ticket to atlanta life had sneak attacked both of them but josh rosenblatt had been much more heavily armed for the ambush i left to see how well hed survived schechter mohl and trimmers decorator had gone for tradition carved riffoak panels with laundrysharp creases layers of heavy moldings voluptuous plaster work wool rugs over herringbone floors the receptionists desk was a huge walnut antique the receptionist was pure contemporary midtwenties whiteblonde vogue face hair tied back tight enough to pucker her hairline breasts sharp enough to make an embrace dangerous she checked a ledger and said have a seat and mr rosenblatt will be right with you i waited twenty minutes until the door to the inner offices opened and a tall goodlooking young man stepped into the reception area i knew he was twentyseven but he looked like a college student his face was long and grave under dark wavy hair nose narrow and full his chin strong and dimpled he wore a pinstriped charcoal suit white tab shirt and red and pearl tie pearl pocket handkerchief quadruple pointed tassled black loafers gold phi beta kappa pin in his lapel intense brown eyes and a golf tan if law started to bore him he could always pose for the brooks brothers catalogue dr delaware josh rosenblatt no smile one arm out bonecrusher handshake i followed him through a quarter acre of secretaries file cabinets and computers to a broad wall of doors his was just off to the left his name in brass on polished oak his office wasnt much bigger than my hotel cubicle but one wall was glass and it offered a falcons lair view of the city on the wall were two degrees from columbia his phi beta kappa certificate and a lacrosse stick mounted diagonally a gym bag sat in one corner documents were piled up everywhere including on one of the straightbacked side chairs facing the desk i took the empty chair he removed his jacket and tossed it on the desk very broad shoulders powerful chest outsize hands he sat down amid the clutter shuffled papers while studying me what kind of law do you practice i said business do you litigate only when i need to get a taxi no im one of the behindthescenes guys mole in a suit he drummed the desk with his palm a few times kept staring at me put his hands down flat same face as your picture he said id expected someone older closer to dads age i appreciate your taking the time having someone you love murdered he wasnt murdered he said almost barking not officially anyway officially he committed suicide though the rabbi filed it as an accident so he could be buried with his parents suicide you met my dad did he seem like an unhappy person on the contrary damn right on the contrary his face reddened he loved life really knew how to have fun we used to kid him that he never really grew up thats what made him a good psychiatrist he was such a happy guy other psychiatrists used to make jokes about it harvey rosenblatt the only welladjusted shrink in new york he got up looked down on me he was never depressed the least moody person i ever met and he was a great father never played shrink with us at home just a dad he played ball with me even though he was no good at it couldnt change a lightbulb but no matter what he was doing hed put it aside to listen to you and we knew it all three of us we saw what other fathers were like and we appreciated him we never believed he killed himself but they kept saying it the goddamn police the evidence is clear over and over like a broken record he cursed and slapped the desk theyre a bureaucracy just like everything else in this city they went from point a to point b found c and said good night time to punch the clock and go home so we hired a private investigator someone the firm had used and all he did was go over the same territory the police had covered say the same damn thing so i guess i should be happy youre here telling me we werent nuts how did they say it happened i said a car crash or some kind of fall he pulled his head back as if avoiding a punch glared at me began loosening his tie then thought better of it and tugged it up against his throat even tighter picking up his jacket he flipped it over his shoulder lets get the hell out of here you in shape he said looking me up and down decent twenty blocks do you in i shook my head he pressed forward into the throng heading uptown i jogged to catch up watching him manipulate the sidewalk like an indy driver swaying into openings stepping off the curb when that was the fastest way to go swinging his arms and looking straight ahead sharpeyed watchful selfdefensive i started to notice lots of other people with that same look thousands of people running the urban gauntlet i expected him to stop at sixtyfifth street but he kept going to sixtyseventh turning east he led me up two blocks and stopped in front of a redbrick building eight floors high plain and flat set between two ornate graystones on the ground floor were medical offices the town house on the right housed a french restaurant with a long black awning lettered in gold at street level a couple of limousines were parked at the curb he pointed upward thats where it happened an apartment on the top floor and yeah they said he jumped whose apartment was it he kept staring up then down at the pavement directly in front of us a dermatologists window was fronted by a boxful of geraniums josh seemed to study the flowers when he faced me pain had immobilized his face its my mothers story he said shirley and harvey rosenblatt had worked where they lived in a narrow brownstone with a gated entry three stories more geraniums a maple with an iron trunk guard surviving at the curb josh produced a ring of keys and used one key to open the gate the lobby ceiling was coffered walnut the floor was covered in tiny blackandwhite hexagonal tiles backed by etched glass double doors and a brass elevator the walls were freshly painted beige a potted palm stood in one corner another was occupied by a louis xiv chair three brass mailboxes were bolted to the north wall number said rosenblatt josh unlocked it and drew out a stack of envelopes before unlatching the glass doors behind it was a smaller vestibule dark paneled and gloomy soup and powderedcleanser smells two more walnut doors one unmarked with a mezuzah nailed to the post the other bearing a brass plaque that said shirley m rosenblatt phd pc the faint outline of where another sign had been glued was visible just above josh unlocked the plain one and held it open for me i stepped into a narrow entry hall lined with framed daumier prints to my left was a bentwood hall tree from which hung a single raincoat a gray tabby cat came from nowhere and padded toward us on the parquet floor josh stepped in front of me and said hey leo the cat stopped arched its tail relaxed it and walked up to him he dropped his hand the cats tongue darted when it saw me its yellow eyes slitted josh said its okay leo i guess he scooped up the cat held it to his chest and told me this way the hall emptied into a small sitting room to the right was a dining room furnished with mock chippendale to the left a tiny kitchen white and spotless though the shades were up on every window the view was a brownstone six feet away leaving the entire apartment dark and denlike simple furniture not much of it some paintings nothing flashy or expensive everything perfectly in place i knew one way josh had rebelled beyond the sitting room was another living area slightly larger more casual tv easy chairs a spinet piano three walls of bookshelves filled with hardbacks and family photos the fourth was bisected by an arched door that josh opened hello josh said sticking his head through the cat fussed and he let it down it studied me finally disappeared behind a sofa the sound of another door opening josh stepped back as a black woman in a white nurses uniform came out in her forties she had a round face a stocky but shapely figure and bright eyes hello mr rosenblatt west indian accent selena he said taking her hand how is she everything is perfect she had a generous breakfast and a nice long nap robbie was here at ten and they did almost the full hour of exercise good is she up now yes the nurses eyes shifted to me shes been waiting for you this is dr delaware hello doctor selena limberton hello we shook hands josh said have you had your lunch break yet no said the nurse now would be a good time they talked a bit more about medicines and exercises and i studied the family portraits settling on one that showed harvey rosenblatt in a dark threepiece suit beaming in the midst of his brood josh around eighteen with long unruly hair a fuzzy mustache and blackrimmed eyeglasses next to him a beautiful girl with a long graceful face and sculpted cheekbones maybe two or three years older the same dark eyes as her brother the oldest child was a young man in his midtwenties who resembled josh but thick necked and heavier with cruder features curly hair and a full dark beard that mimicked his fathers shirley rosenblatt was tiny fair and blueeyed her blond hair cut very short her smile full but frail even in health her shoulders werent much wider than those of a child it was hard to imagine her birthing the robust trio mrs limberton said all righty then ill be back in an hour wheres leo josh looked around i said i think hes hiding behind the couch the nurse went over bent and lifted the cat his body was limp nuzzling him she said ill bring you back some chicken if you behave the cat blinked she set him down on the couch and he curled up eyes open and watchful josh said did you feed the fish she smiled yes everythings taken care of now you dont worry yourself about any more details shes going to be fine nice meeting you doctor byebye the door closed josh frowned dont worry he said i went to school to learn how to worry another small room this one yellow the windows misted by lace curtains shirley rosenblatt looked better than i had expected propped up in a hospital bed and covered to the waist with a white comforter her hair was still blond though dyed lighter and shed grown it out a little her delicate face had remained pretty a wicker bed tray was pushed into one corner to one side of the bed was a cane chair and a pine dresser topped by perfume bottles opposite that stood a large saltwater aquarium on a teakwood base the water bubbled silently gorgeous fish glided through a miniature coral reef josh kissed his mothers forehead she smiled and took hold of his hand her fingers barely stretched the width the comforter dropped a couple of inches she was wearing a flannel nightgown buttoned to the neck and fastened with a bow on her nightstand was a collection of pill bottles a stack of magazines and a coilspring handgrip exerciser josh held onto her hand she smiled up at him then turned the smile on me gentle blue eyes none of her children had gotten them josh said heres the mail want me to open it she shook her head and reached out he put the stack on her lap but she left it there and continued to look at me this is dr delaware he said i said alex delaware but i didnt hold out my hand because i didnt want to dislodge his thanks for seeing me dr rosenblatt shirley her voice was very weak and talking seemed a great effort but the word came out clearly she blinked a couple of times her right shoulder was lower than her left and her right eyelid bagged a bit she kissed joshuas hand slowly she said you can go hon he looked at me then back at her sure nod okay but im coming back in half an hour i already let mrs limberton go to lunch and i dont want you alone for too long its okay she doesnt eat long ill make sure she stays all afternoon until i get here probably not before seventhirty i have paperwork is that okay or do you want to eat earlier seventhirty is fine honey chinese she nodded and smiled let go of his hand i can also get thai if you want he said that place on fiftysixth anything she said as long as its with you she reached up with both hands and he bent for a hug after he straightened she said bye sweets bye take care of yourself one final look at me and then he was gone she pushed a button and propped herself up higher took a breath and said im blessed working with kids my own turned out great im sure it wasnt an accident she shrugged the higher shoulder made it all the way through the gesture i dont know so much is chance she pointed to the cane chair i pulled it up close and sat down youre a child therapist too i nodded she took a long time to touch her lip another while to tap her brow i think ive seen your name on articles anxiety years ago nice to meet you her voice faded i leaned closer stroke she said and tried to shrug again i said josh told me she looked surprised then amused he hasnt told many people protecting me sweet all my kids are but josh lives at home we see more of each other where are the others sarahs in boston teaches pediatrics at tufts davids a biologist at the national cancer institute in washington three for three i said she smiled and looked at the fish tank batting a thousand harvey liked baseball you only met him once yes i told her where and when harvey she said savoring the word was the nicest man ive ever known my mother used to say dont marry for looks or money both can disappear fast so marry for nice good advice are you married not yet do you have someone yes and shes very nice good she began laughing very little sound came out but her face was animated managing to raise one hand she touched her chest forget the phd im just a jewish mother maybe the two arent all that different no they are therapists dont judge right or at least we pretend we dont mothers are always judging she tried to lift an envelope from the mail stack got hold of a corner and fumbled tell me she said letting go about my husband i began including the other murders but leaving out the savagery when i reached the part about bad love and my revenge theory her eyes started blinking rapidly and i was afraid id caused some sort of stress reaction but when i paused she said go on and as i did she seemed to sit up straighter and taller and a cool analytic light sharpened her eyes the therapist in her driving out the patient id been there now i was on the couch opening myself up to this tiny crippled woman when i was finished she looked at the dresser and said open that middle drawer and take out the file i found a blackandwhite marbled box with a snap latch resting atop neatly folded sweaters as i started to hand it to her she said open it i sat down beside her and unlatched the box inside were documents a thick sheaf of them on top was harvey rosenblatts medical license go on she said i began leafing psychiatric board certification internship and residency papers a certificate from the robert evanston hale psychoanalytic institute in manhattan another from southwick hospital a sixyearold letter from the dean of the nyu medical school reaffirming rosenblatts appointment as associate clinical professor of psychiatry an honorable discharge from the navy where hed served as a flight surgeon aboard an aircraft carrier a couple of life insurance policies one issued by the american psychiatric association so he had been a member the absence of an obituary was probably due to shame about suicide as i came to his last will and testament shirley rosenblatt looked away death certificate burial forms i heard her say should be next next was a stapled collection of photocopied sheets the face sheet was white handwritten on it was investig info i removed it from the box she sank back against the pillows and i saw that she was breathing hard when i began to read she closed her eyes page two was a police report the writer was one detective salvatore j giordano th precinct borough of manhattan city of new york in his opinion and supported by subsequently entered medical examiners report case deceased victim rosenblatt h a white male age expired as the consequence of a rapid downward descent from diagrammed window b master bedroom of said address on e st and subsequent extreme bodily contact with pavement in front of said address descent process was most probably selfinduced as d victims blood alcohol was not elevated and there is no lab evidence of druginduced accident and no signs of coerced egress enforced on deceased victim on the part of another as well as no skidmarks on the carpeting of said address or defense marks on window sills and in summary no evidence of the presence of any other individual at said address of further note is the presence of drinking glass a see diagram and apparatus b see diagram conforming to method operandus of the east side burglar an aerial diagram at the bottom of the page illustrated the locations of doors windows and furniture in the room where harvey rosenblatt had spent his last moments a bed two nightstands two dressers one marked low the other high a television set something marked antique and a magazine rack on one of the nightstands were written glass a and apparatus b lockpicks files and keys arrows marked the window from which the psychiatrist had leaped the next paragraph identified the apartment as an eighthfloor fiveroom unit in a coop building at the time of rosenblatts jump the owners and sole occupants mr and mrs malcolm j rulerad he a banker she an attorney were away in europe on a threeweek vacation neither had ever met deceased victim rosenblatt and both witnesses state unequivocally that they have no idea how dv gained ingress to said domicile however the burglary apparatus recovered from a bathroom of said domicile indicates breaking and entering and the fact that the day doorman mr william p odonnell states he never saw d victim enter the buildings main lobby indicates a stealthy ingress by d victim furthermore drinking glass a subsequently identified by mrs rulerad as coming from her kitchen was full of a dark liquid subsequently identified as diet pepsicola a drink favored by mrs m rulerad and this is in conformity with the method operandus of three prior b and e burglaries within a sixblock radius previously attributed to the east side burglar in which soft drinks were displayed in a partially drunk status though d victims wife denies a criminal history on the part of d victim who she says was a psychiatrist physical evidence indicates a secret life on the part of d victim and a possible motive guilt over said secret life due to d victim being a psychiatrist and outward solid citizen and finally coming to grips with this unrespectable secret next came a half page followup by detective giordano dated a week later case rosenblatt h requested permission from d victims wife to search home premises on e st due to search for evidence related to d victims death said search effected at pm to pm in company of det b wildebrandt and officer j mcgovern home and office premises of d victim searched in presence of d victims wife shirley rosenblatt no contraband from previous east side burglaries found permission requested to read d victims psychiatric files for possible patientfence connection refused by s rosenblatt will consult with chief of dets a m talisiani the following page was typed on a different machine and signed by detective lewis s jackson th precinct the date was four weeks later conf on det giordanos case h a rosenblatt det giordano on med leave d victims wife shirley rosenblatt and son joshua rosenblatt requested meeting to review case wanting progress report met with them at pcnct told of disposition very angry said they were deceived as to purpose of home search son stated he is an attorney knows people he and mother convinced hom not sui stated dv not depressed never depressed not criminal further stated there was some sort of setup further stated dv had talked to wife prior to death about upsetting case that could be related to what happened to my dad but when asked for details said he didnt know because dv was psychiatrist and kept secrets because of ethics when told nothing more could be done based on available evidence son became even more irate and threatened to go above you to get some action conversation reported to chief of dets a m talisiani the final two pages consisted of a letter on heavy white bond dated one and a half months later comsac investigative services fifth avenue suite new york ny june dr shirley rosenblatt co j rosenblatt esq schechter mohl and trimmer fifth avenue suite new york ny dear dr rosenblatt pursuant to your request we have reviewed data and materials relevant to the unfortunate death of your husband including but not limited to detailed inspection of all case reports forensic

investigator and supervisor invoice for services rendered twentytwo hours at sixtyfive dollars per hour minus professional discount to schechter mohl and trimmer attys please remit this sum i put down the file shirley rosenblatts eyes were wide open and moist the second death she said like killing him again shake of head four years but its still thats why josh is so angry no resolution now you come im no she managed to place a finger over her mouth dropped it and smiled good the truth outs wider smile a different meaning behind it harvey as a burglar she said its almost funny and im not in prolonged denial i lived with him for thirtyone years sounding resolute but she looked to me for confirmation anyway i nodded she shook her head so how did he get in that apartment right thats what they kept asking me and i didnt know what to tell them he was lured there i said probably under the guise of a patient call someone he thought he could help harvey she said softly she closed her eyes opened them the police kept saying suicide over and over because harvey was a psychiatrist one of them the chief of detectives talisiani told me everyone knew psychiatrists had a high suicide rate then he told me to consider myself lucky that they werent pursuing it further that if they did everything would come out in view of the specific details of this case i said thats the private one right comsac at least the police were a lot more direct talisiani told me if we made waves harveys name would be dragged through the slime the whole family would be permanently coated with slime he seemed offended that we didnt want him to close the case as if we were criminals everyone made us feel that way and now youre coming and telling me we were right she managed to press her palms together thank you she slumped back on the pillow and breathed hard through dry lips tears filled her eyes overflowed and began draining down her cheeks i wiped them with a tissue her lower body still hadnt moved im so sad she whispered thinking about it again picturing it but im glad youve come youve validated me us im only sorry you have to go through this pain you really think its something to do with andres i do harvey never said anything i said the upsetting case josh told detective jackson about a few weeks before two deep breaths we were lunching harvey and i we had lunch almost every day he was upset he was rarely upset such an even man he said it was a case a patient hed just talked to hed found it very disillusioning she turned toward me and her face was quaking disillusioned about andres i said he didnt mention andress name didnt give me any details nothing at all harvey and i never talked about cases we made that rule right at the beginning of our marriage two therapists its so easy to slip you tell yourself its okay its professional consultation and then you let loose more details than you need to and then names slip out and then youre talking about patients to your therapist friends at cocktail parties she shook her head rules are best but harvey must have told you something to make you suspect a connection to his death no she said sadly we really didnt suspect we were just grasping looking for anything out of the ordinary so the police would see harvey didnt the whole thing was so psychotic harvey in a strangers apartment remembered shame colored her face i said the owners of the apartment the rulerads harvey didnt know them they were mean people cold i called the wife and begged her to let the private detective in to look i even apologized for what i dont know she told me i was lucky she wasnt suing me for harveys breakin and hung up she closed her eyes for a long time and didnt move i wondered if shed fallen asleep then she said harvey was so affected by this patient thats what made me suspect cases never got to him to be disillusioned andres it doesnt make sense de bosch was his teacher wasnt he if harvey learned something terrible about him that could have disillusioned him slow sad nod i said how close was their relationship teacher and student close harvey admired andres though he thought he was a little authoritarian authoritarian in what way dogmatic when he was convinced he was right harvey thought it ironic since andres had fought so hard against the nazis wrote so passionately for democracy yet his personal style could be so dictatorial at times but harvey still admired him for who he was what hed done saving those french children from the vichy government his work on child development and he was a good teacher once in a while i sat in on seminars andres holding court like a don he could talk for hours and keep you interested lots of jokes tying everything in with punchlines sometimes he brought children in from the wards he had a gift they opened up to him what about katarina i said harvey told me she sat in too she did just a child herself a teenager but she spoke up as if she was a peer and now shes and those other people how can this be sometimes authoritarianism can go too far i said her cheeks shook then her mouth turned up in a tiny disturbing smile yes i suppose nothings what it seems is it patients have been telling me that for thirty years and ive been nodding and saying yes i know i really didnt know did you ever go back into harveys files to try to figure which patient had upset him long stare guilty nod he kept tapes she said he didnt like writing arthritis so he taped i wouldnt let the police listen to them protecting the patients but later i began playing them for myself i gave myself an excuse for their own good i was responsible for them until they found another permanent therapist had to call them to notify them so i needed to know them downcast eyes flimsy i listened anyway months of sessions harveys voice sometimes i couldnt stand it but there was nothing that would have disillusioned him all his patients were like old friends he hadnt taken on any new ones for two years none at all she shook her head harvey was an oldfashioned analyst the couch free association longterm intensive work the same fifteen people three to five times a week even an old patient might have told him something disillusioning no she said there was nothing like that in any of the sessions and none of his old patients brought him to harm they all loved him what did you do with the tapes rather than answer she said he was gentle accepting he helped those people they were all crushed did you pick any of them up as patients no i was in no shape to work not for a long time even my own patients she attempted another shrug things fell apart for a while so many people let down thats why i didnt pursue his death for my kids and for his patients his extended family for me i couldnt have us dragged through the slime do you understand of course i asked her again what shed done with the tapes i destroyed them she said as if hearing the question for the first time smashed the cassettes with a hammer one by one what a mess threw it all away she smiled catharsis i said did harvey attend any conventions just before his death any psychiatric meetings or seminars on child welfare no why because professional meetings may set the killer off two of the other therapists were murdered at conventions and the de bosch symposium where i met harvey may have triggered the killings in the first place no she said no he didnt attend anything hed sworn off conventions sworn off academia gave up his appointment at nyu so he could concentrate on his patients and his family and getting in shape his father had died young of a heart attack harvey had reached that age confronted his own mortality he was starting to work out trimming the fat from his diet and his life thats a quote he said he wanted to be around for me and the kids for a long long time grimacing she lifted her hand with effort and let it drop upon mine her palm was soft and cold her eyes aimed at the fish tank and stayed there is there anything else you can tell me i said anything at all she thought for a long time no im sorry i wish there was thanks for seeing me i said her hand weighed a ton please let me know she said keeping it there whatever you find i will how long will you be in new york i think ill try to head back this evening if you need a place to stay youre welcome here if you dont mind a pullout couch thats very kind i said but i need to be getting back your nice woman and my home whatever that meant grimacing she exerted barely tangible pressure upon my hand giving me comfort we heard the door close then footsteps josh came in holding leo the cat he looked at our hands and his eyebrows dipped you okay he said to his mother yes honey dr delawares been helpful its good you brought him helpful how he validated us about dad great said josh putting the cat down meanwhile youre not getting enough rest her lower lip dropped enough exertion mom he said please you have to rest im okay honey really i felt a small tug atop my hand not much more than a muscle twitch lifting her hand and placing it on the bedcovers i stood josh walked around the other side of the bed and began straightening the covers you really need to rest mom the doctor said rest is the most important thing i know im sorry i will josh good she made a gulping sound tears clouded the gentle blue eyes oh mom he cried out sounding ten years old its okay honey no no im being an asshole im sorry its been a really tough day tell me about it baby believe me you dont want to hear it yes i do tell me he sat down next to her i slipped out the door and saw myself out of the apartment i reserved a seat on the next flight back to la threw clothes in my bag and told milo and ricks message machine my arrival time checking out of the middleton i flagged a taxi to kennedy a fire on queens boulevard slowed things down and it took an hour and three quarters to reach the airport when i got to the checkin counter i learned my flight had been delayed for thirtyfive minutes pay tvs were attached to some of the seats and travelers stared at their screens as if some kind of truth was being broadcast i found a terminal lounge that looked half decent and downed a leathery corned beef sandwich and a club soda while eavesdropping on a group of salesmen their truths were simple the economy sucked and women didnt know what the hell they wanted i returned to the departure area found a free tv and fed it quarters a local station was broadcasting the news and that seemed about as good as it was going to get potholes in the bronx condom handouts in the public schools the mayor fighting with the city council as the city accrued crushing debt that made me feel right at home a few more local stories and then the anchorwoman said nationally government statistics show a decline in consumer spending and a senate subcommittee is investigating charges of influence peddling by another of the presidents sons and in california officials at folsom prison report that a lockdown has apparently been successful in averting riots in the wake of what is believed to have been a racially motivated double murder at that maximumsecurity facility early this morning two inmates both believed to have been associates of a white supremacist gang were stabbed to death by unknown inmates suspected of belonging to the nuestra raza a mexican gang the dead men identified as rennard russell haupt and donald dell wallace were both serving sentences for murder a prison investigation into the killings continues nuestra raza nr forever the tattoos on roddy rodriguezs hands i thought of rodriguezs masonry yard shut down cleaned out and padlocked the flight from the house on mcvine prepared well in advance evelyn had entertained me in her backyard as her husbands homeboys honed their shanks making an appointment for wednesday then going into the house with her husband and changing it to thursday twentyfour more hours for getaway hurley kefflers debacle at my house made sense now as did sherman bucklears nagging prison rumblings had probably told the iron priests what was brewing locating rodriguez might have forestalled the hit or if the deed had already been done given the priests instant payback payback the same old stupid cycle of violence burglary tools and a quick shove out a eightstory window a corpse on a garage floor a little boy baby never to be two little girls on the run were chondra and tiffani in some mexican border town being tutored in fugitive a with more care than theyd ever been taught to read or write or maybe evelyn had taken them somewhere they could blend in on the surface but suckled on violence theyd always be different unable to understand why years later they gravitated toward cruel violent men static dripped out of the speakers a barely comprehensible voice announcing something about boarding i got up and took my place in line six thousand miles in less than twentyfour hours my mind and my legs ached i wondered if shirley rosenblatt would ever be able to walk again soon id be three time zones away from her problems and a lot closer to my own the flight got in just before midnight the terminal was deserted and robin was waiting outside the automatic doors you look exhausted she said as we walked to her truck ive felt perkier well ive got some news that might perk you up milo called just before i left to pick you up something about the tape i was just out the door and he was running too but he says he learned something important the sheriff who was working on it must have picked up something wheres milo now out on some assignment he said hed be home when we got there which home the question threw her oh milos house he and rick took really good care of us and home is where the heart is right i slept in the car we pulled up at milos house at twelveforty he was waiting in the living room wearing a gray polo shirt and jeans a cup of coffee was in front of him next to a portable tape recorder the dog snored at his feet but woke up when we came in gave out a few desultory licks then collapsed again welcome home boys and girls i put my bags down did you hear about donald dell milo nodded what said robin i told her she said oh milo said nuestra raza could be the fatherinlaw thats what i figured its probably why evelyn postponed her appointment with me rodriguez told her they had to leave wednesday and why hurley keffler hassled me where is he still in i found a few traffic warrants and had one of the jailers lose his paperwork just another few days but every little bit helps robin said it never ends its all right i said theres no reason for the priests to bother us true said milo too quickly they and the raza boys will be concentrating on each other now thats their main game my turn to die your turn to die lovely said robin i had some foothill guys drop in on them after kefflers bust he said but ill see if i can arrange another visit dont worry about them rob really theyre the least of our problems as opposed to he looked at the tape recorder we sat down he punched a button the childs voice came on bad love bad love dont give me the bad love i looked at him he held up a finger bad love bad love dont give me the bad love same flat tones but this time the voice was that of a man ordinary middlepitched male voice nothing remarkable about the accent or the timbre the childs voice transformed some kind of electronic manipulation something familiar about the voice but i couldnt place it someone id met a long time ago in the room was silent except for the dogs breathing milo turned the recorder off and looked at me ring any bells i said theres something about it but i dont know what it is the kids voice was phony what you just heard might be the real bad guy no bells huh let me hear it again rewind play again i said this time i listened with my eyes closed squinting so hard the lids felt welded together listening to someone who hated me nothing registered robin and milo studied my face as if it were some great wonder my head hurt badly no i said i still cant pinpoint it i cant even be sure ive actually heard it robin touched my shoulder milos face was blank but his eyes showed disappointment i glanced at the recorder and nodded he rewound again this time the voice seemed even more distant as if my memory was spiraling away from me as if id missed my chance goddammit i said the dogs eyes opened he trotted over to me and nuzzled my hand i rubbed his head looked at milo one more time robin said youre tired why dont we try again in the morning just once more i said rewind play the voice completely foreign now mocking me i buried my face in my hands robins hands on my neck were an abstract comfort i appreciated the sentiment but couldnt relax what did you mean might be the bad guy i asked milo sheriffs scientific guess he tuned it down from the kids voice using a preset frequency how can he be sure the kids voice was altered in the first place because his machines told him so he came across it by accident working on the screams which incidentally hes ninetynine percent positive are hewitts then he got to the kid chanting and something bothered him about it the evenness of the voice the robot quality i said yeah but he didnt assume brainwashing or anything else psychological hes a technodude so he analyzed the sound waves and saw something fishy with the cycletocycle amplitude the changes in pitch within each sound wave real human voices shimmer and jitter this didnt so he knew the tape had been messed with electronically probably using a pitch shifter its a gizmo that samples a sound and changes the frequency tune up youve got alvin and the chipmunks tune down youre james earl jones hitech bad guy i said not really the basic machines are pretty cheap people attach them to phones women living alone wanting to sound like joe testosterone theyre also used for recording music creating automatic harmonies a singer lays down a vocal track then creates a harmony and overdubs it instant everly brothers sure said robin shifters are used all the time ive seen them interfaced with amps so guitarists can do multiple tracks lyle gritz i said the next elvis howd the sheriff know which frequency to tune down to he assumed we were dealing with a male bad guy using a relatively cheap shifter because nowadays the better machines can be programmed to include jitter the cheap ones usually come with two maybe three standard settings tune up to kid tune down to adult sometimes theres an intermediate setting for adult female by computing the pitch difference he worked backwards and tuned down but if our guys some sort of acoustics nut with fancy equipment there may be other things hes done to alter his voice and what you heard may be nowhere near his real voice it may not even be his voice that he altered he could have shifted someone elses that too but you think you might have heard him before that was my first impression but i dont know i dont trust my judgment anymore well he said at least we know theres no actual kid involved thank god for that okay leave the tape with me ill work with it tomorrow see if anything clicks the screams being hewitt what does ninetynine percent mean it means the sheriffll get up on the stand and testify its highly probable to the best of his professional knowledge only trouble is we need to get someone on trial first so i was right this isnt some homeless guy hed need a place to keep his equipment he shrugged maybe hes got a secret den somewhere and thats where hes hiding out right now i had talks about gritz with detectives at other substations if the scrotes still lurking around well hook him he is i said he hasnt completed his homework i told milo what id learned in new york he said pseudoburglary sounds hokey new york cops didnt think so it matched some previous breakins in the neighborhood jimmied locks people on vacation a glass of soda left on the bedroom nightstand soda from the victims kitchen sound familiar were any of the other burglaries in the papers i dont know if they were all weve probably got is a copycat if they werent maybe our killer has a burglary sideline why dont you get a hold of some fouryearold papers and find out ill phone new york and see if gritzs name or silkmerinos shows up on their blotters around the time of rosenblatts fall hes been pretty careful about keeping his nose clean so far it doesnt have to be a major felony alex son of sam got busted on a parking ticket lots of cases get solved that way the stupid stuff okay i said ill hit the library soon as it opens he picked up his cup and drank so whats rosenblatts motive for jumping supposed to have been guilt coming to grips with his secret criminal identity he scowled what hes standing there about to glom jewelry and he suddenly gets a guilt flash sounds like horseshit to me the family thought so too but the new york police seemed convinced they told the widow if she pressed the issue everyones name would be dragged through the slime a private investigator she hired told her the same thing more tactfully i gave him names and he jotted them down looking into his coffee he said you want theres still some in the pot no thanks robin said another fall just like the other two delmar parkers run off the mountain i said that has to be the connection the killer was traumatized in a major way and is trying to get even weve got to find out more about the accident milo said i still havent had any luck locating delmars mother and none of the santa barbara papers covered the crash out of all those corrective school alumni i said someones got to know still no files anywhere sally and the gang pried up katarinas floorboards and we cant find any records yet of de bosch applying for government funds over the rim of his cup his face was heavy and beat he ran his hand over it it bothers me he said rosenblatt an experienced psychiatrist meeting someone in a strange apartment like that he was experienced but he had a soft heart the killer could have lured him there with a cry for help thats not exactly standard operating shrink procedure is it was rosenblatt some kind of avantgarde guy believed in onthescene treatment his wife said he was an orthodox analyst those guys never leave the office right need their couches and their little notebooks true but she also said hed been very upset by something that had happened in a session recently disillusioned its a reasonable bet it had something to do with de bosch something that shook him up enough to meet the killer out of the office he could have believed he was going to the killers home the killer could have given him a good rationale for meeting there like a disability that kept him homebound maybe even bedridden the window rosenblatt went out of was in a bedroom phony cripple he said nodding then rosenblatt goes to the window and the bad guy jumps up shoves him out very cold and the wife had no idea what disillusioned him enough to make a house call she tried to find out broke her own rules and listened to his therapy tapes but there was nothing out of the ordinary in them this disillusioning thing definitely happened during a session thats what he told her so maybe the session where he died wasnt the first with the killer so why wasnt the first session on tape maybe rosenblatt didnt take his recorder with him or the patient requested no taping rosenblatt would have complied or maybe the session was recorded and the tape got destroyed a strangers bedroom that has almost a sexual flavor to it dont you think i nodded the ritual who owned the place a couple named rulerad they said theyd never heard of harvey rosenblatt shirley said they were pretty hostile to her refused access to the private detective and threatened to sue her cant really blame them can you come home and find out someone broke into your place and used it for a swan dive was rosenblatt the type to be a soft touch for a sob story definitely he probably got the same kind of call bert harrison did and responded to it and died because of it milo said so why did the killer keep his appointment with rosenblatt but not with harrison why now that im thinking about it was harrison let off the hook completely he worked for de bosch he spoke at that goddamn conference too so how come everyone else in that boat is sunk or sinking and hes on shore drinking piña coladas i dont know i mean thats funny dont you think alex that break in the pattern maybe i should learn a little more about harrison maybe i said feeling sick wouldnt that be something there i was sitting across the table from him trying to protect him he treated mitch lerner he knew where katarina lived hard to believe he seemed like such a sweet guy any idea where hes gone i shook my head but hes not exactly unobtrusive with those purple clothes purple clothes said robin he says its the only color he can see another weird one said milo what is it about your profession ask the killer i said hes got strong opinions on the subject we spent the night at milos after he left for work i stayed and listened to the tape another dozen times the chanting man sounded like an accountant tallying up a sum that maddening hint of familiarity but nothing jelled we returned to benedict canyon where robin took the dog to the garage and i called in for messages one from jean jeffers no record of mr gand a request to phone judge stephen huff i reached him in his chambers hi alex i assume you heard is there anything i should know other than whats been on the news theyre pretty positive who did it but cant prove it yet two mexican gang members theyre figuring some kind of drug war thats probably it i said well thats one way to settle a case any word from the grandmother not a one better off the kids i mean away from all of this dont you think depends on what environment theyve been placed into oh sure absolutely well thanks for your help onward toward justice several more tries at the tape then i left for the beverly hills library i scoured four and fiveyearold editions of new york dailies all morning reading very slowly and carefully but finding no record of any east side burglar no great surprise the th precinct serviced a highpriced zip code and its inhabitants probably despised getting their names anywhere in the paper other than the society pages the people who owned the papers and broadcast the news probably lived in the th the rest of the city would know exactly what they wanted it to lack of coverage still didnt mean rosenblatts killer had committed the earlier breakins local residents might be aware of the burglaries and a local could know who was on vacation and for how long but the idea of a th precinct resident owning burglary tools and robbing from his neighbors seemed less than likely so mr silk probably had burgled before ritualistically the same attempt to use what was at hand to master and dominate the victim bad love myra evans paprock rodney shipler katarina only at those three scenes had the words been left behind three bloody undisguised murders no attempt made to present them as anything else stoumen lerner and rosenblatt on the other hand had been dispatched as phony accidents two classes of victims two kinds of revenge butchery for the laypeople falls for the therapists but katarina had been a therapist then i realized that at the time of mr silks trauma sometime before seventynine probably closer to seventythree the year delmar parker had gone off the mountain she hadnt yet graduated in her early twenties still a grad student two patterns part of some elaborate ragelust fantasy that a sane mind could never hope to understand and where did becky basille fit in two killers i remembered the clean bustling street where harvey rosenblatt had landed french restaurants flower boxes and limos how long had it taken the poor man to realize what the swift sharp shove at the small of his back meant i hoped he hadnt hoped against logic that hed felt nothing but the icaruspleasure of pure flight a fall always a fall delmar parker had to be avenging an abused child surely if de bosch had been abusive someone would remember why hadnt anyone spoken out after all these years but no big puzzle there without proof who would believe them and why rake up the dirt around a dead mans grave if it meant stirring up ones own childhood demons still someone had to know what happened to the boy in the stolen truck and why it had set off a killer i sat there for a long time staring at tiny microfilmed words corrective school alumni how to get hold of them then i thought of one someone id never met a name id never even learned a problem child whose treatment had given katarina the leash to put around my neck i returned the microfilm spools and rushed to the pay phones in the librarys lobby trying to figure out who to call western pediatric the late seventies the hospital had undergone a massive financial and professional overhaul during the past year so many people gone but one notable one had returned reuben eagle had been chief resident when id started as a staff psychologist hed taken a professorship at the us med school a gifted teacher specializing in medical education the new western peds board had just wooed him back as general pediatrics division head id just seen his picture in the hospital newsletter the same tortoiseshell spectacles the light brown hair thinner grayer the lean ruddy outdoorsmans face adorned by a trimmed graying beard his secretary said he was out on the wards and i asked her to page him he answered a few moments later saying rube eagle in a soft pleasant voice rube its alex delaware alex wow this is a surprise howre things going not bad how about you hanging in listen rube i need a small favor im trying to locate one of henry borks daughters and i was wondering if you had any idea how to reach her which daughter henry and mo had a bunch three or four i think the youngest she had learning problems was sent to a remedial school in santa barbara around seventysix or seventyseven shed be around twentyeight or twentynine now that would have to be meredith he said her i remember because one year henry had the interns party at his house and she was there very goodlooking a real flirt i thought she was older and ended up talking to her then someone warned me and i split fast warned you about her age that and her problems supposedly a wild kid i remember hearing something about institutionalization apparently she really put henry and mo through it did you know he died yes i said ben wardley too and milt chenier how come youre looking for meredith long story rube it has to do with the school she was sent to what about it things may have happened there happened another mess he sounded more sad than surprised its possible anything i should know about not unless you had something to do with the school the corrective school founded by a psychologist named andres de bosch nope he said well i hope you clear it up and as far as merediths concerned i think she still lives in la something to do with the film business is her name still bork hmm dont know if youd like i can call mo and find out shes still pretty involved with the hospital i can tell her im putting a mailing list together or something id really appreciate that rube stay on the line ill see if i can get her i waited for fifteen minutes with the speaker to my mouth pretending to look busy each time someone came by to use the phone finally rube came back on the line alex still here yes merediths in la she has her own public relations firm i dont know if she ever married but she still goes by bork he gave me the address and phone number and i thanked him again sure bet another mess too bad howd you get involved alex through a patient no i said someone sent me a message bork and hoffman public relations wilshire boulevard suite the eastern edge of beverly hills a fiveminute ride from the library the receptionist said ms bork is on another line ill hold and what was the name again dr alex delaware i worked with her father at western pediatric

wilshire near crescent heights tacky little strip mall on the southeast corner great coffee people pretending to be artistes ill be in a booth near the back if youre late i wont wait around the restaurant was a narrow storefront blocked by blue gingham curtains pine tables and booths half of them empty sacks of coffee stood on the floor near the entrance listing like melting snowmen a few desperatelooking types sat far from one another poring over screenplays meredith bork was in the last booth her back to the wall a mug in her left hand a big beautiful darkhaired woman sitting high and straight the moment i walked in her eyes were on me and they didnt waver as i approached her hair was true black and shiny brushed straight back from her head and worn loose around her shoulders her face was olive tinted like robins just a bit rounder than oval with wide full lips a straight narrow nose and a perfect chin perfect cheekbones too below huge grayblue eyes silverblue nail polish to match her silk blouse two buttons undone freckled chest an inch of cleavage strong square shoulders lots of bracelets around surprisingly slender wrists lots of gold all over even in the weak light she sparkled she said great youre cute i allow you to sit she put the mug down next to a plate bearing an oversized muffin fiber she said the religion of the nineties a waitress came over and informed me the coffee of the day was ethiopian i said that was fine and received my own mug ethiopian said meredith bork theyre starving over there arent they but theyre exporting designer beans dont you think thats weird someone always does okay i said no matter how bad things get how true how true she smiled i like this guy perfect mixture of sincerity and cynicism lots of women love it right you probably use it to get laid then get bored and leave them weeping right i laughed involuntarily no no you dont get laid or no you dont get bored no im not into conning women gay no whats your problem then are we discussing that why not giant smile capped teeth you want to discuss my problems jocko fair is fair i raised my cup to my lips hows the java she said those starving ethiopians know how to grow em very good im so veddy glad mines colombian my regular fix i keep hoping therell be a packaging error and ill get a little snort mixed in with the grind she rubbed her nose and winked leaned forward and showed more chest a black lace bra cut into soft freckled flesh she wore a perfume id never smelled before lots of grass lots of flowers a bit of her own perspiration she giggled no im just joshing you mr sorry doctor no con i know how touchy you healer types are about that daddy always had a bovine when someone called him mister alex is fine alex the great are you great wanna fuck and suck before my mouth could close she said but seriously folks her smile was still on high beam and her breasts were still pushing forward but shed reddened and the muscles beneath one of the lovely cheekbones were twitching she said what a tasteless thing to say right stupid too in the virus era so lets forget about stripping off my clothes and concentrate on stripping my psyche right meredith thats the name dont wear it out her hand brushed against the mug and a few droplets of coffee spilled on the table shit she said grabbing a napkin and blotting now youve really got me spazzing we dont need to talk about you personally i said just about the school not talk about me thats my favorite topic alex the sincere shrink ive spent godknowshowmuch money talking to your ilk about me they all pretended to be utterly fascinated least you can do is fake it too i sat back and smiled i dont like you she said way too agreeable can you get a hardon on demand no scratch that no more dirty talk this is going to be a platonic asexual antiseptic discussion the corrective school how i spent my summer vacation by meredith spillthecoffee bork were you there for only one summer it was enough believe me the waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything else no dear were in love we dont need anything else said meredith waving her away a wine list was propped between the salt and pepper shakers she pulled it out and studied it moving her lips tiny droplets had formed over them her smooth brown brow puckered she put the list down and wiped the sweat from her mouth caught me she said dyslexic not illiterate i probably know more about whats going on than your average asshole senator but it takes effort little tricks so the words make sense another huge smile thats why i like to work with hollywood assholes none of them read is the dyslexia why you went to the corrective school i didnt go alex i was sent and no that wasnt the official reason the official reason was i was acting out one of you guys quaint little terms for being a naughty girl do you want to know how if youd like to tell me of course i would im an exhibitionist no scratch that whats it your business she moistened her lips and smiled suffice it to say i learned about cocks when i was much too young to appreciate them she held out her mug to me as if it were a microphone and why was that contestant number one why for the washerdryer and the trip to hawaii did a sweet young thing from sierra madre besmirch herself i didnt speak buzz she said sorry number one thats not quick enough the correct answer is poor selfesteem twentiethcentury root of all evil right i was fourteen and could barely read so instead i learned to give dynamite blow jobs i looked down at my coffee oh look ive embarrassed him dont worry im okay damn proud of my blow jobs you work with what youve got her grin was huge but hard to gauge one fateful morning mommy discovered strange yucky stains on my junior high prom dress mommy consulted with learned doctor daddy and the two of them threw a joint shitfit the day school ended i was shipped off to the wild and woolly hills of santa barbara little brown uniforms ugly shoes girls bunks separated from the boys bunks by a scuzzy vegetable garden dr botch stroking his little goatee and telling us this could turn out to be the best summer we ever had she hid her mouth behind her mug broke off a piece of muffin and let it crumble between her fingers i couldnt read so they sent me to buchenwaldonthepacific theres juvenile justice for you did de bosch ever diagnose your dyslexia i said you kidding all he did was throw this freudian shit at me i was frustrated because mommy had daddy and i wanted him so i was trying to be a woman rather than a girl acting outin order to displace her she laughed believe me i knew what i wanted and it wasnt daddy it was lean young wellhung bodies and james dean faces and i had the power to get it all back then i believed in myself until botch botched me up all at once her face changed loosening and paling she put the mug down hard shook her hair like a wet puppy and rubbed her temples what did he do to you i said tore my soul out she said glibly but as she spoke she brought strands of hair forward and hid her face long silence shit she said finally this is harder than i thought it would be how did he mess me up subtly nothing he could go to jail for darling so tell your police pals to go back to giving parking tickets youll never pin him besides he must be ancient by now whos going to drag a poor old fart into court hes dead the hair fell away her eyes were very still oh well thats okay by me pal was it long and painful by any chance he killed himself hed been sick for a while multiple strokes killed himself how pills when nineteeneighty the eyes tightened eighty so whats all this bs about an investigation her arm shot forward and she grabbed my wrist big strong woman fess up psychman who are you and whats all this really about a few heads turned she let go of my arm i pulled out id showed it to her and said ive told you the truth and what its about is revenge i summarized the bad love murders throwing out names of victims when i finished she was smiling well im sorry for those others but but what bad love she said turning his own crap against him i like that bad love was something he did oh yeah she said through clenched jaws bad love meant you were a worthless piece of shit who deserved to be mistreated bad love for bad little childrenlike psychological acupuncture these tiny little needles jabbing twisting her wrists rotated jewelry flashed but no scars no we didnt want to leave any marks on the beautiful little children what did he actually do he bounced us good love one day bad love the next publicly when we were all together in the lunch room at an assembly he was joe jolly when visitors came too joe jolly laughing telling jokes lots of jokes tousling our hair joining in our games he was old but athletic used to like to play tether ball when someone hurt their hand on the knob hed make a big show of cuddling them and kissing the booboo mister compassionate doctor compassionate telling us we were the most beautiful children in the world the school was the most beautiful school the teachers the most beautiful teachers the goddamn vegetable garden was beautiful even though the stuff we planted always came out stringy and we had to eat it anyway we were one big happy global family a real sixties kind of thing sometimes he even wore these puka shells around his neck over his pukey tie that was good love i said she nodded and gave a small ugly laugh one big family but if you got on his bad side if you acted out then he gave you a private session and all of a sudden you werent beautiful anymore all of a sudden the world turned real ugly she sniffed and used her napkin to wipe her nose thinking of her colombian coffee comment i wondered if shed fortified herself for our appointment she cut me off midthought dont worry its not nasal candy its plain old emotion and the emotion i feel for that bastard even with his being dead is pure hatred isnt that amazing after all these years im surprising myself with how much i hate him because he made me hate myselfit took years to get out from under his fucking bad love the private sessions i said real private he hit me where it counted i didnt need anyone tearing down my selfesteem i was already fucked up enough not able to read at thirteen everyone blaming me me blaming myself my sisters were all a students i got ds i was a premature baby difficult labor must have affected my brain the dyslexia my other prob she threw up her hands and fluttered her fingers so now its out she said smiling i have yet another problem want a shot at that diagnosis contestant number one i shook my head not a gambler oh well theres no reason i should be ashamed its all chemistry that was my point wasnt it bipolar affective disorder your basic garden variety manicdepressive maniac you tell people youre manic and they say oh yeah im feeling really manic too and you say no no no this is different this is real my little pretties are you on lithium nod unless the work piles up and i need the extra push i finally found a psychiatrist who knew what the hell he was doing all the others were ignorant assholes like dr botch analyzing me blaming me botch nearly convinced me i did want to fuck daddy he totally convinced me i was bad with bad love she stood suddenly and snatched up her purse she was six feet tall with a tiny waist narrow hips and long legs under a charcoalcolored silk miniskirt the skirt had ridden up revealing sleek thigh if she realized it she didnt choose to fix it hes worried im leaving she laughed mellow out son just going to pee she made an abrupt aboutface and sashayed toward the rear of the restaurant a few moments later i got up and verified that the restrooms were back there and the only exit a grimy gray door with a bar across it marked emergency she returned a few minutes later hair fluffed eyes puffy but freshly shadowed sitting down she nudged my shin with a toe and gave a weak smile waving for the waitress she got a refill and drank half the cup taking long silent swallows looking ready to choke my therapeutic impulse was to pat her hand i resisted it bad love she said softly little rooms little locked cells bare bulbs or sometimes hed just light a candle candles we made in crafts beautiful candles actually they were ugly pieces of shit with this really disgusting scent nothing in the cell but two chairs hed sit opposite you your knees almost touching nothing between you then hed stare at you for a long time a long time then hed start talking in this low relaxed voice like it was just a chat like it was just two people having a nice civil conversation and at first youd think you were getting away easy hed sound so pleasant smiling playing with that stupid little beard or his puka shells she said shit and drank coffee what did he talk about hed start off lecturing about human nature how everyone had good parts of their character and bad parts and the difference between the successful people and the unsuccessful people was which part you used and that we kids were there because we were using too much bad part and not enough good part because wed gotten warped somehow damaged was the way he put it from wanting to sleep with our mommies and our daddies but how everyone else at the school was now doing great everyone except you young lady is controlling their impulses and learning to use the good part they are going to be okay they deserve good love and are going to have happy lives she closed her eyes took a deep breath funneled her lips into a pinhole and blew air out through it then hed stop to let it all sink in and stare some more and get even closer his breath always stank of cabbage the room was so small the smell filled it he filled it he wasnt a big man but in there he was huge you felt like an ant about to be crushed like the room was running out of air and you were going to strangle the way he stared his eyes were like drills and the look when you got the bad love after the soft talk was through this hatred letting you know you were scum you hed say and then hed repeat it you you you and then it would start you were the only one who wasnt doing good you couldnt control your impulses you werent trying you were acting just like an animal a dirty filthy animal a vermin animal that was a favorite of his vermin animals in his creepy inspector clouseau accent vermeen aneemals then hed start calling you other names fool idiot weakling moron savage excrement no curse words just one insult after another sometimes in french saying them so quietly you could barely hear them but you had to hear them because there was nothing else to hear in that room just the wax dripping sometimes a plumbing pipe would rumble but mostly it was silent you had to listen a lost look came into her eyes she shifted as far from me as the booth would allow when she spoke again her voice was even softer but deeper almost masculine you are acting like vermin animal young lady you are going to live like vermin animal and you will end up dying like vermin animal and then hed go into these detailed descriptions of how vermin lived and died and how no one loved them and gave them good love because they didnt deserve it and how the only thing they deserved was bad love and filth and humiliation she reached for her mug her hand shook and she braced it with the other one before raising the coffee to her lips hed keep going like that dont ask me how long because i dont know it felt like years chanting over and over and over you will get the bad love you will get the bad love pain and suffering and loneliness that would never end prison where people will rape you and cut you and tie you up so you cant move horrible diseases you will get hed go into the symptoms talk about the loneliness how youd always be alone like a corpse left out in the desert to dry like a piece of dirt on some cold distant planet he was full of analogies dr b was playing loneliness like an instrument your life will be as empty and dark as this room we are sitting in young lady your entire future will be desolate no good love from anyone no good love just bad love filth and degradation because that is what bad children deserve a cold lonely world for children who act like vermin animals then hed show photos dead bodies concentration camp stuff this is how you will end up she shifted closer hed just chant it she said touching my cuff like some priest throwing out these images not giving you a chance to speak he made you feel you were the only bad person in a beautiful world a shit smear on silk and you believed him you believed everyone was changing for the better learning to control themselves everyone was on his side you were the only piece of shit cutting you off i said so you wouldnt confide in the other kids it worked i never confided in anyone later when i was out of there years later i realized it was stupid i couldnt have been the only one id seen other kids go into the rooms it seems so ridiculously logical now but back then i couldnt he kept focusing me in on myself on the bad parts of me the vermin animal parts you were isolated right from the beginning new environment new routine exactly she said squeezing my arm i was scared shitless my parents never told me where we were going just shoved me in the car and tossed in a suitcase the whole ride up there they wouldnt speak to me when we got there they drove through the gates dumped me in the office left me there and drove away later i found out thats what he instructed them to do have a happy summer meredith her eyes got wet id just repeated seventh grade finally faked enough to barely pass and was looking forward to a vacation i thought summer would be the beach and lake arrowhead we had a cabin always went there as a family they dumped me and went without me no apologies no explanation i thought id died and gone to hell sitting in that office all those brown uniforms no one talking to me then he came out smiling like a clown saying what a pretty girl you are telling me to come with him hed be taking care of me i thought what a jerk no problem putting it over on him the first time i stepped out of line he let it pass the second time he pulled me into a room and badloved me i walked out of there in a semicoma blitzed wasted its hard to explain but it was almost like dying like bad dope i felt i was on a rocky island in the middle of a storm this crazy black roaring sea with sharks all around no escape him working on my bad parts chewing me up what a nightmare i said the first week i hardly slept or ate lost ten pounds the worst part was that you believed him he had a way of taking over your head like he was sitting in your skull scraping away at your brain you really felt you were shit and belonged in hell none of the kids ever talked to each other maybe some did i didnt maybe i couldve i dont know i sure didnt feel i could everyone walking around smiling saying how great dr b was such a beautiful guy you found yourself saying it too mouthing along without thinking like one of those dumb camp songs there was this this feverish atmosphere to the place grinning idiots like a cult you felt if you spoke out against him someone would pour poison koolaid down your throat was physical punishment ever part of bad love once in a while usually a slap a pinch nothing that hurt too much it was mostly the humiliation the surprise when he wanted to hurt you hed poke you in the elbow or the shoulder flick his finger on the bone he knew all the spots nothing that would leave a scar not that anyone would have believed us anyway who were we truants fuckups rejects even now would i be credible four abortions valium librium thorazine elavil lithium all the other things ive done wouldnt some lawyer dig that up and put me on trial wouldnt i be a piece of shit all over again probably her smile was rich with disgust im jazzed that hes dead doubly jazzed he did it to himself his turn for humiliation she looked up at the ceiling what is it i said killing himself do you think he could have felt some guilt with what youve told me its hard to imagine yeah youre probably right yeah he slapped me plenty of times but the pain was welcome cause when he was getting physical he wasnt talking his voice his words he could reach into your center and squeeze the life out of you did you know he used to write columns in magazines humane child rearing people sent in problems and hed offer fucking solutions i sighed yes she said my sad sad story such pathos looking around the restaurant she cupped one ear any daytimeserial people listening got a bitchin script for you you never told anyone not until you dear smile arent you flattered all those shrinks and youre the very first why youve deflowered me busted my psychological cherry interesting way to put it but fitting right therapys just like fucking you open yourself up to a stranger and hope for the best i said you said you saw other kids going into the rooms were they taken by other people or just de bosch mostly by him sometimes by that creepy daughter of his i always got personal attention from the big cheese daddys social position and all that katarina was involved in treatment when exactly were you there seventysix she was only twentythree still a student shrug everyone treated her as if she was a shrink what she was was a real bitch walking around with this smug look on her face daddy was the king and she was the princess now theres one dutiful daughter who really did want to fuck papa did you have any direct dealings with her other than a sneer in the hall no what about other staffers did you see any of them doing private sessions no none of those names i mentioned rang a bell she gave a pained look it all blurs ive been through changes my whole life until a few years ago is a blur can i go over those names again sure why not she picked up her cup and drank grant stoumen headshake mitchell lerner maybe that ones a little familiar but i have no face to go with it i gave her some time to think she said nope harvey rosenblatt uhuh wilbert harrison no hes a little man who wears purple all the time does he ride a pink elephant grin myra evans eyeblink frown i repeated the name you used another name before she said myra something hyphenated evanspaprock paprock was her married name evans another smile not at all happy myra evans myra the bitch she was a teacher right a little blond with a tight butt and an attitude am i right i nodded yeah she said myra the bitch she was assigned to tread where others had failed like teaching moi how to read she kept drilling me harassing me forcing me to do stupid exercises that didnt do a fucking bit of good because the words stayed all scrambled when i got something wrong shed clap her hands together and say no in this loud voice like training a dog telling me i was stupid a moron not paying attention she used to clamp her hands on my face and force me to look into her eyes she placed her hands on my cheeks and pressed them together hard her palms were wet and her mouth was parted she brought me forward and i thought she might kiss me instead she said pay attention listen you moron in a grating voice i suppressed the impulse to twist free that instant of confinement drove my empathy up another notch pay attention stop wandering stupid this is important you need to learn this if you dont pay attention you cant learn she squeezed harder let go smiled again breath mints that was her smell isnt it funny how you remember the smells mints but her breath was still shitty she thought she was hot kinda young little miniskirts big boobs maybe she was letting dr b slip it to her why do you say that because of the way she acted around him looks following him around she reported directly to him one thing you could count on after a difficult session with miss bitch youd soon be seeing dr botch for candles and needle twisting so she got murdered huh very nastily too bad she pouted then smiled see i can be a hypocrite too its called acting i work with people who do it for a living we all do actually dont we what about rodney shipler does that name mean anything to you nope delmar parker the boy i told you about over the phone yeah the truck thats how i knew you were for real he was before my time may seventythree you heard about it i heard about it from botch boy did i during a bad love session nod the wages of sin id committed some major felony i think it was not wearing underwear or something or maybe he caught me with a boy i dont remember he said i was a vermeen aneemal and stupid then gave me this whole spiel about a vermeen aneemal boy whod received the ultimate punishment for his stupidity death young lady death what did he say happened the kid stole a truck ran it off the road and got killed proof positive of what happened to vermeen aneemal moron children botch had a good time with it making fun of the kid laughing a lot as if it were just a big joke do you comprehend you bad styupid girl a boy so styupid he steals a truck even though he doesnt know how to drive ha ha ha a boy so styupid he virtually choreographs his own death ha ha ha he used that word choreograph yes she said looking surprised i believe he actually did what else did he say about the accident disgusting details that was part of bad love grossing you out he had a ball with this one how they didnt find the boy right away and when they did there were maggots in his mouth and crawling in and out of his eyeshe is being eaten by maggots my dear meredith feasted upon consumed and the animals have feasted upon him too chewed away most of his face it is a real mess just like your character styupid meredith you are not listening you are not concentrating you bad styupid girl we are trying to mold you into something decent but you refuse to cooperate think meredith think of that styupid boy the bad love he received from the maggots that is what happens when vermeen aneemals dont change their ways she gave a hard dry laugh and dabbed her nose again that might not be an exact quote but its pretty damn close he also got into this whole racist rap said the kid in the truck was black a savage meredith a jungle native why would you want to imitate the savages when theres a world of civilization out there on top of everything else hes a racist too even without the rap you could tell the looks he gave the minority kids were there a lot of minority kids she shook her head just a few tokens probably part of the public image in public he was mr liberal pictures of martin luther king and gandhi and the kennedys all over the place like i said its all acting the world is a fucking stage she placed her hands flat on the table looking ready to get up again a couple more names i said silk headshake merino what is this a fabric show uhuh lyle gritz grits and toast she said nope how many people have gotten bumped off anyway lots im on the list too her eyes rounded you why i cochaired a symposium on de boschs work at western peds why she said coldly were you a fan no actually your father requested it of me requested it huh what approach did he take squeezing your balls or kissing your ass squeezing he did it as a favor to katarina symposium huh gee thanks dad the man tortures me so you throw him a party when did this take place seventynine she thought seventynine i was in boston in seventynine catholic girls school even though we werent catholic a symposium she laughed you never told your parents anything that happened at the corrective school nothing i was too numb and they wouldnt have listened anyway after that summer i didnt talk to anyone just went along like some robot they handed botch a naughty actingout girl and got back this compliant little zombie they thought it was a miracle cure years later they were still saying it was the best decision they ever made id just stare at them want to kill them keep my feelings all inside the pale eyes were wet how long did you stay that way i said softly i dont know months years like i said it blurs all i know is it took a real long time to get back to my true self get smart enough to mess around and cover my tracks no sticky stains on the clothes she licked her lips and grinned a tear dripped down one cheek she wiped it away angrily when i was eighteen i told them fuck you and left ran away with a guy who came to unclog the toilet sounds like youve done pretty well since how kind of you to say so dear oh yeah its been a blast prs a bullshit business so im perfect for it throwing parties setting up promos feeding rumors to the idiot press well the show must go on ciao it was real stud she stood and nearly ran out of the restaurant i put money on the table and followed her caught up as she was getting into a red mustang convertible the car looked new but there were dings and dents all along the drivers side uhuh no more she said starting the engine you get a quickie mindfuck for your ten bucks and thats it just wanted to thank you i said polite too she said i really dont like you robin said bad love the hypocrisy the bastard coins a phrase to describe poor child rearing but has his own private meaning for it victimizing little kids her hands tightened around the handle of a wood rasp the blade caught on a piece of rosewood and she pulled it free and put it down and i said if this womans experience was typical the victimization was perfectly legal de bosch didnt sexually molest anyone and none of the physical things he did would fall under any childabuse statutes but swedens not the poking and slapping no bruises no case and usually you need deep wounds and broken bones to get anywhere legally corporal punishments still allowed in many schools back then it was accepted procedure and theres never been any law against mind control or psychological abuse how can you pin down the criteria basically de bosch behaved like a really rotten parent and thats no crime she shook her head and no one ever said anything maybe some of the children did but i doubt anyone believed them these were problem kids their credibility was low and their parents were angry in some cases de bosch was probably the court of last resort this woman came back to her family traumatized but perfectly compliant they never suspected the summer at the school was anything but successful some success were talking ultrahigh levels of parental frustration rob even if what de bosch did had come to light and some parents had pulled their kids out ill bet you others would have rushed to enroll theirs de boschs victims never had any legal recourse now one of thems evening the score his own way the same old chain she said victims and victimizers the thing that bothers me though is why the killer didnt strike out against de bosch only the disciples unless de bosch died before the killer was old enough or assertive enough to put together a revenge plot or crazy enough that too if im right about the killer being directly traumatized by delmar parkers accident were talking about someone who was a student at the school in de bosch died seven years later so the killer may still have been a kid felons that young rarely commit carefully planned crimes theyre more into impulsive stuff another thing that could have stopped him from getting de bosch was being locked up jail or a mental institution that fits with our mr gritz the ten years unaccounted for between his leaving georgia and getting arrested here more frustration she said exactly not being able to punish de bosch directly could have heated him up even further the first murder occurred five years ago myra paprock maybe that was the year he was released myra would have been a good target for him a trusted disciple dictatorial makes sense she said looking down at her workbench and arranging some files if de bosch really killed himself but what if he was murdered and made to look like a suicide i dont think so i said his death was too peaceful overdose of medication why would the killer butcher subordinates and allow the boss to get off so easy and a ritual approach one that fulfilled a psychological need would have meant leaving the best for last not starting with de bosch first and working backwards best for last she said in a tremulous voice so where do you fit in the only thing i can think of is that damned symposium she started to switch off her tools the dog tagged after her stopping each time she did looking up as if seeking approval alex she said removing her apron if de bosch did commit suicide do you think it could have been due to remorse it doesnt mean much but it would be nice to think of him having some selfdoubts the woman asked me the same thing id have liked to say yesshed have loved to hear it but she wouldnt have bought it the man she described didnt sound very conscience laden my guess is his motivation was just what the papers printed despondence over ill health the slides his daughter flashed at the symposium showed a physical wreck a wrecker she said yeah who knows how many kids he messed up over the years the dog heard the tension in my voice and cocked his head i petted him and said so whos the higher lifeform anyway bub robin picked up a broom and began to sweep wood shavings any other calls i said holding the dustpan for her uhuh she finished and wiped her hands we stepped out of the garage and she pulled down the door the mountains across the canyon were clear and greening droughtstarved shoots trying for another season all at once the big low house seemed more foreign than ever we went inside the furniture looked strange in the bedroom robin unbuttoned her work shirt and i unsnapped her bra and cupped her breasts they were warm and heavy in my palms and as i touched her she arched her back then she stepped away from me and crossed her arms over her chest lets get out of here alex out of the city sure i said looking over at the dog headbutting the bedcovers do we take him with us im not talking summer vacation just dinner somewhere far enough to feel different hell be fine well leave food and water the airconditioning on give him a couple of chewbones okay where would you like to go her smile was barren normally id say santa barbara i forced myself to laugh how about the other direction laguna beach laguna would be peachy she came over and placed my hands on her hips remember that place with the ocean view yeah i said calamari and pictures of weeping clowns wonder if its still in business if it isnt therell be someplace else the main thing is we get away we left at seventhirty to avoid the freeway jam taking the truck because the gas tank was fuller i drove enjoying the height and the heft and the power a tape robin had picked up at mccabes was in the deck a teenager named allison krause singing bluegrass in a voice as sweet and clear as first love and running off fiddle solos that had the wondrous ease of the prodigy i hadnt called milo to tell him about meredith another scumbag hed say worldweary then hed rub his face i thought of the man on the tape chanting like a child reliving his past bad thoughts intruding i felt robin tighten up her fingers had been tapping my thigh in time with the music now they stopped i squeezed them strummed the fingertips let my hand wander to her small hard waist as the truck roared in the fast lane she had on black leotards under a short denim skirt her hair was tied up showing off her neck smooth as cream a man with a functioning brain would have thanked god for sitting next to her i pressed my cheek against hers let my shoulders drop and bobbed my head to the music not fooling her but she knew i was trying and she put her hand high on my thigh a babe and a truck and the open road by the time i reached long beach it started to feel real laguna was quieter and darker than i remembered the art fair over nearly all the tourist traps and galleries closed the place with the squid and clowns was no longer in business a karaoke bar had taken its place people getting slogged on margaritas and pretending to be righteous brothers the painful sounds made their way to the sidewalk we found a pleasantlooking cafe farther up the street ate huge cold salads decent swordfish and excellent chilean sea bass with french fries and coleslaw and drank a bit of wine then strong black coffee walking it off we went far enough past the commercial zone to get an ocean glimpse of our own the water was a thousand miles of black beyond a white thread of sand the waves rolled drunkenly sending up ice chips of spray and an occasional roar that sounded like applause we held hands so tightly our fingers ached grabbed at each other and kissed until our tongues throbbed barely enough light to see robins dark eyes narrowing she bit my lower lip and i knew some of it was passion the rest anger i kissed her behind her ear and we embraced for a long time then we returned to the truck and drove north out of town dont get on the freeway she said drive awhile i got onto laguna canyon road went for several miles and made a random turn onto an unmarked strip that corkscrewed up into the mountains no talk or music her hands on me as she cried out her tension we passed a pottery studio its wooden sign barely lit by a dusty bulb a glimpse of chickenwire fencing a couple of horse ranches an unmarked shack then nothing for a long time and the road deadended at brush crickets and shadows the ocean nowhere in sight i put the truck in reverse robin stopped me and turned off the engine we locked eyes and kissed fumbling with each others clothing stripped completely naked we held each other shivering knitting our limbs breathing into one another fighting for oblivion the ride back was slow and silent and i managed to keep reality at bay till we got off the freeway robin slept as she had since wed crossed the la county line low in the seat half smiling it was one fortytwo in the morning and sunset was nearly bare of cars the familiar eastward cruise was solitary and peaceful as i approached the beverly glen intersection i prepared to shoot through the green light then wailing sirens sounded from somewhere i couldnt pinpoint surrounding me growing louder i slowed and stopped robin was startled sitting up just as flashing red lights popped out from around the bend and the sirens became unbearable a hookandladder came at us from the east bearing down for an instant i felt trapped then the fire engine made a sharp right turn northward onto the glen followed closely by another fire truck then another smaller unit a cherrytopped sedan brought up the rear as the sirens tapered off to a distant whistle robin was clutching the armrest her eyes were gigantic as if the lids had been stapled back we looked at each other i turned left and followed the shrieking caravan a hundred yards in i could smell it a pot left too long on the stove overlaid with gasoline i put on speed just able to see the fire cars taillights hoping the company would continue on up toward mulholland and beyond but they hooked west up an old bridle path that led up to a solitary property robin held her head and moaned as i floored the truck coming to my street i sped up the slope the road was blocked by the newly arrived fire trucks and i had to pull over and park work lights were scattered about highlighting the firefighters yellow hats lots of movement but the night blocked out the details robin and i jumped out and began running up the hill the burnt stench was stronger now the sky a black camouflaging host for the plumes of dark smoke that shot upward in greasy gray spirals i could feel the fire the caustic heat better than i could see it my body was drenched with sweat i was cold to the marrow the firefighters were uncoiling hoses and shouting too busy to notice us what had once been my pond gate was charcoal the carport had collapsed and the entire right side of my house was smoldering the back of the building was haloed in orange tongues of fire licked the sky sparks jumped and died wood crackled and crashed a tall firefighter handed a hose to another man and pulled off his gloves he saw us and came forward gesturing us back we walked toward him its our house i said the look of pity on his face cut me deeply he was black with a big jaw and wide dark mustache sorry folks were working hard on it got here as quick as we could from the mulholland substation reinforcements just came in from beverly hills robin said is it all gone he removed his hat and wiped his forehead exhaling it wasnt as of a few minutes ago maam and weve controlled it you should start to see that smoke turn white real soon how bad is it he hesitated to be frank maam youve suffered some serious structural damage all along the rear what with the drought and all that wood siding your roofs half gone must have been pretty dry up there what was it ceramic tile some sort of tile i said it came with the house i dont know those old roofs give thanks it wasnt wood shingle that would have been like a pile of kindling robin was looking at him but she wasnt listening to him he bit his lip started to place a hand on her shoulder but stopped himself putting his glove back on he turned to me if the wind doesnt do squirrely things we should be able to save some of it get you in there soon as possible to start taking a look robin started to cry the fireman said im real sorry maam if you need a blanket weve got some in the truck no she said what happened dont know exactly yet why dont you talk to the captain that gentleman over there captain gillespie he should be able to help you after pointing to a mediumsized man up near the carport he ran off we made our way to the captain his back was to us and i tapped him on the shoulder he turned quickly looking ready to snap one look at us shut his mouth he was in his fifties and had a deeply scored face that was almost a perfect square tugging at his chin strap owners two nods sorry folks out for the night more nods i felt encased in sand movement was an ordeal well weve been at it for about half an hour and i think we got to it relatively fast after ignition luckily someone driving up the glen smelled it and phoned it in on cellular weve got most of the really hot spots out look for white smoke soon mr alex delaware this is robin castagna ron gillespie mr delaware are you the legal owners or tenants owners another pitying look a whooshing sound came from the house he glanced over his shoulder then looked back we should be able to save at least half of it but our water does some damage too he looked back again something creased his brow one minute jogging over to a group of new arrivals he pointed at my flaming roof and spread his arms like a preacher when he came back he said you folks want something to drink cmon lets get away from the heat we followed him down the road a bit the house was still in sight some of the smoke had startened to lighten pluming upward like an earthborn cloud he pulled a canteen out of his jacket and held it out to us robin shook her head i said no thanks gillespie opened the bottle and drank screwing the cap back on he said do you know of anyone whod want to do this to you why he stared at me usually people say no there is someone i said i dont know who its a long story theres a police detective you can talk to i gave him milos name and he wrote it down id better call him now he said our arson investigators will be in on it too this is an obvious intentional weve got three discrete points of origin and we found a gasoline can out back thats probably the accelerant looks like the bastard didnt even try to hide it no i said he wouldnt want to do that he stared at me again i looked back without focusing gillespie said ill go call that detective now milo spent a few seconds of silent comfort with us then he huddled with gillespie the fire went out sending off columns of white smoke some time after i still dont know how long robin and i were able to tour the damage accompanied by a fireman with a flashlight who looked out for our safety but hung back diplomatically as we stumbled and cursed in the dark the garden and the rear half of the house were a total loss the air still hot and bitter the front rooms were sodden and putrid ash filled already moldering i ran my hand along scorched furniture fingered hot dust looked at ruined art and decimated keepsakes tv and stereo equipment that had blistered and burst after a while it got too difficult i pulled the paintings and prints that looked intact off the wall and made a neat stack short stack my bellows boxing print seemed to have come out okay but the frame was blackened around the edges robin was across the living room when i said ive got to get out of here she gave a dull nod more of a bow we carried the art out and took it to the truck beyond the vehicles milo and gillespie were still conferring and a third man had joined them young chubby balding with bristly red hair he held a pad and his writing hand was busy drew seaver he said holding out the other one fire department arson investigator detective sturgis has been filling me in sounds like youve really been through it ill have some questions for you but they can wait a couple of days milo told him ill get you whatever you need fine said seaver whats your insurance situation doctor as if cued captain gillespie said better be getting back good luck folks when he was gone seaver repeated his insurance question i said i never really checked the details im up to date on my premiums well thats good those insurance guys are real sonofas believe me dot your i wrong and theyll find a way not to pay you you need any help with justification just have em call me he handed me his card that and a statement from detective sturgis should handle it what needs to be handled said robin what do we need to justify seaver picked at his chin his lips were thick pink and soft looking with a natural turndown that made him look sad arson fires tend to be selfgenerated mrs delaware in lots of cases anyway like i said insurance companiesll do anything not to pay up first thing theyre going to be assuming is youre behind this then fuck em said milo to us dont sweat it ill handle it seaver said okay well better be looking around some more cracking a brief smile he left milos hair was ragged his eyes electric he had on a shirt and tie but the tie was crooked and his collar was loosened in the darkness his acnescarred face looked like moonscape his hand moved over it rapidly and repeatedly almost ticlike its okay said robin no no he said uhuh dont comfort me youre the victims goddamn protect and serve some protection i know it sounds like a crock but we are gonna get him one fucking way or the other hes history well get free of this the three of us walked back to the truck milos unmarked was parked behind it none of us looked back the firefighters lights were going out one by one as some of the trucks pulled away sunrise was several hours away without the bulbs and the flames the night seemed hollow just a thin membrane holding back the void wanna go back with me said milo no i said i can handle it robin stood on tiptoes and kissed his cheek i found out what de boschs sin was i said i told him of meredith borks experience you stab me i stab you he said no fucking excuse can we be sure this wasnt the iron priests we cant be sure of anything he said furiously but a thousand to one its not them no offense but youre just not important enough to them they want raza blood no this was our bad love buddy remember bancrofts comment about firesetters at the school you told me there was no record of any fires there yeah the kids behaved themselves there its when they graduated that the problems started i drove but i felt as if i was being towed each segment of white line diminished me across the cab of the truck robin wept unable to stop finally surrendering to deep wracking sobs i was beyond tears just as i crossed into beverly hills she took a sucking breath and pressed fisted hands together oh well she said i always wanted to redecorate i must have laughed because my throat hurt and i heard two voices chuckling hysterically what style should we choose i said phoenix rococo benedict canyon appeared red light i stopped my eyes felt acid washed it was a crummy little place anyway she said no it wasnt it was a beautiful little place oh alex i pulled her to me her body felt heavy but boneless green light my brain said go but my foot was slow to follow trying not to think of everything id lost and everything yet to lose i managed to complete the left turn and began a solitary crawl up benedict home temporary home the dog would run out to greet us i felt inadequate for the role of animal buddy for anything i drove up to the white gate it took a long time to find the card key even longer to slip it in the slot moving the truck up the drive i counted cypress trees in an effort to settle my mind on something i parked next to the seville and we got out the dog didnt rush out to greet us i fumbled with the key to the front door turned it as i walked through the door something cold and hard pressed against my left temple and a hand reached around and clapped me hard on the right side of my head immobilizing my skull hello doctor said a voice from a chant welcome to bad love he said dont move or speak pardon the cliché the pressure on my temple was intense strong fingers dug into my cheek good he said obedient you must have been a good student dig were you i was okay such modesty you were a lot better than okay your fourthgrade teacher mrs lyndon said you were one of the best students she ever had do you remember mrs lyndon squeeze and shake yes she remembers you such a good little boy keep being good hands on head as my fingers touched my hair the lights went on one of the couches was out of place pushed closer to the coffee table there were drinks and plates on the coffee table a glass of something brown the bag of taco chips robin had bought a couple of days ago was open crumbs scattered on the table making himself comfortable knowing wed be gone for a while but would come back nowhere else to go because hed used the fire to flush me out used the time to prepare the scene the ritual choreographing death firesetters and felons i considered how to get at him felt the pressure saw only dark sleeve where was robin forward march he said but he continued to hold me still footsteps on marble someone walked into my line of sight holding robin the same way tall bulky black sweater baggy black slacks black ski mask with eye holes shiny eyes the color indeterminate at this distance he towered over robin gripping her face and forcing her eyes up at the ceiling her neck was stretched exposed i gave an involuntary start and the hand gripped my head harder imprisoning it i knew where theyd learned that bumping and scratching from the back of the house the dog tied out there behind drapes that had been drawn over the french doors something else at robins head besides a hand automatic pistol small chrome plated bump scratch the voice behind me laughed great attack dog some tight security youve got here alarm system with an obvious home run one snip and byebye fancy electric gate a dwarf could climb over and a cute little closedcircuit tv to announce your arrival more laughter the tall man with robin didnt move or make a sound two types of killing two killers my captor said okay campers the tall man shifted his free hand from robins face to the small of her back and began propelling her down the hallway toward the bedrooms swinging his hips effeminate walking the way robin walked a woman a tall woman with strong shoulders id talked to a tall angry woman this afternoon a corrective school alumna with plenty of reason to hate i really dont like you id called meredith out of the blue yet shed been willing to talk to me too eager and she had a special reason to feel rage over the western peds symposium thanks dad id just stare at them want to kill them keep my feelings all inside alone with robin now her appetites and anger forward march fool the gun stayed in place as the hand moved from my face no more pressure but his touch lingered like phantom pain a sharp prod to my kidneys as he shoved me farther into the room onto a couch as i bounced my hands left my head his foot met my shin and pain burned through my leg back up up up up i complied waiting to be tied or restrained but he let me stay there hands on head and sat down facing me just out of reach i saw the gun first another automatic bigger than merediths dull black a dark wooden grip freshly oiled i could smell it he looked tall too long waist and long legs that he planted firmly on the marble a little narrow in the shoulders arms a bit short navy blue sweatshirt with a designer logo black jeans black leather hightop athletic shoes that looked spanking new the chic thing to wear for homicide the avenger reads gq his mask had a mouth cutout a sharklike smile filled the hole the dog scratched some more under the mask his forehead moved he crossed his legs keeping the big black gun a couple of feet from the center of my chest breathing fast but his arm was stable using his free hand he reached up and began rolling his mask up doing it deftly so that his eyes never moved from mine and his gun arm never faltered doing it slowly the wool peeled away like a snakes molt exposing a soft unremarkable face with fine features rosy cheeks the hair brass colored thinning worn thicker at the sides now matted by the mask andrew coburg the storefront lawyers smile was wide wet impish a surpriseparty smile he twirled the mask and tossed it over his shoulder voilà i struggled to make sense of it coburg directing me to gritz misdirecting me careful researcher mrs lyndon i really like this place he said despite all the queer art nice crisp cruel la ambience much better than that little yuppie log cabin of yours and cliffside talk about perfect not to mention your little friends truckunbelievable couldnt have set it up better myself he winked almost makes you believe in god doesnt it fate karma predestination collective unconscious choose your dogma do you have any idea what im talking about delmar parker i said the dead boys name blotted out his smile im talking about consonance he said making it right but delmar has something to do with it doesnt he something beyond bad love he uncrossed his legs the gun made a small arc what do you know about bad love you pretentious yuppie prick the gun arm was board rigid then it began vibrating he looked at it for just a second laughed as if trying to erase his outburst scratch bump the dog was throwing himself hard against the glass coburg snickered little pit puppy maybe after its over ill take him home with me smiling but sweating the rosy cheeks deep with color trying to keep my face neutral i strained to hear sounds from the bedrooms nothing so you think you know about bad love said coburg meredith told me about it i said his brow tightened and mottled the dog kept scraping the oldman whining sound filtered through the glass coburg gave a disgusted look you dont know anything he said so tell me shut your mouth the gun arm shot forward again i didnt move he said you dont know a tenth of it dont flatter yourself with empathy fuck your empathy the dog bumped some more coburgs eyes flattened maybe ill just shoot it skin it and gut it how good can a shrinks dog be anyway how many shrinks does it take to change a lightbulb none theyre all dead he laughed a bit more wiped sweat from his nose i concentrated on the gun arm it remained firmly in place as if cut off from the rest of him do you know what my sin was he said the great transgression that bought me a ticket to hell ticket to hell meredith had called the school the same thing i shook my head my armpits were aching my fingers turning numb he said enuresis when i was a kid i used to piss my bed he laughed they treated me as if i liked it he said mumsy and evil stepdaddy as if i liked clammy sheets and that litterbox smell they were convinced i was doing it on purpose so they beat me so i got more nervous and pissed gallons so then what did they do looking at me waiting they beat you some more bingo and washed my dick with lye soap and all sorts of other wonderful stuff still smiling but his cheeks were scarlet his hair was plastered to his forehead his shoulders hunched under the designer sweatshirt my first thought seeing those rosy cheeks had been a beautiful baby so i started to do other things he said really naughty things could anyone blame me being tortured for something that i had no control over i shook my head again for a split second i felt my agreement meant something to him then a distracted look came into his eyes the gun arm pushed forward and the blackmetal barrel edged closer to my heart whats the current lowdown on enuresis anyway he said do you pricks still tell parents its a mental disease its genetic i said related to sleep patterns generally it goes away by itself you dont treat it anymore sometimes behavior therapy is used you ever treat kids for it when they want to be treated sure he grinned youre a real humanitarian the grin died so what were you doing making speeches paying homage to hitler i shut up the gun jabbed my chest that was rhetorical dont speak unless youre spoken to sleep patterns huh you quacks werent saying that back when i was getting beaten with a strap you had all sorts of other voodoo theories back then one of your fellow quacks told mumsy and evil that i was screwed up sexually another said i was seriously depressed and needed to be hospitalized and one genius told them i was doing it because i was angry about their marriage which was true but i wasnt pissing because of it that one they bought evil really got into expressing his anger big financial man spiffy dresser he had a whole collection of fancy belts lizard alligator calfskin all with nice sharp buckles one day i went to school with an especially nice collection of welts on my arm a teacher started asking questions and the next thing i knew i was on a plane with dear old mumsy to sunny california go west little bad boy he let his free hand drop to his lap his eyes looked tired and his shoulders rounded the dog was still throwing himself against the glass coburg stared straight at me i said how old were you when they put you in the school the gun jabbed again forcing me backward against the couch all at once his face was up against mine breathing licorice i could see dried mucus in his nostrils he spat his saliva was cold and thick as it oozed down the side of my face im not there yet he said between barely moving lips why dont you shut up and let me tell it breathing hard and fast i made myself look into his eyes feeling the gun without seeing it my pulse thundered in my ears the spit continued its downward trail reaching my chin dripping onto my shirt he looked repulsed struck out slapping me and wiping me simultaneously wiped his hand on the seat cushion they didnt put me there right away they put me in another dungeon first right across the street can you believe that two hellholes on the same street what was it zoned h for hell a real shithole run by a nincompoop alkie but expensive as hell so of course mumsy thought it was good the woman was always such an arriviste i tried to look like a fascinated student still no sounds from the bedrooms coburg said a nincompoop not even a challenge a book of matches and some notebook paper smile firesetters and truants bancroft hadnt said the fire was at his school poor mumsy was stymied out on the next plane the poor thing this wonderful look of hopelessness on her face and she such an educated woman crying as we waited for our taxi i thought id finally scored a point then he walked over from across the street this goatish thing in a black suit and cheap shoes taking mummys hand telling her hed heard what had happened tsktsking and letting her cry some more about her bad little boy then telling her his school could handle those kinds of things guaranteed all the while tousling my hair twelve years old and he was tousling my fucking hair his hand stank of cabbage and bay rum the gun hand wavered a bit not enough scratch bump mummy was thrilledshe knew him from his magazine articles a famous man willing to tame her wild child his free hand fluttered the cab came and she sent it off empty the gun withdrew far enough for me to see its black snout dark against his white knuckles two hellholes on the same street de bosch exploiting bancrofts failures an alumnus of both schools coming back years later a tramp the cleancut face in front of me bore no street scars but sometimes the wounds that healed werent the important ones across the street i went mummy signed some papers and left me alone with hitler he smiled at me and said andrew little andrew we have the same name lets be friends me saying fuck you old goat he smiled again and patted my head took me down a long dark hall shoved me into a cell and locked it i cried all night when they let me out for lunch i snuck into the kitchen and found matches a wistful look came into his eyes how thorough was i tonight did i leave anything standing at casa del shrinko i remained silent the gun poked me did i not much good its a shoddy world thoroughness is so rare a quality you personify shoddiness you were as easy to get to as a sardine in a can all of you were tell me why are psychotherapists such a passive helpless bunch why are you all such absolute wimps talking about life rather than doing anything i didnt answer he said you really are you know such an unimpressive group stripped of your jargon youre noth if that dog of yours doesnt shut up im going to kill him better yet ill make you kill him make you eat him we can grill him on that barbecue youve got out back a nice little hot dog that would be justice wouldnt it making you confront your own cruelty give you a taste of empathy why dont we just let him go i said hes not mine just a stray i took in how kind of you jab my breastbone felt inflamed i said why dont we let my friend go too she hasnt seen your faces he smiled and settled back a bit shoddiness he said thats the big problem phony science false premises false promises you pretend to help people but you just mindfuck them he leaned forward how do you manage to live with yourself knowing youre a phony jab answer me ive helped people how with voodoo with bad love trying to keep the whine out of my voice i said i had nothing to do with de bosch except for that symposium except for except for thats like eichmann saying he had nothing to do with hitler except for getting those trains to the camps that symposium was a public love fest you asshole you stood up there and canonized him he tortured children and you canonized him i didnt know yeah you and all the other good germans he spat at me again the knuckles of his gun hand were tiny cauliflowers sweat popped at his hairline thats it he said thats your excusei didnt know pathetic just like all the others for a bunch of supposedly educated people you cant even plead for yourselves effectively no class delmar had more class in his little finger than the lot of you put together and he was retarded not that it stopped them from badloving him day in and day out he shook his head and flung sweat i saw his index finger move up and down the trigger the painful hungry look on his face made my bowels churn but then it was gone and he was smiling again retarded he said as if enjoying the word fourteen but he was more like a sevenyearold i was twelve but i ended up being his big brother he was the only one in the place whod talk to me beware the dangerous pyromaniac hitler warned them all against having anything to do with me i was completely shunned except by delmar he couldnt think clearly but he had a heart of gold hitler took him in for the publicity poor little negro retardo helped by the great white doctor when visitors came he always had his hand on delmars woolly little head but delmar was no great success delmar couldnt remember rules or learn how to read and write so when there were no visitors around he kept badloving him over and over and when that didnt work they sent in the shebeast myra evans no not her you idiot she was the bitch im talking about the beastdr daughter killme katethank you i already have highpitched laughter the gun moved back some more and i stared into its single black eye the dog began scratching again but coburg didnt notice when the beast finished with delmar he was drooling and crapping his pants and banging his head against the wall what did she do to him what did she do she did a number on his head and other parts of his body she molested him his free hand touched his cheek and he arched his eyebrows such shock the poor man is shocked yeah she molested him you idiot in ways that hurt hed come back from sessions with her crying and holding himself crawl into bed weeping i had the room next door id pick the lock and sneak him something to drink when i asked him what the matter was he wouldnt tell me not for weeks then he finally did i didnt know much about sex period let alone ugly things he pulled down his pants and showed me the marks dried blood all over his shorts that was my introduction to the birds and the bees it altered me it altered me his lips vibrated and he swallowed hard a couple of times the gun arm like steel the glass door vibrated so he took the truck i said to escape what she was doing to him we took it i knew how to drive because evil had a farm in connecti a summer place lots of trucks and tractors one of the farmhands taught me planning the break was hard because delmar had trouble remembering details we had a bunch of false starts finally we made it out late at night everyone asleep delmar was scared i had to drag him the gun barrel made tiny arcs i had no idea which way to go so i just drove the roads kept getting curvier delmar was scared out of his mind crying for his mama im telling him everythings okay but some idiot left sawhorses in the middle of the road a ditch no warning lights we skidded off the road i yelled for delmar to jump free tried to pull him out but he was too heavy then my door flipped open and i was thrown out delmar he licked his lips and breathed with forced deliberation his finger tapped the trigger boom kaboom he said life is so tenuous isnt it he looked winded dripping perspiration the big smile on his face was forced he it took me two hours to walk back to hell my clothes were torn and id twisted my ankle it was a miracle i was alive meant for something i managed to crawl into bed my teeth were chattering so loud i was sure everyone would wake up it took a while till the commotion began talking footsteps lights going on then hitler came stomping into my room tore the covers off me and stared at me foaming at the mouth i looked right back at him this crazy look came into his eyes and he lifted his hands like he was ready to claw me i stared right back at him and pulled my pud and he just let his arms drop walked out never spoke to me again i was locked in my room for three days on the fourth day mummy came and picked me up go east young victor so you won i said oh yeah he said i was the conquering hero jab my victory bought me more dungeons more sadists pills and needles thats what your places are about whether you call them hospitals or jails or schools killing the spirit i remembered the flash of anger hed shown in his office when wed talked about dorsey hewitt he should have been taken care of institutionalized taken care of not jailed oh hell even jail wouldnt have been bad if that would have meant treatment but it never does but you got past that i said you made it through law school youre helping other people he laughed and the gun retreated an inch or two dont patronize me you fuck yeah lets hear it for higher education you know where i learned my torts and jurisprudence the library at rahway state prison filing appeals for myself and the other wretches thats where i learned the law was written by the oppressors to benefit the oppressors but like fire you could learn to use it make it work for you he laughed again and wiped his forehead the only bars i ever passed were the ones on my cell for five years ive been going up against yuppie careerist assholes from harvard and stanford and kicking their asses in court ive had judges compliment my work five years i said right after myra right before he grinned the bitch was a gift to myself id just gotten the gig at the center gave myself two gifts the bitch and a new guitar black les paul special you remember my guitar dont you all that rapportbuilding crap you slung at me in my office the guitarpick tiepin what do you do mostly electric or acoustic lately ive been getting into electric special effects too phase shifters he grinned and raised his free hand as if for a highfive hey bro lets jam and cut a record is that the offer you gave lyle gritz the grin shrank a human decoy i said to throw me off the track he jabbed me hard with the gun and slapped my face with his free hand shut up and stop controlling or ill do you right here and make your little friend in there clean it up keep those fucking hands up up i felt spit hit my cheek again and roll over my lips silence from the bedroom the dogs struggles had become background noise say youre sorry he said for trying to control im sorry he reached over and patted my cheek almost tenderly the bitch he said wistfully she was given to me served on a plate with parsley and new potatoes the gun wavered then straightened he crossed his legs the soles of his shoes were unmarked except for a few bits of gravel stuck in the treads karma he said i was living out in the valley nice little bachelor pad in van nuys driving home on a sunday these flags out at the curb open house for sale when i was a kid i liked other peoples houses anything better than my own i got good at getting into other peoples houses this one looked like it might have a few souvenirs so i stopped to check it out i ring the bell the real estate agent comes to the door and right away shes giving me her pitch da da da da da da da da but im not hearing a word shes saying im looking at her face and its the bitch some wrinkles her boobs are sagging but theres no doubt about it shes shaking my hand talking about pride of ownership owner will carry and it hits me this is no accident this is karma all these years id been thinking about justice all those nights i lay in bed thinking about getting hitler but the fuck beat me to it he grimaced as if stung i thought id put that behind me then i looked into the bitchs eyes and realized i hadnt and she made it so easy playing her part turning her back and walking right in front of me open invitation he coughed cleared his throat the gun bumped against my sternum everything was perfect no one around i locked all the doors without her noticing shes too busy giving me her spiel when we reached an inner bathroom with no windows i hit her and did her she fell apart as if she was made of nothing at first it was messy then it got easier like a good riff the rhythm he talked on for a long while slipping into a drone like a surgeon dictating operatingroom notes giving me details i didnt want to hear i tuned out listening to the dog thump and bark listening for sounds from the bedrooms that never came silence sighing he said i found my lifes work rodney shipler i said he didnt work at the school did he was he a relative of delmars father in name only what was his crime complicity delmars mom was dead shipler was the only member of delmars family i could find delmar told me his dad was named rodney and he worked for the la schools i thought he was a teacher finally i located him over in south central a janitor this tired old asshole big and fat living by himself drinking whiskey out of a dixie cup i told him i was a lawyer and i knew what really happened to his son said we could sue class action even after the bitch i was still trying to work within the system he sat there drinking and listening then asked me could i guarantee him a lot of money in his pocket i told him no money wasnt the issue the publicity would expose hitler for what hed really been delmar would be a hero jab shipler poured himself another cup and told me he didnt give a shit about that said delmars mom had been some whore hed met in manila who wasnt worth the time of day said delmar had been a fool and a troublemaker from day one i tried to reason with him show him the importance of exposing hitler he told me to get the hell out tried to push me out coburgs eyes flared the gun seemed fused to his hand another good german he tried to push me out real bully but i taught him about justice after that i knew the only way was swift punishment the system wasnt set up to do the job i said one form of punishment for the underlings another for the high command exactly fair is fair he smiled finally someone catches on mrs lyndon was right you are a clever piece of work i told her i was a reporter doing a story on you she was so happy to help her little a student the gun tickled my ribs you deserve something for paying attention maybe ill knock you unconscious before i roll you over the cliff outside such a perfect setup head cock toward the front door would you like that before i could answer just kidding your eyes will be taped open youll experience every second of hell just like i did he laughed droned some more describing how hed beaten rodney shipler to death blow by blow when he was through i said katarina was high command also whyd you wait so long for her trying to buy time with questions but to what end a longer ordeal for robin why was it so quiet in there my eyes shifted downward the damn gun arm wasnt moving he said why do you think clever boy saving the best for last and you messed me up royal you were supposed to go before her but then you started snooping around sending your queer police buddy snooping so i had to do her out of sequence im pissed at you for that maybe ill put your girlfriend on the barbecue make you watch that with your eyelids taped open smiling sighing still shebeast got done and whats done is done do you know how she handled her fate total passivity just like the rest of you jab what kind of person would want to spend his life just sitting there listening not doing anything he laughed she got down on her knees and begged her shebeast throat got all clogged up like a toilet full of shit she was eating breakfast i just strolled in put this gun to her head said bad love shebeast and she just fell apart shaking his head as if still not believing slight shift of the gun not an ounce of fight no fun i had to stand her up and order her to make a run for it kicked her butt to get her to move even with that all she could do was stumble into the garage and get down on her knees again then she snapped out of her trance then she started begging crying pointing to her stomach telling me shes pregnant please have pity on my baby like she had pity then she pulled a card out of her pocket trying to prove it to me a sperm bank which makes sense who would have done her laughter like that was a reason saving her beastly fetus au contraire that was the best reason of all to do her kill hitlers seed another shake of the head unbelievable she bloodies delmars shorts and thinks thats a good reason she started to tell me she was on my side shed helped me killing him she killed her father she claimed she oded him on pills like shed gotten some insight but i knew she did it as a favor to him putting him out of his misery making sure id never get to him giving me another reason to do her hard and long shes blabbing and just digging herself deeper smile i made sure to do the baby first pulled it out still attached to her showed it to her and put it back in her the dogs struggles seemed to be weakening i thought i heard him whimper coburg said you messed up my order but thats okay ill get creative you and your little friend will be an adequate final act what about the others i said fighting to keep my voice even fighting to focus my own rage whyd you choose the order you did i keep telling you i didnt choose anything the pattern constructed itself i put your names into a hat and drew them out eenymeeny all the meanies the names of the people who spoke at the symposium nod all you good germans id been thinking about all of you for years even before doing the bitch you were there i said listening to us sitting in a back row taking it all in you were a kid howd you come to be there more karma i was nineteen living in hollywood and crashing at a halfway house on serrano just a few blocks from western peds taking a walk on sunset and i saw this program board out in front psychiatric symposium tomorrow morning tensing up he waved the gun arm dipping for just one second then snapping back into place the barrel touching my shirt his name i went in and picked up a brochure at the information desk shaved and showered and put on my best clothes and just walked in and watched all you hypocritical bastards get up there and say what a pioneer hed been child advocate gifted teacher the shebeast and her home movies everyone smiling and applauding i could barely sit there without screaming i should have screamed should have gotten up and told all of you what you really were but i was young no confidence so instead i went out that night and hurt myself which bought me another dungeon lots of time to think and get my focus id cut out your pictures pasted them on a piece of paper kept the paper in a box along with other important things ive lived with you assholes longer than most people stay married why was dr harrison spared he stared at me as if id said something stupid because he listened right after the hitler canonization i called him and told him it had bothered me and he listened i could tell he was taking me seriously he made an appointment to speak to me i was going to show up but something came up another dungeon whyd you tell him your name was merino whyd you tell me you were mr silk wrinkled forehead you spoke to harrison maybe ill visit him after all a sick feeling flooded me he doesnt know anyth dont fret fool im fair always have been i gave all of you the same chance i gave harrison but the rest of you flunked you never called me i said smile november thirtieth nineteen seventynine two pm i have a written record of it your snotty secretary insisted you only treated children and couldnt see me she wasnt supposed to screen i never knew thats an excuse when the troops fuck up the generals culpable and it was a chance you didnt even deserve a lot more than i got or delmar or any of the other loved ones you muffed it bro but rosenblatt i said he did see you he was the biggest hypocrite pretending to understand the soft voice the phony empathy then he revealed his true colors quizzing me trying to get into my head coburg put on an unctuous look im hearing a lot of pain one thing you might consider is talking about this more fury compressed the light brown eyes the phony bastard wanted to give me psychoanalysis to deal with my conflicts hundredbuckanhour couch work as a cure for political oppression because he couldnt accept the fact that hed worshiped hitler he sat there and pretended to hear but he didnt believe me just wanted to mess with my head the worst one of all byebye birdie he made a shoving motion with his free hand and smiled i said howd you get him to see you outside his office i told him i was bedridden crippled by something hitler had done that piqued his interest he came right over that evening with his kind looks and his beard and his bad tweed suit it was hot but he needed his little shrink costume the whole time he was there i stayed in bed the second time also i had him bring me a drink serving me it was a really muggy day the window was wide open for air tissue box on the ledge karma i pretended to sneeze and asked him to get me a tissue shove fly away hypocrite bird other peoples houses a financial man a farm in connecticut did that mean an apartment in new york city and her such an educated woman she a lawyer he a banker i said the apartment belonged to your mother and stepfather he shook his head joyfully clever little alex mrs lyndon would be so proud mummy and evil were in europe so i decided to crash at the old homestead rosenblatts office two blocks away karma eight floors up have a nice flight mr and mrs malcolm j rulerad cold people shirley rosenblatt had said unwilling to let a private investigator search their place guarding more than privacy how much had they known you left burglar tools behind i said did you need them to get in or were you just setting it up as another east side burglary he tried to mask his surprise with a slow languid smile my my we have been busy no i had a key one keeps looking for home sweet home the big brady bunch in the sky stoumen and lerner i said did they meet with you no he said suddenly angry again stoumens excuse was that he was retired another flunky shutting me out did i want to speak to the doctor on call you people really dont know how to delegate authority properly and lerner made an appointment but didnt show up the rude bastard the unreliability harrison had spoken of it had affected his work missed appointments so you tracked them down at conferences howd you get hold of the membership lists some of us are thorough mrs lyndon would have liked me too what a kindly old bag all that midwestern saltoftheearth friendliness research is such fun maybe ill visit her in person someday did meredith help you get the lists i said was she doing publicity for the conventions pursed lips tense brow the hand wavered meredith ah yes dear meredith shes been a great help now stop asking stupid questions and get down on your knees keep those hands up keep them up moving as slowly as i could i got off the couch and kneeled trying to keep a fix on the gun silence then another impact that shook the glass the dogs definitely chops and steaks he said the gun touched the crown of my head he ruffled my hair with the barrel and i knew he was remembering the weapon pressed down on me harder as if boring into my skull all i could see were his shoes the bottoms of his jeans a grout seam between two marble tiles say youre sorry he said sorry louder sorry personalize itim sorry andrew im sorry andrew more sincerity im sorry andrew he made me repeat it six times then he sighed i guess thats as good as its going to get how are you feeling right now ive been better chuckle ill bet you have stand up slowly slowly slooowly keep those hands up hands on head simon says he stepped back the gun trained on my head behind me was the couch chairs all around an upholstered prison nowhere to go a run for it would be suicide leaving robin to deal with his frustration the dog throwing himself harder i was upright now he stepped closer we came facetoface licorice and rage lowering the gun and pushing it against my navel then up at my throat then down again playing choreography i see it he said behind your eyes the fear you know where youre going dont you i said nothing dont you where am i going straight to hell oneway ticket the gun nudged my groin moved up to my throat again pressed against my heart back down to my crotch taking on a rhythm the musician in him moving his hips i was altered groin heart groin he poked my crotch and laughed when he raised the gun again i exploded chopping the gun wrist with my right hand as i stabbed at his eye with the stiffened fingertips of my left the gun fired as he lost balance he landed on his side the gun still laced between his fingers i stomped on his wrist his free hand was clamped over his face when he pulled it free and grabbed at my leg his eye was shut bleeding i stomped again and again he roared with pain the gun hand was limp but the weapon remained entangled he struggled to lift it and aim i dropped my knee full force on his arm got hold of the hand tugging twisting finally freeing the automatic my turn to aim my hands were numb i had trouble bending my fingers around the trigger he slid across the carpet on his back kicking out randomly holding his eye blood ran over his hand his escape was blocked by a sofa flailing and kicking he looked at me no behind me he screamed do it as i ducked and wheeled facing the hallway the smaller gun in my face a womans hand behind it red nails coburg shouting do it do it do it starting to get up i dropped to the floor just as the little gun went off more gunshots hollow pops softer than the black pistols thunder coburg on me we rolled i struck out with the black gun and caught the side of his head he fell back soundlessly landed on his back not moving where was the silver gun arcing toward me again from across the room two rednailed hands starting to squeeze i dove behind the couch pop the fabric puckered and gobbets of stuffing flew inches from my face i pressed myself flush to the marble pop pop pop heavy breathing gasping but whose i couldnt tell pop a dull noise from my back then the windchime song of shattered glass scampering feet a small black blur raced past me toward meredith hooking my arm around the couch i fired the big black automatic blindly trying to aim well above dog level the recoil drove me backward something crashed barks and growls and female screams i scuttled to the opposite side of the couch squeezed the trigger waited for return fire more screams footsteps human getting distant i hazarded a look around the couch saw her heading for the front door silver gun dangling like a purse coburg still down where was the dog meredith was almost at the door now the bolt was thrown she was having trouble with it i rushed her pointing the black gun feeling the triggers heavy action start to give swift justice screaming stop i fired into a wall she obeyed held onto the silver gun drop it drop it the gun fell to the floor and skidded away she said im sorry i didnt want to he made me turn around she did i yanked off her mask her face was trembling but she tossed her hair in a gesture more suited for a teenager blond hair my hand was still compressing the trigger i forced myself not to move jean jeffers said he made me and glanced at coburg he remained openmouthed and inert and her eyes died she tried tears you rescued me she said thanks whatd you do with robin shes fine i promise shes in there go see step out in front of me sure but this is silly alex he made me hes crazy were on the same side alex another look at coburg his chest wasnt moving keeping the black gun on jeffers i stooped and pocketed the silver one maintaining a clear view of her i managed to pull a large upholstered chair over the bottom half of coburgs body not worth much but it would have to do for the moment i walked jeffers back to the bedroom the door was closed the dog stood on his hind legs scratching at it gouging the paint an acetone stink came from the other side familiar open it i said she did robin was spreadeagled on the bed hands and feet tied to the posts with nylon fishing line duct tape over her mouth a bandana over her eyes on the nightstand were the spool of line scissors nail polish a box of tissues and robins manicure set nail polish remover the acetone a used emery board jeffers had passed the time by doing her nails she said let me free her right now i pocketed the scissors and let her using her hands she worked clumsily the dog up on the bed growling at her circling robin licking robins face specks of blood dappled his fur diamond glints of broken glass robin sat up and rubbed her wrists and looked at me stunned i motioned her off the bed and gave her the silver gun shoved jeffers down on it belly down hands behind her back did she hurt you i said jeffers said of course i didnt robin shook her head jeffers red nails were so fresh they still looked wet she said can we please robin tied her up quickly then we returned to the living room coburgs head where id hit him was huge soft eggplantpurple he was starting to move a bit but hadnt regained consciousness robin trussed him expertly those good strong hands the dog was at my feet panting i got down and inspected him he licked my hands licked the gun superficial cuts no sign he was suffering robin picked the glass out of his fur and lifted him kissing him cradling him like a baby i picked up the phone three days later i waited for milo at a place named angelas across the street from the west la stationhouse the front was a coffee shop in back was a cocktail lounge where detectives lawyers bailbondsmen and felons drank and worked on their lung tumors i took a booth at the rear of the lounge drinking coffee and trying to concentrate on the morning paper nothing yet on the bad love murders orders of the brass till it got sorted out coburg was in the hospital and milo had been virtually sequestered with jean jeffers at the county jail when he showed up fifteen minutes late a woman was with him thirties black the two of them stood in the doorway of the lounge outlined by hazy gray light adeline potthurst the social worker id seen on film dorsey hewitts knife up against her throat she looked older and heavier a big white purse was clutched in front of her like a fig leaf milo said something to her she glanced over at me and replied a bit more conversation then they shook hands and she left he came over and slid into the booth remember her shes talking to me she have anything interesting to say he smiled lit up a cigar and added to the pollution oh yeah before he could elaborate a waitress arrived and took his diet coke order when she left he said lots happening ive got new york records placing coburg in manhattan during all the east side breakins up till the day after rosenblatts death busted for shoplifting he was arrested in times square two days before the first burglary went to court the day he shoved rosenblatt out the window but his attorney got a continuance records listed his address as some dive near times square so he celebrated with murder he nodded grimly jivin jean finally opened up her attorney convinced her to sell out coburg for a reduced plea to accessory names dates places shes puttin on a good show whats her connection to de bosch she says none he said claims the revenge thing was all coburgs game she didnt really know what he was up to she says she met him at a mental health convention advocacy for the homeless struck up a conversation at the bar and found they had lots in common social worker encounters public interest lawyer i said a couple of idealists huh god help us he loosened his tie coburg probably went to lots of conventions with his phony law degree and his publicinterest persona he would have fit right in meanwhile hes looking for de bosch disciples and trying to undo his past symbolically all those years he spent in institutions now hes in the power role hobnobbing with therapists he was like a little kid thinking magically pretending he could make it all go away were still trying to unravel his travel schedule place him and jeffers together at least once acapulco the week mitchell lerner was killed jeffers admits going along for the weekend she presented a paper but claims to know nothing about lerner she also admits using her position to get coburg shrink mailing lists but says she thought he just wanted to use them in order to advertise the law center how does she explain trussing up robin and taking potshots at me he grinned what do you think the devil made her do it you bet as their relationship developed coburg began to dominate her psychologically and physically shed started to have some suspicions about him but was too afraid to back away from him does physically mean sexually she says there was some of that but mostly she claims he used mind control threats and intimidation to get into her head kind of a minimanson thing poor vulnerable woman taken in by psychopathic svengali she says the night he announced he was going to get you she didnt want any part of it but coburg threatened to tell her husband the two of them had been screwing for five years and when that didnt work he flat out said hed kill her how does she explain being so vulnerable because shed been abused as a kid she says that was what drew her to coburg their mutual experiences at first their relationship was platonic lunch talking about work coburg helping some of her clients out of legal jams she helping him get social services for his eventually it got more personal but still no sex then one day coburg took her to his apartment cooked lunch had a heart to heart and told her all the shit hed been through as a kid she told him she had too and they ended up having this big emotional scene cathartic she called it then they went to bed and the whole relationship started taking another turn five years i said thats when the murders began who does she say abused her daddy shes free and easy with the ugly details but itll be impossible to verify both parents and her only sibling a brother are dead natural causes were looking into it convenient i said everyones a victim i guess she could be telling the truth about being abused first time i met her she told me violating a childs trust was the lowest she could never work with abuse cases then again she could have been toying with me she and coburg got off on playing games even if its true it doesnt change the fact that shes a psychopathic witch couple of goddamn psychopaths theres your two pathologies scenario the bond between them couldnt be that deep it didnt take long for her to sell him out honor among scumbags his drink came and he cooled his hands on the glass i said so what about becky what does jean say the link was between her and coburg she claims to have no idea what his motive was there he smiled and guess what he didnt have one other than making jean happy becky was jeans thing you bet and thats what im gonna get her on all her cooperation on the other murders isnt going to help her there because ive got independent info on a motive becky and dick jeffers were having an affair for six months howd you find that out from the newly talkative ms adeline potthurst adeline saw becky and dick jeffers together sneaking off during a christmas party at the center kissing passionately his hand up her skirt not very discreet apparently becky and dick werent he used to come by to pick up jean and end up talking to becky body language all over the place the affair was semipublic knowledge at the center i checked it out with some of the other workers and they confirm it meaning jean knew jean knew because dickie told her i had a chat with him this morning guys a basket case and he admitted everything six months of illicit passion said he was planning to leave jean for becky and he let jean know it howd she react calmly they had a nice chat and she told him she loved him was committed to him please give it some thought lets get some counseling et cetera did they no a month later beckys dead and theres no reason for anyone to make a connection a nut hacking her up the way i see it its just like you said jean and coburg searched for a nut who could be manipulated to hack her up and came up with hewitt both of them had ties to him what was jeffers tie she was his therapist before transferring him to becky supposedly because of a heavy workload she told me becky was the only therapist he had adeline says no jeffers definitely treated him and mary chin jeffers secretary confirms it twiceaweek sessions sometimes more for at least three or four months before becky took over we cant find any therapy notes no doubt jeffers destroyed them but that only makes it look worse for her i said she made a point of telling me she didnt do therapy anymore another mind game why didnt the fact that she was working with hewitt ever come out after beckys murder the hand went over his face we didnt ask and no one volunteered why would they everyone saw it as psycho kills girl and we killed the psycho no one suspected a damn thing none of the staffers at the center or dick jeffers hes pretty freaked out now coming to grips with the monster hes been living with says hes willing to testify against her whether or not he sticks with that remains to be seen an affair i said so goddamned mundane jean sleeps with coburg for five years but becky gets the death penalty typical psychopathic thinking the ego out of control you hurt me i kill you yeah he said drinking and licking his lips so tell me specifically how would you get a nut like hewitt to kill id pick someone with strong paranoid tendencies whose fantasies got violent when he was off his medicine then id get him off his medicine either by convincing him to stop taking it or by substituting a placebo and try to get as much control as i could over his psyche as he deteriorated maybe use some ageregression techniques hypnosis or free association bring him back to his childhood get him to confront the helplessness of childhood to feel it the pain the rage the screams he said i nodded thats probably why they taped him they got him to scream out his pain played it back for him you remember how hard it was to listen to can you imagine a schizophrenic dealing with that meanwhile theyre also teaching him about bad love evil shrinks indoctrinating him telling him hes been a victim and insinuating becky into the delusion as a majorleague evil shrink the purveyor of bad love they continue to increase his paranoia by praising him for it convincing him hes some kind of soldier on a mission get becky then they transfer him to her but ill bet jean continued to see him on the side prepping him directing him backed up by coburg another authority figure for hewitt and the beauty of it is even if hewitt hadnt been killed at the scene and had talked who would have believed him he was crazy thats about the way i had it he said but hearing you organize it that way helps its not hard evidence i know but the circumstantial case is building up bit by bit the das going to let coburgs attorney know how extensively jeffers is ratting him out then offer a deal no death penalty in return for coburg ratting on jeffers over becky my bet is coburg takes it well get both of them poor becky yeah guess how she and dick got started jean had becky over for dinner supervisorstudent rapport and all that eyes across the fried chicken a couple of knee nudges next day becky and dick are at a motel mrs basille said she thought becky had a new beau becky wouldnt talk about it which led mrs basille to suspect it was someone she wouldnt have approved of what she called a loser beckyd gone with married men before guys who promised to get divorced but never did dick was exactly her type married and disabled what does disabled have to do with it becky had a thing for guys with problems wounded birds jeffers missing leg meshed nicely with that hes missing a leg thats what the limp is he wears a prosthesis beckys dad was diabetic lost some of his limbs jesus he smoked so maybe there is something to this psychology stuff huh i thought about becky basille trapped in a locked room with a madman everything jean and coburg did was part of the ritual like forging beckys therapy notes and scripting them to make it seem becky was having an affair with hewitt in addition to diverting us once more to gritz it added insult to injury by humiliating becky as if that could undo the humiliation beckyd caused jean he stubbed out his cigar speaking of gritz i think i found him once i realized coburg and jeffers were probably using him as a distraction i figured the poor suckers life expectancy wasnt too great and started to call around at morgues long beach has someone who fits his description perfectly multiple stab wounds and ligature around the neck a guitar string the next elvis id check coburgs guitar case del hardy already did coburgs got a bunch of guitars and a phase shifter and other recording stuff in one of the cases was a set of brandnew strings missing the low e the other interesting things that came up were a mans shirt too small to be coburgs torn up and used for a rag still stinking of booze and an old corrective school attendance roster with nineteen seventythree ripped out small shirt i said gritz was a little man he nodded and a client of the law center coburg had gotten him off a theft thing too couple of months ago any indication he ever knew hewitt no poor guy i said they probably lured him with notions of being a recording star let him play with the guitars and the gizmos make a demo thats why he talked about getting rich then they killed him and used him as a red herring no family connections the perfect victim where was the body found near the harbor naked no id quite a bit worse for wear hed been in one of their coolers with a john doe toe tag they figure hes been dead anywhere from four days to a week right around the time you called jeffers and asked her to speak to me you said she thought she recognized my name when i got there she pretended it was because of the casa de los niños case but she knew it from coburgs hit list it must have shocked them their next victim in their face like that your making the connection between the bad love tape and what happened to becky someone else might have backed off but clearing the list just meant too much to coburg he couldnt let go of it so he and jean decided to stay on track and use gritz as extra insurance jeffers sends me to coburg coburg just happens to remember gritz was hewitts friend and directs me to little calcutta then just in case we still werent biting jeffers produces the therapy notes with all those references to g maybe i should have wondered jeffers made such a big deal about becky being a lousy note taker then magically these appear mrs basille said becky was a real stickler for the rules but i figured she was just out of touch there was no way to know he said these people are from another planet that lunch with jeffers i said feeling suddenly chilled she sat across from me touching my hand letting loose the tears bringing dick along was another ritual becky vanquished jean was showing off her spoils after we were finished eating she insisted on walking me to my car stood on the sidewalk misbuttoned her sweater and had to redo it probably a signal to coburg waiting somewhere across the street she stayed with me all the way to the seville tagging the car for coburg he followed me up to benedict and learned where i was hiding out he shook his head we hadnta caught them theyd probably run for office at lunch i told jeffers that i was going to santa barbara the next day to talk to katarina that got them worried id learn something maybe even bring back the school roster so they were forced to break sequence coburg beat me up there and killed katarina before me and tossed the house any idea why coburg called himself silk and merino i asked the asshole he didnt answer just smiled that creepy smile i started to walk out and then he said look it up so i did in the dictionary coburg is an old english word for imitation silk or wool enough of this my heads splitting how are you and robin doing weve been able to go back to the house anything left mostly ashes he shook his head im sorry alex i said well survive were surviving and living in the shops not bad the smallness is actually kind of comforting insurance company jerking you around as predicted let me know if i can do anything i will and when youre ready for a contractor ive got a possible for you excop does nice work relatively cheap thanks i said thanks for everything and sorry about the rental house im sure your banker didnt expect bullet holes in his walls tell him to send me the bill dont worry about it its the most exciting things ever happened to him i smiled he looked away shootout at the beverly hills corral he said i should have been there how could you have known knowings my job you offered to drive us home i turned you down i shouldnt have listened to you come on milo you did everything you could to paraphrase a friend of mine dont flog yourself he frowned tilted his glass poured ice down his gullet and crunched hows rov spike a few surface cuts the vet said bulldogs have high pain thresholds a throwback to when they were used for baiting right through the glass he shook his head little maniac must have taken a running start and gone ballistic talk about devotion you see it from time to time i said then i ordered him another coke i drove back to venice the shop was empty and robin had left a note on her workbench am had to run to the lumberyard back at pls call

magnin suit would have fetched top dollar at a vintage boutique and her pearls were real she carried a bag that matched the suit and wore a bejeweled american flag lapel pin she looked around the shop

necessary but the expenses i know how barry eats hes earned his way i smiled charming fellow yes isnt he she said but with a curious lack of passion are you sure i cant reimburse you give it to charity she thought all right thats a good idea planned parenthood always needs help she sat down i repeated my drink offer and she said its really not necessary but iced tea would be fine if you have it as i fixed the drink she inspected the shop some more when i gave her the glass she thanked me again and sipped daintily does your wife fix violins a few mostly guitars and mandolins she fixes and makes them my father played the violin quite well actually we went to the bowl every summer to hear jascha heifetz play back when you could still enjoy a civilized drive through hollywood he taught at

mother loved that the snoring barry was actually mothers she kept english bulldogs and frenchies for over fifty years did quite a bit of breeding and showing in her day and obedience training did she perimeter train him i said to avoid water oh of course she trained all her dogs she had lily ponds and a big pool and the poor things sink like stones then her back started to go and the english were too heavy for her to carry so she kept only frenchies then she got too weak even for the frenchies barry was her last little boy she imported him three years ago flew him all the way from holland a linen hankie came out of the handbag she took off her glasses and dabbed at her eyes mother passed away three weeks ago shed been ill for a while and barry was her faithful companion werent you

horses anything with fur sets him off and he swells up like a balloon as is im going to have to take a bubble bath the moment i get home or monty will be wheezing the moment he sees me she pulled something else out of the purse and gave it to me an akc pedigree sheet for van der legyhs lionel barrymore on stage a family tree that put mine to shame mrs braithwaite said isnt that noble very robin said wed love to take him good i was hoping you were nice people smiling but she took another dubious look around the shop he likes his liver snaps and his sausage sticks cheese as well of course though he doesnt seem to have any affection for edam isnt that odd his being dutch robin said well support him in the lifestyle to which hes become accustomed yeess she glanced furtively around the shop im sure hell love your new home will it be in the same location absolutely i said scooping up the dog and rubbing his tummy weve been happy there it came in a plain white envelope pressed into my hand as i walked out the shops side door spike heeling i looked up to see ruthanne wallaces kid sister bonnie tight jeans tucked into cowboy boots white blouse no bra nipples assertive she winked at me tickled my palm with her finger and ran to the curb a dark blue chevy caprice with chrome wheels and black windows was idling there blowing smoke she jumped in slammed the door and the car sped off no postmark on the envelope no lettering too thin to have anything in it but paper i slit it open with my fingernail a piece of notebook paper torn evenly in half a note on the first dear
