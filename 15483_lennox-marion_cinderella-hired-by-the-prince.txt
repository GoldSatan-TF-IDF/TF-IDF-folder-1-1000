id keep on sailing chapter one jenny lose your muffins get a life gianetta bertin known to the seaport locals as jenny gave her best friend a withering look and kept right on spooning double choc chip muffin mixture into pans seaport coffee n cakes had been crowded all morning and her muffin tray was almost bare i dont have time for lectures she told her friend severely im busy you need to have time for lectures honest jen cathy hitched herself up onto jennys prep bench and grew earnest you cant stay stuck in this hole for ever theres worse holes to be stuck in and get off my bench if charlie comes in hell sack me and i wont have a hole at all he wont cathy declared youre the best cook in seaport you hold this place up charlies treating you like dirt jen just because you dont have the energy to do anything about it i know you owe him but you could get a job and repay him some other way like how jenny shoved the tray into the oven straightened and tucked an unruly curl behind her ear her cap was supposed to hold back her mass of dark curls but they kept escaping she knew shed now have a streak of flour across her ear but did it matter what she looked like and as if in echo cathy continued look at you she declared youre gorgeous twentynine figure to die for cute as a button a woman ripe and ready for the world and here you are hidden in a shapeless white pinafore with flour on your noseyes flour on your nose jenno dont wipe it youve made it worse it doesnt matter jenny said whos looking can i get on theres customers out there there are cathy said warmly peering out through the hatch but refusing to let go of her theme you have twenty people out there all coming here for one of your yummy muffins and then heading off again for life you should be out there with them look at that guy out there for instance gorgeous or what thats what youre missing out on jen stuck in here every day jenny peered out the hatch as well and it didnt take more than a glance to see who cathy was referring to the guy looked to be in his midthirties he was a yachtieshe could tell that by his gearand he was seriously goodlooking it had been raining this morning he was wearing battered jeans saltstained boating shoes and a faded black tshirt stretched tight over a chest that looked truly impressive hed shrugged a battered souwester onto the back of his chair professional she thought after years of working in coffee n cakes she could pick the classes of boaty holding the place up were the hardcore fishermen then there were the battered old salts who ran small boats on the smell of an oily rag often living on them next there was the cool set arriving at weekends wearing gear that came out of the designer section of the nautical monthly catalogue and leaving when they realized coffee n cakes didnt sell chardonnay and finally there were the serious yachties seaport was a deep water harbour just south of sydney and it attracted yachts doing amazing journeys seaport had a great dry dock where repairs could be carried out expertly and fast so there were often one or two of these classy yachts in port this guy looked as if he was from one of these his coat looked battered but she knew the brand even from this distance it was the best like the man the guy himself also looked a bit battered but in a good way worn by the sea his tan was deep and real his eyes were crinkled as if he spent his life in the sun and his black hair was only really black at the roots the tips were sunbleached to almost fair he was definitely a professional sailor she thought giving herself a full minute to assess him and why not he was well worth assessing she knew the yachting hierarchy the owners of the big seagoing yachts tended to be middleaged or older they spent short bursts of time on their boats but left serious seafaring to paid staff this guy looked younger tougher leaner than a boatowner he looked seriously competent hed be being paid to take a yacht to where its owner wanted it to be and for a momentjust for a momentjenny let herself be consumed by a wave of envy just to go where the wind took you to walk away from seaport no thatd take effort and planning and hopeall the things she no longer cared about and there was also debt an obligation like a huge anchor chained around her waist hauling her down but her friend was thinking none of these things cathy was prodding her grinning rolling her eyes at the sheer good looks of this guy and jenny smiled and gazed a little bit more cathy was rightthis guy was definite eyecandy what was more he was munching on one of her muffinslemon and pistachio her favourite she thought in approval and then he looked up and saw her watching he grinned and raised his muffin in silent toast then chuckled as she blushed deep crimson and pushed the hatch closed cathy laughed her delight there she said in satisfaction you see whats out there hes gorgeous jen why dont you head on out and ask him if hed like another muffin as if she muttered thoroughly disconcerted she shoved her mixing bowl into the sink servings susies job im just the cook go away cathy youre messing with my serenity stuff your serenity cathy said crudely come on jen its been two years then as she saw the pain wash across jennys face she swung herself off the bench and came and hugged her i know moving on cant ever happen completely but you cant keep hiding dr matheson says im doing well jenny said stubbornly yeah hes prescribing serenity cathy said dourly honey youve had enough peace you want life even sailing you love the water but now you dont go near the sea theres so many people whod like a weekend crew like the guy out there for instance if he offered me a sail id be off for more than a weekend i dont want anything but to be left alone cathy finished for her oh enough i wont let you keep on saying it and before jenny could stop her she opened the hatch again she lifted the bell jenny used to tell susie an order was ready and rang it like there was a shipwreck in the harbour jenny made a grab for it but cathy swung away so her body protected the bell then when everyone was watching attention please she called to the room in general in the booming voice she used for running the seaport ladies yoga sessions ladies and gentlemen i know this is unusual but id like to announce a fantastic offer back here in the kitchen is the worlds best cook and the worlds best sailor jennys available as crew for anyone offering her excitement adventure and a way out of this town all she needs is a fantastic wage and a boss who appreciates her anyone interested apply right here right now cathy jenny stared at her friend in horror she made a grab for the hatch doors and tugged them shut as cathy collapsed into laughter are you out of your mind i love you sweetheart cathy said still chuckling im just trying to help getting me sacked wont help susie wont tell charlie cathy said she agrees with me dont you susie she demanded as the middleaged waitress pushed her way through the doors do we have a queue out there suse all wanting to employ our jen you shouldnt have done it susie said severely looking at jenny in concern youve embarrassed her to death theres no harm done cathy said theyre all too busy eating muffins to care but honest jen put an ad in the paper or at least start reading the situations vacant susie has a husband four kids two dogs and a farm this place is a tiny part of her life but for you this place has become your life you cant let it stay that way its all i want jenny said stubbornly serenity thats nonsense susie declared of course its nonsense cathy said jumping off the bench and heading for the door okay stage one of my quest is completed if it doesnt have an effect then ill move to stage two and that could be really scary coffee n cakes was a daytime café charlie was supposed to lock up at five but charlies life was increasingly spent in the pub so at five jenny locked up as she was starting to do most nights at least charlie hadnt heard of what had happened that morning just as well jenny thought as she turned towards home for all cathys assurances that she wouldnt be sacked she wasnt so sure charlies temper was unpredictable and she had debts to pay big debts once upon a time charlie had been a decent boss then his wife died and now loss did ghastly things to people it had to her was living in a grey fog of depression worse than spending life in an alcoholic haze how could she blame charlie when she wasnt much better herself she sighed and dug her hands deep into her jacket pockets the rain from this morning had disappeared it was warm enough but she wanted the comfort of her coat cathys behaviour had unsettled her she wouldve liked to take a walk along the harbour before she went home only in this mood it might unsettle her even more all those boats going somewhere she had debts to pay she was going nowhere excuse me the voice came from behind her she swung around and it was him the guy with the body and with the smile okay that was a dumb thing to think but she couldnt help herself the combination of ridiculously goodlooking body and a smile to die for meant it was taking everything she had not to drop her jaw it had been too long she thought no one since no dont even think about going there can i talk to you are you jenny he had an accentspanish maybe she thought and seriously sexy uh oh body of a god killer smile and a voice that was deep and lilting and gorgeous her knees felt wobbly any minute now hed have her clutching the nearest fence for support hey she was a grown woman she reminded herself sharply where was a bucket of ice when she needed one making do as best she could she tilted her chin met his gaze square on and fought for composure im jenny infuriatingly her words came out a squeak she turned them into a cough and tried again isure the lady in the café said you were interested in a job he said im looking for help can we talk about it he was here to offer her a job his eyes were doing this assessing thing while he talked she was wearing old jeans and an ancient duffel built for service rather than style was he working out where she fitted in the social scale was he working out whether she cared what she wore suddenly she found herself wishing she had something else on something with a bit ofglamour now that was crazy she was heading home to put her feet up watch the telly and go to bed what would she do with glamour he was asking her about a job yeah they all needed deckhands she thought trying to ground herself lots of big yachts came into harbour here thered be one guy in chargesomeone like this thered also be a couple of deckies but the guy in charge would be the only one paid reasonable wages by the owners deckies were to be found in most portskids looking for adventure willing to work for cheap travel theyd get to their destination and disappear to more adventure to be replaced by others did this man seriously think she might be interested in such a job my friend was having fun at my expense she said settling now she knew what he wanted still trying to firm up her knees though sorry but im a bit old to drop everything and head off into the unknown are you ever too old to do that yes she snapped before she could stop herselfand then caught herself sorry look i need to get on so youre not interested theres a noticeboard down at the yacht club she told him theres always a list of kids looking for work i already have a job you do have a job his smile had faded hed ditched his coat leaving only his jeans and tshirt they were faded and old andnice he was tall and broadshouldered he looked looselimbed casually at ease with himself and quietly confident his eyes were blue as the sea though they seemed to darken when he smiled and the crinkles round his eyes said smiling was what he normally did but suddenly he was serious if you made the muffins i ate this morning youre very very good at your job he told her if youre available as crew a mand be crazy not to take you on well im not he had her rattled and shed snapped again why he was a nice guy offering her a job sorry she said but no do you have a passport yes but im sailing for europe just as soon as i can find some company its not safe to do a solo where im going round the horn despite herself she was interested round the horn he agreed its fastest thatd be right the boaties in charge of the expensive yachts were usually at the call of owners shed met enough of them to know that an owner fancied a sailing holiday in australia hed pay a guy like this to bring his boat here and have it ready for him maybe hed join the boat on the interesting bits flying in and out at will now the owner would be back in europe and itd be up to the employed skipperthis guyto get the boat back there as soon as he could with crew but not with her well good luck she said and started to walk away but he wasnt letting her leave he walked with her its a serious offer its a serious rejection i dont take rejection kindly thats too bad she told him the days of carting your crew on board drugged to the eyeballs is over press gangs are illegal theyd make my life easier he said morosely you know im very sure they wouldnt his presence as he fell into step beside her was making her thoroughly disconcerted having a pressganged crew waking up with hangovers a day out to sea surely wouldnt make for serene sailing i dont look for serenity he said and it was so much an echo of her days thoughts that she stopped dead but this was ridiculous the idea was ridiculous serenitys important she managed forcing her feet into moving again so thank you but ive said no is there anything else you want i pay well i know what deckies earn you dont know what i pay why dont you ask im not interested do you really sail he asked curiously he wasnt going away she was quickening her steps but he was keeping up with ease she had the feeling if she broke into a run hed keep striding beside her effortlessly once upon a time i sailed she said before life got serious your life got serious how suddenly his eyes were creasing in concern he paused and before she could stop him he lifted her left hand she knew what he was looking for no ring you have a partner he demanded its none of your business yes but i want to know he said in that gorgeous accent excellent english but with that fabulous liltand there was that smile again the smile she knew could get him anything he wanted if he tried hard enough with these looks and that smile and that voice whew no he couldnt get anything from her she was impervious she had to be impervious but he was waiting for an answer maybe it wouldnt hurt to tell him enough to get him off her back im happily single she said ah but if youre saying lifes serious then youre not so happily single maybe sailing away on the next tide could be just what you want look she said tugging her hand away exasperated im not a teenager looking for adventure i have obligations here so youre offering me a trip to europe where would that leave me id get on your boat id work my butt off for passagei know you guys get your moneys worth from the kids you employand then id end up wherever it is youre going thats it i know how it works i wouldnt even have the fare home im not a backpacker mr whoeveryouare and i live here i dont know you i dont trust you and im not interested in your job my names ramón cavellero he said sounding not in the least perturbed by her outburst im very trustworthy and he smiled in a way that told her he wasnt trustworthy in the least im sailing on the marquita youve seen her had she seen her every person in seaport had seen the marquita the big yachts photograph had been on the front of their local paper when shed come into port four days ago with good reason quite simply she was the most beautiful boat jenny had ever seen and probably the most expensive if this guy was captaining the marquita then maybe he had the funds to pay a reasonable wage that was an insidious little whisper in her head but she stomped on it before it had a chance to grow there was no way she could walk away from this place not for years she had to be sensible look mr cavellero this has gone far enough she said and she turned back to face him directly you have the most beautiful boat in the harbour you can have your pick of any deckie in the marketi know a dozen kids at least who would kill to be on that boat but as for me my friend was making a joke but thats all it was thank you and goodbye she reached out and took his hand to give it a good firm handshake as if she was a woman who knew how to transact business as if she should be taken seriously he took it she shook but instead of pulling away after one brief shake she found he was holding on or maybe it was that she hadnt pulled back as shed intended his hand was strong and warm and his grip as decisive as hers or more two strong wills she thought fleetingly but more but then before she could think any further she was aware of a car sliding to a halt beside them she glanced sideways and almost groaned charlie she could sense his drunkenness from here one of these days hed be caught for drinkdriving she thought and half of her hoped itd be soon but the other half knew thatd put her boss into an even more foul mood than he normally was once upon a time hed been a nice guybut that was when he was sober and she could barely remember when hed been sober so she winced and braced herself for an explosion as charlie emerged from the car and headed towards them ramón kept on holding her hand she tugged it back and he released her but he shifted in closer charlies body language was aggressive he was a big man hed become an alcoholic bully and it showed but whatever else ramón might be it was clear he knew how to protect his own his own that was a dumb thing to think even so she was suddenly glad that he was here right now hey i want to speak to you you stupid cow lose your friend charlie spat at her jenny flinched uh oh this could mean only one thingthat one of the patrons of the café had told charlie of cathys outburst this was too small a town for such a joke to go unreported charlie had become universally disliked and the idea that one of his staff was advertising for another job would be used against him at her expense and ramóns presence here would make it worse protective or not charlie was right she needed to lose him see you later she said to ramón stepping deliberately away and turning her back on him expecting him to leave hello charlie but charlie wasnt into greetings what the hell do you think youre doing making personal announcements in my café in my time he was close to yelling shoving right into her personal space so she was forced to step backward and getting another job you walk away from me and i foreclose before the days end you know what you owe me girl you work for me for the next three years or ill have you bankrupt and your friend with you i could toss you out now your friendll lose her house great mess thatd leave her in youll work the next four weekends with no pay to make up for this or youre out on your ear what do you say to that she closed her eyes charlie was quite capable of carrying out his threats this man was capable of anything why had she ever borrowed money from him because shed been desperate that was why it had been right at the end of mattys illness shed sold everything but there was this treatment thered been a chance it was slim shed known but shed do anything shed been sobbing late at night in the back room of the café shed been working four hours a day to pay her rent the rest of the time shed spent with matty cathy had found her there and charlie came in and found them both hed loan her the money he said and the offer was so extraordinary both women had been rendered almost speechless jenny could repay it over five years hed told them by working for half wages at the café only he needed security in case you decide to do a runner shed never do a runner cathy had said incensed when mattys well shell settle down and live happily ever after i dont believe in happy ever after charlie had said i need security ill pledge my apartment that shell repay you cathy had said hotly i trust her even if you dont what a disaster theyd been so emotional they hadnt thought it through all jenny had wanted was to get back to the hospital to get back to matty and she didnt care how cathys generosity was all she could see so shed hugged her and accepted and didnt see the ties only ties there were matty died a month later and she was faced with five years bonded servitude cathys apartment had been left to her by her mother it was pretty and neat and looked out over the harbour cathy was an artist she lived hand to mouth and her apartment was all she had even cathy hadnt realised how real the danger of foreclosure was jenny thought dully cathy had barely glanced at the loan documents she had total faith in her friend to repay her loan of course she had so now there was no choice jenny dug her hands deep into her pockets she bit back angry words as shed bitten them back many times before and she nodded okay im sorry charlie of course ill do the weekends hey from behind them came ramóns voice laced with surprise and the beginnings of anger what is this four weekends to pay for two minutes of amusement its none of your business charlie said shortly get lost if youre talking about what happened at the café i was there it was a joke i dont do jokes butt out and shell do the weekends she has no choice and then he smiled a drunken smile that made her shiver so theres the joke he jeered on you woman not me and that was that he stared defiance at ramón but ramón it seemed was not interested in a fight he gazed blankly back at him and then watched wordlessly as charlie swung himself unsteadily back into his car and weaved off into the distance leaving silence how to explain what had just happened jenny thought and decided she couldnt she took a few tentative steps away hoping ramón would leave her to her misery he didnt instead he looked thoughtfully at the receding car then flipped open his cellphone and spoke a few sharp words he snapped it shut and walked after jenny catching up and once again falling into step beside her how much do you owe him he asked bluntly she looked across at him startled sorry you heard how much i dont believe that its any of my business he finished for her your boss just told me that but as your future employer i can make it my business youre not my future employer just tell me jenny he said and his voice was suddenly so concerned so warm so laced with caring that to her astonishment she found herself telling him just blurting out the figure almost as if it didnt matter he thought about it for a moment as they kept walking thats not so much he said cautiously to you maybe she retorted but to me my best friend signed over her apartment as security if i dont pay then she loses her home you could get another job you dont have to be beholden to this swinebag you could transfer the whole loan to the bank i dont think you realise just how broke i am she snapped and then she shook her head still astounded at how she was reacting to him sorry theres no need for me to be angry with you when youre being nice im tired and im upset and ive got myself into a financial mess the truth is that i dont even have enough funds to miss a weeks work while i look for something else and no bank will take me on or cathy either for that mattershes a struggling painter and has nothing but her apartment so there you go thats why i work for charlie its also why i cant drop everything and sail away with you if you knew how much id love to would you love to he was studying her intently the concern was still there but there was something more it was as if he was trying to make her out his brow was furrowed in concentration would you really how good a sailor are you that was a weird question but it was better than talking about her debts so she told him that too why not i was born and bred on the water she told him my dad built a yacht and we sailed it together until he died in the last few years of his life we lived on board my legs are more at home at sea than on land yet youre a cook theres nothing like spending your life in a cramped galley to make you lust after proper cooking she gave a wry smile temporarily distracted from her bleakness my mum died early so she couldnt teach me but i longed to cook when i was seventeen i got an apprenticeship with the local baker i had to force dad to keep the boat in port during my shifts and your boat what was she a twentyfive footer fibreglass called wind trader flamingo if you know that class she wasnt anything special but we loved her sold now to pay debts he asked bluntly how did you know she said crashing back to earth and before you ask i have a gambling problem now why dont i believe that why would you believe anything i tell you she took a deep breath look this is dumb im wrecked and i need to go home can we forget we had this conversation it was crazy to tell you my troubles and i surely dont expect you to do anything about them but thank you for letting me talk she hesitated then for some reason it was really hard to walk away from this man but she had no choice goodbye mr cavellero she managed thank you for thinking of me as a potential deckhand it was very nice of you and you know what if i didnt have this debt id be half tempted to take it on once more she turned away she walked about ten steps but then his voice called her back jenny she should have just kept on walking but there was something in his voice that stopped her it was the concern again he sounded as if he really cared that was crazy but the sensation was insidious like a siren song forcing her to turn around yes he was standing where shed left him just standing behind him down the end of the street she could see the harbour that was where he belonged she thought he was a man of the sea he looked a man from the sea whereas she jenny ill pay your debts he said she didnt move she didnt say anything she didnt know what to say this isnt charity he said quickly as she felt her colour rise its a proposition i dont understand its a very sketchy proposition he told her ive not had time to work out the details so we may have to smooth it off round the edges but essentially ill pay your boss out if you promise to come and work with me for a year youll be two deckies instead of onecrew when i need it and cook for the rest of the time sometimes youll be run off your feet but mostly not ill also add a living allowance he said and he mentioned a sum that made her feel winded youll be living on the boat so that should be sufficient he told her seemingly ignoring her amazement then at the end of the year ill organise you a flight home from wherever marquita ends up so how about it jenny and there was that smile again flashing out to warm parts of her she hadnt known had been cold will you stay here as charlies unpaid slave or will you come with me cook your cakes on my boat and see the world what do you say marquitas waiting jenny come sail away its three years debt she gasped finally was he mad not to me its one years salary for a competent cook and sailor and its what im offering your owner could never give the authority to pay those kind of wages he hesitated for a momentfor just a momentbut then he smiled my owner doesnt interfere with how i run my boat he told her my owner knows if iif he pays peanuts he gets monkeys i want good and loyal crew and with you i believe id be getting it you dont even know me and youre out of your mind do you know how many deckies you could get with that money i dont want deckies i want you and then as she kept right on staring he amended what had been a really forceful statement if you can cook the muffins i had this morning youll make my lifeand everyone else who comes onto the boata lot more pleasant who does the cooking now she was still fighting for breath what an offer me or a deckie he said ruefully not a lot of class idid be expected to cook for the owner yes dinner parties theres not a lot of dinner parties on board the marquita he said sounding a bit more rueful the owners pretty much like me a retiring soul you dont look like a retiring soul she retorted caught by the sudden flash of laughter in those blue eyes retiring or not i still need a cook whoa to be a cook on a boat with this man then she caught herself for a moment shed allowed herself to be sucked in to think what if what if she sailed away only shed jumped like this once before and where had it got her matty and all the heartbreak that went with him her thoughts must have shown on her face what is it ramón asked and his smile suddenly faded hey jenny dont look like that theres no strings attached to this offer i swear you wont find yourself the seventeenth member of my harem chained up for my convenience in the hold i can even give you character references if you want im extremely honourable he was trying to make her smile she did smile but it was a wavery smile im sure youre honourable she saiddespite the laughter lurking behind his amazing eyes suggesting he was nothing of the kindbut references or not i still dont know you deep breath be sensible sorry she managed its an amazing offer but i took a loan from charlie when i wasnt thinking straight and look where that got me and there have beenother timeswhen i havent thought straight either and troubles followed so i dont act on impulse any more ive learned to be sensible thank you for your offer mr cavellero ramón mr cavellero she said stubbornly with the wages youre offering i know youll find just the crew youre looking for no problem at all so thank you again and goodnight then before she could let her treacherous heart do any more impulse urgingbefore she could be as stupid as shed been in the pastshe turned resolutely away she walked straight ahead and she didnt look back chapter two her heart told her she was stupid all the way home her head told her she was right her head addressed her heart with severity this was a totally ridiculous proposition she didnt know this man shed be jumping from the frying pan into the fire she told herself to be indebted to a stranger then sail away into the unknown he could be a white slave trader she knew he wasnt take a risk her heart was commanding her but then her heart had let her down before she wasnt going down that road again so somehow she summoned the dignity to keep on walking think about it ramón called after her and she almost hesitated she almost turned back only she was a sensible woman now not some dumb teenager whod jump on the nearest boat and head off to sea so she walked on round the next corner and the next past where charlie lived a police car was pulled up beside charlies front door and charlie hadnt made it inside her boss was being breathalysed hed be way over the alcohol limit hed lose his licence for sure she thought back and remembered ramón lifting his cellphone had he whoa she scuttled past feeling like a guilty rabbit ramón had done it not her charlie would guess charlie would never forgive her uh oh uh oh uh oh by the time she got home she felt as if shed forgotten to breathe she raced up the steps into her little rented apartment and she slammed the door behind her what had ramón done charlie without his driving licence charlie thinking it was her fault but suddenly she wasnt thinking about charlie she was thinking about ramón numbly she crossed to the curtains and drew them aside just checking just in case hed followed he hadnt and she was aware of a weird stab of disappointment well what did you expect she told herself i told him press gangs dont work what if they did what if he came up here in the dead of night drugged her and carted her off to sea what if she woke on his beautiful yacht far away from this place id be chained to the sink down in the galley she told herself with an attempt at humour nursing a hangover from the drugs he used to get me there but oh to be on that boat hed offered to pay all her bills get her away from charlie what was she about even beginning to think about such a crazy offer if he was giving her so much money then hed be expecting something other than the work a deckie did but a man like ramón wouldnt have to pay she thought her mind flashing to the nubile young backpackers she knew would jump at the chance to be crew to ramón theyd probably jump at the chance to be anything else so why did he want her did he have a thing for older women she stared into the mirror and what she saw there almost made her smile itd be a kinky man whod desire her like she was her hair was still flourstreaked from the day shed been working in a hot kitchen and shed been washing up over steaming sinks she didnt have a spot of makeup on and her nose was shiny very shiny her clothes were ancient and nondescript and her eyes were shadowed from lack of sleep oh she had plenty of time for sleep but where was sleep when you needed it shed stopped taking the pills her doctor prescribed she was trying desperately to move on but how what better way than to take a chance she whispered to her image charlies going to be unbearable to work with now and ramóns gorgeous and he seems really nice his boats fabulous hes not going to chain me to the galley im sure of it she even managed a smile at that if he does i wont be able to help him with the sails hed have to unchain me a couple of times a day at least and id be at sea at sea so maybemaybe her heart and head were doing battle but her heart was suddenly in the ascendancy it was trying to convince her it could be sensible as well wait she told herself severely she ran a bath and wallowed and let her mind drift pros and cons pros and cons if it didnt work she could get off the boat at new zealand hed demand his money back so shed then owe money to ramón instead of to charlie and thered be no threat to cathys apartment the debt would be hers and hers alone that felt okay sensible even she felt a prickle of pure excitement as she closed her eyes and sank as deep as she could into the warm water to sail away with ramón her eyes flew open shed been stupid once one gorgeous sailor andmatty so im not that stupid she told herself i can take precautions before i go before she went this wasnt turning out to be a relaxing bath she sat bolt upright in the bath and thought what am i thinking she was definitely thinking of going you told him where to go to find deckies she said out loud hell have asked someone else by now no so get up get dressed and go down to that boat right now before you chicken out and change your mind youre nuts so what can happen thats worse than being stuck here she told herself and got out of the bath and saw her very pink body in the mirror pink the sight was somehow a surprise for the last two years shed been feeling grey shed been concentrating on simply putting one foot after another and sometimes even that was an effort and nowsuddenly she felt pink so go down to the docks knock on the hatch of ramóns wonderful boat and sayyes please i want to come with you even if you are a white slave trader even if i may be doing the stupidest thing of my life jumping from the frying pan into the fire maybe but crazy or not i want to jump she told the mirror and she would youre a fool she told her reflection and her reflection agreed yes but youre not a grey fool just do it what crazy impulse had him offering a woman passage on his boat a needy woman a woman who looked as if she might cling she was right he needed a couple of deckies kids whod enjoy the voyage and head off into the unknown as soon as he reached the next port then he could find more but he was tired of kids hed been starting to think hed prefer to sail alone only marquita wasnt a yacht to sail by himself she was big and oldfashioned and her sails were heavy and complicated in good weather one man might manage her but ramón didnt head into good weather he didnt look for storms but he didnt shy away from them either the trip back around the horn would be long and tough and hed hardly make it before he was due to return to bangladesh hed been looking forward to the challenge but at the same time not looking forward to the complications crew could bring the episode in the café this morning had made him act on impulse the womanjennylooked light years from the kids he generally employed she looked warm and homely and mature she also looked as if she might have a sense of humour and what was more she could cook he could make a rather stodgy form of paella he could cook a steak often the kids he employed couldnt even do that he was ever so slightly over paella which was why the taste of jennys muffins the cosiness of her café the look of her with a smudge of flour over her left ear had him throwing caution to the winds and offering her a job and then when hed realised just where that bully of a boss had her hed thrown in paying off her loan for good measure sensible no shed looked at him as if she suspected him of buying her for his harem and he didnt blame her it was just as well she hadnt accepted he told himself move on it was time to eat maybe he could go out to one of the dockside hotels he didnt feel like it his encounter with jenny had left him feeling strangely flatas if hed seen something he wanted but he couldnt have it that made him sound like his uncle iván he thought ruefully iván crown prince of cepheus arrogance personified why was he thinking of iván now he was really off balance he gave himself a fast mental shake and forced himself to go back to considering dinner even if he didnt go out to eat he should eat fresh food while in port he retrieved steak a tomato and lettuce from the refrigerator a representation of the height of his culinary skill dinner then bed or he could wander up to the yacht club and check the noticeboard for deckies the sooner he found a crew the sooner he could leave and suddenly he was eager to leave why had the woman disturbed him she had nothing to do with him he didnt need to regard jennys refusal as a loss hello for a moment he thought he was imagining things but his black mood lifted just like that as he abandoned his steak and made his way swiftly up to the deck he wasnt imagining things jenny was on the jetty looking almost as hed last seen her but cleaner she was still in her battered coat and jeans but the flour was gone and her curls were damp from washing she looked nervous jenny he said and he couldnt disguise the pleasure in his voice nor did he want to something inside him was very pleased to see her again extremely pleased i just i just came out for a walk she said great he said charlie was arrested for drinkdriving really that wouldnt have anything to do with you who me he demanded innocence personified would you like to come on board iyes she said and stepped quickly onto the deck as if she was afraid he might rescind his invitation and suddenly her nerves seemed to be gone she gazed around in unmistakable awe wow wow was right ramón had no trouble agreeing with jenny there marquita was a gracious old lady of the sea built sixty years ago a wooden schooner crafted by boat builders who knew their trade and loved what they were doing her hull and cabins were painted white but the timbers of her deck and her trimmings were left unpainted oiled to a warm honey sheen brass fittings glittered in the evening light and above their heads marquitas vast oak masts swayed majestically matching the faint swell of the incoming tide marquita was a hundred feet of tradition and pure unashamed luxury ramón had fallen in love with her the moment hed seen her and he watched jennys face now and saw exactly the same response what a restoration she breathed shes exquisite now that was different almost everyone who saw this boat looked at ramón and said she must have cost a fortune jenny wasnt thinking money she was thinking beauty beauty there was a word worth lingering on he watched the delight in jennys eyes as she gazed around the deck taking in every detail and he thought it wasnt only his boat that was beautiful jenny was almost as goldenskinned as he was indeed she could be mistaken for having the same mediterranean heritage she was small and compact neat he thought and then thought no make that cute exceedingly cute and smart her green eyes were bright with intelligence and interest he thought he was right about the humour as well she looked like a woman who could smile but she wasnt smiling now she was too awed can i see below she breathed of course he said and hed hardly got the words out before she was heading down he smiled and followed a man could get jealous this was one beautiful woman taking not the slightest interest in him she was totally entranced by his boat he followed her down into the main salon but was brought up short shed stopped on the bottom step drawing breath seemingly awed into silence he didnt say anything just waited this was the moment for people to gush in truth there was much to gush about the rich oak wainscoting the burnished timber the soft worn leather of the deep settees the wonderful colours and fabrics of the furnishing the silks and velvets of the cushions and curtains deep crimsons and dark blues splashed with touches of bright sunlit gold when ramón had bought this boat just after the accident that had claimed his mother and sister shed been little more than a hull hed spent time care and love on her renovation and his aunt sofía had helped as well in truth maybe sofías additions were a little over the top but he loved sofía and he wasnt about to reject her offerings the result was pure comfort pure luxury he loved the marquitaand right now he loved jennys reaction she was totally entranced moving slowly around the salon taking in every detail this was the main room the bedrooms were beyond if she was interested hed show her those too but she wasnt finished here yet she prowled like a small cat inspecting each tiny part of a new territory her fingers brushed the burnished timber lightly almost reverently she crossed to the galley and examined the taps the sink the stove the attachments used to hold things steady in a storm she bent to examine the additional safety features on the stove gas stoves on boats could be lethal not his she opened the cupboard below the sink and proceeded to check out the plumbing he found he was smiling enjoying her awe enjoying her eye for detail she glanced up from where she was inspecting the valves below the sink and caught him smiling and flushed im sorry but its just so interesting is it okay to look its more than okay he assured her ive never had someone gasp at my plumbing before she didnt return his smile this pump she breathed ive seen one in a catalogue youve got them all through the boat there are three bathrooms he told her trying not to sound smug all pumped on the same system you have three bathrooms she almost choked my father didnt hold with plumbing he said real sailors used buckets i gather your owner isnt a bucket man no he agreed gravely my owner definitely isnt a bucket man she did smile then but she was still on the prowl she crossed to the navigation desk examining charts checking the navigation instruments looking at the radio still seeming awed then you leave your radio off i only use it for outgoing calls your owner doesnt mind with a boat like this id imagine hed be checking on you daily your owner now was the time to say he was the owner this was his boat but jenny was starting to relax becoming companionable friendly ramón had seen enough of other womens reactions when they realised the level of his wealth for some reason he didnt want that reaction from jenny not yet not now my owner and i are in accord he said gravely we keep in contact when we need to how lucky she said softly to have a boss who doesnt spend his life breathing down your neck and then she went right on prowling he watched growing more fascinated by the moment hed had boat fanatics on board beforeof course he hadand most of them had checked out his equipment with care others had commented with envy on the luxury of his fittings and furnishings but jenny was seeing the whole thing she was assessing the boat and he knew a part of her was also assessing him in her role as possible hired hand yes he thought starting to feel optimistic she was now under the impression that his owner trusted him absolutely and such a reference was obviously doing him no harm if he wanted her trust such a reference was a great way to start finally she turned back to him and her awe had been replaced by a level of satisfaction as if shed seen a work of art that had touched a chord deep within i guess nows the time to say isnt she gorgeous she said and she smiled again only its not a question she just is i know she is he said he liked her smile it was just what it should be lighting her face from within she didnt smile enough he thought he thought suddenly of the women he worked with in bangladesh jenny was light years away from their desperate situations but there was still that shadow behind her smile as if shed learned the hard way that she couldnt trust the world would you like to see the rest of her he asked suddenly unsure where to take this a tiny niggle was starting in the back of his head take this further and there would be trouble it was too late hed asked yes please thoughit seems an intrusion its a pleasure he said and he meant it then he thought hey hed made his bed this morning there was a bonus his cabin practically looked neat he took her to the second bedroom first the cabin where sofía had really had her way hed restored marquita in the months after his mothers and sisters death and sofía had poured all her concern into furnishings you spend half your life living on the floor in mud huts in the middle of nowhere shed scolded your grandmothers money means were both rich beyond our dreams so theres no reason why you should sleep on the floor here there was certainly no need now for him or anyone else on this boat to sleep on the floor hed kept a rein on his own room but in this the second cabin hed let sofía have her way he opened the door and jenny stared in stunned amazementand then burst out laughing its a boudoir she stammered its harem country hey he said struggling to sound serious even offended but he found he was smiling as well sofía had indeed gone over the top shed made a special trip to marrakesh and shed furnished the cabin like a sheikhs boudoir boudoir who knew whatever it was that sheikhs had the bed was massive eight feet round curtained with burgundy drapes and piled with quilts and pillows of purple and gold the carpet was thick as grass a muted pink that fitted beautifully with the furnishings of the bed sofía had tied in crisp pure white linen and matched the whites with silk hangings of sea scenes on the walls the glass windows were open while the marquita was in port and the curtains blew softly in the breeze the room was luxurious yet totally inviting and utterly utterly gorgeous this is where youd sleep ramón told jenny and she turned and stared at him as if he had two heads me the deckie there are bunkrooms below he said but i dont see why we shouldnt be comfortable this is harem country you dont like it i love it she confessed eyes huge whats not to love but as for sleeping in it the owner doesnt mind no where do you sleep she demanded you cant give me the best cabin this isnt the best cabin youre kidding me right he smiled and led the way back down the companionway opened another door ushered her in hed decorated this room sofía had added a couple of touchesactually sofía had spoken to his plumber so the bathroom was a touchwell a touch embarrassingbut the rest was his it was bigger than the stateroom hed offered jenny the bed here was huge but he didnt have hangings it was more masculine done in muted tones of the colours through the rest of the boat the sunlit yellows and golds of the salon had been extended here with only faint touches of the crimson and blues the carpet here was blue as well but short and functional there were two amazing paintings on the wall recognizable paintings jenny gasped with shock please tell me theyre not real okay theyre not real they were you want to see the bathroom he asked unable to resist and he led her through then he stood back and grinned as her jaw almost hit the carpet while the marquita was being refitted hed had to return to bangladesh before the plumbing was done and sofía had decided to put her oar in here as well and sofías oar was not known as sparse and clinical plus she had this vision of him in sackcloth and ashes in bangladesh and she was determined to make the rest of his life what she termed comfortable plus she read romance novels he therefore had a massive golden bath in the shape of a botticelli shell it stood like a great marble carving in the middle of the room with carved steps up on either side sofía had made concessions to the unsteadiness of bathing at sea by putting what appeared to be vines all around in reality they were hand rails but the end result looked like a tableau from the amazon rainforest there were gold taps gold hand rails splashes of crimson and blue again there was trompe loeila massive painting that looked like realityon the wall making it appear as if the sea came right inside shed even added towels with the monogram of the royal family his grandmother had belonged to when hed returned from bangladesh hed come in here and nearly had a stroke his first reaction had been horror but sofía had been beside him so anxious she was quivering i so wanted to give you something special shed said and sofía was all the family he had and there was no way hed hurt her hed hugged her and told her he loved itand that night hed even had a bath in the thing she wasnt to know he usually used the shower down the way youyou sleep in here jenny said her bottom lip quivering not in the bath he said and grinned but where does the owner sleep she demanded ignoring his attempt at levity she was gazing around in stupefaction theres not room on his boat for another cabin like this i at need i use the bunkroom and that was a lie but suddenly he was starting to really really want to employ this woman okay he was on morally dubious ground but did it matter if she thought he was a hired hand he watched as the strain eased from her face and turned to laughter and he thought surely this woman deserved a chance at a different life if one small lie could give it to her would it make a difference if she knew the truth if he told her he was so rich the offer to pay her debts meant nothing to him how would she react with fear hed seen her face when hed offered her the job thered been an intuitive fear that he wanted her for more than her sailing and her cooking how much worse would it be if she knew he could buy and sell her a thousand times over the owner doesnt mind she demanded he gave up and went along with it the owner likes his boat to be used and enjoyed wow she breathed and looked again at the bath wow i use the shower in the shared bathroom he confessed and she chuckled what a waste youd be welcome to use this in your dreams she muttered this place is haremsrus its great he said but its still a working boat i promise you jenny theres not a hint of harem about her you swear she demanded and she fixed him with a look that said she was asking for a guarantee and he knew what that guarantee was i swear he said softly i skipper this boat and shes workmanlike she looked at him for a long long moment and what she saw finally seemed to satisfy her she gave a tiny satisfied nod and moved on you have to get her back to europe fast three months at the latest that at least was true his team started work in bangladesh then and he intended to travel with them so do you want to come youre still offering i am he ushered her back out of the cabin and closed the door the sight of that bath didnt make for businesslike discussions on any level youre not employing anyone else not if i have you you dont even know if i can sail she said astounded all over again he looked at her appraisingly the corridor here was narrow and they were too close hed like to be able to step back a bit to see her face he couldnt she was still nervous he thought like a deer caught in headlights but caught she was his offer seemed to have touched something in her that longed to respond and even the sight of that crazy bath hadnt made her back off she was just like he was he thought raised with a love of the sea aching to be out there soshe was caught all he had to do was reel her in so show me that you can sail he said show me now the winds getting up enough to make it interesting lets take her out what tonight tonight now dare you i cant she said sounding panicked why not she stared up at him as if he were a species shed never seen you just go whenever you feel like it the only thing holding us back is a couple of lines tied to bollards on the wharf he said and then as her look of panic deepened he grinned but we will bring her back tonight if thats whats worrying you its seven now we can be back in harbour by midnight you seriously expect me to sail with you now theres a great moon he said the night is ours why not so half an hour later they were sailing out through the heads heading for europe or that was what it felt like to jenny ramón was at the wheel shed gone up to the bow to tighten a stay to see if they could get a bit more tension in the jib the wind was behind them the moon was rising from the east moonlight was shimmering on the water and she was free the night was warm enough for her to take off her coat to put her bare arms out to catch a moonbeam she could let her hair stream behind her and become a bowsprite she thought an omen of good luck to sailors an omen of good luck to ramón she turned and looked back at him he was a dark shadow in the rear of the boat but she knew he was watching her from behind the wheel she was being judged so what the boat was as tightly tuned as she could make her ramón had asked her to set the sails herself shed needed help in this unfamiliar environment but hed followed her instructions rather than the other way round this boat was far bigger than anything shed sailed on but shed spent her life in a sea port talking to sailors watching the boats come in shed seen yachts like this shed watched them and shed ached to be on one shed brought matty down to the harbour and shed promised him his own boat when youre big when youre strong and suddenly she was blinking back tears that was stupid she didnt cry for matty any more it was no use he was never coming back are you okay had he seen the moonlight wasnt that strong she swiped her fist angrily across her cheeks ridding herself of the evidence of her distress and made her way slowly aft she had a lifeline clipped to her and she had to clip it and unclip it along the way she was as surefooted as a cat at sea but it didnt hurt to show him she was safety consciousand besides it gave her time to get her face in order im fine she told him as she reached him take over the wheel then he told her i need to cook dinner was this a test too she wondered did she really have sea legs cooking below deck on a heavy swell was something no one with a weak stomach could do ill do it she could you really dont get seasick i really dont get seasick a woman in a million he murmured and then he grinned but no its not fair to ask you to cook this is your night at sea and after the day youve had you deserve it take the wheel have you eaten hours ago theres steak to spare he smiled at her and wham there it was again his smile that had her heart saying beware beware beware i really am fine she said and sat and reached for the wheel and when her hand brushed hisshe could swear it was accidentalthe beware grew so loud it was a positive roar but seemingly unaware of any roaring on deck he left her and dropped down into the galley in minutes the smell of steak wafted up nothing else just steak not my choice for a lovely night at sea she thought but she wasnt complaining the rolling swell was coming in from the east she nosed the boat into the swell and the boat steadied on course she was the most beautiful boat could she really be crew she was starting to feel as if when ramón had made the offer she should have signed a contract on the spot then as he emerged from the galley bearing two plates and smiling she knew why she hadnt that smile gave her so many misgivings i cooked some for you too he said looking dubiously down at his plates if you really arent seasick i have to eat something to prove it its a true test of grit he said you eat my cooking then i know you have a cast iron stomach he sat down beside her and handed her a plate she looked down at it supermarket steak she thought and not a good cut she poked it with a fork and it didnt give you have to be polite he said otherwise my feelings will be hurt get ready for your feelings to be hurt taste it at least she released the wheel fought the steak for a bit and then said can we put her on automatic pilot this is going to take some work hey im your host he said sounding offended and im a cook how long did you fry this i dont know twenty minutes maybe i needed to check the charts to remind myself of the lights for harbour reentry so your steak cooked away on its own while you concentrated on other things whats wrong with that id tell you she said darkly stabbing at her steak and finally managing to saw off a piece manfully chewing and then swallowing only youre right youre my host id like to be your employer will you be cook on the marquita whoa so much for concentrating on steak this then was when she had to commit to craziness or not to lifeor not you meanyou really were serious with your offer im always serious it was a serious offer it is a serious offer youd only have to pay me a years salary i could maybe organise something but she knew she couldnt and he knew it too his response was immediate the offer is to settle your debts and sail away with you debt free that or nothing that sounds like something out of a romance novel hero on white charger rescuing heroine from villain im no wimpy heroine he grinned you sound just like my aunt sofía she reads them too but no i never said you were wimpy i never thought you were wimpy id repay no he said strongly and took her plate away from her and set it down he took her hands then strong hands gripping hers so she felt the strength of him the sureness and the authority authority this was a man used to getting his own way she thought suddenly breathless and once more came the fleeting thought i should run there was nowhere to run if she said yes thered be nowhere to run for a year you will not repay he growled a deals a deal jenny you will be my crew you will be my cook ill ask nothing more this was serious too serious she didnt want to think about the implications behind those words and maybe she didnt want that promise ill ask nothing more hed said her debt was insignificant maybe it was to him to her it was an insurmountable burden she had her pride but maybe it was time to swallow it stand aside and let him play hero thank you she said trying to sound meek jenny yes im captain he said but i will not tolerate subordination subordination its my english he apologised sounding suddenly very spanish as in captains say to their crew i will not tolerate insubordination just before they give them a hundred lashes and toss them in the brink whats the brink i have no idea he confessed im sure the marquita doesnt have one which is what im telling you whereas most captains wont tolerate insubordination i am the opposite if youd like to argue all the way around the horn its fine by me you want me to argue she was too close to him she thought and he was still holding her hands the sensation was worrying worryingly good though not worryingly bad arguing with this guy all the way round the horn yes i will also expect muffins he said and she almost groaned really take it or leave it he said muffins and insubordination yes or no she stared up at him in the moonlight he stared straight back at her and she felt her heart do this strange surge as if her fuellines had just been doubled what am i getting into she demanded of herself but suddenly she didnt care the night was warm the boat was lovely and this man was holding her hands looking down at her in the moonlight and his hands were imparting strength and sureness and promise promise what was he promising she was being fanciful but she had to be careful she told herself fiercely she must it was too late yes she said before she could change her mindand she was committed she was heading to the other side of the world with a man shed met less than a day ago was she out of her mind what had he done what was he getting himself into hed be spending three months at sea with a woman called jenny jenny what jenny who he knew nothing about her other than she sailed and she cooked he spent more time on background checks for the deckies he employed he always ran a fast check on the kids he employed to ensure there werent skeletons in the closet that would come bursting out the minute he was out of sight of land and he didnt employ them for a year the deal was always that theyd work for him until the next port and then make a mutual decision as to whether they wanted to go on hed employed jenny for a year he wasnt going to be on the boat for a year had he thought that through no so hed better think it through now be honest should he say jenny i made the offer because i felt sorry for you and there was no way youd have accepted my offer of a loan if you knew im only offering three months work he wasnt going to say that because it wasnt true hed made the offer for far more complicated reasons than sympathy and that was what was messing with his head now in three months hed be in bangladesh did he need to go to bangladesh in truth he didnt need to go anywhere his family inheritance had been massive hed invested it with care and if he wished he could spend the rest of his life in idle luxury onlyhis family had never been like that excluded from the royal family ramóns grandmother had set about making herself useful the royal family of cepheus was known for indolence mindless indulgence even cruelty his grandmother had left the royal palace in fear for good reason but then shed started making herself a lifegiving life to others so she and her children ramóns father and aunt had set up a charity in bangladesh they built homes in the low lying delta regions houses that could be raised as flood levels rose homes that could keep a community safe and dry ramón had been introduced to it early and found the concept fascinating his fathers death had made him even more determined to stay away from royalty to make a useful life for himself so at seventeen hed apprenticed himself to one of cepheuss top builders hed learned skills from the ground up now it wasnt just money he was throwing at this projectit was his hands as well as his heart during the wet season he couldnt build during these months he used to stay on the island he still called home spending time with his mother and sister hed also spent it planning investments so the work they were doing could go on for ever but then his mother and his sister died one drunken driver and his family was wiped out suddenly he couldnt bear to go home he employed a team of top people to take over his familys financial empire and hed bought the marquita he still worked in bangladeshhandson was great hard manual work which drove away the demons but for the rest of the year he pitted himself against the sea and felt better for it but there was a gaping hole where his family had been a hole he could never fill nor did he want to he decided after a year or so if it hurt so much to loseto get close to someone again seemed stupid so why ask jenny onto his boat he knew instinctively that closeness was a very real risk with this woman but it was as if another part of him a part he didnt know existed had emerged and done the asking hed have to explain bangladesh to her or would he when he got to cepheus he could simply say there was no need for the boat the owner wanted her in dry dock for six months jenny was free to fly back to australiahed pay her fareand she could fill the rest of her contract six months later thatd mean he had crew not only for now but for the future as well a crew of one woman this was danger territory the ramón he knew well the ramón he trusted was screaming a warning no he could be sensible this was a big enough boat for him to keep his own counsel hed learned to do that from years of sailing with deckies the kids found him aloof he knew but aloof was good aloof meant you didnt open yourself to gutwrenching pain aloof meant you didnt invite a woman like jenny to sail around the world with you a shame that he just had the marquitas reported as having left fiji two weeks ago we think ramóns in australia for heavens sake sofía pushed herself up on her cushions and stared at the lawyer perplexed whats he doing in australia who would know the lawyer said with asperity hes left no travel plans he could hardly expect this awfulness sofía retorted theres never been a thought that ramón could inherit well it makes life difficult for us the lawyer snapped he doesnt even answer incoming radio calls ramóns been a loner since his mother and sister died sofía said and she sighed it affected me deeply so who knows how it affected him if he wants to be alone who are we to stop him he cant be alone any longer the lawyer said im flying out to australia yes isnt australia rather big sofía said cautiously i mean i dont want to discourage you but if you flew to perth and he ended up at darwin ive read about australia and it does sound a little larger than cepheus i believe the smallest of its states is bigger than cepheus the lawyer agreed but if hes coming from fiji hell be heading for the east coast we have people looking out for him at every major port if i wait in sydney i can be with him in hours rather than days you dont think we could wait until he makes contact sofía said he does email me eventually he needs to take the throne by the end of the month or carlos inherits carlos sofía said and her face crumpled in distress oh dear so you see the hurry the lawyer said if im in australia as soon as we locate his boat i can be there he has to come home now i wish we could find him before i make a decision about philippe she said oh dear i thought youd found foster parents for him yes butit seems wrong to send him away from the palace what would ramón do do you think i hardly think prince ramón will wish to be bothered with a child no sofía said sadly maybe youre right there are so many things ramón will be bothered with nowhow can he want a say in the future of a child he doesnt know he wont send the child to foster parents yes sofía said sadly i dont know how to raise a child myself hes had enough of hired nannies i think its best for everyone chapter three this was really really foolish she was allowing an unknown spaniard to pay her debts and sweep her off in his fabulous yacht to the other side of the world she was so appalled at herself she couldnt stop grinning watching cathys face had been a highlight i cant let you do it shed said in horror i know i joked about it but i never dreamed youd take me seriously you know nothing about him this is awful and jenny had nodded solemn agreement it is awful if i turn up in some arabic harem on the other side of the world its all your fault she told her friend you pointed him out to me no jenny i never would have no shed chuckled and relented okay i wont make you come and rescue me i know this is a risk my love but honestly he seems nice i dont think theres a harem but even if there isim a big girl and i take responsibility for my own decision i know its playing with fire but honestly cathy you were right im out of here any way i can and what a way sailing out of the harbour on board the marquita with ramón at the helm was like something out of a fairy tale fairy tales didnt include scrubbing decks though she conceded ruefully there was enough of reality to keep her groundedor as grounded as one could be at sea six days later jenny was on her knees swishing a scrubbing brush like a true deckhand theyd been visited by a flock of terns at dawnpossibly the last theyd see until they neared land again she certainly hoped so the deck was a mess but making her feel a whole lot better about scrubbing was the fact that ramón was on his knees scrubbing as well that didnt fit the fairy tale either knight on white charger scrubbing bird droppings she glanced over and found he was watching her he caught her grin and he grinned back not exactly the romantic ideal of sailing into the sunset he said and it was so much what shed been thinking that she laughed she sat back on her heels put her face up to the sun and soaked it in the marquita was on autopilot safe enough in weather like this there was a light breezeenough to make marquita slip gracefully through the water like a skier on a downhill run on land it would be hot but out here on the ocean it was just plain fabulous jenny was wearing shorts and tshirt and nothing else her feet were bare her hair was scrunched up in a ponytail to keep it out of her eyes her nose was white with sunscreenand she was perfectly gloriously happy youre supposed to complain ramón said watching her any deckie ive ever employed would be complaining by now what on earth would i be complaining about scrubbing maybe id scrub from here to china if i could stay on this boat she said happily and then saw his expression and hastily changed her mind no i didnt mean that you keep right on thinking im working hard for my money but honestly you have the best job in the world ramón cavellero and i have the second best i do dont i he said but his smile faded and something about him said he had shadows too did she want to ask maybe not shed known ramón for over a week now and shed learned a lot in that time shed learned he was a wonderful sailor intuitive clever and careful he took no unnecessary risks yet on the second night out thered been a storm a nervous sailor might have reefed in everything and sat it out ramón however had looked at the charts altered his course and let the jib stay at full stretch the marquita had flown across the water with a speed jenny found unbelievable and when the dawn came and the storm abated they were maybe three hundred miles further towards new zealand than theyd otherwise have been shed taken a turn at the wheel that night but she knew ramón hadnt slept shed been conscious of his shadowy presence below aware of what the boat was doing aware of how she was handling her it wasnt that he didnt trust her but she was new crew and to sleep in such a storm while she had such responsibility might have been dangerous his competence pleased her as did the fact that he hadnt told her he was checking on her lots of things about him pleased her she admittedbut ramón kept himself to himself any thoughts she may have had of being an addition to his harem were quickly squashed once they were at sea he was reserved to the point of being aloof how long have you skippered this boat she asked suddenly getting back to scrubbing not looking up she was learning that he responded better that way talking easily as they worked together once work stopped he retreated again into silence ten years he said wow you must have been at kindergarten when you were first employed i got lucky he said brusquely and she thought dont go there shed asked a couple of things about the owner and shed learned quickly that was the way to stop a conversation dead so how many crews would you have employed in that time she asked and then she frowned down at what she was scrubbing how on earth had the birds managed to soil under the rim of the forward hatch she tried to imagine and couldnt how longs a piece of string ramón said i get new people at every port but you have me for a year thats right i have he said and she glanced up and caught a flash of something that might be satisfaction she smiled and went back to scrubbing unaccountably pleased that sounds like you liked my lunch time paella i loved your lunch time paella where did you learn to cook something so magnificently spanish im part spanish she said and he stopped scrubbing and stared spanish well truthfully im all australian she said but my father was spanish he moved to australia when he met my mother my mothers mother was spanish as well papà came as an adventuring young man he contacted my grandmother as a family friend and the rest is history so ramón said slowly sounding dazed habla usted español can you speak spanish sí she said and tried not to sound smug i dont believe it theres no end to my talents she agreed and grinned and then peered under the hatch speaking of talent how did these birds do this they must have lain on their sides and aimed its a competition between them and me ramón said darkly they dont like my boat looking beautiful all i can do is sail so far out to sea they cant reach me butyou have a spanish background why didnt you tell me you never asked she said and then she hesitated theres lots you didnt ask and your offer seemed so amazing i saw no reason to mess it with detail i could have told you i play a mean game of netball i can climb trees i have my bronze surf lifesaving certificate and i can play waltzing matilda on a gum leaf you didnt ask and how could i tell you you might have thought i was skiting skiting making myself out to be miss wonderful i seem to have employed miss wonderful regardless he said and then jenny mmm no i mean what sort of spanish parents call their daughter jenny its gianetta gianetta he said it with slow lilting pleasure and he said it the way it was supposed to sound the way her parents had said it she blinked and then she thought no actually the way ramón said it wasnt the way her parents had said it he had the pronunciation right but it was much much better he rolled it he almost growled it and it sounded so sexy her toes started to curl i would have found out when you signed your contract ramón was saying while she attempted a bit of toe uncurling then he smiled speaking of which maybe its time you did sign up i dont want to let anyone who can play waltzing matilda on a gum leaf get away its a dying art she said relieved to be on safer ground in fact shed been astounded that he hadnt yet got round to making her sign any agreement the day before theyd sailed hed handed charlie a cheque how do you know you can trust me to fill my part of the bargain shed asked him stunned by what he was doing and ramón had looked down at her for a long moment his face impassive and hed given a small decisive nod i can hed said and that was that playing a gum leafs a dying art he asked now cautiously its something i need to teach my grandchildren she told him and then she heard what shed said grandchildren the void always threatening was suddenly right under her she hauled herself back with an effort what is it ramón said and he was looking at her with concern the void disappeared there went her toes again curling curling did he have any idea of what those eyes did to her they helped though she was back again now safe she could move on if she could focus on something other than those eyes so im assuming youre spanish too she managed no youre not spanish absolutely not you sound spanish then she hesitated here was another reason she hadnt told him about her heritageshe wasnt sure there was something else in his accent besides spain france it was a sexy mix that she couldnt quite place i come from cepheus he said and all was explained cepheus she knew it a tiny principality on the mediterranean fiercely independent and fiercely proud my father told me about cepheus she said awed that here was an echo from her childhood papà was born not so far away from the border and he went there as a boy he said its the most beautiful country in the worldbut he also said it belonged to spain if hes spanish then he would say that ramón growled if he was french hed say the same thing theyve been fighting over my country for generations like eagles over a small bird what theyve come to realize however is that the small bird has claws and knows how to protect itself for now theyve dropped ustheyve let us be we are cepheus nothing more but you speak spanish the french and the spanish have both taken part of our language and made it theirs he said and she couldnt help herself she chuckled whats funny he was suddenly practically glowering your patriotism she said refusing to be deflected like australians saying the english speak australian with a plum in their mouths its not the same he said but then he was smiling again she smiled backand wham what was it with this man she knew exactly what it was quite simply he was the most gorgeous guy shed ever met tall dark and fabulous a voice like a god rugged cleverand smiling she took a deep breath and went back to really focused scrubbing it was imperative that she scrub she was alone on a boat in the middle of the ocean with a man she was so attracted to her toes were practically ringlets and she was crew nothing more she was cook and deckhand remember it so why the debt he asked gently and she forgot about being cook and deckhand he was asking as if he cared should she tell him to mind his own business should she back away why hed been extraordinarily kind and if he wanted to ask he didnt feel like her boss and at this moment she didnt feel like a deckie maybe he even had the right to know i lost my baby she said flatly trying to make it sound as if it was history only of course she couldnt two years on it still pierced something inside her to say it matty was born with a congenital heart condition he had a series of operations each riskier than the last finally there was only one procedure left to trya procedure so new it cost the earth it was his last chance and i had to take it but of course id run out of what money i had i was working for charlie for four hours a day over the lunch time rushmatty was in hospital and i hated leaving him but i had to pay the rent so when things hit rock bottom charlie knew so charlie loaned me what i needed on the basis that i keep working on for him she scrubbed fiercely at a piece of deck that had already been scrubbed ramón didnt say anything she scrubbed a bit more thought about not saying more and then decidedwhy not say it all you need to understandid been cooking on the docks since i was seventeen and people knew my food charlies café was struggling and he needed my help to keep it afloat but the operation didnt work matty died when he was two years three months and five days old i buried him and i went back to charlies café and ive been there ever since i am so sorry ramón was sitting back on his heels and watching her she didnt look upshe couldnt she kept right on scrubbing the boat rocked gently on the swell the sun shone down on the back of her neck and she was acutely aware of his gaze so aware of his silence charlie demanded that you leave your baby for those hours in the last days of his life he said at last and she swallowed at that fighting back regret that could never fade it was our deal she hesitated youve seen the worst of charlie time was when he was a decent human being before the drink took over when he offered me a way outi only saw the money i guess i just trusted and after i borrowed the money there was no way out so where he asked in his soft lilting accent that seemed to have warmth and sincerity built into it was mattys father on the other side of the world as far as i know she said and she blinked back selfpity and found herself smiling my kieran or rather no ones kieran youre smiling he sounded incredulous as well he might yes thats stupid and yes i was really stupid enough with the scrubbingany more and shed start taking off wood she tossed her brush into the bucket and stood up leaning against the rail and letting the sun comfort her how to explain kieran my father had just died and i was bleak and miserable kieran came into port and he was justalive i met him on the wharf one night we went dancing and i fell in love only even then i knew i wasnt in love with kieran not with the person i was in love with what he represented happiness laughter life at the end of a wonderful week he sailed away and two weeks later i discovered our precautions hadnt worked i emailed him to tell him he sent me a dozen roses and a cheque for a termination the next time i emailed to tell him i was keeping our baby there was no reply theres been no reply since do you mind he said gently i mind that kieran didnt have a chance to meet his son she said it was his loss matty was wonderful she pulled herself together and managed to smile again but id imagine all mothers say that about their babies any minute now ill be tugging photographs out of my purse it would be my privilege to see them you dont mean that why would i not her smile faded she searched his face and saw only truth its okay she said disconcerted she was struggling to understand this man shed accepted this job suspecting he was another similar to kieran sailing the world to escape responsibility only the more she saw of him the more she realized there were depths she couldnt fathom she had armour now to protect herself against the likes of kieran she knew she didthat was why shed taken the job but this mans gentle sympathy and practical help were something new she tried to imagine kieran scrubbing a deck when he didnt have to and she couldnt so wheres your family she asked too abruptly and she watched his face close which was what she was coming to expect hed done this before to her simply shutting himself off from her questions she thought it was a method hed learned from years of employing casual labour setting boundaries and staying firmly behind them maybe that was reasonable she conceded just because shed stepped outside her personal boundaries it didnt mean he must sorry ill put the buckets away she said but he didnt move and neither did she i dont like talking of my family thats okay thats your right you didnt have to tell me about your son yes but i like talking about matty she said she thought about it it wasnt absolutely true or was it she only talked about matty to cathy to susie to those few people whod known him but still talking about him keeps him real she said trying to figure it out as she spoke keeping silent locks him in my heart and im scared hell shrivel i want to be able to have him out there to share him she shrugged it makes no sense but there it is your familyyou keep them where you need to have them im sorry i intruded i dont believe you could ever intrude he said so softly she could hardly hear him but my storys not so peaceful my father died when i was seven he and my grandfatherwell lets just say they didnt get on my grandfather was what might fairly be described as a wealthy thug he mistreated my grandmother appallingly and finally my father thought to put things right by instigating legal proceedings only when it looked like my father and grandmother might win my grandfathers thugs bashed himso badly he died oh ramón she whispered appalled its old history he said in a voice that told her it wasnt it still had the power to hurt nothing could ever be proved so we had to move on as best we could but my grandmother never got over it she died when i was ten and then my mother and my sister were killed in a car accident when i was little more than a teenager so thats my family or rather that was my family i have an aunt i love but thats all so you dont have a home she said softly the sea makes a wonderful mistress shes not exactly cuddly jenny retorted before she thought it through and then she heard what shed said and she could have kicked herself but it seemed her tongue was determined to keep her in trouble i mean well the sea a mistress wouldnt you rather have a real one his lips twitched youre asking why dont i have a woman i didnt mean that at all she said astounded at herself if you dont choose to but she stopped herself there she was getting into deeper water at every word and she was floundering would you rate yourself as cuddly he asked a slight smile still playing round his mouth and she felt herself colouring from the toes up shed walked straight into that one he thoroughly disconcerted her it was as if there was some sort of connection between them like an electric current that buzzed back and forth no matter how she tried to subdue it she had to subdue it ramón was her boss she had to maintain a working relationship with him for a year no no she shook her head so hard the tie came loose and her curls went flying every which way of course im not cuddly i got myself in one horrible mess with kieran and im not going down that path again thank you very much so maybe the sea is to be your partner in life too i dont want a partner she said with asperity i dont need one thank you very much youre very welcome to your sea mr cavellero but ill stick to cooking sailing and occasional scrubbing what more could a woman want it sounds like relationships for both of us are a thing of the past and then she paused she stared out over ramóns shoulder oh she put her hand up to shade her eyes oh ramón look ramón wheeled to see what she was seeing and he echoed her gasp theyd been too intent on each other to notice their surroundingsthe sea was clear to the horizon so there was no threat but suddenly there was a great black mound floating closer and closer to the marquita on the far side of the mound was another much smaller the smaller mound was gliding through the water surfacing and diving surfacing and diving the big mound lay still like a massive log threequarters submerged oh jenny gasped trying to take in what she was seeing its a whale and its calf but why why was the larger whale so still they were both staring out to starboard now ramón narrowed his eyes then swore and made his way swiftly aft he retrieved a pair of field glasses focused and swore again shes wrapped in a net he flicked off the autopilot jenny were coming about the boat was already swinging jenny dropped her buckets and moved like lightning reefing in the main with desperate haste so the boom wouldnt slam across with the wind shift even her father wouldnt have trusted her to move so fast she thought as she winched in the stays with a speed even she hadnt known was possible ramón expected the best of her and she gave it but ramón wasnt focused on her all his attention was on the whale with the sails in place she could look again at what was in front of her and what she saw she drew in her breath in distress the massive whalemaybe fifty feet long or morewas almost completely wrapped in a damaged shark net jenny had seen these nets they were set up across popular beaches to keep swimmers safe but occasionally whales swam in too close to shore and became entangled or swam into a net that had already been dislodged the net was enfolding her almost completely with a rope as thick as jennys wrist tying her from head to tail forcing her to bend as the marquita glided past jenny saw her massive pectoral fins were fastened uselessly to her sides she was rolling helplessly in the swell dead no just as she thought it the creature gave a massive shudder she was totally helpless and by her side her calf swam free but helpless as well in the shadow of her mothers entrapment dios she whispered it was the ageold plea shed learned from her mother and she heard the echo of it from ramóns lips its a humpback she said in distress the nets wrapped so tight its killing her what can we do but ramón was already moving we get the sails down and start the motor he said the sails wont give us room to manoeuvre gianetta i need your help fast he had it the sails were being reefed in almost before he finished speaking as the motor hummed seamlessly into life he pushed it into low gear so the sound was a low hum the last thing either of them wanted was to panic the whale as it was the calf was moving nervously away from them so the mother was between it and the boat if she panics theres nothing we can do jenny said grimly can we get near enough to cut they couldnt ramón edged the marquita close the big whale rolled a little the swell separated them and jenny knew they could never simply reach out and cut can we call someone she said helplessly theres whale rescue organisations maybe they could come out were too far from land ramón said its us or no one no one jenny thought as they tried one more pass it was hopeless for them to cut the net the whale had to be right beside the boat with the lurching of the swell there was no way they could steer the boat alongside and keep her there how else to help to get into the water and swim then cling and cut was far far too risky jenny was a good swimmer but its open water the jobs too big theres no way i could count on getting back into the boat ramón said and she knew he was thinking the same you would do it if you could she asked incredulous if i knew itd be effective but do you think shes going to stay still while i cut if she rolled if i was pushed under and caught as if on cue the whale rolled again her massive pectoral fins were fastened hard against her so a sideways roll was all she could do she blewa spray of water misted over jennys face but jennys face was wet anyway we cant leave her like this she whispered we have to try we do ramón said jenny are you prepared to take a risk there was no question of course okay he said reaching under the seat near the wheel and hauling out life jackets heres the plan we put these on we unfasten the life raft in case worst comes to worst and we let the authorities know whats happening we radio in our position we tell them what we intend to do and if they dont hear back from us then theyll know were sitting in a life raft in the middle of the pacific were wearing positional locators anyway we should be fine whatwhat are we intending to do jenny asked faintly pull the boat up beside the whale he said if youre brave enough she stared at him almost speechless how could he get so close and even if he did if the whale rolled youd risk the boat she gasped yes unequivocal could we be sure of rescue ill set it up so we would be he said im not risking our lives here only our boat and the cost of marine rescue marine rescue itd cost a fortune jenny were wasting time yes or no she looked out at the whale left alone shed die dreadfully agonisingly and without her her calf would slowly starve to death as well ramón was asking her to risk all she looked at him and he met her gaze levelly and calmly gianetta shes helpless he said i believe at some subliminal level shell understand were trying to help and she wont roll towards us but you know i cant guarantee that theres a small chance we may end up sitting in a lifeboat for the next few hours waiting to be winched to safety but i wont do it unless i have your agreement its not my risk gianetta its our risk our risk she thought about what he was askingwhat he was doing hed have to explain to his owner that hed lost his boat to save a whale hed lose his job at the very least maybe hed be up for massive costs for the boat and for rescue she looked at him and she saw it meant nothing he was free she thought with a sudden stab of something that could almost be jealousy there was the whale to be saved hed do what needed to be done without thinking of the future life that was all that mattered she thought suddenly and with it came an unexpected lifting of the dreariness of the last couple of years shed fought long and hard for matty shed lost but shed had him and shed loved him and shed worried about the cost later she looked out at the whale and she knew there was only one answer to give of course she said just give me a couple of minutes to stick a ration pack in the life raft if im going to float around for a day or so waiting for rescue flights then i want at least two bottles of champagne and some really good cheeses while im waiting jenny didnt have a clue what ramón intended but when she saw she was awed with his safeguards in place he stood on the highest point of the boat with a small anchorone he presumably used in shallow waters when lowering the massive main anchor would potentially damage the sea bed this anchor was light enough for a man to hold or rather for ramón to hold jenny corrected herself it still looked heavy but ramón stood with the anchor attached by a long line and he held it as if it was no weight at all while jenny nosed the boat as close to the whale as she dared ramón swung the anchor round and round in wider and wider circles and then he heaved with every ounce of strength he had the whale was maybe fifteen feet from the boat the anchor flew over the far side of her and slid down as it slid ramón was already striding aft a far more secure place to manoeuvre and he was starting to tug the rope back in cut the motor he snapped she did and finally she realized what he was doing the anchor had fallen on the far side of the whale as ramón tugged the anchor was being hauled up the whales far side its hooks caught the ropes of the net and held and suddenly ramón was reeling in the anchor with whale attached or rather the marquita was being reeled in against the whale and the massive creature was simply submitting jenny was by ramóns side in an instant pulling with him boat and whale moved closer closer still okay hold her as close as you can ramón said curtly as the whales vast body came finally within an arms length if she pulls you let go no heroics gianetta just do it but keep tension on the rope so ill know as soon as i have it free ramón had a lifeline clipped on he was leaning over the side with a massive gutting knife in his hand reaching so far jenny was sure hed fall the whale could roll this way she thought wildly and if she did he could be crushed he was supporting himself on the whale itself his legs still on the boat but leaning so far over he was holding onto the netting slicing slicing as if the danger was nothing she tugged on if the whale pulled away shed have to release her theyd lose the anchor they had this one chance please but the whale didnt move except for the steady rise and fall of the swell where jenny had to let out reel in let out reel in to try and keep ramóns base steady against her he was slicing and slicing and slicing swearing and slicing some more until suddenly the tension on jennys rope was no longer there the anchor lifted free the net around the whales midriff dislodged jenny still pulling was suddenly reeling in a mass of netting and an anchor and ramón was back in the boat pulling with her one of the whales fins was free the whale moved it a little stretching and she floated away not far twenty feet no more the whale stilled again one fin was not enough she was still trapped on the far side of her her calf nudged closer again ramón said grimly as jenny gunned the motor back into action and nosed close he was already on top of the cabin swinging the anchor rope once more if shell let us youll hit the calf she said almost to herself and then bit her tongue of all the stupid objections she knew what his answer must be its risk the calf having a headache or both of them dying no choice but he didnt need to risk as the arcs of the swinging anchor grew longer the calf moved away again as if it knew and once again ramón caught the net it took an hour maybe longer the times to catch the net getting longer as the amount of net left to cut off grew smaller but they worked on reeling her in slicing reeling her in slicing until the netting was a massive pile of rubbish on the deck ramón was saving her jenny thought dazedly as she worked on every time he leaned out he was risking his life she watched him workand she fell in love she was magnificent ramón was working feverishly slashing at the net while holding on to the rails and stretching as far as he could but every moment he did he was aware of jenny gianetta she had total control of the anchor rope somehow holding the massive whale against the side of the boat but they both knew that to hold the boat in a fixed hold would almost certainly mean capsizing what jenny had to do was to work with the swells holding the rope fast then loosening it as the whale rose and the boat swayed or the whale sank and the boat rose ramón had no room for anything but holding on to the boat and slashing but thanks to jenny he had an almost stable platform to work with tied together boat and whale represented tonnage he didnt want to think about especially as he was risking slipping between the two he wouldnt slip jenny was playing her part reading the sea watching the swell focused on the whale in case she suddenly decided to roll or pull away she didnt ramón could slash at will at the rope entrapment knowing jenny was keeping him safe he slipped once and he heard her gasp he felt her hand grip his ankle he righted himselfit was okaybut the memory of her touch stayed gianetta was watching out for him gianetta where had she come from this magical gianetta it was working jenny was scarcely breathing please please but somehow her prayers were being answered piece by piece the net was being cut away ramón was winning they were both winning the last section to be removed was the netting and the ropes trapping and tying the massive tail but catching this section was the hardest ramón threw and threw but each time the anchor slipped uselessly behind the whale and into the sea to have come so far and not save her jenny felt sick but ramón would not give up his arm must be dropping off she thought but just as she reached the point where despair took over the whale rolled she stretched and lifted her tail as far as she could within the confines of the net and in doing so she made a channel to trap the anchor line as ramón threw and her massive body edged closer to the boat ramón threw again and this time the anchor held once more jenny reeled her in and once more ramón sliced again again one last slashand the last piece of rope came loose into his hands ramón staggered back onto the deck and jenny was hauling the anchor in one last time he helped her reel it in then they stood together in the mass of tangled netting on the deck silent awed stunned as the whale finally floated free totally free the net was gone but there were still questions were they too late had she been trapped too long ramóns arm came round jennys waist and held but jenny was hardly aware of it or maybe she was but it was all part of this moment she was breathing a plea and she knew the plea was echoing in ramóns heart as well as her own please the whale was wallowing in the swell rolling up and down up and down her massive pectoral fins were free now they moved stiffly outward upward over and over while jenny and ramón held their breath and prayed the big tail swung lazily back and forth she seemed to be stretching feeling her freedom making sure the ropes were no longer there she cant have been caught all that long jenny whispered breathless with wonder look at her tail that rope was tied so tightly but theres hardly a cut she might have only just swum into it ramón said and jenny was aware that her awe was echoed in his voice his arm had tightened around her and it seemed entirely natural this was a prayer shared if it was loosened from the shore by a storm it might have only hit her a day or so ago the calf looks healthy enough the calf was back at its mothers side now nudging against her flank then it dived straight down into the deep and jenny managed a faltering smile hell be feeding she must still have milk oh ramón gianetta ramón murmured back and she knew he was feeling exactly what she was feeling awe hope wonder they might they just might have been incredibly wondrously lucky and then the big whale moved her body seemed to ripple everything flexed at once her tail her fins she rolled away almost onto her back as if to say to her calf no feeding not yet i need to figure if im okay and figure she did she swam forward in front of the boat speeding up speeding up faster faster she swam with her calf speeding after her and then just as they thought theyd lost sight of her she came sweeping back a vast majestic mass of glossy black muscle and strength and bulk then not a hundred yards from the boat she rolled again only higher so her body was half out of the water stretching arching back her pectoral fins outstretched then falling backward with a massive splash that reached them on the boat and soaked them to the skin neither of them noticed neither of them cared the whale was sinking now deep so deep that only a mass of still water on the surface showed her presence then she burst up one more time arched back once moreand she dived once more and they saw her print on the water above as she adjusted course and headed for the horizon her calf tearing after her two wild creatures returned to the deep tears were sliding uselessly down jennys face she couldnt stop them any more than she could stop smiling and she looked up at ramón and saw his smile echo hers we did it she breathed ramón we did it we did he said and he tugged her hard against him then swung her round so he was looking into her tearstained face we did it gianetta we saved our whale and you were magnificent gianetta you may be a spanishaustralian woman in name but i believe you have your nationality wrong a woman like you i believe youre worthy of being a woman of cepheus and then before she knew what he intended before she could guess anything at all he lifted her into his arms and he kissed her chapter four one moment she was gazing out at the horizon catching the last shimmer of the whales wake on the translucence of the sea the next she was being kissed as shed never been kissed in her life his hands were lifting her pulling her hard in against him so her feet barely touched the deck his body felt rockhard the muscled strength hed just displayed still at work only now directed straight at her straight with her the emotions of the rescue were all around her he was wet and wild and wonderful she was soaking as well and the dripping fabric of his shirt and hers meant their bodies seemed to cling and melt it felt right it felt meant it felt as if there was no room or sense to argue his mouth met hers again his arms tightening around her so she was locked hard against him he was so close she could feel the rapid beat of his heart her breasts were crushed against his chest her face had tilted instinctively her mouth was caught caught merged more like two parts of a whole finding their home he tugged her tighter tighter still against him moulding her lips against his she was hard against him closer closer feeling him tasting him wanting him to be a part of him seemed suddenly as natural as right as breathing to be kissed by this man was an extension of what had just happened or maybe it was more than that maybe it was an extension of the whole of the last week maybe shed wanted this from the moment shed seen him either way she certainly wasnt objecting now she heard herself give a tiny moan almost a whimper which was stupid because she didnt feel the least like whimpering she felt like shouting yes his mouth was demanding his tongue was searching for an entry his arms holding her so tightly now he must surely bruise but he couldnt hold her tight enough she was holding him right back desperate that she not be lowered desperate that this miraculous contact not be lost he felt so good he felt as if he was meant to be right here in her arms that shed been destined for this moment for ever and it had taken this long to find him he hadnt shaved this morning she could feel the stubble on his jaw she could almost taste it there was salt on his faceof course there was hed been practically submerged over and over he smelled of salt and sea and of pure testosterone he tasted of ramón ramón she heard herself whisper his name or maybe it was in her heart for how could she possibly whisper when he was kissing as if he was a man starved for a woman starved of this woman she knew so clearly what was happening and she accepted it with elation this woman was who he wanted and hed take her he wanted her she was his and he was claiming his own like the whale rolling joyously in the sea she thought dazed and almost delirious this was nature it was right it was meant she was in his arms and she wasnt letting go ramón gianetta his voice was ragged with heat and desire somehow he dragged himself back from her and held her at arms length gianetta mia if youre asking if i want you then the answers yes she said huskily and almost laughed at the look of blazing heat that came straight back at her his eyes were almost black gleaming with tenderness and want and passion but something else he wouldnt take her yet his eyes were searching ill take no woman against her will he growled you thinkyou think this is against my will she whispered as the blaze of desire became almost whitehot and she pressed herself against him forcing him to see how much this was not the case gianetta he sighed and there was laughter now as well as wonder and desire before she could respond he had her in his arms held high cradled against him almost triumphant you dont think maybe we should set the automatic pilot or something she murmured well drift the radar will tell us if were about to hit something big he said his dark eyes gleaming but it cant pick up things like jellyfish so theres a risk you want to risk death by jellyfish and come to my bed while we wait my gianetta and what was a girl to say to an invitation like that yes please she said simply and he kissed her and he held her tight and carried her down below to his bed to his arms to his pleasure she left port six days ago heading for new zealand the lawyer stared at the boat builder in consternation youre sure the marquita thats the one the guy skippering herramón i think he said his name washad her in dry dock here for a couple of days checking the hull but she sailed out on the morning tide on monday took the best cook in the bay with him too half the locals are after his blood hed better look after our jenny but the lawyer wasnt interested in ramóns staff he stood on the dock and stared out towards the harbour entrance as if he could see the marquita sailing away youre sure he was heading for auckland i am youre spanish right cepheus country the lawyer said sharply not spain but no matter how long would it take the marquita to get to auckland coupla weeks the boat builder told him cant see him hurrying i wouldnt hurry if i had a boat like the marquita and jenny aboard so if i go to auckland i guess youd meet him if its urgent its urgent the lawyer said grimly you have no idea how urgent there was no urgency about the marquita if she took a year to reach auckland it was too soon for jenny happiness was right now they could travel faster but that would mean sitting by the wheel hour after hour setting the sails to catch the slightest wind shift being sailors instead of being lovers shed never felt like this shed melted against ramóns body the morning of the whales and she felt as if shed melted permanently shed shape shifted from the jenny she once knew to the gianetta ramón loved for that was what it felt like loved for the first time in her life she felt truly beautiful truly desirableand it wasnt just for her body yes he made love to her over and over wonderful lovemaking that made her cry out in delight but more he wanted to know all about her he tugged blankets up on the deck they lay in the sun and they solved the problems of the world they watched dolphins surf in their wake they fished they compared toes to see whose little toe bent the most that might be ridiculous but there was serious stuff too ramón now knew all about her parents her life her baby she told him everything about matty she showed him pictures and he examined each of them with the air of a man being granted a privilege when matty was smiling ramón smiled she watched this big man respond to her babys smile and she felt her heart twist in a way shed never thought possible he let the boom net down off the rear deck and they surfed behind the boat and when the wind came up it felt as if they were flying they worked the sails as a team setting them so finely that they caught up on time lost when they were below lost in each others bodies he touched her and her body reacted with fire dont fall in love dont fall in love it was a mantra she said over and over in her head but she knew it was hopeless she was hopelessly lost it wouldnt last like kieran this man was a nomad a sailor of no fixed address going where the wind took him he talked little about himself she knew thered been tragedy the sister hed loved parents hed lost pain to make him shy from emotional entanglement well maybe shed learned that lesson too so savour the moment she told herself for now it was wonderful each morning she woke in ramóns arms and she thought ramón had employed her for a year when they got back to europe conceivably the owner would join them she could go back to being crew but ramón would be crew as well and the nights were long and owners never stayed aboard their boats for ever tell me about the guy who owns this boat she said two days out of auckland and she watched a shadow cross ramóns face she was starting to know him so wellshe watched him when he didnt know ithis strongly boned aquiline face his hooded eyes the smile lines the weather lines from years at sea what had suddenly caused the shadow hes rich he said shortly he trusts me what else do you need to know well whether he likes muffins for a start she said with something approaching asperity which was a bit difficult as she happened to be entwined in ramóns arms as she spoke and asperity was a bit hard to manage breathless was more like it he loves muffins ramón said hell be used to richer food than i can cook do you usually employ someone with special training he eats my cooking really she frowned and sat up in bed tugging the sheet after her shed seen enough of ramóns culinary skills to know what an extraordinary statement this was hes rich and he eats your cooking as i said hell love your muffins so when will you next see him back in europe ramón said and sighed hell have to surface then but not now not yet theres three months before we have to face the world do you think we can be happy for three months cariño and he tugged her back down to him if you keep calling me cariño she whispered are we really being paid for this he chuckled but then his smile faded once more you know it cant last my love i will need to move on of course you will she whispered but she only said it because it was the sensible dignified thing to say a girl had some pride move on she never wanted to move on if her world could stay on this boat with this man for ever she wasnt arguing at all she slept and ramón held her in his arms and tried to think of the future he didnt have to think not yet it was three months before he was due to leave the boat and return to bangladesh three months before he needed to tell jenny the truth she could stay with the boat he thought if she wanted to he always employed someone to stay on board while he was away she could take that role only that meant jenny would be in cepheus while he was in bangladesh hed told her he needed to move on it was the truth maybe she could come with him the idea hit and stayed his team always had volunteers to act as manual labour would jenny enjoy the physical demands of construction of helping make life bearable for those who had nothing maybe she would what was he thinking hed never considered taking a woman to bangladesh hed never considered that leaving a woman behind seemed unthinkable gianetta his arms tightened their hold and she curved closer in sleep he smiled and kissed the top of her head her curls were so soft maybe he could sound her out about bangladesh give it time he told himself startled by the direction his thoughts were taking him youve known her for less than two weeks was it long enough there was plenty of time after auckland it was pretty much perfect right now he thought lets not mess with perfection hed just hold this woman and hope that somehow the love hed always told himself was an illusion might miraculously become real anything was possible how do you know hell sail straight to auckland in the royal palace of cepheus sofía was holding the telephone and staring into the middle distance seeing not the magnificent suits of armour in the grand entrance but a vision of an elderly lawyer pacing anxiously on an unknown dock half a world away she could understand his anxiety things in the palace were reaching crisis point the little boy had gone into foster care yesterday philippe needed love sofía thought bleakly his neglect hereall his physical needs met but no love little affection just a series of disinterested nanniesseemed tantamount to child abuse and the country knew of it shed found him lovely foster parents but his leaving the palace was sending the wrong message to the populationas if ramón himself didnt care for the child did ramón even know about him i dont know for sure where the prince will sail the lawyer snapped but i can hope hell want to restock fast to get around the horn it makes sense for him to come here so youll wait of course ill wait what else can i do but theres less than two weeks to go sofía wailed what if hes delayed then we have catastrophe the lawyer said heavily he has to get here then he has to get back to cepheus and accept his new life and the child it doesnt matter about the child yes it does sofía thought oh ramón what are you facing they sailed into auckland harbour just after dawn jenny stood in the bow ready to jump across to shore with the lines ready to help in any way she could with berthing the marquita ramón was at the wheel she glanced back at him and had a pang of misgivings they hadnt been near land for two weeks why did it feel as if the world was waiting to crowd in how could it their plan was to restock and be gone again their idyll could continue but theyd booked a berth with the harbour master ramón had spoken to the authorities an hour ago and after that hed looked worried problem shed asked someones looking for me debt collectors shed teased but he hadnt smiled i dont have debts then who i dont know he said and his worry sounded as if it was increasing no one knows where i am conceivably the owner knows what he caught himself iyes but he wont be here i cant think that was all hed said but she could see worry building she turned and looked towards the dock shed looked at the plan the harbour master had faxed through and from here she could see the berth that had been allocated to them there was someone standing on the dock at the berth as if waiting a man in a suit it must be the owner she thought she glanced back at ramón and saw him flinch rodriguez he muttered and in the calm of the early morning she heard him swear trouble is he the boats owner no he said shortly hes legal counsel to the crown of cepheus ive met him once or twice when he had business with my grandmother if hes here i hate to imagine what he wants of me señor rodriguez was beside himself he had ten days to save a country he glanced at his watch as the marquita sailed slowly towards her berth fretting as if every second left was vital what useless display of skill was this to sail into harbour when motoring would be faster and why was the woman in the bow rather than ramón himself he needed to talk to ramón now the boat edged nearer can you catch my line the woman called and he flinched and moved backward he knew nothing about boats but it seemed she could manage without him she jumped lightly over a gap he thought was far too wide landing neatly on the dock then hauled the boat into position and made her fast as ramón tugged down the last sail good morning the woman said politely casting him a curious glance and maybe she was justified in her curiosity he was in his customary suit which he acknowledged looked out of place here the woman was in the uniform of the seafaded shorts a tshirt and nothing else she looked windblown and free momentarily he was caught by how good she looked but only for an instant his attention returned to ramón señor rodriguez ramón called to him cautious and wary you remember me yes ramón said shortly whats wrong nothings wrong the lawyer said speaking in the mix of french and spanish that formed the cepheus language as long as you come home my homes on the marquita you know that not any more its not the lawyer said your uncle and your cousin are dead as of four weeks ago youre the crown prince of cepheus there was silence jenny went on making all secure while ramón stared at the man on the dock as if hed spoken a foreign language which he had but jenny had been raised speaking spanish like a native and shed picked up french at school there were so many similarities in form shed slipped into it effortlessly now shed missed the odd word but she understood what the lawyer had said or she thought she understood what hed said crown prince of cepheus ramón it might make linguistic sense it didnt make any other sort of sense my uncles dead ramón said at last his voice without inflexion in a light plane crash four weeks ago your uncle your cousin and your cousins wife all killed only theres worse it seems your cousin wasnt really marriedhe brought the woman he called his wife home and shocked his father and the country by declaring he was married but now weve searched for proof weve found none so the child philippe who stood to be heir is illegitimate you stand next in line but if youre not home in ten days then carlos inherits carlos the look of flat shock left ramóns face replaced by anger pure and savage youre saying carlos will inherit the throne not if you come home you must see thats the only way no think about it ive thought leave the woman to tend the boat and come with me señor rodriguez said urgently we need to speak privately the womans name is gianetta ramóns anger seemed to be building i wont leave her the man cast an uninterested glance at jenny as if she was of no import which obviously was the case regardless you must come i can look after the boat jenny said trying really hard to keep up i wont leave her there was a declaration but he obviously meant it for right now certainly not for tomorrow crown prince of cepheus theres immigration ramón said i can sort my papers out she said the harbour masters office is just over there you do what you have to do on the way to wherever youre going have your discussion and then come back and tell me whats happening jenny but she was starting to add things together in her head and she wasnt liking them crown prince of cepheus i guess the marquita would be your boat then she asked flatly and she saw him flinch yes but she felt sick there you go she managed fighting for dignity the owners needs always come first ill stow the sails and make all neat then i might go for a nice long walk and let off a little steam ill see you later and ramón cast her a glance where frustration angerand maybe even a touch of envywere combined if you can of course i can she said almost cordially were on land again i can stand on my own two feet there were complications everywhere and all he could think of was jenny gianetta his woman the flash of anger hed seen when hed confessed that he did indeed own the marquita the look of betrayal shed think hed lied to her she wouldnt understand what else was going on but the lie would be there as if in flashing neon yes hed lied he needed to concentrate on the lawyer the throne of cepheus was his up until now thered never been a thought of him inheriting neither his uncle nor his cousin cristián had ever invited ramón near the palace he knew the country had been in dread of cristián becoming crown prince but there was nothing anyone could do about it cristián had solidified his inheritance by marrying and having a child the boy must be what five for him to be proved illegitimate i cant even remember the childs name he said across the lawyers stream of explanations and the lawyer cast him a reproachful glance philippe how old five he confirmed so what happens to philippe nothing the lawyer said he has no rights with his parents dead your aunt has organized foster care and if you wish to make a financial settlement on him i imagine the country will be relieved theres a certain amount of anger you mean my cousin didnt make provision for his own son your cousin and your uncle spent every drop of their personal incomes on themselves on gambling onon whatever they wished the crown itself however is very wealthy you with the fortune your grandmother left you and the crown to take care of your every need will be almost indecently rich but the child has nothing he felt sick a fiveyearold child to lose everything hed been not much older than philippe when hed lost his own father it couldnt matter it shouldnt be his problem he didnt even know the little boy ill take financial care of the child ramón said shortly but i cant drop everything i have twelve more weeks at sea and then im due in bangladesh your team already knows you wont be accompanying them this year the lawyer told him flatly leaving no room for argument and ive found an experienced yachtsman whos prepared to sail the marquita back to cepheus for you we can be on a flight tonight and even thats not soon enough then as the lawyer noticed ramóns faceand ramón was making no effort to disguise his furyhe added quickly theres mounting hysteria over the mess your uncle and cousin left and theres massive disquiet about carlos inheriting as well there might be ramón growled trying hard to stay calm ramóns distant cousin was an indolent gamester rotund corrupt and inept hed faced the court more than once but charges had been dropped because of bribery he wasnt close enough to the throne to know hes making noises that the throne should be his blustering threats against you and your aunt threats and there it was again the terror hed been raised with dont go near the throne ever if the people rise against the throne the lawyer was saying maybe that would be a good thing maybe itd be a disaster the man said and proceeded to tell him why at every word ramón felt his world disintegrate there was no getting around itthe country was in desperate need of a leader of some sort of stabilityof a crown prince so you see the lawyer said at last you have to come go back to the boat tell the womanshes your only crewwhats happening pack your bags and well head straight to the airport and there was nothing left for him but to agree to take his place in a palace that had cost his family everything tomorrow he said feeling ill tonight i will spend tonight with gianetta ramón growled and the lawyer raised his brows like that like nothing ramón snapped she deserves an explanation its not as if youre sacking her the lawyer said ive only hired one man to replace you shell still be needed she can help bring the marquita home and then you can pay her off ive already paid her then theres no problem the lawyer rose and so did ramón tonight tomorrow ramón snapped and looked at the mans face and managed a grim smile consider it my first royal decree book the tickets for tomorrows flights but i will not argue ramón said ive a mind to wash my hands of the whole business and take marquita straight back out to sea then at the wash of undisguised distress on the lawyers face he sighed and relented but of course i wont he said you know i wont i will return with you to cepheus ill do what i must to resolve this mess ill face carlos down but you will give me one more night chapter five she walked for four long hours and then she found an internet café and did some research by the time she returned to the boat she was tired and hungry and her anger hadnt abated one bit ramón was the crown prince of cepheus what sort of dangerous mess had she walked into shed slept with a prince logically it shouldnt make one whit of difference that he was royal but it did and she felt used and stupid and very much like a starstruck teenager all that was needed was the paparazzi images of headlines flashed through her headcrown prince of cepheus takes stupid naive australian loverand as she neared the boat she couldnt help casting a furtive glance over her shoulder to check the thought had no foundation it didntof course it didnt there was only ramón kneeling on the deck calmly sealing the ends of new ropes he glanced up and saw her coming he smiled a welcome but she was too sick at heart to smile back for a few wonderful days shed let herself believe this smile could be for her she felt besmirched ive just come back to get my things she said flatly before he had a chance to speak youre leaving his eyes were calmly appraising of course im leaving to go where ill see if i can get a temporary job here as soon as i can get back to australia ill organize some way of repaying the loan theres no need for you to repay theres every need she flashed wanting to stamp her foot wanting quite badly to cry you think i want to be in your debt for one minute more than i must ive read about you on the internet now it doesnt matter whether anyone died or not you were a prince already does that make a difference he asked still watchful and his very calmness added to her distress of course it does ive been going to bed with a prince she wailed and the couple on board their cruiser in the next berth choked on their lunch time martinis but ramón didnt notice he had eyes only for her you went to bed with me he said softly not with a prince you are a prince im just ramón gianetta dont gianetta me she snapped thats your bedroom we slept in not the owners here i was thinking we were doing something illicit werent we he demanded and a glint of humour returned to his dark eyes it was your bed all along she wailed and then finally she made a grab at composure the couple on the next boat were likely to lose their eyes they were out on stalks dignity she told herself desperately please so i own the boat he said yes im a prince what more do you know of me apparently very little she said bitterly i seem to have told you my whole life story it appears youve only told me about two minutes of yours apparently youre wealthy fabulously wealthy and youre royal the internet bio was sketchy but you spend your time either on this boat or fronting some charity organisation i do more than that but she was past hearing she was past wanting to hear she felt humiliated to her socks and one fact stood out above all the rest shed never really known him so when you saw me you thought heres a little more charity she threw at him anger making her almost incoherent ill take this povertystricken flourstreaked muffinmaker and show her a nice time a flourstreaked muffinmaker he said and infuriatingly the laughter was back i guess if you want to describe yourself as that okay fine i rescued the muffinmaker and we did have a nice time no but she wasnt going there she was not being sucked into that smile ever again im leaving she said and she swung herself down onto the deck she was heading below but ramón was before her blocking her path jenny youre still contracted to take my boat to cepheus you dont need me you signed a contract yesterday as i rememberand it was you who wanted it signed before we came into port his hands were on her shoulders forcing her to meet his gaze and her anger was suddenly matched with his so youve been on the internet do you understand why i have to return and she did understand sort of shed read and read and read it seems your uncle and cousin are dead she said flatly theres a huge scandal because it seems your cousin wasnt married after all so his little son cant inherit so you get to be crown prince even now she couldnt believe she was saying it crown prince it was like some appalling twisted fairy tale kiss a frog have him turn into a prince she wanted her frog back i dont have a choice in this he said harshly you need to believe that before she could stop him he put the back of his hand against her cheek and ran it down to her lips a touch so sensuous that it made a shiver run right down to her toes but there was anger behind the touchand there was alsoregret gianetta for you to go of course im going she managed and i need to let you go he said and there was a depth of sadness behind his words that she couldnt begin to understand but still i want you to take my boat home selfish or not i want to see you again where was dignity when she needed it his touch had sucked all the anger out of her she wanted to hold on to this man and cling what was she thinking no this man was royalty and hed lied to her she had to find sense im grabbing my things she said shortly fighting for some semblance of calm ill be in touch about the money i swear i wont owe you for any longer than absolutely necessary theres no need to repay there is she snapped i pay my debts even if theyre to princes can you stop calling me a prince its what you are and its not new its not like this titles a shock to you yes you seem to have inherited the crown and thats surprised you but you were born a prince and you didnt tell me you didnt ask right she said fury building again she shoved his hands away and headed below whether he liked it or not ramón followed her and stood watching as she flung her gear into her carryall dignity was nowhere the only thing she could cling to was her anger so jenny you think i should have introduced myself as prince ramón he asked at last and the anger was still there he was angry what did that make her nothing she thought bleakly how could he be angry at her she felt like shrivelling into a small ball and sobbing but she had to get away from here first you know what matters most she demanded trying desperately to sort her thoughts into some sort of sense that you didnt tell me you owned the boat maybe you didnt lie outright but you had plenty of opportunities to tell me and you didnt thats a lie in my books would you have got on my boat if you thought i was the owner there was only one answer to that if hed asked her and shed known he was wealthy enough to afford such a boathis wealth would have terrified her no she admitted so i wanted you to come with me bully for you and i did cling to the anger she told herself it was all there was if he was angry she should be more so she headed into the bathroom to grab her toiletries i came on board and we made love and it was all very nice she threw over her shoulder now youve had your fun and you can go back to your life being a prince isnt my life no gianetta jenny jenny then he conceded and the underlying anger in his voice intensified i want you to listen im listening she said shoving toiletries together with venom jenny my grandfather was the crown prince of cepheus i know that what you dont know he snapped is that he was an arrogant cruel womanizer jenny i need you to understand this my grandfathers marriage to my grandmother was an arranged one and he treated her dreadfully when my father was ten my grandmother fell in love with a servant and who can blame her but my grandfather banished her and the younger children to a tiny island off the coast of cepheus he kept his oldest son my uncle at the palace but my grandmother my father and my aunt were never allowed back my grandmother was royal in her own right she had money of her own and all her life she ached to undo some of the appalling things my grandfather did but when she triedwell thats when my father died and now to be forced to go back im sorry you dont like it she said stiffly what was he explaining this for it had nothing to do with her but your country needs you at least now youll be doing something useful is that what you think he demanded sounding stunned that i spend my life doing nothing isnt that the best job in the world she could feel the vibrations of his anger and it fed hers hed known he was a prince the internet bio says youre aligned to some sort of charity in bangladesh she said shortly i guess you cant be all bad thanks think nothing of it she said and she thought where did she go from here away her head told her harshly and coldly she needed to leave right now and she would but there were obligations this man had got her out of a hole hed paid her debts she owed him deception or not okay ill be the first to admit i know nothing of your life she said stiffly i felt like i knew you and now i realize i dont that hurts but i do need to thank you for paying my debt for getting me away from charlie but now im justscared so ill just get out of your life and let you get on with it youre scared what do you think theres no threat thered only be a threat if you were my woman that was enough to take her breath away if you were my woman whichwhich im not she managed no he said and there was bleakness as well as anger there now she closed her eyes so what else had she expected these two weeks had been a fairy tale nothing more move on jenny i have to do this he said harshly understand it or not this is what im faced with if i dont take the throne then it goes to my fathers cousins son carlos carlos is as bad as my grandfather hed bring the country to ruin and then theres the child hes five god knows he raked his hair with quiet despair i will accept this responsibility i must even if it means walking away from what i most care about and then there was silence stretching towards infinity where only emptiness beckoned what he most cared about his boat his charity work what she couldnt think of what she couldnt think what she wanted what to be im sorry ramón she whispered at last im sorry too he said he sighed and dug his hands deep into his pockets seemingly moving on for whats between us needs to be put aside for the sanity of both of us but gianettajenny what will you do in new zealand make muffins her fury from his perceived betrayal was oozing away now but there was nothing in its place except an aching void yesterday had seemed so wonderful today her sailor had turned into a prince and her bubble of euphoria was gone make muffins until you can afford to go back to australia i dont have a lot of choice there is señor rodriguez the lawyer you met this morning has already found someone prepared to skipper the marquitato bring her to cepheus ive already met him hes a scottish australian gordon exmerchant navy hes competent solid and i know i can trust him withwith my boat but he will need crew so im asking you to stay on im asking you if youll sail round the horn with him and bring the marquita home if you do that ill fly you back to australia debt discharged it wouldnt be discharged i believe it would he said heavily im asking you to sail round the horn with someone you dont know and im asking you to trust that ill keep my word thats enough of a request to make paying out your debt more than reasonable i dont want to do you want to go back to cooking muffins he spread his hands and he managed a smile then his wonderful sexy insinuating smile that had the power to warm every last part of her and at least this way youll get to see cepheus even if its only for a couple of days before you fly home and youll have sailed around the horn you wanted to see the world give yourself a chance to see a little of it he hesitated and jenny maybewe can have tonight that made her gasp after all that stood between themwhat was he suggesting that she spend one more night as the royal mistress are you crazy so not tonight his eyes grew bleak no im sorry gianetta you and me i concede its impossible but what is possible is that you remain on board the marquita as crew you allow me to continue employing you so youll walk away at the end of three months beholden to nobody no the word should have been shouted at him she should walk away right now but to walk away for ever how could she do that and if she stayed on board maybe a sliver of hope remained hope for what a cinderella happy ending what a joke ramón himself had said it was impossible but to walk away from this boat as well as from this mancinders had fled at midnight maybe cinders had more resolution than she did ill come back to the boat in the morning she whispered if the new skipper wants to employ me and i think hes a man i can be at sea with for three months hes nothing like me ramón said gently almost bleakly hes reliable and steady and not a prince he gave a wintry smile no gianetta hes not a prince then it might be possible i hope it will be possible no guarantees she said you feel betrayed of course i do she whispered i need to go now the bleakness intensified he nodded as you say go my gianetta before i forget myself ive learned this day that my lifes not my own but first and before she could guess what he was about he made two swift strides across the room took her shoulders in a grip of iron and kissed her and such a kiss it was fierce it was possessive it held anger and passion and desire it was no kiss of farewell it was a kiss that was all about his need his desire his ache to hold her to him for this night and for longer still he was hungry for her she thought bewildered she didnt know how real that hunger was but when he finally put her away from him when she finally broke free she thought he was hurting as much as she was but hunger changed nothing she thought bleakly there was nothing left to say he stood silently by as she grabbed her carryall and walked away her eyes shimmering with unshed tears he didnt try to stop her he was her ramón she thought bleakly but he wasnt her prince he watched her go walking along the docks carrying her holdall her shoulders slumped her body language that of someone weary beyond belief he felt as if hed betrayed her so what to do go after her lift her bodily into his arms take her to cepheus how could he there were threats from carlos the lawyer was talking of the possibility of armed insurrection against the throne had it truly become so bad his father had died because he hadnt realized the power of royalty how could he drag a woman into this mess it would be hard enough keeping himself afloat let alone supporting anyone else how could he be a part of it himselfa royal family that had destroyed his family jennys figure was growing smaller in the distance she wasnt pausingshe wasnt looking back he felt ill so can we leave tonight he looked back and the lawyer was standing about twenty feet from the boat calmly watching i asked them to hold seats on tonights flight as well as tomorrow you have some nerve the countrys desperate the lawyer said simply nothings been heard from you carlos is starting to act as if hes the new crown prince and his actions are provocative delay on your part may well mean bloodshed i dont want to leave her he said simply and turned backbut shed turned a corner and was gone i think the lady has left you the lawyer said gently which leaves you free to begin to govern your country so the flight tonight your highness fine ramón said heavily and went to pack but fine was the last thing he was feeling his flight left that evening he looked down from the plane and saw the boats in auckland harbour the marquita was down there with her new skipper on board he couldnt make her out among so many she was already dwindling to nothing as the plane rose and turned away from land would jenny join her tomorrow he thought bleakly would she come to cepheus he turned from the window with a silent oath it shouldnt matter what was between them was finished whether she broke her contract or notthere was nothing he could offer her jenny was on her own as was he his throne was waiting for him and two days later the marquita slipped its moorings and sailed out of auckland harbourwith jenny still on board as she watched the harbour fade into the distance she felt all the doubts reassemble themselves gordon her new skipper seemed respectful of her silence and he let her be she was about to sail around the horn once upon a time that prospect would have filled her with adrenalinloaded excitement now she was simply fulfilling a contract before she went home chapter six ramóns introduction to royal life was overwhelming he walked into chaos he walked into a life he knew nothing about there were problems everywhere but hed been back in cepheus for less than a day before the plight of philippe caught him and held on his first meeting the lawyers introduction to the little boy was brief this is philippe philippe his cousins son the little boy who should be crown prince but for the trifling matter of a lack of wedding vows philippe whod had the royal surname until a month ago and was now not entitled to use it the little boy looked like the child ramón remembered being philippes pale face and huge eyes hinted that he was suffering as ramón had suffered when his own father died and as he met him for the first time he felt his gut wrench with remembered pain hed come to see for himself what hed been toldthat the little boy was in the best care possible señor rodriguez performed the introductions consuela and ernesto were philippes foster parents farmers who lived fifteen minutes drive from the palace the three were clearly nervous of what this meeting meant but philippe had been well trained i am pleased to meet you the little boy said in a stilted little voice that spoke of rote learning and little else he held out a thin little arm so his hand could be shaken and ramón felt him flinch as he took it in his philippes foster mother a buxom farmers wife exuding goodhearted friendliness didnt seem intimidated by ramóns title or maybe she was but her concern for philippe came first weve been hearing good things about you she told ramón scooping her charge into her arms so he could be on eye level with ramón ending the formality with this decisive gesture this dumplings been fearful of meeting you she told him but ernesto and i are telling him he should think of you as his big cousin a friend isnt that right your highness she met ramóns gaze almost defiantly and ramón could see immediately why sofía had chosen consuela as philippes foster mother the image of a mother hen prepared to battle any odds for her chick was unmistakable philippes homesick for the palace she said now almost aggressively and he misses his cat you have a cat ramón asked yes philippe whispered there are many cats at the palace señor rodriguez said repressively from beside them and ramón sighed what was it with adults hang on he was an adult surely he could do something about this he must but he wasnt taking him back to the palace memories were flooding back as he watched philippe memories of himself as a child he vaguely remembered someone explaining that his grandmother wanted to return to the palace and his father would organize itor maybe that explanation had come later what he did remember was his father leading him into the vast grand entrance of the palace ramón clutching his fathers hand as the splendour threatened to overwhelm him theres nothing to be afraid of its time you met your grandfather and your uncle his father had told him his mother had said later that the decision to take him had been made because surely the prince cant refuse his grandchild a little boy who looks just like him but his mother had been wrong not only had he been refused some time in the night while ramón lay in scared solitude in a room far too grand for a child somehow some time his father had died he remembered not sleeping all night and the next morning he remembered his grandfather his icy voice laced with indifference to both his sons death and his grandsons solitary grief snarling at the servants pack him up and get him out of here hed ordered pack him up and get him out of here it was a dreadful decree but how much worse would it have been if the crown prince had ordered him to stay as he was being ordered to stay now not philippe though philippe was free if he could just be made happy with that freedom tell me about your cat he asked trying a smile and philippe swallowed and swallowed again and made a manful effort to respond hes little he whispered the other cats fight him and hes not very strong something bit his ear papà doesnt permit me to take him inside so he lives in the stables but he comes when i call him hes orange with a white nose are there many orange cats with white noses at the palace ramón asked and for some reason the image of jenny was with him strongly urging him on the little boy shook his head bebes the only one hes my friend he tilted his chin obviously searching for courage for a confession sometimes i take a little fish from the kitchen when no ones looking bebe likes fish so he shouldnt be hard to find ramón glanced at consuela and ernesto questioningly this place was a farm surely one cat we like cats consuela said guessing where he was going but señor rodriguez tells us the palace cats are wild theyre used to keep the vermin down and he says no one can catch one much less tame one im sure we could tame him ernesto a wiry weathered farmer spoke almost as defiantly as his wife if you sir or your staff could try to catch him for us ill try ramón said hes called bebe you say my aunt has her cat at the palace now she understands them lets see what we can do jenny would approve he thought as he returned to the palace but he pushed the idea away this was his challenge as was every challenge in this place it was nothing to do with jenny as soon as he returned to the palace he raided the kitchens then he set off to the stables with a platter of smoked salmon he set down the saucer and waited for a little ginger cat with a torn ear to appear it took a whole three minutes bebe wasnt wild at all he stroked his ears and bebe purred he then shed ginger fur everywhere while he wrapped himself around ramóns legs and the chair legs in the palace entrance and the legs of the footman on duty jenny would laugh ramón thought but he shoved that thought away as well just do what comes next do not think of jenny bebe objectedloudlyto the ride in a crate on the passenger seat of ramóns boxster but he settled into life with philippeas if philippes been sneaking him into his bed for the last couple of years consuela told him and maybe he had after that philippe regained a little colour but he still looked haunted he missed the palace he confided as ramón tried to draw him out in a world of adults who hadnt cared the palace itself had become his stability pack him up and get him out of here it made sense ramón thought if the servants reaction to philippe was anything to go by hed be treated like illegitimate dirt in the palace and then there was his main worry or maybe it wasnt so much a worry but a cold hard certainty there was so much to be done in this country that his role as crown prince overwhelmed him he had to take it on he had no choice but in order to do it he must be clearheaded disciplined focused there was no link between love and duty in this job hed seen that spelled out with bleak cruelty his grandmother had entered the palace through love and had left it with her dreams and her family destroyed his father had tried again to enter the palace for the love of his mother and hed lost his life because of it there were threats around him now veiled threats and who knew what else besides and the knowledge settled on his heart like grey fog to stay focused on what he must do he could put no other person at risk sofìa was staying until after the coronation after that shed leave and no one would be at risk but him hed have no distractions and without them maybe just maybe he could bring this country back to the prosperity it deserved but philippe and jenny theyd get over it he told himself roughly or philippe would get over his grief and move on jenny must never be allowed to know that grief and once again he told himself harshly this was nothing to do with jenny thered never been a suggestion that they take things further nor could there be this was his life and his life only even if it was stifling this place was stifling nothing seemed to have changed since his grandfathers reign or maybe since long before lack of change didnt mean the palace had been allowed to fall into disrepair though even though his grandfather and uncle had overspent their personal fortunes the crown itself was still wealthy so pomp and splendour had been maintained furnishings were still opulent rich paintings still covered the walls the woodwork gleamed and the paintwork shone the staff looked magnificent even if their uniforms had been designed in the nineteenth century but the magnificence couldnt disguise the fact that every one of the people working in this palace went about their duties with impassive faces any attempt by ramón to penetrate their rigid facades was met with stony silence and as the weeks turned into a month and then two he couldnt make inroads into that rigidity the servantsand the countryseemed to accept him with passive indifference he might be better than what had gone before the newspapers declared but he was still royal soon the press implied hed become just like the others when he officially took his place as crown prince he could make things better for the people of this county he knew that so hed bear the opulence of the palace the lack of freedom hed bear the formality and the media attention hed cope also with the blustering threats of a still furious carlos along with the insidious sense that threats like this had killed his father hed face them down alone once philippe had recovered from his first grief surely hed be happy on the farm with consuela and ernesto and also jenny would be happy as a muffinmaker why did he even think of her why had he ever insisted that she come here it would have been easier for both of them if hed simply let her go for she was jenny he reminded himself harshly a dozen times a day she was not gianetta she was free to go wherever she willed she was jenny with the world at her feet yet he watched the marquitas progress with an anxiety that bordered on obsession and he knew that when jenny arrived he would see her one last time he must was that wise he knew it wasnt there was no place for jenny here as there was no place for philippe hed been alone for much of his adult life he could go on being alone but hed see jenny once again first sensible or not please eleven weeks and two days after setting sail from auckland the marquita sailed into cepheus harbour and found a party as they approached land every boat they passed from tiny pleasure craft to workmanlike fishing vessels was adorned in red gold and deep deep blue the flag of cepheus hung from every mast the harbour was ringed with flags there were people crowded onto the docks spilling out of harbourside restaurants every restaurant looked crammed to bursting it looked like sydney harbour on a sunny sunday multiplied by about a hundred jenny thought dazed as she made the lines ready to dock you reckon theyre here to welcome us gordon called to her and she smiled shed become very fond of gordon when shed first met him the morning after ramón had left shed been ready to walk away only his shy smile his assumption that she was coming with him and his pleasure that she was had kept her on board he reminded her of her father which helped shed been sailing with him now for almost three months hed kept his own counsel and shed kept hers and it had taken almost all those months for her emotions to settle nowapproaching the dock she was so tense she could hardly speak normally she welcomed gordons reserve but his silence was only adding to her tension there was no need for her to be tense she told herself shed had a couple of surreal weeks with royalty in true princely fashion hed rescued her from a life of making muffins and now she could get on with her life with this experience of sailing round the horn behind her and with gordons references maybe she could get another job on board a boat she could keep right on sailing while ramón see that was what she couldnt let herself think the future and ramón it had been a twoweek affair nothing more whats the occasion gordon was behind the wheel calling to people on the boat passing them but they didnt understand english or gordons broad mixed accent why the flags and decorations she called in spanish and was rewarded by comprehension are you from another planet they called incredulous everyone knows whats happening today their language was the mix of spanish and french ramón had used with the lawyer she felt almost at home no this was ramóns home not hers were from australia she called we know nothing well welcome the people raised glasses in salutation youre here just in time for what for the coronation they called its a public holiday crown prince ramón cavellero of cepheus accepts his crown today right she stood in the bow and let her hands automatically organize lines or not she didnt know what her hands were doing first thought stupidly it was that ramón wouldnt be meeting her had she ever believed he would ramón was a prince of the blood hed have moved on is that our berth gordon called and she caught herself glanced at the sheet the harbour master had faxed through and then looked ahead to where their designated berth should be and drew in her breath ramón wasnt there of course he wasnt but there was a welcoming committee there were four officials three men and a woman all in some sort of official uniform the colours of their uniform matched the colours of the flags this yacht belonged to royalty and representatives of royalty were there to meet them reckon any of them can catch a line gordon called and she tried to smile were about to find out not only could they catch a line they were efficient courteous and they took smoothly over from the time the marquita touched the dock welcome the senior official said gravely in english you are exactly on time youve been waiting for us his highness has had you tracked from the moment you left auckland hes delighted you could be here today he asks that you attend the ceremony this afternoon and the official ball this evening jenny swung around to stare at gordonwho was staring back at her they matched they both had their mouths wide open reckon we wont fit in gordon drawled at last sounding flabbergasted reckon there wont be a lot of folk wearing saltcrusted oilskins on your guest list thats why were here the official said smoothly jorge here will complete the care of the marquita while dalila and rudi are instructed to care for you if you agree well escort you to the palace youll be fitted with clothing suitable for the occasion and youll be his highnesss honoured guests at the ceremonies this afternoon and this evening jenny gasped her head was starting to explode to see ramón as a prince we cant gordon muttered but jenny looked at the elderly seaman and saw her mixture of emotions reflected on his face theyd been at sea for three months now and she knew enough of gordon to realize he stacked up lifes events and used them to fill the long stretches at sea that he lived for he was staring at the officials with a mixture of awe and dread and desire if she didnt go gordon wouldnt go and a little voice inside her breathed shed get to see ramón one last time once upon a time ramón had been her skipper once upon a time hed been her lover hed moved on now he was a crown prince shed see him today and then shed leave for the marquita to berth on the same day as his coronation was a coincidence he couldnt ignore making his resolution waver hed made the decision to send his apologies when the boat berthed for jenny to be treated with all honour paid handsomely and then escorted to the airport and given a firstclass ticket back to australia that was the sensible decision he couldnt allow himself to be diverted from his chosen path but when hed learned the marquitas date of arrival was today hed given orders before he thought it through sensible or not he would see jenny this one last time maybe he should see it as an omen he decided as he dressed maybe he was meant to have her nearby giving him strength to take this final step servants were fussing over his uniform making sure he looked every inch the ruler of cepheus and outside there was sufficient security to defend him against a small army carloss blustering threats of support from the military seemed to have no foundation on his own he had nothing to fear and on his own he must rule the last three months had cemented his determination to change this country if he must accept the crown then hed do it as it was meant to be done he could change this country for the better he could make life easier for the population the crown this ultimate position of authority had been abused for generations if anyone was to change it it must be him duty and desire had no place together he knew that and the last months assessment of the state of the country told him that his duty was here he had to stay focused he didnt need jenny but need her or not he wanted jenny at the ceremony to have her come all this way and not see heron this of all daysthat was more unthinkable than anything he would dance with her this night he thought just this once hed touch her and then hed move forward alone the doors were swinging open the master of state was waiting cepheus was waiting hed set steps in place to bring this country into the twentyfirst century he thought with grim satisfaction his coronation would cement those steps fulfilling the plans hed set in place over the last few weeks would mean this country would thrive but maybe the population would never forget the family he came from he thought as he was led in stately grandeur to the royal carriage there were no cheers no personal applause today the country was celebrating a public holiday and a continuum of history but the populace wasnt impressed by what he personally represented his grandfathers reputation came before him smirching everything royalty was something to be endured the country had celebrated the birth of a new crown prince five years ago that deception still rankled souring all philippe should be here he thought the little boy should play some part in this ceremony but out at the farm philippe was finally starting to relax with him learning again to be a little boy he still missed the palace but to bring him back seemed just as impossible as it had been three months ago philippe was now an outsider as he was himself he thought grimly glancing down at his uniform that made him seem almost ludicrously regal and the threats were there real or not he could protect philippe he would protect philippe but from a distance jenny was here for this day only sofía would be gone he could rule as he needed to rule its time your highness the head of state said in stentorian tones and ramón knew that it was it was time to accept that he was a prince of the blood with all the responsibilityand lossthat the title implied the great chorus of trumpets sounded heralding the beginning of ceremonies and jenny was sitting in a pew in the vast cathedral of cepheus feeling bewildered feeling transformed feeling like cinderella must have felt after the fairy godmother waved her wand for she wasnt at the back with the hired help she and gordon were being treated like royalty themselves the palace itself had been enough to take her breath away all spirals and turrets and battlements a medieval fantasy clinging to white stone cliffs above a sea so blue it seemed to almost merge with the sky the apartment shed been taken to within the palace had taken even more of her breath away it was as big as a small house and gordon had been shown into a similar one on the other side of the corridor corridor it was more like a great hall you could play a football match in the vast areasdecorated in gold all carvings columns and ancestral paintingsthat joined the rooms dalila had ushered her in put her holdall on a side table and instructed a maid to unpack im not staying here jenny had gasped for tonight at least dalila had said formally polite in stilted english the ball will be late the prince requires you to stay how to fight a decree like that how indeed to fight when clothes were being produced that made her gasp all over again i cant wear these you can the woman decreed if youll just stay still dolores is a dressmaker it will take her only moments to adjust these for size and jenny had simply been too overwhelmed to refuse so here she was in a pew ten seats from the front right on the aisle dressed in a crimson silk ballgown that looked as if it had been made for her it was cut low across her breasts with tiny capped sleeves the bodice clinging like a second skin curving to her hips and then flaring out to an almost full circle skirt the fabric was so beautiful it made her feel as if she was floating there was a pendant round her neck that she hoped was paste but she suspected was a diamond so big she couldnt comprehend it her hair was pinned up in a deceptively simple knot and her makeup had been applied with a skill so great that when she looked in the mirror she saw someone she didnt recognize she felt likegianetta for the first time in her life her fathers name seemed right for her im just glad they cant see me back at the sailors arms in auckland gordon muttered and she glanced at the weathered seaman who looked as classy as she did in a deep black suit that fitted him like a glove he too had been transformed like it or not she almost chuckled but then the music rose to a crescendo and she stopped thinking about chuckling she stopped thinking about anything at allanything but ramón crown prince ramón cavellero of cepheus for so he was the great doors of the cathedral had swung open the archbishop of cepheus led the way in stately procession down the aisle and ramón trod behind intent his face set in lines that said this was an occasion of such great moment that lives would change because of it he truly was a prince she thought dazed beyond belief if shed walked past him in the streetno if shed seen his picture on the cover of a magazine for this wasnt a man one passed in the street she would never have recognized him his uniform was black as night skilfully cut to mould to his tall lean frame the leggings the boots the slashes of gold the tassels the fierce sword at his side they only accentuated his aura of power and strength and purpose or then againmaybe she would have recognized him his eyes seemed to have lost their colourthey were dark as night his mouth was set and grim and it was the expression shed seen when hed known she was leaving he looked likean eagle she thought a fierce bird of prey ready to take on the world but he was still ramón he was so near her now if she put out her hand he was passing her row he was right here and as he passed his gaze shifted just a little from looking steadily ahead somehow it met hers and held for a nanosecond for a fraction that might well be imagined and then he was gone swept past in the procession and the world crowded back in he hadnt smiled but had his grimness lifted just a little he was looking for you gordon muttered awed the guy who helped me dress said he told the aides where we were to sit its like were important are you important to him then lass not in a million years she breathed shed come it was the only thing holding him steady gianetta jenny her name was in his mind like a mantra said over and over by the power vested in me he was kneeling before the archbishop and the crown was being placed on his head the weight was enormous she was here he could take this nowhere he knew that but still for now she was here on this day when he needed her most she was here and his crown was the lighter for it the night seemed to be organized for her as the throng emerged from the great cathedral an aide appeared and took her arm youre to come this way miss and you too sir he said to gordon youre official guests at the coronation dinner i reckon ill slope back down to the boat gordon muttered shrinking but jenny clutched him as if she were drowning we went round the horn together she muttered we face risk together this is worse than the horn youre telling me jenny said and the aide was ushering them forward and it was too late to escape they sat midway down a vast banquet table where it seemed half the worlds dignitaries were assembled gordon a seaman capable of facing down the worlds worst storms was practically shrinking under the table jenny was a bit braver but not much she was recognizing faces and names and her eyes grew rounder and rounder as she realized just who was here there were speechesof courseand she translated for gordon and was glad of the task it took her mind off what was happening it never took her mind off ramón he was seated at the great formal table at the head of the room gravely surveying all he looked born to the role she thought he listened with gravitas and with courtesy he paid attention to the two women on either side of himgrand dames both of them queens of their own countries i have friends back in australia who are never going to believe what ive done tonight she whispered to gordon and her skipper nodded agreement then once more the aide was beside them bending to whisper to jenny maam ive been instructed to ask if you can waltz if i can his royal highness wishes to dance with you he doesnt wish to embarrass you however so if theres a problem no she wanted to scream no but she glanced up at the head table and ramón was watching her those eagle eyes were steady i dare you his gaze was saying and more i can waltz she heard herself say her eyes not leaving ramóns excellent the aide said ill come to fetch you when were ready you do that she said faintly what have i done the entrance to the grand ballroom was made in state ramón led the procession and it was done in order of rank which meant jenny came in somewhere near the rear even that was intimidatingall the guests who hadnt been at the dinner were assembled in line to usher the dining party in if the ground opened up and swallowed her shed be truly grateful too many people were looking at her why had she agreed to dance ramón was so far ahead she couldnt see him ramón prince ramón she wasnt into fairy tales bring on midnight and gordon had deserted her as she took the aides arm as she joined the procession he suddenly wasnt there she looked wildly around and he was smiling apologetically but backing firmly away but she was being ushered forward and there was no way she could run without causing a spectacle cinderella ran she thought wildly at midnight but midnight was still a long time away courage if cinders could face them all down so could she she took a deep breath and allowed herself to be led forward the aide was ushering her into the ballroom then into an alcove near the entrance before them ramón was making a grand sweep of the room greeting everyone the heads of the royal houses of europe were his entourage nodding smiling doing what royalty did best and suddenly she realized what was happening why shed been directed to stand here she was close to the door where ramón must end his circuit she felt frozen to the spot ramón prince ramón ramón the wait was interminable she tried to focus on anything but what was happening a spot on the wax of the polished floor the hem of her gown anything but finally inevitably the aide was beside her ushering her forward and ramón was right in front of her every eye in the room was on him every eye in the room was on her she was jenny she made muffins she wanted to have hysterics or faint ramón was before her his eyes grave and questioning gianetta he said softly and every ear in the room was straining to hear youve arrived for my coronation and i thank you youve brought my boat home and thus youve linked my old life with my new can i therefore ask for the honour of this dance there was an audible gasp throughout the room it wasnt said out loud but she could hear the thought regardless who but ramón was holding out his hand waiting for her to put hers in his smiling it was the smile she loved with all her heart was this how cinders felt and then cinders was forgotten everything was forgotten she put her hand in his she tried hard to smile back and she allowed the crown prince of cepheus to lead her onto the ballroom floor where had she learned to dance ramón had been coached almost before he could walk his grandmother had thought dancing at least as important as any other form of movement he could thus waltz without thinking hed expected to slow his steps to jennys to take care she wasnt embarrassed but hed been on the dance floor less than ten seconds before he realized such precautions werent necessary he took her into his arms in the waltz hold and she melted into him as if she belonged the music swelled in an ageold wellloved waltz and she was one with the music one with him hed almost forgotten how wonderful she felt he had to be formal he told himself harshly he needed to hold her at arms lengthwhich was difficult when he was not holding her at arms length at all he needed to be courteously friendly and he needed to thank her and say goodbye only not yet not goodbye yet where did you learn to dance he managed and it was a dumb thing to say to a woman after a threemonth separation but the tension eased a little and she almost smiled dancings not reserved for royalty my papà was the best this was better there was small talk in this he should have met my grandmother yes she said and seemed to decide to let herself enjoy the music the dance the sensation of being held for a couple more circuits of the floor while the world watched and then ramón why are you doing this im sorry why did you ask me to dancefirst i wanted to thank you you paid me remember its me who should be thanking and the world is watching for you to ask me for the first dance i believe its the last dance he said and the leaden feeling settled back around his heart as the truth flooded back holding her was an illusion a fleeting taste of what could have been and all at once the pain was unbearable ive wanted to hold you for three months he said simply and it was as if the words were there and had to be said whether he willed them or not jenny maybe even saying it is unwise but wise or not ive missed you every single night he hesitated then somehow struggled back to lightness forcing the leaden ache to stay clear of his voice he couldnt pass his regret onto her he had to say goodbyeas friends do you realize how much work there is in being a crown prince i have no idea she said faintly i guesstheres speeches to make ribbons to cut that sort of thing not so much of that sort of thing his hand tightened on her waist tugging her closer wanting her closer sense decreed he had to let her go but still not yet i havent even been official crown prince until today he said fighting to make his voice sound normal ive not even been qualified as a ribboncutter until now ive been a prince in training nothing more nothing less but i have been practising my waltzing my aunt sofías seen to that so lets see if we can make the ghosts of your papà and my grandmère proud she smiled he whirled her around in his arms and she felt like thistledown he thought she felt like jenny he had to let her go he didnt feel like a prince she thought as he held her close and their bodies moved as one if she closed her eyes he felt like ramón just ramón pure and simple the man whod stolen her heart it was impossible hed said of course it was shed known it for three months and nothing had changed the world was watching she had to keep it light so its been practising speeches and waltzing she ventured at last while weve been braving the horn that and getting leggings to fit he murmured into her ear bloody things leggings id almost prefer the horn but leggings are so sexy sexy isnt leggings he said his eyes were on her and she could see exactly what he was thinking dont she whispered feeling her colour rising every eye in the room was on them ive missed you for three long months he said lightness disappearing he sounded goaded almost past breaking point ramón we had two weeks she managed it didnt mean anything he stopped dancing others had taken to the floor now but they were on the edge of the dance floor ramón and jenny had central position and they were still being watched are you saying what we had didnt mean anything to you he asked his voice sounding suddenly calm almost distant of course it did she said blushing furiously at the time ramón please can we keep dancing i dont belong here neither do i he said grimly and he took her in his arms again and slipped back into the waltz i should be leaving for bangladesh right now my teams left without me for the first time in years speeches are important she said cautiously they are the laughter and passion had completely disappeared now leaving his voice sounding flat and defeated believe it or not this country needs me its been bled dry by my grandfather and my uncle if i walk away itll continue to be bled dry by a government thats as corrupt as it is inept its not all ribboncutting its your life she said simply youre bred to it and you shouldnt be dancing with me i shouldnt be doing lots of things and ill not be told who i should be dancing with tonight i know this can only be for now but i will dance with you tonight the music was coming to an end the outside edge of the dance floor was crowded but the dancers were keeping clear of the crown prince and his partner a space was left so that as soon as the dance ended ramón could return to his royal table waiting for him were the crowned heads of europe men and women who were watching jenny as if they knew instinctively she had no place among them you have danced with me jenny said softly disengaging her hands before he realized what she intended i thank you for the honour theres no need to thank me oh but there is she said breathless the clothes this moment you ill remember it all my life she looked up into his eyes and felt an almost overwhelming urge to reach up and kiss him just a kiss just a moment to take a tiny taste of him to keep for ever but the eyes of the world were on her ramón was a prince and his world was waiting i believe there are women waiting to dance with the crown prince of cepheus she murmured we both need to move on so thank you ramón thank you for the fantasy thank you gianetta he murmured and he raised his hand and touched her cheek a feather touch that seemed a gesture of regret and loss and farewell its been my honour i will see you before you leave do you think its unwise of course its unwise he finished for her but its tonight only tomorrow i need to be wise for the rest of my life then maybe tomorrow needs to start now she said unsteadily and she managed a smile her very best peasant to royalty smile and turned and walked away leaving the crown prince of cepheus looking after her what had he said we cant take it further of course they couldnt what was she thinking of but still she felt like sobbing what was she doing here why had she ever come shed slip away like gordon she thought just as soon as the next dance started just as soon as everyone stopped watching her but someone was stepping into her path another prince the man was dark and bold and so goodlooking that if she hadnt met ramón first she would have been stunned as it was she hardly saw him may i request the honour of this dance he said and it wasnt a question his hand took hers before she could argue autocratic as ramón where did they learn this autocracy school it seemed no wasnt a word in these mens vocabularies she was being led back onto the dance floor like it or not whats needed is a bit of spine she told herself and somehow she tilted her chin fixed her smile and accepted partner after partner most of these men were seriously good dancers many of these men were seriously goodlooking men she thought briefly of cathy back in seaportjenny get a life if cathy could see her now the thought was almost enough to make her smile real if only she wasnt so aware of the eyes watching her if only she wasnt so aware of ramóns presence he was dancing with beautiful woman after beautiful woman and a couple of truly impressive royal matriarchs as well he was smiling into each of his partners eyes and each one of them was responding exactly the same they melted why would they not anyone would melt in ramóns arms and suddenly inexplicably she was thinking of matty of her little son and she wondered what she was doing here this strange creature in fancy clothes had nothing to do with who she really was and all at once what she was doing seemed a betrayal its okay she told herself feeling suddenly desperate this is simply an unbelievable moment out of my life after tonight ill return to being who i truly am this is for one night only she promised matty one night and then im back where i belong her partner was holding her closer than was appropriate sadly for him she was so caught up in her thoughts she hardly noticed ramón was dancing so close that she could almost reach out and touch him he whirled his partner round his gaze caught hers and he smiled and her partner had no chance at all that smile was so dangerous that smile sucked you in so who are your parents her partner asked and she had to blink a few times to try and get her world moving again my parents are dead she managed and yours i beg your pardon who are your parents my father is the king of morotatia her partner said in stilted english my mother was a princess in her own right before she married and i am prince marcelo pietros cornelieus maximus heir to the throne of morotatia thats wonderful she murmured i guess you dont need to work for a living then work i didnt think so she said sadly but you guys must need muffins i wonder if theres an opening around here for a kitchen maid but even as she said it she knew even that wasnt possible she had no place here this was the fairy tale and she had to go home chapter seven the night was becoming oppressive she was passed on to her next partner who gently grilled her again and then another who grilled her not so gently until she almost snapped at him finally supper was announced she could escape now she thought but then a dumpy little lady with a truly magnificent tiara made a beeline for her grasped her hands and introduced herself im ramóns aunt sofía im so pleased to meet you she tucked her arm into jennys as if she was laying claim to heras indeed she was as there were those around them who were clearly waiting to start the inquisitions again aunt sofía turned to see ramón approaching he had one of the formidable matrons on his arm queen of somewhere but sofía was not impressed go away ramón sofía commanded im taking jenny into supper you look after her highness sofía was always bossy the queen of somewhere said but she smiled and ramón gave his aunt a smile and gave jenny a quick fierce glanceone that was enough to make her toes curland led his queen away sofía must rank pretty highly jenny thought so dazed she simply allowed herself to be led the crowd parted before them sofía led them to a small alcove set with a table and truly impressive tableware she smiled at a passing servant and in two minutes there were so many delicacies before them jenny could only gasp sofía ate two bitesized cream éclairs then paused to demand why jenny wasnt doing likewise im rather in shock jenny confessed me too sofía confessed and ramón too though were making the best of it but ramóns the crown prince jenny managed how can he be intimidated she could see him through the crowd he drew every eye in the room he looked truly magnificentcrown prince to the manor born because he wasnt meant to be royal sofía said darkly but then her darkness disappeared and she smiled encouragingly at jenny just like youre not im not sure what ramóns told you so i thought maybe theres things you ought to know i know the succession was a shock jenny ventured and sofía nodded vigorously and ate another éclair yes she said definitely we were never expected to inherit ramóns grandfathermy fathersent my mother my younger brother and i out of the palace when my brother and i were tiny we were exiled and kept virtual prisoners on an island just off the coast my mother was never permitted to step back onto the mainland jenny frowned why was she being told this but she could do nothing but listen as sofía examined a meringue from all angles and decided not that sounds dreadful sofía continued moving on to a delicate chocolate praline popping it in and choosing another but in truth the island is beautiful it was only my mothers pain at what was happening to her country and at losing her elder son that hurt as we grew older my younger brother married an islandera lovely girl ramón is their son so ramóns technically a prince but until three months ago the only time he was at the palace was the night his father died there were places here she didnt want to go there were places she had no right to go to hehe spends his life on his yacht she ventured no dear only part of it and thats only since his mother and sister died he trained as a builder i think he started building things almost as soon as he could put one wooden block on top of another he spends every dry season in bangladesh building houses with floating floors apparently theyre brilliantvillagers can adjust their floor levels as flood water rises hes passionate about it but now here he is stuck as crown prince for ever i imagine he was trained for it jenny said stiffly still not sure where this was going only in that my mother insisted on teaching us court manners sofía retorted it was as if she knew that one day wed be propelled back here we humoured her though none of us ever expected that we would finally my brother tried to reinstate my mothers rights to allow her to leave the island and thats when the real tragedy started that was when ramóns father was killed yes dear by my fathers thugs sofía said her plump face creasing into distress the noise and bustle of the ballroom was nothing ignored in her apparent need to tell jenny this story my mother ached to leave and we couldnt believe my fathers vindictiveness could last for years but last it did and when my brother was old enough he mounted a legal challenge it was met with violence and with death my father invited my brother here to reason with him so he came and brought ramón with him because he thought hed introduce his little son to his grandfather so ramón was here when it happened a child sleeping alone in this dreadful place while his father was killed justalone she stared down at her chocolate but she wasnt seeing it she was obviously still stunned at the enormity of what had happened thats what royalty does she whispered what is it they say absolute power corrupts absolutely so my father had his own son killed simply because he dared to defy him we assumewe want to believe that it was simply his thugs going too far meant to frighten but taking their orders past the point of reason but still my father must have employed them and he must have known the consequences this placethe whole of royalty is tainted by that murder and now carlosthe man who would have been crown prince if ramón hadnt agreed to come homeis in the wings threatening hes here tonight she gestured towards the supper table where a big man with more medals than ramón was shovelling food into his mouth he makes threats but so quietly we cant prove anything hes here always with his unfortunate wife towed in his wake and hes just waiting for something to happen to ramón i can walk awayramón insists that i will walk awaybut ramón cant jenny was struggling to take everything in she couldnt focus on shadows of death she couldnt even begin to think of carlos and his threats she was still in fact struggling with genealogy and ramón as a little boy alone as his father died soso the crown prince whos just been killed was your older brother she managed yes sofía told her becoming calm once more not that i ever saw him after we left the palace and he had a son who also had a son she shrugged a little boy called philippe theres another tragedy but its not your tragedy dear she said as she saw jennys face nor ramóns ramón worries but then ramón worries about everything she hesitated and then forged ahead as if this was something shed rehearsed but my dear ramóns been talking about you she confessed he sayshe says youre special well i can see that i watched ramóns face as he danced with you and its exactly the same expression i saw on his fathers face when he danced with his mother if ramóns found that with you he cant possibly jenny started startled but sofía was allowing no interruptions you cant say its impossible if its already happened all im saying is that you dont have to be royal to be with ramón what im saying is give love a chance how could i she stopped bewildered by not staying in this palace sofía said suddenly deadly serious by not even thinking about it ramóns right when he tells me such a union is impossible dangerous unsuitable and he cant be distracted from what he must do you dont fit in and neither should you our real home our lovely island is less than fifteen minutes helicopter ride from here if ramón could settle you there as his mistress hed have an escape an escape she whispered stunned from royalty sofía said bluntly ramón needs to do his duty but if he could have you on the side she laid a hand over jennys it could make all the difference and hed look after you so well i know he would youd want for nothing so my dear will you listen to ramón if he asksto have me as his sometime mistress she managed im just letting you know his family would think it was a good thing sofía said refusing to be deterred by jennys obvious shock youre not to take offence but its nothing less than my duty to tell you that youre totally unsuitable for this place even if hed have you here which he wont youre not who ramón needs as a wife he needs someone who knows what royalty is and how to handle it thats what royal pedigree istheres a reason for it but as for a partner he lovesthats a different thing if ramón could have you now and then she paused finally beginning to flounder the expression on jennys face wasnt exactly encouraging she was finding it impossible to contain her anger and her humiliation so youd have him marry someone else and have me on the side she said dangerously its been done for generation upon generation sofía said with asperity then she glanced up with some relief as a stranger approached a youngish man wearing more medals than ramón but heres lord anthony wanting an introduction hes frightfully british my dear but hes a wonderful dancer ramón wont have any more time for you tonight hell have so little time but im sure he could fit you in every now and then if youll agree to the island so you go and dance with lord anthony and remember what i said when you need to remember it jenny danced almost on automatic pilot she desperately wanted to leave but slipping away when the world was watching was impossible as sofía had warned her she barely saw ramón again he was doing his duty dancing with one society dame after another shed been lucky to be squeezed in at all she thought dully what was she doing here it wasnt made better with her second girls talk of the night another woman grabbed her attention almost straight after sofía this lady was of a similar age to sofía but she was small and thin she had fewer jewels and she had the air of a frightened rabbit but she was a determined frightened rabbit she intercepted jenny between partners when the next man approached she hissed go away and stood her ground until they were left alone im perpetua she said and then as jenny looked blank she explained im carloss wife carlos the threat hes not dangerous perpetua said obviously reading her expression and she steered her into the shadows with an air of quiet but desperate determination my husbands all talk all stupidity its this place its being royal i just wanted to sayto say she took a deep breath and out it came as if it had been welled up for years they say youre common she said i meanordinary not royal like me i was a schoolteacher and i loved my work and then i met carlos for a while we were happy but then the old prince decided he liked my husband he used to take him gambling carlos got sucked into the lifestyle and thats where he stays in some sort of fantasy world where hes more royal than ramón hes done some really stupid things most of them at the princes goading in these last months when he thought he would inherit the throne hes beena little bit crazy theres nothing i can do but its so painful to see the way he is the way hes acting and then i watched you tonight the way you looked at ramón when you were dancing i dont understand jenny managed just get away from it she whispered whatever ramón says dont believe it just run oh i shouldnt say anything im a royal wife and a royal wife just shuts up do you want that to be an appendage who just shuts up my dear dont do it just run and then as yet another potential partner came to claim jennys hand she gave a gasping sob shot jenny one last despairing glance and disappeared into the crowd just run that was truly excellent advice jenny thought as she danced on on autopilot it was the best advice shed had all night if she knew where she was if she knew how to get back to the boat in the dark in the middle of a strange city that was just what shed do shed never felt so alone she was cinderella without her coach and it wasnt even midnight but finally the clock struck twelve right on cue a cluster of officials gathered round ramón as a formal guard of honour trumpets blared with a final farewell salute and the crown prince ramón of cepheus was escorted away hed be led to his harem of nubile young virgins jenny decided fighting back an almost hysterical desire to laugh or cry or both she was so weary she wanted to sink and as if the thought had been said aloud a footman was at her side courteously solicitous maam im to ask if youd like to stay on to continue dancing or would you like to be escorted back to your chambers id like to be escorted back to the yacht thats not possible maam he said the princes orders are that you stay in the palace and then as she opened her mouth to argue he added flatly theres no transport to the docks tonight im sorry maam but youll have to stay so that it seemed was that she was escorted back to the palace she lay in her ridiculously ostentatious bedchamber in her ridiculously ostentatious bed and she tried for sleep how was a girl to sleep after a night like this she couldnt her crimson ballgown was draped on a hanger in the massive walkin wardrobe the diamond necklet still lay on her dresser her cinderella slippers were on the floor beside her bed at least shed kept both of them on she thought ruefully it hadnt quite been a fairy tale only it had been a fairy tale gianetta bertinjenny to her friendshad attended a royal ball shed been led out onto the dance floor with a prince so handsome he made her knees turn to jelly for those few wonderful moments shed let herself be swept away into a magic future where practicalities disappeared and there was only ramón only her love and then his aunt had told her that she was totally unsuitable to be a royal wife but she could possibly be his mistress only not here how romantic and then someone called perpetua had warned her against royalty like the voice of doom in some gothic novel do not trust him gentle maiden how ridiculous and as if in response to her unanswerable question someone knocked on the door whod knock on her bedroom door at three in the morning who is it she quavered and her heart seemed to stop until there was a response i cant get my boots off a beloved voice complained from the other side of the door i was hoping someone might hang on while i pull i i believe my contract was all about muffins and sails she managed trying to make her voice not squeak trying to kickstart her heart again while warnings and sensible decisions went right out of the window ramón i know i have no right to ask there was suddenly seriousness behind ramóns words i know this isnt sensible i know i shouldnt be here but jenny if tonight is all there is then im sure if we read the contract carefully there might be something about boots something thatd give us an excuse forwell something about helping me for this night only dont you have a valet she whispered and then wondered how hed hear her through the door but it was as if he was already in the room with her valets scare the daylights out of me he said theyre better dressed than i am please jenny love will you help me off with my boots i dont think im brave enough you helped a trapped whale surely you can help a trapped prince for this night only ramón open the door gianetta he said in a different voice a voice that had her flinging back her bedcovers and flying to the door and tugging it open despite what sofía had said despite perpetuas grim warnings this was ramón her ramón and there he was he wasnt smiling he was justhim he opened his arms and she walked right in for a long moment she simply stood held against him feeling the strength of his heartbeat feeling his arms around her he was still in his princely uniform there were medals digging into her cheek but she wasnt complaining his heart was beating right under those medals and who cared about a bit of metal anyway who cared what two royal women had said to her who cared that this was impossible they had this night he kissed the top of her head and he held her tight and she felt protected and lovedand desperate to haul him into the room right there and then but there was a footman at the top of the stairs just standing staring woodenly ahead he was wigged powdered almost a dummy but he was real it was hard to seize a prince and haul him into her lair when a footman was on guard umwe have an audience she whispered at last he kissed her hair again and said gravely do you care if we walk into my room and shut the door we wont have an audience she tried ah but the story will out he said gravely so it should if you go creeping into strange womens bedrooms in the small hours i should yell the house down she was trying to sound indignant she was trying to pull back so she could be at arms length so she could see his face she wasnt trying hard enough she sounded happyand there was no way she was pulling back from this man you could if you wanted and youd have help he said gravely the footmans on guard duty in case the huns invadeor strange women dont want strange men doing this creeping thing you describe but if the woman was to welcome this strange man then we dont need an audience gianetta are you hungry hungry the thought was so out of left field that she blinked hungry im starving i was hoping you might come down to the kitchen with me after ive pulled your boots off yup you want me to be your servant no he said lightness giving way instantly to a gravity she found disconcerting for this night i want you to be my friend her friend the prince her friend her lover ramón parttime mistress forget sofía she told herself fiercely forget perpetua tonight shed hold on to the fairy tale soso theres no royal cook she managed there are three but they scare me more than my valet they wear white hats and speak with italian accents and say béchamel a lot oh ramón and theres no security camera in the smaller kitchen he told her and she looked up into his face and it was all she could do not to burst into spontaneous combustion so will you come his eyes dared her im coming mistress or not dangerous or not right now shed take whatever he wanted to give stupid who knew she only knew that there was no way she could walk away from this man this night slippers and robe first he suggested and she blinked pardon lets keep it nice past the footman he grinned and do your belt up really tight i like a challenge ramón second kitchen no security camera he said and gave her a gentle push back into her bedroom slippers and gown respectabilitys the thing my love all the way down the stairs they were respectable all the way down the stairs the footman watched them go his face impassive when they reached the second kitchen another footman appeared and opened the door for them he ushered them inside would you like the door closed he said deferentially and ramón nodded absolutely and make sure the huns stay on that side the huns the man said blankly you never know what theyre planning ramón said darkly if i were you id take a walk around the perimeter of the palace warn the troops your highness just give us a bit of privacy ramón said relenting at the look of confusion on the mans face fifty paces from the kitchen door agreed finally there was a smilesort ofpulled back instantly with a gasp as if the man had realized what he was doing and maybe smiling was a hanging offence impassive again he snapped his heels and moved away and ramón closed the door and leaned on it this servant things got knobs on it three months and they still treat me like a prince you are a prince not here he said not now im me and youre you and the kitchen door is closed and so and so he took her into his arms and he held her so tight the breath was crushed from her body he held her like a man drowning holding on to a lifeline he held her and held her and held her as if there was no way he could ever let her go he didnt kiss her his head rested on her hair he held her until her heart beat in synchronisation with his until she felt as if her body was merging with his becoming one until she felt as if she was truly lovedthat shed come home how long they stayed there she could never afterwards telltime disappeared this was their moment the world was somewhere outside that kitchen door the servants sofías words perpetuas warnings tomorrow but for now all that mattered was this her ramón her love the kitchen was warm an old firestove sent out a gentle heat a small grey cat slept in a basket by the hearth all jenny had seen of this palace was grandeur but here in this second kitchen the palace almost seemed a home it did feel like home ramón was holding her against his heart and she was where she truly belonged she knew it was an illusion and so must he maybe that was why he held her for so long allowing nothing no words no movement to intrude as if by holding her the world could be kept at bay as if she was something that he must lose but hed hold on while he still could finally he kissed her as she needed to be kissed as she ached to be kissed and she kissed him back as if he was truly her ramón and the royal title was nothing but a crazy fantasy locked securely on the other side of the door with the huns she thought somewhat deliriously reality and the huns were being kept at bay by powdered wigged footmen giving her this time of peace and love and bliss she loved this man with all her heart maybe what sofía had said was wrong maybe the perpetua thing was crazy the cat stirred coiling out of her basket stretching then stepping daintily out to inspect her food dish the tiny movement was enough to make them stir to let a sliver of reality in but only a sliver shes only interested in her food jenny whispered not us i dont blame her im hungry too ramóns voice was husky with passion but his words were so prosaic that she chuckled it made it real her prince of the blood dressed in medals and tassels and boots that shone like mirrors was smiling down at her with a smile that spoke of devilry and pure latent sexand he was hungry forfor what she managed and the devilry in his eyes darkened gleamed sprang into laughter id take you on the kitchen table my love he said simply but i just dont trust the servants that much and wed shock the cat she whispered and he chuckled absolutely he was trying to make his voice normal jenny thought he was trying to make their world somehow normal in truth if ramón carried out his earlier threat to untie the cord of her dressing gown if he took that to its inevitable conclusion there was no way shed deny him only sense was prevailing sort of where he led shed follow but if he was trying to be prosaicmaybe she could be too i could cook in this kitchen she said eyeing the old range appraisingly the rows of pots and pans hanging from overhead rails the massive wooden table worn and pitted from years of scrubbing the pantry adjoins both kitchens ramón said hopefully im sure theres eggs and bacon in there are you really hungry at dinner i had two queens one duke and three prime ministers within talking range he said they took turns to address me its very rude for a crown prince to eat while being addressed by a head of state my aunt sofía was watching if id eaten i would have had my knuckles rapped shes a terrifying lady jenny said and he grinned i love her to bits he said simply like i love you ramón gianetta this is just for tonight he said softly and his voice grew bleak i know this is impossible after tonight ill ask nothing of you but gianettajust for tonight can we beus his face was grim there were vast problems here she knew and she saw those problems reflected in his eyes sofía had said the ghost of his father made this palace hateful yet ramón was stuck here can we be us maybe they could go back to where they started do you want bacon and eggs or do you want muffins she asked and tried to make her voice prosaic you could cook muffins here astonishment lessened the grimness you have an oven warmed for a cat she said it seems silly to waste it itll mean you need to wait twenty minutes instead of five minutes for eggs and bacon and the smell will go all through the palace he said in satisfaction theres an alibi if ever i heard one we could give a couple to manuel and luis manuel and luis our hun protectors they think im taunting them if i use their real names but surely a muffin couldnt be seen as a taunt his eyes were not leaving hers he wanted her he ached for her his eyes said it all but he was keeping himself rigidly under control you think we might find the ingredients he asked but she was already opening the panty door doing a visual sweep of the shelves then checking out the first of three massive refrigerators as anxious as he to find some way of keeping the sizzle between them under control and to keep the tension on his face at bay theres more ingredients than you can shake a stick at pardon lots of ingredients she said in satisfaction it seems a shame to abandon bacon entirely you want bacon and cheese muffins or double chocolate chip both he said promptly especially if i get to lick the chocolate chip bowl done she said and smiled at him and his smile met hers and she thought whoa i am in such trouble and then she thought whatever sofía said or perpetua said no matter how impossible this is im so deeply in love theres no way ill ever be able to climb out chapter eight they made muffins not just half a dozen muffins because if im helping its not such a huge ask to make heaps ramón declared we can put them on for breakfast and show the world what my gianetta can do youll upset the chefs jenny warned if theres a turf war you win hands down a turf war she was pouring choc chips into her mixture but she hesitated at that im not interested in any turf war frankly this setup leaves me terrified it leaves me terrified yes but but i have no choice he said flatly finishing the sentence for her i know that in the good old days as crown prince i could have simply had my soldiers go out with clubs and drag you to my lair and now you give me choices she retorted trying desperately to keep things light whisking her muffin mix more briskly than she needed just as well i believe clubbing might create an international incident i miss the good old days he said morosely he was sitting on the edge of the table swinging his gorgeous boots taking taste tests of her mixture so sexy the kitchen seemed to sizzle what use is being a prince if i cant get my woman my woman she was dreaming jenny thought dreamily she was cooking muffins for her prince my woman she started spooning her mixture into the pans and ramón reached over and took the trays and the bowl from her i can do this he said if you do something for me what pull my boots off i asked you ages ago i thought you were kidding theyre killing me he confessed ive spent my life in either boat shoes bare feet or steeltoed construction boots these make me feel like my feet are in corsets and i cant get them off please dear kind jenny will you pull my boots off he was sitting on the table he was spooning muffin mixture into pans he was holding his boots out for her to pull this was so ridiculous she couldnt help giggling she wiped her handsitd be a pity to get chocolate on leather like thistook position took a boot in both handsand pulled the boot didnt budge it was like a second skin see what i mean ramón said morosely and i really dont want to wake a valet you think i should cut them off you cant cut them jenny said shocked and tried again the boot budged just a little hey ramón said continuing to spoon its coming ill pull you off the table if i tug any harder jenny warned im strong he said too smugly keeping on spooning my balance is assured right she said and glowered reacting to his smugness she wiped both her hands on her dressing gown took the boot in both hands took a deep breathand pulled like shed never pulled the boot held gripped for a nanosecond and then gave jenny lurched backward boot in hand lost her balance and fell backwards ramón slid off the table staggeredand ended up on the floor the halffull bowl slid off after him tipped sideways and mixture oozed out over the floor jenny stared across at him in shock ramón stared back at herher lovely prince half bootless sprawled on the floor surrounded by choc chip muffin mixture her ramón she couldnt help it she laughed out loud and it was a magical release of tension a declaration of love and happiness if ever there was one and she couldnt help what happened next either it was as if restraint had been thrown to the wind and she could do what she likedand there was no doubting what shed like she slid over the floor she took ramóns face in both her handsand she kissed him and ramón kissed her backa thoroughly befuddled laughing wonderful kiss he tasted of choc chip muffin he tasted of love he tugged her close hauling her backward with him so she was in his arms and they were so close she thought she mustthey must and then the door burst open and sofía was standing in the doorway staring at them both as if theyd lost their minds maybe they had the little cat was delicately licking muffin mixture from the floor sofía darted across and retrieved the cat as if she were saving her from poison hi sofía ramón said innocently from somewhere underneath his woman jenny would have pulled away but he was having none of it he tugged her close and held so they were lying on the floor like two children caught out in mischief or more sofía stared down at them as if she couldnt believe her eyes what do you think youre doing she hissed making muffins ramón said and he would have pulled jenny closer but the mixture of confusion and distress on sofías face was enough to have her pulling away the timer was buzzing somehow she struggled to her feet she opened the oven and retrieved her now cooked bacon muffins then she thought what the heck she might as well finish what shed started so she put the almost full tray of choc chip muffins in to replace them gianettas a professional ramón said proudly to his aunt struggling up as well i told you she was fabulous are you out of your minds no i youre just like the rest she hissed at him theyre all womanisers all the men whove ever held power here you have her trapped ramón what on earth is it that youre planning im not planning anything if its marriage you cant i know philippe needs a mother but this is its nothing to do with philippe ramón snapped why are you here why do you think sofías anger was becoming almost apoplectic did you think the two of you were invisible everyone knows where you are ramón think about what youre doing youre no longer just responsible for yourself you represent a country now shes a nice girl i wont let you ruin her or trap her into this life i wont do either ramón said coldly furious were not talking marriage were not talking anything past this night jenny will be leaving ramón if she goes to the island now therell be such talk to take her in the palace kitchen he didnt take me it was jennys turn to be angry now my dressing gown cords still done up no one can tell that from outside sofía snapped and walked across and tugged the door wide see the harms done she said as two footmen stepped smartly away from the door you cant be happy here she whispered no one knows anyone no one trusts i know that ramón told her sofía stop this i told her you should take her to the island i told her you should have waited excuse me jenny said can you include me in this its nothing to do with you sofía said and then seemed to think about it her anger faded and she suddenly sounded weary and defeated no i meaneven if you were suitable as a royal bridewhich you arentyou arent tough enough to do it with no training sofía dont do this ramón said sofías distress was clear and real we arent talking about marriage then youre ruining her for nothing and heres your valet come to see what all the fuss is about i dont want my valet ramón snapped i dont want any valet you dont have a choice sofía said with exasperation none of us do ramón go away ill stay here with jenny until thesewhatever youre makingmuffinsare cooked well make the best of a bad situation but theres no way we can keep this quiet this with your stupid insistence on dancing with her first tonight shell have paparazzi in her face tomorrow whether she leaves or not paparazzi jenny said faintly leave now ramón and dont go near her again she needs space to see what a mess this situation is she doesnt want space yes i do jenny said philippe paparazzi there were so many unknowns what was she getting into she felt dizzy she felt bereft jenny ramón said urgently but sofía was before him pushing herself between them leave it she told them both harshly like it or not ramón is crown prince he needs to fit his new role he might think he wants you but he doesnt have a choice you dont belong in our world and you both know it she glanced along the corridor where there were now four servants waiting so theres to be no seduction tonight were all calmly eating muffins and going to bed yes yes jenny said before ramón could reply she didnt want to look at him she couldnt because the laughter in his eyes had gone the servants were waiting to take over the palace was waiting to take over she lay in her opulent bed and her head spun so much she felt dizzy she was lying on silk sheets when she moved she felt as if she was being caressed she wasnt being caressed she was lying in a royal bed in a royal boudoir alone because why because ramón was a crown prince even when shed lain with him in his wonderful yacht believing he was simply the skipper and not the owner shed felt a sense of inequality as if this couldnt be happening to her but it had happened and now it was over what else had she expected since shed met ramón her ache of grief had lifted life had becomeunreal but here it was again reality hard and cold as ice slamming her back to earth grief was real loss was real emptiness and heartache had been her world for years and here they were again her time with ramón her time tonight had been some sort of crazy soap bubble even before sofía had spelled it out shed known it was impossible sofía said she was totally unsuitable of course she was butbut as the night wore on something strange was happening her grief for matty had been in abeyance during the two weeks with ramón and again tonight it was back with her now but things had changed things were changing ever since matty was born things had happened to jenny just happened it was as if his birth his medical problems his desperate need had put her on a roller coaster of emotions that she couldnt get off her life was simply doing what came next but the chain of events today had somehow changed things what sofía and then perpetua had said had stirred something deep within or maybe it was how ramón had made her feel tonight that was making her feel different shed seen the defeat on ramóns face and she recognized that defeat it was a defeat born of bleak acceptance once upon a time shed shared it maybe she still should butbut why should i run she whispered and she wondered if shed really said it it didnt make any sense sofía and perpetua were right so was ramón what was between them was clearly impossible and thered be a million more complications she hadnt thought of yet philippe the child sofía had talked of she didnt go near children not after matty and royalty she had no concept of what ramón was facing threats the unknown carlos there were questions everywhere unspoken shadows looming from all sides but overriding everything was the fact that she wanted ramón so much she could almost cry out loud for him what she wanted right now was to pad out into the palace corridor yell at the top of her lungs for ramón and then sit down and demand answers shed had her chance shed used it making muffins and kissing her prince hed kissed her back the memory made her smile ramón made her smile maybe the shadows werent so long she thought but she knew they were id be happy as his lover she whispered to the night for as long as he wanted me just as his lover just in private back on his boat sailing round the world ramón and me it wasnt going to happen and would she be happy on his island being paid occasional visits as sofía had suggested no she lay back on her mound of feather pillows and she stared up at the ceiling some more she stared at nothing jenny and ramón the crown prince of cepheus no and no and no but still there was this niggle it wasnt anger exactly not exactly it was more that shed found her centre again shed found something worth fighting for gianetta and the crown prince of cepheus no and no and no the thing was though sense had gone out of the window the car crash that had killed his mother and his sister had left him with an aching void where family used to be for years hed carried the grief as a burden thinking he could bear no more and the way to avoid that was to not let people close he loved his work in bangladeshit changed peoples livesyet individual lives were not permitted to touch him but there was something about jennygianettathat broke the barriers hed built shed touched a chord and the resonance was so deep and so real that to walk away from her seemed unthinkable for the last three months hed tried to tell himself what hed felt was an illusion but the moment hed seen her again hed known it was real she was his woman he knew it with a certainty so deep it felt primeval but to drag her into the royal limelight into a place where the servants greeted you with blank facesinto a place where his father had died and barely a ripple had been createdwhere carlos threatened and he didnt know which servants might be loyal and which might be in carloss payhere his duty lay to his people and to have his worry centred on one slip of a girl on jenny no could he love her enough to let her go he must he had a deputation from neighbouring countries meeting him first thing in the morning to discuss border issues refugees the thought did his head in royalty seemed simple on the outsidewhat had jenny saidcutting ribbons and making speeches but cepheus was governed by royalty hed set moves afoot to turn it into a democracy but it would take years and meanwhile what he did would change peoples lives could he do it alone he must he had no right to ask jenny to share a load he found insupportable to put her into the royal limelight to ask her to share the risks that had killed his father to distract himself from a task that had to be faced alone there was no choice at all chapter nine jenny didnt see ramón all the next day she couldnt affairs of state sofía told her darkly deeply disapproving when jenny told her she had no intention of leaving until shed spoken to ramón theres so much business thats been waiting for ramón to officially take charge señor rodriguez tells me hes booked for weeks poor baby poor baby jenny thought of the man whose boot shed pulled off she thought of the power of his touch and she thought poor baby was a description just a wee bit wide of the mark so what was she to do by nine shed breakfasted inspected the palace gardensbreathtakingly beautiful but so emptygot lost twice in the palace corridors and she was starting to feel as if she was climbing walls she headed out to the gardens again and found gordon pacing by one of the lagoonsized swimming pools it seemed the darkness and the strange city last night had defeated even him all this opulence gives me the creeps he said greeting her with relief ive been waiting for you how about if we slope off down to the docks its not so far a mile or so as the crow flies we could get out the back way avoid the paparazzi i do need to come back she whispered looking at the cluster of cameramen around the main gate with dismay and gordon surveyed her with care are you sure theres talk lass about last night and there it was again that surge of anger then maybe i need to give them something to talk about she snapped the meetings were interminablemen and women in serious suits with serious briefcases filled with papers covered with serious concerns not one of which he could walk away from this country had been in trouble for decadeswas still in trouble it would take skill and commitment to bring it back from the brink to stop the exodus of youth leaving the country to take advantage of the countrys natural resources to bring prosperity for citizens whod been ignored for far too long the last three months hed spent researching researching researching he had the knowledge now to make a difference but so much work was before him it felt overwhelming he should be gearing up right now to spend the next six months supervising the construction of houses in bangladesh simple work but deeply satisfying hed had to abandon that to commit to this a more direct and personal need and this morning hed had to abandon jenny gianetta the two words kept interplaying in his head jenny gianetta jenny was the woman who made muffins the woman who saved whales the woman who made him laugh gianetta was the woman he took to his bed gianetta was the woman he would make his princessif he didnt care so much for her and for his country where was she now hed been wrong last night sofía had spelled out their situation clearly and he could do nothing but agree he should be with her now explaining why he couldnt take things further shed be confused and distressed but there was simply no option for him to spend time with her today so hed left orders for her to be left to enjoy a day of leisure the marquita was a big boat it was hard work to crew her and shed been sailing for three months last night had beenstressful she deserved to rest he had meetings all day and a formal dinner tonight tomorrow though hed make time early to say goodbye if she stayed that long and tomorrow hed promised to visit philippe he glanced at his watch tomorrow it was twentytwo hours and thirty minutes before a scheduled visit with his woman wedging it in between affairs of state and his concern for a child he didnt know what to do with jenny how could he ever make sense of what he felt for her he knew in his heart that he couldnt the marquita meant work and in work there was respite the day was windless so they could unfurl the sails and let them dry the boat was clean but by common consensus they decided it wasnt clean enough they scrubbed the decks they polished brass they gave the interior such a clean that martha gardener would be proud of them jenny remade the bed in the great stateroom plumped the mass of pillows looked down at the sumptuous quilts and wondered again what had she been thinking shed slept in this bed with the man she loved she loved him still with all her heart but in the distance she could see the spires of the palace glistening white in the mediterranean sunshine the crown prince of cepheus for a tiny time their two disparate worlds had collided and theyd seemed almost equal now all that was left was to find the courage to walk away perhaps eighteen hours and twentytwo minutes how many suits could he talk to in that time how many documents must he read he had to sign them all and there was no way he could sign without reading his eyes were starting to cross eighteen hours and seven minutes would she still be here surely she wouldnt leave without a farewell he deserved it he thought but pleaseno they worked solidly until midafternoon gordon was checking the storerooms taking inventory making lists of what needed to be replaced jenny was still obsessively cleaning taking away every trace of her but as the afternoon wore on even she ran out of things to do time to get back to the palace gordon decreed we could stay on board shes being pulled out of the water tonight so engineers can check her hull in the morning we hardly have a choice tonight will you stay on as ramóns skipper i love this boat he said simply for as long as im asked ill stay if that means staying at the palace from time to time ill find the courage i dont have very much courage she whispered or maybe you have sense instead gordon said stoutly he stood back for her to precede him up to the deck she stepped upand suddenly the world was waiting for her paparazzi were everywhere flashlights went off in her face practically blinding her she put her hand over her eyes in an instinctive gesture of defence and retreated straight back down again gordon slammed the hatch after her tell us about yourself someone called from the dock you speak spanish right were happy to pay for your story someone else called you and prince ramón were on the boat together for two weeks alone right that was bad enough but then is it true you had a baby out of wedlock someone else called while jenny froze and the baby died they knew about her matty they knew she wanted to go home right now she wanted to creep into a bunk and stay hidden while gordon sailed her out of the harbour and away serenity peace that was what shed been striving for since matty died where was serenity and peace now how could she find it in this ill talk to them gordon said looking stunned and sick and she looked at this big shy man and she thought why should he fight her battles why should anyone fight her battles maybe she had to fight to achieve this socalled serenity she thought maybe that was what her problem had been all along shed been waiting for serenity to find her when all along it was something she needed to fight for or maybe it wasnt even serenity that she wanted then before she had time to decide shed lost her mind entirelyfor maybe she had she certainly wasnt making sense to herself and gordon was looking really worriedshe flung open the hatch again and stepped out onto the deck his cellphone was on mute in his pocket he felt it vibrate checked it and saw it was gordon calling gordon wouldnt call him except in an emergency the documents had just been signed and the heads of state were lining up for a photo call these men had come for the coronation and had stayed on cepheus was a small nation these men represented far more powerful nations than his and cepheus had need of powerful allies nevertheless he excused himself and answered paparazzi know about jennys baby gordon barked so loud he almost burst ramóns eardrum theyre on the jetty were surrounded you need to get her out of here he felt sick ill have a security contingent there in two minutes he said motioning to señor rodriguez who no doubt had heard every word i need to get to the docks he told him how long it would take us fifteen minutes your highness but we cant leave here rodriguez said the man was seriously good he already had security on his second phone security will have dealt with it before we get there theres no need there was a need but as he glanced back at the heads of state he knew his lawyer was right to leave for such a reason could cause insupportable offence it could cause powerful allies to turn to indifference his sense of helplessness was increasing almost to breaking point he couldnt protect his woman you can see though señor rodriguez said obviously realising just how he was torn he turned back to the men and women behind him if youll excuse us for a moment he said smoothly an urgent matter of security has come up well be five minutes no more i will go ramón said through gritted teeth it will be dealt with before you arrive señor rodriguez said again but we have security monitors on the royal berth i can switch our cameras there to reassure you until you see our security people take over if youll come aside so ramón followed the lawyer into an anteroom he stared at the monitor in the corner and he watched in grim desperation as his woman faced the press theyd pull her apart he thought grimlyand there was nothing he could do to help her the cameras went wild questions were being shouted at her from all directions courage she told herself grimly come on girl youve hidden for long enough nows the time to stand and fight she ignored the shouts she stood still and silent knowing she looked appalling knowing the shots would be of her at her worst shed just scrubbed out a boat she didnt look like anyone famous she was simply jenny the deckhand standing waiting for the shouting to stop and finally it did the journalists fell silent at last thinking she didnt intend to respond finished she asked quirking an eyebrow in what she hoped looked like sardonic amusement and the shouting started again serenity she told herself she tapped a bare toe on the deck and waited again for silence ive called his highness gordon called up from below securitys on its way ramónll send them it didnt matter this wasnt ramóns fight she thought finally silence fell again baffled silence the cameras were still in use but the journalists were clearly wondering what they had here she waited and they watched impasse you do speak english one asked at last a lone question and she nodded a lone question not shouted could be attended to and why not all the others in serene order starting now yes she said speaking softly so they had to stay silent or they couldnt hear her i speak english as well as spanish and french my parents have spanish blood and i did indeed act as crew for his highness prince ramón as we sailed between sydney and auckland she thought back through the questions that had been hurled at her mentally ticking them off yes im a cook im i was also a single mother my son died of a heart condition two years ago but i dont wish to answer any more questions about matty his death broke my heart as for the rest thank you i enjoyed last night and yes rumours that i cooked for his highness early this morning are true im employed as his cook and crew thats what ive been doing for the last three months and no im not sure if ill continue it depends if he needs me what else oh the personal questions im twentynine years old i had my appendix out when i was nine my second toes are longer than my big toes and i dont eat cabbage i think your country is lovely and the marquita is the prettiest boat in the world however scrubbing the marquita is what im paid to do and thats what im doing if you have any more questions can you direct them to my secretary she grinned then a wide cheeky grin which only she knew how much effort it cost to produce oh whoops i forgot i dont have a secretary can one of you volunteer ill pay you in muffins if one of you is willing then the rest can siphon your questions through him thats so much more dignified than shouting dont you think then she gave them all a breezy wave observed their shocked silence and then slipped below leaving them dumfounded she stood against the closed hatch feeling winded gordon was staring at her in amazement as well he might what was she doing short answer she didnt know long answer she didnt know either retiring from this situation with dignity was her best guess though suddenly jenny had no intention of retiring not just yet this was a stateoftheart security system and sound was included not only did ramón see everything he heard every word jenny spoke it seems the lady doesnt need protecting señor rodriguez said smiling his relief as jenny disappeared below deck and ramóns security guards appeared on the docks ramón shook his head i should have been there for her shes protected herself shes done very well she shouldnt have been put in that position i believe the lady could have stayed below the lawyer said dryly the lady chose to take them on she has some courage she shouldnt she did the lawyer said and then hesitated señor rodriguez had been watching on the sidelines for many years now his father had been legal advisor to ramóns grandmother and sofía had kept him on after ramóns father died simply to stay aware of what royalty was doing now he was doing the job of three men and he was thoroughly enjoying himself your highness if i may make so bold youve never asked permission before ramón growled and the lawyer permitted himself another small smile its justthe role youre taking onto do it alone could well break you youre allowing me to assist but no one else this woman has courage and honour if you were to i wont ramón snapped harshly guessing where the lawyer was going and cutting him off before he went any further he flicked the screen off there was nothing to see but the press now being dispersed by his security guards i do this alone or not at all is that wise i dont know whats wise or not ramón said and tried to sort his thoughts into some sort of sense what was happening here the lawyer was suggesting sharing the throne with jenny jenny as his woman yes but jenny in the castle the thought left him cold the night of his fathers death was still with him still haunting him enough we have work to do he growled and headed back to the room where the heads of state were waiting but the lawyer started but ramón was already gone chapter ten he managed a few short words with her that night as he passed the supper room it was all he had as he moved from the evenings meetings to his briefing for tomorrow to his surprise jenny seemed relaxed even happy im sorry about today he said it seemed you handled things very well i talked too much she said smiling i need to work on my serenity your serenity im not very good at it her smile widened but i showed promise today dr matheson would be proud of me by the way i hope its okay that gordon and i are staying here tonight the boats up on the hard and who wants to sleep on a boat in dry dock besides staying in a palace is kind of fun kind of fun he gazed into the opulent supper room at the impassive staff and he thoughtkind of fun so i can stay tonight she prompted he raked his hair i should have had señor rodriguez organise airline tickets señor rodriguez has better things to do than organise my airline tickets ill organise them when im ready meanwhile can i stay tonight of course but jenny i dont have time i know you dont she said sympathetically señor rodriguez says these first days are crazy itll get better he says but ill not add to your burdens tonight i hope i never will then before he could figure how to respond a servant appeared to remind him he was late for his next briefing he was forced to leave jenny who didnt seem the least put out shed started chatting cheerfully to the maid who was clearing supper to his surprise the maid was responding with friendliness and animation well why wouldnt she he told himself as he immersed himself again into royal business jenny had no baggage of centuries of oppression she wasnt royal she never could be royal he could never ask that of her he thought grimly but as the interminable briefing wore on he thought of jennynot being royal he thought of her thinking of the palace as fun and he almost told the suits he was talking to where to go but he didnt he was sensible he had a country to run and when he was finally free jenny had long gone to bed and there was no way he was knocking on her door tonight he missed her at breakfast maybe because he ate before six before commencing the first of three meetings scheduled before ten he moved through each meeting with efficiency and speed desperate to find time to see her but the meetings went overtime he had no time left his ten oclock diary entry was immovable this appointment hed made three months ago four hours every wednesday even jenny would have to wait on this swiftly he changed out of his formal wear into jeans grabbed his swimmers and made his way to the palace garages he strode round the rows of espaliered fruit trees marking the end of the palace gardensand jenny was sitting patiently on a garden bench she was wearing smart new jeans a casual cord jacket in a pale washed apricot over a creamy lace camisole and creamy leather ballet flats her curls were brushed until they shone she looked rested and refreshed and cheerful she looked beautiful she rose and stretched and smiled a welcome gianetta jenny he told himself fiercely this was jenny his guest before she left for ever a very lovely jenny smiling and smiling do you like it she demanded and spun so she could be admired from all angles this is the new smart me where on earth i went shopping she said proudly yesterday when we finally escaped from that mob your security guys kindly escorted me to some great shops and then stood guard while i tried stuff on neat yes neat he said faintly and her face fell and he amended his statement fast gorgeous no that wont do either she said reprovingly my borrowed ballgown was gorgeous but this feels good i thought yesterday i havent had new clothes for years and the owner of the boutique gave me a huge discount ill bet she did he said faintly she grinned i know it was cheeky but i thought if im to be photographed by every cameraman in the known universe there has to be some way i can take advantage she was practically begging me to take clothes gordon said you were upset gordon was upset i should have been there then the cameramen would have been even more persistent she said gently but i have clothes to face them now and theyre not so scary soi pinned señor rodriguez down this morning and he says youre going to see philippe so i was wondering her tone became more diffident would it upset you if i came along would it upset philippe no but i cant ask you youre not asking she said and came forward to slip her hands into his youre looking trapped i dont want you to feel that way not by me youd never make me feel trapped he said but jenny i cant expect then dont expect she said señor rodriguez told me all about philippe no dont look like that the poor man never had a chance i practically sat on him to make him explain things in detail philippes your cousins son everyone thought he stood to inherit only when his parents died it turned out they werent actually married according to royal rules hes illegitimate now he has nothing hes well cared for he has lovely foster parents sofía says youve been visiting him every week since you got here its the least i can do when hes lost his home as well as his parents he cant stay here no he said bleakly if hes here hell be in the middle of servants wholl either treat him like royaltyand this country hates royaltyor theyll treat him as an illegitimate nothing yet you still think he should be here jenny said softly no because this is where you were when your father died what the sofía she said simply i asked she told me ramón im so sorry it must have been dreadful but that was then now is now can i meet him i cant ask that of you he said feeling totally winded and hes the same age your little boy would have been ramón can we take this one step at a time she asked lets just go visit this little boywhos not matty lets just leave it at that so they went and for the first five miles or so they didnt speak ramón didnt know where to take this there were so many things in this country that needed his attention but over and over his thoughts kept turning to one little boy consuela and ernesto were lovely but they were in their sixties to expect them to take philippe longterm he glanced across at jenny and found she was watching him he had the top down on his boxster coupe the warm breeze was blowing jennys curls around her face she looked young and beautiful and free he remembered the trapped woman hed met over three months ago and the change seemed extraordinary how could he trap her again he couldnt of course he couldnt he didnt intend to yetshed asked to come was she really opening herself up to be hurt again i cant believe this country she said smiling and he knew she was making an attempt to keep the conversation neutral steering away from undertones that were everywhere its like something on a calendar theres a deep description its true theres a calendar in the bathroom of seaport coffee n cakes and it has a fairy tale palace on it all white turrets and battlements and moats surrounded by little stone houses with ancient tiled roofs and mountains in the background and just a hint of snow theres no snow here he said forced to smile back were on the mediterranean please she said reprovingly youre messing with my calendar so as i was saying but then as he turned the car onto a dirt track leading to a farmhouse she stopped with the imagery and simply stared where are we this is where philippe lives but its lovely she whispered gazing out over grassy meadows where a flock of alpacas grazed placidly in the morning sun its the perfect place for a child to live hes not happy i imagine that might well be because his parents are dead she said suddenly sharp itll take him for ever to adjust to their loss if ever i dont think his parents were exactly handson ramón told her my uncle and my cousin liked to gamble and so did maria therese they spent threequarters of their lives in monaco and they never took philippe they were on their way there when their plane crashed so who took care of philippe hes had a series of nannies the palace hasnt exactly been a happy place to work neither my uncle nor my cousin thought paying servants was a priority and i gather as a mother maria therese wasdifficult nannies have come and gone so philippes only security has been the palace itself jenny ventured hes getting used to these foster parents ramón said but he wasnt convincing himself theyre great im looking forward to meeting them ill be interested to hear your judgement then he paused gianetta are you sure you want to do this philippes distressed and theres little i can do about it it wont help to make you distressed as well would you like to turn back well thatd be stupid jenny said philippe will already know youre on your way to turn back now would be cruel but what about you this isnt about me she said gently but inexorably lets go meet philippe he was the quietest little boy jenny had ever met he looked just like ramón the family resemblance was amazing she thought same dark hair same amazing eyes same sense of trouble kept under wraps his foster parents consuela and ernesto were voluble and friendly they seemed honoured to have ramón visit but not so overawed that it kept them silent that was just as well as their happy small talk covered up the deathly silence emanating from philippe they sat at the farmhouse table eating consuelas amazing strawberry cake consuela and ernesto chatted ramón answered as best he could and jenny watched philippe he was clutching a little ginger cat as if his life depended on it he was too thin his eyes were too big for his face he was watching his big cousin as if he was hungry i feel like that she thought and recognized what shed thought and intensified her scrutiny she had the time and the space to do it consuela and ernesto were friendly but they were totally focused on ramón philippe had greeted jenny with courtesy but now he too was totally focused on ramón of course ramón was the crown prince only ramóns title didnt explain things completely jenny decided ramón was here in his casual clothes he didnt look spectacularor any more spectacular than he usually didand a child wouldnt respond to an adult this way unless there was a fair bit of hero worship going on does prince ramón really come every week she asked consuela as she helped clear the table every week since hes been back in the country the woman said were so grateful ernesto and i have had many foster childrensome from very troubled homesbut philippes so quiet we dont seem to get through to him he never says a thing unless he must he hardly eats unless hes forced and he certainly doesnt know how to enjoy himself but once a week ramóni mean crown prince ramóncomes and takes him out in his car and its as if he lights up he comes home happy he eats he tells us what hes done and he goes to bed and sleeps all night then he wakes and ramóns not here and his parents arent here and it all starts again his highness brought him his cat from the palace and thats made things better but nowwere starting to wonder if its his highness himself the child pines for he cant have become attached to ramón so fast jenny said startled and consuela looked at her with eyes that had seen a lot in her lifetime and she smiled caro are you telling me thats impossible oh help was she so obvious she glanced back to where ernesto and ramón were engaged in a deep conversation about some obscure football match with philippe listening to every word as if it was the meaning of lifeand she found herself blushing from the toes up were hearing rumours consuela said seemingly satisfied with jennys reaction how lovely itheres nothing how fast did rumours spread theres everything consuela said all our prince needs is a woman to love him im not his class class pah consuela waved an airy hand at invisible class barriers three months ago philippe was prince royal now hes the illegitimate son of the dead princes mistress if you worry about class then you worry about nothing you make him happy thats all anyone can ask her shrewd gaze grew intent you know that prince ramón is kind intelligent honourable our country needs him so much but for a man to take on such a rolethere must be someone filling his heart as well i cant i can see a brave young woman before me and im very sure you can all of this was thoroughly disconcerting she should just shut up she thought she should stick with her new found serenity but as she wiped as consuela washed she pushed just a little more can i ask you something of course you and ernesto you obviously love philippe and youre doing the best you can for him but if philippe wants to be at the palace why doesnt ramónwhy doesnt his highness simply employ you to be there for him the woman turned and looked at jenny as if she were crazy us go to the palace why not were just farmers umexcuse me didnt you just say thats for you consuela said and then she sighed and dried her hands and turned to jenny i think that for you youre young enough and strong enough to fight it but for usand for philippethe lines of class at the palace are immovable would you try it though she asked would you stay in the palace if ramón asked it of you maybe but he wont he wont risk it and why should he she sighed as if the worries of the world were too much for her but then she pinned on cheerfulness smiled determinedly at jenny and turned back to the men moving on philippe his highness prince ramón asked if you could have your swimming costume prepared he tells me he wishes to take you to the beach football was abandoned in an instant in your car philippe demanded of ramón roundeyed in my car ramón said with señorina bertin if its okay with you the little boy turned his attention to jenny and surveyed her with grave attention whatever he saw there it seemed to be enough that will be nice he said stiffly get your costume poppet consuela said but philippe was already gone so they headed to the beach about five minutes drive from the farmhouse philippe sat between jenny and ramón absolutely silent his eyes straight ahead but jenny watched his body language he could have sat ramrod still and not touched either of them but instead he slid slightly to ramóns side so his small body was just touching his big cousin ramón was forging something huge here jenny thought did he know maybe he did maybe he couldnt help but know as he drove he kept up a stream of lighthearted banter speaking to jenny but most of what he said was aimed at philippe did gianetta know this little car was the most wonderful car in the world did she know he thought this was the only one of its kind that had ever been fitted with bench seatsdesigned so two people could have a picnic in the car if it was raining why only two weeks ago he and philippe had eaten a picnic while watching a storm over the sea and theyd seen dolphins and now the bench seat meant there was room for the three of them how about that for perfect and it was red didnt jenny think red was great i like pink jenny said and ramón looked as if shed just committed blasphemy youd have me buy a pink car no thatd be a waste you could spray paint this one she retorted and chuckled at their combined manly horror philippe didnt contribute a word but she saw him gradually relax responding to their banter realizing that nothing was expected of him but that he relax and enjoy himself and he did enjoy himself they arrived at the beach and ramón had him in the water in minutes jenny was slower señor rodriguez had told her they often went swimming so shed worn her bikini under her jeans but for now she was content to paddle and watch the beach was glorious a tiny cove with sunbleached sand gentle waves and shallow turquoise water there were no buildings no people and the mountains rose straight from the sea like sentinels guarding their privacy thered be bodyguards shed been vaguely aware of cars ahead and behind them all day and shadowy figures at the farmhouse but as theyd arrived at the beach the security presence was nowhere to be seen the guards must be under orders to give the illusion of total privacy she thought and that was what they had ramón had set this time up for philippe for a little cousin he was not beholden to in any way a little boy whod be miserable at the palace she paddled on casually kicking water out in front of her pretending she wasnt watching she was definitely watching ramón was teaching philippe to float the little boy was listening with all the seriousness in the world he was aching to do what his big cousin was asking of him his body language said hed almost die for his big cousin if you float with your face in the water and count to ten then ill lift you out of the water ramón was saying my hand will be under your tummy until we reach ten and ill count aloud then ill lift you high do you trust me to do that he received a solemn nod right ramón said and philippe leaned forward leaned further so he was floating on ramóns hand and put his face in the water one two threeten and the little boy was lifted high and hugged did you feel my hand fall away before i lifted you up you floated hey gianetta philippe floated ramón was spinning philippe around and around until he squealed his squeal was almost the first natural sound shed heard from him it was a squeal of delight of joy of life philippe was just a little bit older than matty would be right now ramón had worried about it shed dismissed his worry but now suddenly the knowledge hit her so hard that she flinched she was watching a little boy learn to swim and her matty never would everything inside her seemed to shrink pain surged back as it had surged over and over since shed lost her little son but something about this time made it different something told her it must be different so for once somehow she let the pain envelop her not trying to deflect it simply riding it out letting it take her where it would trying to see if she allowed it to take its course whether it would destroy her or whether finally she could come out on the other side she was looking at a man holding a little boy who wasnt mattya little boy who against all the odds she was starting to care about the heart swells to fit all comers it was a cliché shed never believed it back at the hospital watching matty fade shed looked at other children whod come in ill recovered then gone out again to face the world and shed feltnothing it had been as if other children were on some parallel universe to the one she inhabited there was no point of contact but suddenly unbidden those universes seemed to have collided for a moment she thought the pain could make her head explodeand then she knew it wouldnt matty philippe two little boys did loving matty stop her feeling philippes pain did loss preclude loving how could it she gazed out over the water at this big man with the responsibilities of the world on his shoulders and at this little boy whose world had been taken away from him she knew how many cares were pressing in on ramón right now hed taken this day out not for himself but because hed made a promise to philippe every week hed come affairs of state were vital but this hed decreed was more so she thought fleetingly of the man whod fathered matty whod sailed away and missed his whole short life philippe wasnt ramóns son he was the illegitimate child of a cousin hed barely known and yetand yet she was blinking back tears struggling to take in the surge of emotions flooding through her but slowly the knot of pain within was easing its grip letting her see what lay past its vicious hold ramón had lost his family and hed been a loner ever since but now he was being asked to take on the cares of this country and the care of this little boy this country depended on him philippe depended on him but for him to do it alone class barriers were just that she thought grief was another barrierand barriers could be smashed could she face them all down would ramón want her to and if she did face them down for ramóns sake and for hers she thought for her thoughts were flowing in all sorts of tangents that hardly made sense could she love philippe as well could the knot of pain shed held within since mattys death be untied maybe used to embrace instead of to exclude her vision was blurred with tears and it was growing more blurred by the second ramón looked across at her and waved as if to say whats keeping you come in and join us she waved back and turned her back on them supposedly to walk up the beach and strip off her outer clothes in reality it was to get her face in orderand to figure if she had the courage to put it to the test maybe they didnt want her maybe her instinctive feelings for philippe were wrong and maybe what ramón was feeling for her stemmed from nothing more than a casual affair her heart told her it was much more but then her heart was a fickle thing no matter if she was mistaken she could walk awaybut first she could try and matty surely loving again could never be a betrayal this was crazy she told herself as she slipped off her clothes and tried to get her thoughts in order she was thinking way ahead of what was really happening she was imagining things that could never be should she back off but then she glanced back at the two males in the shallows and she felt so proprietorial that it threatened to overwhelm her my two men she thought mistily or they could be maybe they could be the country can have what it needs from ramón but im lining up for my share she told herself fiercely if i have the courage and maybe the shadows of matty can be settled warmed even honoured by another love she sniffed and sniffed again found a tissue in her bag blew her nose and decided her face was in order as much as she could make it she wriggled her bare toes in the sand and wriggled them again if she dived straight into the waves and swam a bit to start with she might even look respectable before she reached them and if she didnt warts and all she thought that was what she was offering for they all had baggage she decided as she headed for the water her grief for matty was still raw and real this must inevitably still hurt and ramón he was an unknown he was crown prince of cepheus to her jenny she was risking rejection and everything that went with it consuela said she had courage maybe consuela was wrong maybe im just pigheaded stubborn she muttered to herself heading into the shallows maybe im reading this all wrong and he doesnt want me and philippe doesnt need me and today is all i have left of the pair of them so get in the water and get on with it she told herself and if im right then maybe serenitys not the way to go she muttered maybe the opposites whats needed oh but to fight for a prince maybe she would for a princes happiness and for the happiness of one small boy who wasnt matty they swam they ate a palaceprepared picnic on the sand and then they took a sleepy philippe back to the farmhouse once again they drove in silence what was between them seemed too complicated for words dared she by the time they reached the farm philippe was asleep but as ramón lifted him from the car he jerked awake then sobbed and clung shaken ramón carried him into the house while jenny stared straight ahead and wondered whether she could be brave enough it was like staring into the night sky overwhelmed by what she couldnt see as much as what she could see the concept of serenity seemed ridiculous now this was facing her demons fighting for what she believed in fighting for what she knew was right dared she two minutes later ramón was back he slid behind the wheel still without a word and sat grimfaced and silent now or never jenny took a deep breath reached over and put her hand over his he loves you she whispered he stared down at their linked hands and his mouth tightened into a grim line of denial he cant if its going to upset him then i should stop coming do you want to stop no then why not take him back to the palace why not take him home there was a moments silence then what take him back to the palace and wedge him into a few moments a day between my appointments and the rest of the time leave him with people who love him like like consuela and ernesto then at the look on his face she pressed his hand tighter ramón youre taking all of this on as it is why not take it as it could be i dont know what you mean just try she said figuring it out as she went try for change you say the palace is a dreadful place to live so it is but the servants are terrified of your title they wont let you close because theyre afraid the place isnt a home its a mausoleum oh its a gorgeous mausoleum but its a mausoleum for all that but it could change people like consuela and ernesto could change it or be swallowed by it theres no need to be melodramatic you could just invite them to stay for a couple of days to start with tell philippe that his home is heremake that clear so he wont get distraught ifwhen he has to return you can see how it goes you wont be throwing him back anywhere i wont make him sleep in those rooms and there it was out in the open raw and dreadful as it had been all those years ago and even worse jenny was looking at him as if she understood and maybe she did you were alone she whispered your father brought you to the palace and he was killed and you were alone its nothing its everything of course it is but this is now ramón this is philippe as its not matty its also not you philippe wont be alone this is nonsense he said roughly trying to recover some sort of footing its impossible sofía saw that even before i arrived philippes illegitimate the country would shun him theyd love him given half a chance how do you know he snapped he was there for over four years and no one cared maybe no one had a chance the maid i talked to this morning said no one was permitted near except the nursery staff and philippes mother was constantly changing the people who worked with him hes better off here if no one loves him at the palace of course he is but you could change that she hesitated ramón im thinking you already have he shook his head shaking off demons this is nonsense i wont risk this this you know what i mean his face grew even more strained gianetta yes i hate it he said explosively the paparazzi almost mobbed you yesterday the threat from carlos how can anyone live in that sort of environment how could you her world stilled her heart seemed to forget to beat how could you they were no longer talking about philippe then am iam i being invited she managed no there was a long silence loaded with so many undercurrents she couldnt begin to figure them out through the silence ramón held the steering wheel his knuckles clenched white fighting demons she could hardly fathom we need to get back he said at last of course we do she said softly but she knew this man now maybe two weeks of living together was too soon to judge someoneor maybe not maybe shed judged him the first time shed seen him okay she hardly understood his demons but demons there were and prince or not maybe the leap had to be hers you know that i love you she said gently into the warm breeze but his expression became even more grim dont dont say what i feel you dont want this life i like tiaras she ventured trying desperately for lightness and caviar and french champagne at least she added honestly i havent tasted caviar yet but im sure ill like it and if i dont im very good at faking jenny dont make this any harder than it has to be he snapped refusing to be deflected by humour i was a fool to bring you to cepheus i will not drag you into this royal life you dont have to drag me anywhere i choose where to go all you need to do is ask just leave it you dont know the paparazzi yesterday was just a taste right now youre seeing the romance the fairy tale youll wake in a years time and find nothing but a cage you dont think you might be overreacting she ventured not everyone at the coronation ball looked like theyve been locked up all their lives surely caviar cant be that bad but he wasnt listening youre my beautiful jenny he said youre wild and free and i wont mess with who you are youll always be my jenny and ill hold you in my heart for ever from a distance from how big a distance from a photo in a frame she demanded indignant that sounds appalling or better still do you mean as your mistress on your island he stared at her as if shed grown two heads what the thats what sofía said we should do i do not want you as my mistress he said through gritted teeth so you dont want me his anger was building and she thought good an angry ramón might just lose control and control had gone on long enough she wanted him to take her into his arms in truth she wanted him to take her any way he wanted but he was fighting his anger hauling himself back from the brink i want you more than life itself but i will not take you he took a deep ragged breath i could never keep you safe well thats nonsense i know karate she retorted i can duck and i can run and i can even punch and scratch and yell if i need to not that ill need to perpetua says carlos is all bluster perpetua is a very nice lady with an oaf for a husband and with very oldfashioned ideas about royal wives shutting up ideas that i dont believe for one minute youll never see me shutting up it doesnt matter he said exasperated i want you free free she was fighting on all fronts now knowing only that she was fully exposed and she had no defence all she had was her love for this man like our whale she demanded thats just perspective our whales free now to swim to antarctica but she has to stop there and turn around a minnow can feel free in an aquarium if its a beautiful aquarium she hesitated then seeing the tension on his face stretched almost to breaking point shed gone far enough ramón lets not take this further she said gently whats between uslets leave it for now lets just think of philippe is his room still as it was at the palace no ones touched the nursery so you could go in right now and say philippe what about coming back to the palace for a night or two tell him maybe if it works out he could come for two nights every week see how it goes jenny okay maybe it is impossible she said this is not my life and its not my little cousin but you know him now ramón and maybe things have changed all i know is that philippes breaking his heart in there and if he returned to the palace theres no way hed be alone consuela is looking out the window and i wouldnt mind betting she knows exactly what were talking about shes bursting to visit the palace even if shes scared and if you raise one finger to beckon shell have bags packed and bebe in his cat crate and you can still reach your three oclock appointment and before you start raising quibbles like wholl look after their alpacas youre the prince surely you can employ half this district to look after this farm so decide she said bluntly youve been making life and death decisions about this country now its time to make one about your family philippes not my family is he not it might have started with sympathy ramón cavellero but its not sympathy thats tugging him to you now is it i dont dolove you already have just take the next step all it needs is courage she hesitated ramón i know how it hurts to love and to lose youve loved and youve lost but philippe is going right on loving he cant he said but he was looking at the window where consuela was indeed peeping through a chink in the curtains and then he was looking at jennygianettawho knew whichand she was looking back at him with faith faith that he could take this new step you can she said gianetta he said and would have taken her into his arms right then part in exasperation part in angerand there were a whole lot more parts in there besides but she held up her hands in a gesture of defence not me not now this is you and philippe do you want him or not he looked at her for a long moment he glanced back at the farmhouse and philippe was at the window now as well as consuela and there was only one answer to give so half an hour laterramón would be late for his meeting but not muchhis little red boxster finally left the farmhouse with philippe once again snuggled between ramón and jenny there was a cat crate at jennys feet the boxster was definitely crowded behind them consuela and ernesto drove their farm truck packed with enough luggage to last them for two days or more jenny thought with satisfaction there were four big suitcases on the back for all she talked of class differences consuela seemed more than prepared to take a leap into the unknown if only ramón could join her chapter eleven the moment he swung back into the palace grounds affairs of state took over again ramón couldnt stay to watch philippes reaction to being back at the palace he couldnt stay to see that consuela and ernesto were treated right he couldnt stay with jenny we can do this go jenny told him and he had no choice he went to meeting upon interminable meeting once again he was forced to work until the small hours finally exhausted beyond belief he made his way through the palace corridors towards his personal chambers once again he passed jennys doorand he didnt knock but then he reached the nursery to his surprise manuel was standing outside the door at attention the footmen were posted at the top of the stairs had a change been ordered but manuel spoke before he could ask im not permitted to move the man said and it was as if a statue had come to life but the little boy and señorina bertin i thought you wouldnt wish them harm so i took it upon myself to stay here good idea he hesitated taking in the full context of what the man had said reaching the crux señorina bertins in there yes sir manuel said and he opened the nursery door before ramón could say he hadnt meant to go in he was only passing only of course he had meant to go in just to check manuel closed the door after him the room was in darkness but the moon was full the curtains werent drawn and he could see the outline of the bed against the windows it was a truly vast bed for a small child a ridiculous bed he moved silently across the room and looked downand there were two mounds in the bed a childsized one with a catshaped bump over his feet and a jennyshaped one and the jennyshaped one spoke youre not a hun she whispered and he blinked pardon manuels saving us from the huns i thought you might have overpowered him and be about toplunder and pillage im very glad youre not im glad im not a hun either he said and smiled down at her and he could feel her smile back even if he couldnt quite see it what are you doing here shh hes only just gone back to sleep he tugged a chair forward and sat then leaned forward so he was inches away from jennys face philippe was separated from them by jennys body but he could see that her arm was around him the sight made him feelmade him feel no there were no words to describe it this is consuelas job he managed she was here until midnight the staff put consuela and ernesto into one of the state apartments and its so grand its made ernesto quiver ernesto seems more frightened than philippe so i said id stay she said shed stay with a little boy who was the same age as her matty in this room that hed once slept in he looked at her at the way philippes body was curved against hers at the way she was holding him and he felt things slither and change within him knots that had been around his heart for ever slipped away undone free gianetta he whispered and placed his fingers on her lips wondering if shed found the courage to do this shh she said again he woke and he was a little upset i dont want him to wake again but you soothed him i told him the story of the whale he loved it i told him about his cousin the hero saviour of whales saviour of this country we both thought it was pretty cool gianetta jenny your employee and manuel is out there manuel can go manuel cant go she said seriously neither of us is sure where to take this you need to sleep ramón i want i know she said softly and she placed a finger on his lips in turn we both want i can feel it and its wonderful but theres things to think about for both of us for now give me my selfrespect and go to your own bedroom tonight she smiled at him then and he was close enough to see a lovely loving smile that made his heart turn over besides she said tonight im sleeping with philippe one man a night my love i have my reputation to think of hes not matty he said before he could stop himself philippes not matty no but jenny doesnt that tear you in two i thought it would she said on a note of wonder but now he fits exactly under my arm hes not matty but its as if matty has made a place for him it feels right jenny go to bed ramón she said simply we all have a lot of thinking to do this night he left and she was alone in the dark with a sleeping child shed given her heart she thought shed given it to both of them just like that what if they didnt want it it was theirs she thought like it or not bebe stirred and wriggled and padded his way up the bed to check she was still breathing that shed still react if he kneaded his paws on the bedcover okay i can learn to love you too she told the little cat as long as your claws dont get all the way through the quilt satisfied bebe slumped down on the coverlet across her breast and went back to sleep leaving her with her thoughts they have to want me she whispered in the dark oh they have to want me or im in such big trouble and in the royal bedchamber the apartment of the crown prince of cepheus there was no sleep at all once upon a time a child had slept alone in this palace and known terror now the man lay alone in his palace and knew peace he woke and he knew but he couldnt do a thing about it itd take him a week señor rodriguez told him this signing signing and more signing he had to formally accept the role of crown prince before he could begin to delegate so from dawn his time was not his own i need two hours this afternoon he growled to his lawyer as he saw his packed diary youve scheduled me an hour for lunch take fifteen minutes from each delegation that gives me another hour so between one and three is mine ive already started organising it his lawyer told him we all want you to have time with the child all i believe the staff have been missing him the lawyer said primly it seems there are undercurrents neither the princess sofía nor i guessed he didnt say more but they agreed a message would be sent to jenny and to philippe that hed spend the early afternoon with them then ramón put his head down and worked he finished just before one hed have finished earlier only someone dared ask a question was he aware there were up to fifty students in each class in the local schools and didnt he agree this was so urgent it had to be remedied right now he did agree how could he put his own desire to be with jenny and philippe before the welfare of so many other children señor rodriguez disappeared leaving ramón to listen and think and agree to meet about the issue again tomorrow finally he was free to walk out to find the whereabouts of philippeand of jenny theyre by the pool your highness it was the maid who normally brought in his coffee and to his astonishment she smiled as she bobbed her normal curtsy its so good to have him back sir theres refreshments being served now if youd like to have your lunch with them bemused he strolled out the vast palace doors into the gardens overlooking the sea there was a party happening by the pool and the perfection of the scene before him was marred or not marred he corrected himself just changed the landscape to the sea had been moulded to create a series of rock pools and waterfalls tumbling down towards the sea shade umbrellas and luxurious cream beach loungers were discreetly placed among semitropical foliage blending unobtrusively into the magical garden setting now however at the biggest rock pool chairs and tables had been hauled forward to make a circle there were balloons attached around every umbrella this wasnt tasteful at all he thought with wry amusement the balloons were all colours and sizes as though some had been blown up by men with good lungs and some had been blown up by a fiveyearold they were attached to the umbrellas by red ribbons with vast crimson bows under each bunch and there were sea dragons floating in the rock pool huge plastic sea dragons red green and pink with sparkly tiaras sea dragons with tiaras what on earth jenny was in the water and so was philippe and so wassofía they were on a sea dragon apiece kicking their way across the water seemingly racing sofía was wearing neck to knee swimmers and she was winning whooping her elderly lungs out with excitement there was more he thought stunned señor rodriguez was sitting by the edge of the pool wearing shorts his skinny frame a testament to a life spent at his desk he was cheering sofía at full roar as were consuela and ernesto yelling their lungs out for their foster son go philippe go there were also servants all in their ridiculous uniforms but each of them was yelling as loudly as everyone else and another woman was cheering too a woman who looked vaguely familiar and then he recognised her perpetua carloss wife what the he didnt have time to take it all in sofía reached the wall by a full length of sea dragon philippe came second and jenny fell off her dragon from laughing it felt crazy it was a palace transformed into something else entirely he watched as philippe turned anxiously to find jenny she surfaced still laughing she hugged him and his heart twisted and he forgot about everything everyone else she saw him she waved and then staggeredholding philippe with one arm was a skill yet to be mastered welcome to our pool party your highness she called have you come to try our sausage rolls sausage rolls he said faintly and looked at the table where there was enough food for a small army your chefs have never heard of sausage rolls she said clambering up the pool steps with philippe in her arms and grinning as sofía staggered out as well still clutching her sea dragon philippe and i had to teach them and we have fairy bread and lamingtons and tacos and tortillas and strawberries and éclairsand i love this place philippe does too dont you philippe weve decided its the best place to visit in the world visit he stood and watched as woman and child disappeared under vast towels and he thoughtvisit oh and we invited perpetua jenny said from under her towel motioning in the general direction of the pallid little lady standing uncertainly under the nearest umbrella perpetua gave him a shy scared smile you know carloss wife and carlos too and carlos too he demanded perpetuas smile slipped i told him to come she whispered when gianetta invited us he said he would he just has tohes been making silly threats that he doesnt mean he wants to apologise her voice was almost pleading hed never hurt and maybe he wouldnt ramón thought for carlos was approaching them now escorted by palace footmen the footmen were walking really close really close hes not going to hurt anyone perpetua whispered hes just been silly i was so pleased when gianetta rang he needs a chance to explain explain what ramón said and perpetua fell silent waiting for carlos himself to answer ramóns gaze flew to jenny she met his gaze full on shed set this up he thought one of the maids had taken over rubbing philippe dry the maid was laughing and scolding making philippe smile back she was a servant hed thought lacked emotion had the servants turned to ice through mistreatment and fear what else had fear done he looked again at carlos a big stupid man who for a few short weeks while ramón couldnt be found had thought the throne was his for the dream to be snatched away must have shattered his world maybe stupid threats could be treated as they deserved ramón thought feeling suddenly extraordinarily lightheaded and if threats werent there we invited both carlos and perpetua jenny was saying because of philippe philippe says perpetuas always been nice to him hes a sweetheart perpetua said stoutly becoming braver i worried about him whenever i stayed here you used to stay in the palace ramón asked surprised again what had señor rodriguez told him perpetua was a nice enough woman intelligent trained as a grade school teacher but always made to feel inferior to carloss royal relatives a lot perpetua said becoming braver carlos liked being here philippe and i became friends didnt we sweetheart but then carlos said some silly things her gaze met her husbands i used to believewell im a royal wife and a royal wife stays silent but gianetta says thats ridiculous so im not staying silent any longer youre sorry arent you dear was he ramón watched carlos sweating slightly in a suit that was a bit too tight struggling to come to terms with this new order and he even felt a bit sorry for him i shouldnt have said it carlos managed you said youd kill you know how it is carlos was almost pleading i meanheat of the moment i was only sayingyou know wild stuff what id do if you didnt look after the countrythat sort of thing it got blown up you didnt take it seriously please tell me you didnt take it seriously was that it ramón thought relief running through him in waves history had created fearnot fear for himself but fear for family his family a family he could now build in time and with that thought came another he wasnt alone delegation why not start now perpetua you used to be a grade teacher he said speaking slowly but thinking fast thinking back to the meeting hed just attended do you know the conditions in our schools of course i do perpetua said confused i mean i havent taught for twenty yearscarlos doesnt like me tobut i have friends who are still teachers they have such a hard time tomorrow morning im meeting with a deputation to see what can be done about the overcrowding in our classrooms he said would you like to join us me she gasped i need help he said simply and carlos how can you help there was stunned silence even philippe who was wrapped in a towel and was now wrapping himself around a sausage roll stopped midbite and stared this man whod made blustering threats to kill how can you help jenny moved then inconspicuously slipping to his side she stood close and she took his hand as if she realized just how big it was just how important this request was defusing threats to create a future refusing to stand alone for one moment longer i cant carlos managed at last theres nothing yes dear there is perpetua had found her voice and she too slipped to stand beside her man sports carlos loves them loves watching them but theres never been enough money to train our teenagers and the football stadiums falling down you like football ramón asked football philippe said lighting up i you could give me reports on sports facilities ramón said thinking fast trying to figure out something meaningful that the man could do tell me what needs to be done put in your recommendations i dont know this country you do i need help on the ground so what do we have here assistant to the crown for education assistant to the crown for sport and ill be assistant to the crown for new uniforms for the staff sofía said happily id like to help with that i can help with floating philippe said gamely but can i help with football too and gianetta perpetua said looking anxious what about jenny i need to figure that out ramón said softly holding his love close his world suddenly settling in a way that was leaving him stunned in private philippe had finished his sausage roll now and he carried the loaded tray over to his big cousin would you like to eat one he asked and then will you teach me to float some more of course i will he said on one condition philippe looked confused as well he might no matter sometimes a prince simply had to allocate priorities and this was definitely that time he tugged jenny tighter then audience or not he pulled her into his arms and gave her a swift possessive kiss it was a kiss that said he was pushed for time he knew he couldnt take this further not here not now but there was more where that came from my condition to you all he said softly kissing her once more a long lingering kiss that said pushed for time or not this was what he wanted most in the world is that señor rodriguez changes my diary this night is mine the car came to collect her just before sunset she was dressed again as gianetta in a long diaphanous dress made of the finest layers of silk and chiffon with the diamonds at her throat two maids and sofía and consuela and perpetua had clucked over her to distraction sofía had added a diamond bracelet of her own and had wept a little oh my dear youre so beautiful shed said mistily do you think hell propose jenny hadnt answered she couldnt she was torn between laughter and tears ramóns kisses had promised everything but nothing had been said mistress to a crown prince wife dared she think wife how could she think anything after a fast floating lesson ramón had been swept away yet again on his interminable business and shed been left only with his demand a car will come for you at seven be ready she was ready but she was daring to think nothing finally at seven the car came and señor rodriguez handed her into the limousine with care and with pride the reverberations from this afternoon were being felt all around the country and the lawyer couldnt stop smiling wheres ramón she managed waiting for you the lawyer said sounding inscrutable until he added how could any man not so she was driven in state alone with only a chauffeur for company the great white limousine was driven slowly through the city out along the coast road up onto a distant headland where it drew to a halt two uniformed footmen met her manuel and luis trying desperately to be straightfaced there was a footpath leading from where the car pulled in to park winding through a narrow section of overgrown cliff manuel and luis led her silently along the path emerged into a clearing then slipped silently back into the shadows leaving her to face what was before her and what was before her made her gasp a headland looking out all over the moonlit mediterranean a table for two crisp white linen two cushioned chairs with high high backs draped all in white velvet each leg fastened with crimson ties silverware crystal a candelabrum magnificent enough to take her breath away soft music coming from behind a slight rise real music there were real musicians somewhere behind the trees champagne on ice and then ramón stepped from the shadows ramón in full ceremonial ramón looking more handsome than any man shed met the sound of frogs came from beneath the music behind him her frog prince if i kiss you will you join your friends the frogs she whispered before she could help herself and he laughed and came towards her and took her hands in his no kissing he said tenderly not yet what she could barely speak what are we waiting for this he said and went down on bended knee she closed her eyes this couldnt be happening this was happening this should wait until after dinner he said softly but its been burning a hole in my pocket for three hours now and without more words he lifted a crimson velvet box and held it open a diamond ring lay in solitary splendour a diamond so wonderfulso amazing is it real she gasped and he chuckled thats jenny speaking i think we need gianetta to give us the right sense of decorum gianetta she took a deep breath and fought for composure she could do this sire you do me honour thats more like it he said and his dark eyes gleamed with love and with laughter so gianetta jenny my love my sailor my cook extraordinaire my hearti give you my love the past has made us solitary but its up to both of us to move forward to leave solitude and pain behind youve shown me courage and i trust that i can match it so gianetta my dearest love if i promise to love you cherish you honour you for as long as we both shall live will you do me the honour of taking my hand in marriage she looked down into his loving eyes then she paused for a moment taking time to gaze around her at the night at the stars the accoutrements of royalty at the lights of cepheus glowing around them knowing also there was a little boy waiting as well her family her love starting now i believe i will she said gently and before he could respond she dropped to her own knees and she took his hands in hers yes my love and my prince i believe i will marion lennox marion lennox is a country girl born on an australian dairy
