a tail of two skittys the four skitty stories appeared in cat fantastic anthologies edited by andre norton im very very fond of skitty it might seem odd for a bird person to be fond of cats but i am so there it is i was actually a catperson before i was a birdmother and i do have two cats both siamesemix both rather old and very slow just if the other local cats poach too often at my bird feeders they can expect to get a surprise from the gardenhose the howls coming from inside the special animal shipping crate sounded impatient and had been enough to seriously alarm the cargo handlers dick white spaceman first class supercargo on the catseye company ship brightwing put his hand on the outside of the plastile crate just above the word property from within the crate the muffled voice continued to yowl general unhappiness with the world tell her that its all right skitty he thought at the black form that lay over his shoulders like a living fur collar tell her ill have her out in a minute i dont want her to come bolting out of there and hide the minute i crack the crate skitty raised her head yellow eyes blinked once sleepily abruptly the yowling stopped she fine skitty said and yawned showing a full mouth of needlepointed teeth only young scared i think she make good mate for furrball dick shook his head the kittens were not even a year old and already their mother was matchmaking then again that was the tendency of mothers the universe over at least now hed be able to uncrate this wouldbe mate with a minimum of fuss the full legend imprinted on the crate read female shipscat astra stardancer of englewood property of biotech interstellar leased to catseye company do not open under penalty of law theoretically astra was like skitty a bioengineered shipscat fully capable of handling freefall alien vermin conditions that would poison paralyze or terrify her remote terran ancestors and all without turning a hair in actuality astra like the nineteen other shipscats dick had uncrated was a failure the genetic engineering of her middleear and other balancing organs had failed she could not tolerate freefall and while most ships operated under gravgenerators there were always equipment malfunctions and accidents that made her and her fellows failures by biotech standards a shipscat that could not handle freefall was not a shipscat normally kittens that washed out in training were adopted out to carefully selected planet or stationbound families of biotech employees however this was not a normal circumstance by any stretch of the imagination the world of the lacuun graceful bipedal humanoids with a remarkably sophisticated if planetbound civilization was infested with a pest called a kreshta erica makumba the legal advisor and security chief of dicks ship described them as sixlegged crosses between cockroaches and mice skitty described them only as nasty but she hunted them gleefully anyway the lacuun opened their world to trade just over a year ago and some of their artifacts and technologies made them a desirable tradeally indeed the brightwing had been one of the three ships invited to negotiate in part because of skitty for the lacuun valued totemic animals highly and that was what had led to captain singh of the brightwing conducting the entire trade negotiations with the lacuunand had kept brightwing groundbound for the past year skitty had done theto the lacuunimpossible she had killed kreshta she had already been assumed to be brightwings totemic animal that act elevated her to the status of godtouched miracle and had given the captain and crew of her ship unprecedented control and access to the rulers here skitty had been newlypregnant at the time part of the price for the power captain singh now wielded had been her kittens but dick had gotten another idea and had used his own share of the profits brightwing was taking in to purchase the leases of twenty more failed cats to supplement skittys four kittens biotech cats released for leases were generally sterile skitty being a rare exception if these twenty worked out the lacuun would be very grateful and more importantly so would vena ferducci the attractive petite terran consul assigned to the new embassy here in the past few months dick had gotten to know vena very welland he hoped to get to know her better vena had originally been a survey scout and she was getting rather restless in her groundbased position as consul and in truth the lacuun lawyer lan ventris was much better suited to such a job than vena she had hinted that as soon as the lacuun felt they could trust ventris she would like to resign and go back to space dick rather hoped she might be persuaded to take a position with the brightwing it was too soon to call this little dance a romance but he had hopes hopes which could be solidified by this experiment if the twenty young cats he had imported worked out as well as skittys four halfgrown kittens the lacuun would be able to import their intelligent pestkillers at a fraction of what the lease on a shipscat would be this would make vena happy anything that benefited her lacuun made her happy and if dick was the cause of that happiness dick go courting skitty asked innocently salting her query with decidedly notinnocent images of her own courting dick blushed no courting he thought firmly not yet anyway silly skitty replied scornfully the overtones of her thoughts werewhy waste such a golden opportunity dick did not answer her instead he thumbed the lock on the crate a lock keyed to his dna only a tiny prickle was the only indication that the lock had taken a sample of his skin for comparison but a moment later a hairlinethin crack appeared around the front end of the crate and dick carefully opened the door and looked inside a pair of big green eyes in a pointed gray face looked out at him from the shadows meowrrrr said a tentative voice tell her its all right skitty he thought extending a hand for astra to sniff it was too bad that his telepathic connection with skitty did not extend to these other cats but she seemed to be able to relay everything he needed to tell them astra sniffed his fingers daintily and oozed out of the crate belly to the floor after a moment though a moment during which skitty stared at her so hard that dick was fairly certain his little friend was communicating any number of things to the newcomer astra stood up and looked around her ears coming up and her muscles relaxing finally she looked up at dick and blinked prrow she said he didnt need skittys translation to read that he held out his arms and the young cat leapt into them to be carried in regal dignity out of the quarantine area as he turned away from the crate he thought he caught a hint of movement in the shadows at the back but when he turned to look there was nothing there and he dismissed it as nothing more than his imagination if there had been anything else in astras crate the manifest would have listed itand astra was definitely sterile so it could not have been an unlicensed kitten erica makumba and vena were waiting for him in the corridor outside vena offered her fingers to the newcomer much more secure now astra sniffed them and purred shes lovely vena said in admiration dick had to agree astra was a velvety bluegray from head to tail and her slim clean lines clearly showed her descent from russian blue ancestors she for furrball skitty insisted gently nipping at his neck is this your idea or hers dick retorted sees furrball in head likes furrball that seemed to finish it as far as skitty was concerned good hunter too dick gave in to the inevitable didnt we promise one of these new cats to the lacuteveras dick asked this one seems very gentle shed probably do very well as a companion for furrball skittys kittens all had names as fancy as astrasor as skittys official name for that matter furrball was andreas widefarer of lacuun nuisance was misty snowspirit of lacuun rags was lady flamebringer of lacuun and trey was garrison starshadow of lacuun but they had as cats always do acquired their own nicknames that had nothing to do with the registered names astra would without a doubt do the same each of the most prominent families of the lacuun had been granted one cat but the royal family had three two of skittys original kittens and one of the newcomers astra would bring that number up to four a sacred number to the lacuun and very propitious we did vena replied absently scratching a pleased astra beneath her chin and i agree with you i think this one would please the lacuteveras very much she laughed a little im beginning to think youre psychic or something dick you havent been wrong with your selections yet me he said ingenuously psychic spirits of space vena the way these people are treating the cats it doesnt matter anyway any match i made would be a good one so far as the cat is concerned they couldnt be pampered more if they were lacuun girlbabies true she agreed and reluctantly took her hand away well four cats should be just about right to keep the palace verminfree its really kind of funny how theyve divided the place up among them with no bickering they almost act as if they were humans dividing up patrols erica shot him an unreadable glance did she remember how he had sat down with the original three and skittyand a floorplan of the placewhen he first brought them all to the palace they are bred for high intelligence he reminded both of them hastily no one really knows how bright they are theyre bright enough to use their lifesupport pods in an emergency and bright enough to learn how to use the human facilities in the ships they seem to have ways of communicating with each other or so the people at biotech tell me so maybe they did establish patrols well maybe they did erica said after a long moment he heaved a mental sigh of relief the last thing he needed was to have someone suspect skittys telepathic link with him biotech was not breeding for telepathy but if such a useful trait ever showed up in a fertile female they would surely cancel brightwings lease and haul skitty back to their nearest cattery to become a breeding queen skitty was his best friend to lose her like that would be terrible no breeding skitty said firmly love dick love ship no breeding breeding dull kittens a pain not leave ship ever well at least skitty agreed for now anyway now that her kittens were weaned whenever she came into season she seemed to change her mind at least about the part that resulted in breeding if not the breeding itself the lacuteveras the ruling consort of her people accepted astra into the household with soft cries of welcome and gladness erica was right the lacuun could not possibly have pampered their cats more whenever a cat wanted a lap or a scratch one was immediately provided whether or not the object of feline affection was in the middle of negotiations or a session of council or not whenever one wished to playalthough with the number of kreshta about there was very little energy left over for playingeverything else was set aside for that moment and when one brought in a trophy kreshta tail and ears held high with pride the entire court applauded astra was introduced to furrball at skittys insistence noses were sniffed and the two rubbed cheeks it appeared that mamas matchmaking was going to work the three humans and the pleased feline headed back across the city to the spaceport and the fence around it the city of the lacuun was incredibly attractive much more so than any other similar city dick had ever visited because of the rapidity with which the kreshta multiplied given any food and shelter the streets were kept absolutely spotless and the buildings clean and in repair most had walls about them giving the inhabitants little islands of privacy the walls of the wealthy were of carved stone those of the poor of cast concrete in all cases ornamentation was the rule not the exception the lacuun themselves walked the streets of their city garbed in delicate flowing robes or shorter more practical versions of the same garments graceful and handsome they resembled avians rather than reptiles their skin varied in shade from a dark brown to a golden tan and their heads bore a kind of frill like an iguanas that ran from the base of the neck to a point just above and between the eyes their faces were capable of something like a smile and the expression meant the same for them as it did for humans most of them smiled when they saw dick and skitty although the kreshtadestroying abilities of the cat were not something any of them would personally feel the impact of for many years perhaps generations they still appreciated what the cats dick had introduced could do the kreshta had been a plague upon them for as long as their history recorded even being so bold as to steal the food from plates and injure unguarded infants for as long as that history it had seemed that there would never be a solution to the depredations of the little beasts but nowthe most pious claimed the advent of the cats was a sign of the gods direct intervention and blessing and even the skeptics were thrilled at the thought that an end to the plague was in sight it was unlikely that even with a cat in every household the kreshta would ever be destroyedbut such things as setting a guard on sleeping babies and locking meals in metal containers set into the tables could probably be eliminated when they crossed the fence into terran territory however the surroundings dropped in quality by a magnitude or two dick felt obscurely ashamed of his world whenever he looked at the shabby garish spaceport facilities that comprised most of the terran spaceport area at least the headquarters that captain singh and catseye had established were handsome adaptations of the natives own architecture in cast concrete with walls decorated with stylized stars spaceships and suggestions of slitpupiled eyes solarquest and uvn the other two companies that had been given trade permits were following catseyes lead and had hired the same local architects and contractors to build their own headquarters it looked from the halffinished buildings as if solarquest was going with a motif taken from their own logo of a stylized sunburst uvn was going for geometrics in their walldecor there were four ships here at the moment rather than the authorized three for some reason the independent freighter that had brought in the twenty shipscats was still here on the landing field dick wondered about that for a moment then shrugged mentally independents often ran on shoestring budgets probably they had only loaded enough fuel to get them here and refueling was taking more time than they had thought it would suddenly just as they passed through the doors of the building skitty howled hissed and leapt from dicks shoulders vanishing through the rapidlyclosing door he uttered a muffled curse and turned to run after her what had gotten into her anyway he found himself looking into the muzzle of a weapon held by a large man in the nondescript coveralls favored by the crew of that independent freighter the man was as nondescript as his clothing with ashblond hair cut short and his very ordinary facewith the exception of that weapon and the cold calculating look in his irongray eyes dick put up his hands slowly he had the feeling this was a very bad time to play hero wheres the damn cat snapped the one dick was coming to think of as the gray man one of his underlings shrugged gone the man replied shortly she got away when we rounded up these three and she just vanished somewhere forget the cat how much damage could a cat do the gray man shrugged the natives might get suspicious if they dont see her with our man she probably wouldnt have cooperated with our man the underling pointed out not like she did with this one it doesnt matterwhite got the new cats installed and we dont need an animal that was likely to be a handful anyway the gray man nodded after a while and went back to securing the latest of his prisoners the offices in the new catseye building had been turned into impromptu cells dick had gotten a glimpse of captain singh in one of them as he had been frogmarched past he didnt know what these people had done with the rest of the crew or with vena and erica since vena had been taken off somewhere separately and erica had been stunned and dragged away without waiting for her surrender the gray man watched him with his weapon trained on him as two more underlings installed a tanglefield generator across the doorway with no windows these little offices made perfect holdingpens most of them didnt have furniture yet those that did didnt really contain anything that could be used as a weapon the desks were simple slabs of native wood on metal supports the chairs molded plastile and both were bolted to the floor there was nothing in dicks little cubicle that could even be thrown dick was still trying to figure out who and what these people were when something finally clicked he looked up at the gray man youre from tristar arent you he asked if the gray man was startled by this he didnt show it yes the man replied gunmuzzle never wavering how did you figure that out biotech never ships with anyone other than tristar if they can help it dick said flatly i wondered why they had hired a trampfreighter to bring out their cats it didnt seem like them but then i thought maybe that was all they could get youre clever white the gray man replied expressionlessly too clever for your own good maybe we might just have to make you disappear you and the makumba woman shell probably know some of us as soon as she wakes up and we dont have the time or the equipment to brainwipe you dick felt a chill going down his back as the men at the door finished installing the field and left quickly biotech is going to wonder if one of their designated handlers just vanishes and without me youre never going to get skitty back biotech isnt going to care for that either they might start asking questions that you cant answer the gray man stared at him for a long moment his expression did not vary in the least but at least he didnt make any move to shoot ill think about it he said finally he might have said more but there was a shout from the corridor outside the cat someone yelled and the gray man was out of the door before dick could blink unfortunately he paused long enough to trigger the tanglefield before he ran off in pursuit of what could only have been skitty dick slumped down into the chair and buried his face in his hands but not in despair he was thinking furiously tristar didnt like getting cut out of the negotiations what they cant get legally theyll get any way they can probably they intend to use us as hostages against venas good behavior getting her to put them up as the new negotiators i solved the problem of getting the cats for them now theres no reason they couldnt just step in but that cant go on forever sooner or later vena is going to get to a com unit or send some kind of message offworld so what would these people do then tristar had a reputation as being ruthless and hed heard from erica that it was justified so how do you get rid of an entire crew of a spaceship and the terran consul and maybe the crews of the other two ships into the bargain well there was always one answer to that especially on a newlyopened world plague the chill threaded his backbone again as he realized just what a good answer that was these tristar goons could use sickness as the excuse for why the catseye people werent in evidence a rumor of plague might well drive the other two ships offworld before they came down with it the tristar people could even claim to be taking care of the brightwings crew then after a couple of weeks they all succumb to the disease the terran consul with them it was a story that would work not only with the terran authorities but with the lacuun the fence was a very effective barrier to help from the natives the lacuun would not cross it to find out the truth even if they were suspicious i have to get to a com set he thought desperately his own usefulness would last only so long as it took them to trap skitty and find some way of caging her no one else so far as he knew could hear her thoughts all they needed to do would be to catch her and ship her back to biotech with the message that the designated handler was dead of plague and the cat had become unmanageable it wouldnt have been the first time a soft hiss made him look up and he strangled a cry of mingled joy and apprehension it was skitty she was right outside the door and she seemed to be trying to do something with the tanglefield generator skitty he thought at her as hard as he could skitty you have to get away from here theyre trying to catch you there was no way skitty was going to be able to deal with those controls they were deliberately made difficult to handle just precisely because shipscats were known to be curious and how could she know what complicated series of things to do to take down the field anyway but skitty ignored him using her stubby raccoonlike hands on the controls of the generator and hissing in frustration when the controls would not cooperate finally with a muffled yowl of triumph she managed to twist the dial into the off position and the field went down dick was out the door in a moment but skitty was uncharacteristically running off ahead of him instead of waiting for him not that he minded she was safer on the ground in case someone spotted him and stunned him she was small and quick and if they caught him again she would still have a chance to hide and get away but there was something odd about her bounding run as if her body was a little longer than usual and her tail seemed to be a lot longer than he remembered never mind that get moving he scolded himself trying to recall where theyd set up all the coms and if any of them were translight skitty whisked ahead of him around a corner when he caught up with her she was already at work on the tanglefield generator in front of another door practice must have made perfect she got the field down just before he reached the doorway and shot down the hall like a streak of black lightning dick stopped inside was someone lying down on a cot arm over her dark mahogany head erica erica he hissed at her she sat bolt upright wincing as she did so and he felt a twinge of sympathy a stunmigraine was no picnic she saw who was at the door saw at the same moment that there was no tanglefield shimmer between them and was on her feet and out in a fraction of a second how she demanded scanning the corridor and finding it as curiously empty as dick had skitty took the generator offline he said she got yours too and she headed off that way he pointed towards the heart of the building do you remember where the translight coms are eyeah she said in the basement if we can get there thats the emergency unit and i dont think they know weve got it she cocked her head to one side as if she had suddenly heard something he strained his earsand there was a clamor off in the distance beyond the walls of the building it sounded as if several people were chasing something but it couldnt have been skitty she was still in the building it sounds like theyre busy erica said and grinned lets go while we have the chance but before they reached the basement com room they were joined by most of the crew of the brightwing some of whom had armed themselves with whatever might serve as a weapon all of them told the same story about how the shipscat had taken down their tanglefields and fled once in the basement of the buildingafter scattering the multiple nests of kreshta that had moved right inthe com officer took over while the rest of them found whatever they could to make a barricade and dick related what he had learned and what his surmises were power controls were all down here there would be no way short of blowing the building up for the tristar goons to cut power to the com now all they needed was timetime to get their message out and wait for the patrol to answer but time just might be in very short supply dick told himself as he grabbed a sheet of reflective insulation to use as a crude stunshield and as if in answer to that just as the com officer got the link warmed up and began to send erica called out from the staircase front and centerhere they come dick slumped down so that the tiny medic could reach his head to bandage it he knew he looked like hed been through a war but either the feeling of elated triumph or the medics drugs or both prevented him from really feeling any of his injuries in the end it had come down to the crudest of handtohand combat on the staircase as the com officer resent the message as many times as he could and the rest of them held off the tristar bullies he could only thank the spirits of space that they had no weapons stronger than stunnersor at least they hadnt wanted to use them down in the basement where so many circuits lay bare eventually of course they had been overwhelmed but by then it was too late the com officer had gotten a reply from the patrol help was on the way faced with the collapse of their plan the tristar people had done the only wise thing they had retreated with them they had taken all evidence that they were from tristar there was no way of proving who and what they were unless the patrol corvette now on the way in could intercept them and capture them contrary to what the gray man had thought erica had recognized none of her captors but right now none of that mattered what did matter was that they had come through thisand that skitty had finally reappeared as soon as the tristar ship blasted out to take her accustomed place on dicks shoulders purring for all she was worth and interfering with the medics work dick vena called from the door to the medics office i found your dick looked up vena was cradling skitty in her arms but skitty was already on his shoulders she must have looked just as stunned as he did but he recovered first doing a doubletake his skitty was the one on her usual perchvenas skitty was a little thinner a little taller and most definitely had a lot longer tail is prrreet skitty said with satisfaction handsome no is bred for being patrolcat warcat vena whats the tattoo inside that cats ear he asked urgently she checked fx she said and a serial number but the x designation is for experimental isnt it uhyeah he got up ignoring the medic and came to look at the new cat venas stranger also had much more humanlike hands than his skitty suddenly the mystery of how the cat had managed to manipulate the tanglefield controls was solved shoot he might even have been trained to do that yes skitty said simply i go play catchmestupid he open humancages he hear of me on station come to see me be mate i think i keep him dick closed his eyes for a moment somewhere there was a frantic biotech station trying to figure out where one of their experimentals had gone he should turn the cat over to them no skitty said positively no look is deaf one ear is pet run away find me he uhmust have come in as an extra with that shipment dick improvised quickly i found an extra invoice i just thought theyd made a mistake hes deaf in one ear thats why they washed him out i uhi suppose brightwing could keep him i was kind of hoping i could vena began and flushed lowering her eyes i suppose i still could after this the embassy is going to have to have a full staff with patrol guards and a real consul they wont need me anymore dick began to grin as he realized what vena was saying well he will need a handler and i have all i can do to take care of this skitty courting skitty asked slyly reaching out to lick one of prrreets ears this time dick did not bother to deny it
